One of these days, an actual malicious entity, like a terrorist group, is going to get their hands on one of these zerodays. I guarantee you, they won't be killing a test subject's engine on the highway. It'll either be a targeted attack - forcing somebody's car into reverse and hitting the gas in order to kill a specific person, or it'll be a broad attack - take control of every vulnerable vehicle in the country and attempt to kill every person in each car. They might also just fire up the engines of a bunch of cars outside a concert and try to run over everybody in the crowd. The difference in difficulty between what these guys did and the two scenarios I just described are not as significant as you might think."

That's exactly what I thought upon reading this article.  The amount of chaos and death caused by simultaneously speeding up and disabling the brakes of over 400,000 vehicles would make 9/11 look like a picnic.  Even if a fraction of that total were being operated at the time, the results could be catastrophic.  I can't understand why anyone would think it's okay to just shrug this off as a minor issue."

Having only read OP's wired article on the issue, Sprint's uconnect provisioning shows the real weakness here.   The guy at Chrysler who negotiated the carrier contract with Spring made a bad mistake in not requiring their own APN (Access Point Name) for their diagnostics telematics services, effectively blocking off their IP addresses from the rest of the network.  I don't know much about Chrysler's (or Fiat's) telematics solution, but the reason for using a ""public"" APN when connecting to the network may be that the diagnostic services share the 3G link with the WiFi hotspot run by the car. That, in turn, may be due to that embedded 3G modems just recently were able to handle multiple APN's (thus data sessions) in parallel.  tl;rd: Separate out your diagnostic data to its own data link. Build a firewall between the IVI and the CAN/MOST/Ethernet bus to control traffic.  Source: Heading telematics R&D for an OEM.  *Grommar"

Especially in industrial control systems where no personal devices should be plugged in. You still get idiots who think they can just pop in their flash drive from home into a diagnostic system and expect it to work. Thankfully we can stop things like that easily, but the problem is still there.     Anything that is connected into the system, such as a phone, flash drive, etc. in normal operation could be used as an entry point. Things like those ECU monitors, diagnostic computers, whatever you can think of. The problem is unless security is a core concept understood during development, you end up with a system with weak points.    And if you work in security, you know the struggle of management saying ""we'll worry about it if that happens"""
technology,3e23ge,SamTheSammich,30,Tue Jul 21 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the designers think they've isolated the CAN bus from the Uconnect system, but haven't taking into account things like the head unit which are connected to both systems and could be compromised.

There is a box that takes aircraft bus broadcast data and converts it to an IP or serial stream (depends on the aircraft) used by the in flight entertainment and media distribution system. It's a one way bus and there is no way to back feed data into it without physically rewiring the aircraft.
technology,3e23ge,DrAllison,35,Tue Jul 21 16:04:39 2015 UTC,"Supposedly they have convinced the FAA that while the two networks are physically linked, the security is effectively the same as having physically separate networks.  I think someone on reddit explained that the way this works is that the network traffic is tightly scheduled and verified so anything trying to spoof another device on the network will just corrupt traffic and be ignored. So at best there's some scope for a denial of service attack. But then all you have to do is pull power from the passenger entertainment side (assuming there's some active hardware between terrorist laptop and the shared network.)"

I complained and opened a case, but PayPal sided with the seller because I couldn't prove I didn't receive anything. They only refunded my money back after I showed them a screen shot of me buying the same sandals off of Amazon, including the tracking number. Then they finally refunded my money :/   And this other time a package was stolen/went missing, PayPal wouldn't do shit. I was told I had to talk to the seller. The seller was a dick, and said ""Not my problem, it's your fault for using those shipping companies"" (No it's not. That was the only option you made available).   Tried calling PayPal again, and they told me it was the shipping companies fault and I needed to deal with it.  Tried calling the company that delivered. They told me it wasn't their fault because there was no insurance on the package and were told to leave the package at the door even if there was no response (the package was literally the box the item came in. With pictures and logos all over it, explicitly showing what it was).   So I was supposed to call Pitney Bowes (Ebay's border company that makes buying from the US supposedly easier for buyers and sellers). I called them, and they told me it wasn't their fault, because eBay gave them the delivery instructions which they merely passed along.   So I called eBay, and they told me to call PayPal because I'm from Canada and they don't deal with disputes from the Canadian eBay for whatever reason, and that I didn't have the same buyer's protection simply because I purchased it from eBay.ca instead of eBay.com.  So I tried PayPal again, while in a three way call with eBay. PayPal wouldn't do anything. I emailed so many people at eBay, and I got a response back saying I will get a full refund. After a week, I called eBay about this asking when I was getting it, and they said they know nothing about this. So I read out the email, and they said PayPal is the one that gives the refunds, and I needed to forward them the email from eBay.   PayPal tells me they don't cover missing or stolen packages, and that I need to talk to the seller or shipping companies... Round and round in circles.  I gave up, because this had been going on for two months. I called up my credit card company and opened a case for the purchase, and received the funds back into my account the next day.  PayPal is a nightmare. Credit cards are a buyer's dream. Maybe it's because it's through the bank I've been with for ten years, and they care more about my loyalty. But PayPal doesn't necessarily care more about protecting buyer's than sellers. They only care about who will make them the most money. Not only that, but credit cards give you additional insurance for your purchases, like accidental damage. PayPal doesn't do that.  PayPal is definitely convenient, but I will only ever use it with my credit card, never funds or my bank account. Because I cannot count on them if shit hits the fan. People may hate the idea of credit cards because ""oh no, debt and interest etc.."" , but they are more than worth it. You don't need to max it out and make minimum payments... You can just use it instead of your bank card, and just pay it all off every month."

One Sunday, some former coworkers & I were bored, talking about salaries on the internal social network instance. A spreadsheet was created. we put our salaries in the sheet, realized that it was created on a public to the world spreadsheet, so I copied it to internal. I then put a form on it and posted the link to the form and the spreadsheet on my internal social network account.  It took off like wildfire.  It got reshared all over the place. People started adding pivot tables that did spreadsheet magic that highlighted not great things re: pay. I did some general housekeeping stuff to the sheet (normalizing the gender field where it could be, exchange rate stuff, that sort of thing).  More reshares.  More people adding pay.  It became a thing.  I was invited to talk to my manager on Mon or Tues. Higher up people weren't happy. She wasn't happy. Why did I do it? ""Don't you know what could happen?"" Nothing. It's illegal to retaliate against employees for sharing salaries. ""Wellll...."".  Meeting ended.  Sheet kept going.  People were thanking me for it. They were also sending me peer bonuses. here's how peer bonuses work @ former co:  If you did something good, someone peer bonuses you, you get $150 net in your next paycheck. An important thing I learned during that time: peer bonuses are rewarded at managers discretion. My manager was rejecting all of them. Wasn't sure if this would be good for the company. Wanted to see what the outcome was. Mind you once a PB is rejected, that can't be undone.  Meanwhile, one of the other people involved, a white dude (good friend I won't name, he can name himself if he wants), was also getting PBs. His weren't getting rejected. I told him mine were. He was pissed. Wanted to tell everyone what was happening. I declined. A smattering of people knew what was going on. Backchannels being what they are at former co. (lol IRC #yallknowwhoyouare), it got around. Rejecting PBs was so unheard of, ppl didn't know it was possible. There was outrage when they found out. Shock that I wasn't talking abt it. Meanwhile, spreadsheet still going, getting spread around, pointed questions being thrown at mgmt about sharing salary ranges (hahah no). Most people agreed that it was A Good Thing. PBs kept rolling in. Rejections kept rolling out. One PB eventually got approved. Way after everything died down. Because the person worded it in a way that was vary vague. Any that were outright about the spreadsheet got rejected. 7 total in the end I think?  Higher ups still pissed. Some I used to support as an exec tech would pointedly not interact w/ me anymore. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Before I left, about 5% of former co. had shared their salary on that sheet. People asked for & got equitable pay based on data in the sheet. The world didn't end. Everything didn't go up in flames because salaries got shared. But shit got better for some people.  I explicitly gave ownership of the sheet to someone else before I left so it couldn't be taken over by mgmt when I was gone (can happen).  I am thinking of this because of everyone celebrating the fact that Google put Ida B. Wells in the doodle yesterday. Ida B. Wells was great. She did stuff to affect change of such a magnitude that if I'm half the woman she was, I'm doing pretty good. I don't claim to come close, but from time to time, I do stuff that will make things better for people at the expense of the establishment. I'm a pretty big believer in justice and fairness and will fight for both if necessary. Fighting for justice & fairness INSIDE Google doesn't go over well. Salary sharing is only 1 example. Blogger porn. Real names. Many others. Shit WILL hit the fan if you tell a racist (a well documented racist) to go fuck themselves though. In defense of the racist, obvi. So sure. Rah rah, Google did an Ida B. Wells doodle. Guaranteed that if Ida Wells were alive & working at Google today, there'd be many private calendar meetings focused on ""her future"" there.  tl;dr the sharing of one doodle does not a bastion of support for justice and civil disobedience make."

technology,3e05wg,Atario,17,Tue Jul 21 10:00:17 2015 UTC,It's on Wired's front page
technology,3e05wg,MrNarc,57,Tue Jul 21 13:14:44 2015 UTC,"It's not a form of journalism, it's someone sharing a personal story over a social media account. I admit I would have better appreciated a more easily readable blog post but I'm not going to begrudge someone using a social media site for its intended purpose.   Unless you're talking about the Wired article itself doing nothing but showing screen shots, which I admit is a bit lazy, but when sharing a long-form story composed on new media most journalists prefer to rehost the story ""in the person's own words"" rather than attempt to edit or paraphrase it. This also adds built-in evidence in the form of pictures that the information was shared by this person at this time rather than the ""I heard once from an anonymous source that his second cousin once said..."" format, which is especially important when tweets can be easily and quickly deleted. I especially appreciate that because of this article I can read the whole story without having to search through the author's twitter page. Now, would we all prefer an investigative article about payment practices at Google, using this story as the first step? Probably. But this ""article"" is a possible jumping off point for that, not necessarily a replacement for it."

technology,3e05wg,ya_y_not,1218,Tue Jul 21 07:17:27 2015 UTC,"Time for the other side of the story Saw this, was interested, called up a friend that works at Google to see what the deal is with this salary sheet. The words ""fucking bullshit"" came up after reading the twitterrant.  Friend says Google did not object to her sheet. Friend says the sheet was addressed a company all-hands meeting (it wasn't the focus of the meeting, apparently they have an all-hands every week and it was mentioned. Can that be right tho? Aren't there like tens of thousands of people all across the world? How can you have an all-hands meeting the world over every week? anyway...)  HR said that it was definitely people's right to share their salary info if they want to, but they should be aware that comparing salary is much more difficult than just ""are these numbers equal"". Assuming equal performance there are lots of factors that go into it, cost of living at location, exchange rate (remember this sheet had different countries), local issues / disparities in benefits, and on and on. Then, on top of that, there's differences in performance.  Upshot is that Google is one of the best companies at adjusting pay to be equitable across employees with the same titles, and they openly allow for some amount of play in order to reward good performance within that band.  Also, friend told me that peer bonuses are not meant for something that makes people happy, it's meant to reward work that someone else did that was somewhat outside their job description and immediate task list but significantly made your job easier. Starting a spreadsheet doesn't make anyone's job easier. You might be appreciative, you might experience benefit even. But it doesn't help you knock down any of your todos at all.  Friend also mentioned this person known for being a bit of a passive aggressive rabble rouser, even so was treated really well by Google and given lots of leeway and support to pursue her goals both professional and moving her ideas forward to make it a more inclusive company. So talking shit about them after leaving now after all that is ... not classy. Friend was careful to say: I only have a view from the outside, though, and that's how it seemed from afar. Maybe what she's saying has some merit and I wouldn't know, I didn't know her personally.  Also, potentially important: friend is minority female and likely faced many of the same issues as ranter in her career, however is somewhat older and worked at many other places before Google, and said Google is fucking awesome and anyone who says otherwise is talking out their ass. Bad things happen at every company, but pound for pound Google crushes."
technology,3e05wg,dickbutt_md,123,Tue Jul 21 08:58:24 2015 UTC,We do have an all-hands every week. It's mostly attended by video conference with questions submitted via a webapp.
technology,3e05wg,jsolson,14,Tue Jul 21 10:12:21 2015 UTC,Is that one of those meetings where everyone dials in and just continues their work or peruses Reddit while management talk about things completely unrelated to you?
technology,3e05wg,Craysh,126,Tue Jul 21 14:14:32 2015 UTC,"This is basically accurate. She also eventually did get the peer bonus and you can't get more than one PB for the same work. Also, if you look at the spreadsheet, she was actually in the higher end of the salary range for her job ladder and level.   Source: I'm a Google employee."
technology,3e05wg,UngKwan,63,Tue Jul 21 10:44:45 2015 UTC,"Your friend might be totally justified in their POV, but there are a couple of points that are worth noting:   If Erica was indeed threatened by her immediate supervisor for sharing a spreadsheet comparing salary, no matter how good Google in general is, her perception is valid. There's a lot of ad hominem in your post and in the comments below.  Many folks saying she was being shitty for talking about salary when she was actually doing pretty well.  So what?  She never claimed this was for her sake, or that her goal was getting herself a bump.   That said, she does make a big deal out of the PBs, implying that she should have been granted them when in fact that implication may misrepresent what they are for.  All the same ... even if seven were sent and rejected, that's, what, $1050?  It probably would have been a better call to just approve them even if that's not what PBs are supposed to be for.  My takeaway: Erica may have had a habit of making mountains out of molehills, and she probably had a pretty shitty direct supervisor.  Her twitter story might not be commentary on Google as a company, but unless she's outright lying, some aspects of her story represent a legitimate beef."

I remember trying to correct it and being told that it was not a problem that we were hiring in new people for as much or more than the core resource of the group, who had worked for the company for nearly 30 years.  That was just how these things work.    I spent 5 years working every possible raise I could get approved into her salary in order to get her into a range that made me not embarrassed to look her in the eye at a review.  I never succeeded in getting her paid what she was worth.  That entire thing would NEVER have happened with transparency.  Transparency forces a company to keep equity or justify adequately all inequity.   But under the carpet inequity works in favor the of the company.  It means they can hire ""competitively"".  Its hidden in the concept of meritocracy.  But very few salaries seem to correlate to the contribution of the employee, in my experience.   And the dirty secret is that management is slowly absorbed into the idea because once you are management, you are complicit.  And so you are the one exposed and look bad if its all suddenly transparent."

If I were to not give a reason, the person I fired could turn around and say I was being prejudice. I could then give my reason, but it doesn't it look as good if I came up with a reason after they complained. The way I do it, there is an email that is solid proof that I provided a reason.

technology,3e05wg,fubo,64,Tue Jul 21 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"I did something of a lesser degree while interning at Google. Every quarter there is an internal meeting [townhall] with all employees in the style of a shareholder meeting. A large part of it is open mic questions that employees get to AMAA the c level management (CEO etc).  This takes place in MV and so global employees don't have the option to turn up and ask questions, although we do get a livestream / VOD. Remote employees also get a reddit style board for asking questions which will then get answered. I asked the question about internal salaries and the policy Google has that it sets intern pay based off 'market competition'.  The same interns doing the same functions at the same level in the US were being paid 3.5x more than I was in the UK. They'd get free housing, free transport and a huge salary. Me on the other hand, paid more to live in a cockroach infested studio 50 minutes away from the office than I received in pay.  Why? That's a good question and so I asked, Google was potentially missing top tier interns who would be paid multiple times more at other prestigious firms. And it got upvoted to near the top. For some reason my question was skipped and never addressed, and a few days later my HR rep wanted a meeting. This is someone who I met once previously and someone I'm not likely to meet during my time.  She explained that I my question was something that shouldn't be asked, and that the pay policy was clear - they only compete with the local market. She asked me: ""Which of our competitors would pay you more?"" I then explained that management consultancies, banks etc were paying 3-4x more for the same interns. She replied that Google doesn't ""compete"" with those companies, and that there is no other meaningful tech in London. And so pay is set as low as it can physically / legally go.

Some employees used it to negotiate better salaries, and praised the creator of the spreadsheet. Management got upset. The spreadsheet creator no longer works at Google.

It's basically unsubstantiated office gossip made public by a disgruntled employee -- who, if her spreadsheet really said what she suggests it does, would have a valuable discrimination lawsuit in her hands.

Manager only approves $150.  Woman insinuates that the bonus adjustment is race-related, but her only evidence is that she knows a white guy whose peer bonuses were approved. She also implies that she got in trouble at work one time for telling a ""known racist"" to go fuck him/herself, and that this was a huge injustice considering that a white man got his peer bonuses when she didn't.

Me and my buddy had some prank tools for messing with other students and the computers they were using, so we regularly would look at the whole LAN for anything interesting.  Occasionally we'd see that the principles laptop was connected. It was the only one that wasn't completely wide open for access (default privs were full read/write everywhere else, which made it trivial for us to drop extensions into other computers system folder, causing all sorts of chaos, such as the sudden inability to type vowels)  One day, though, it was connected and wide open.  So we went in there. And we found a spreadsheet of every single staff members salary.  We grabbed it and disconnected. A discussion was had about what, if anything, to do with it. One suggestion was that we print it off on every printer at the same time.  We ultimately decided not to, since there were only 3 or 4 of us who actually knew how to do all this stuff, and we'd be rounded up immediately. It's not a court of law, it's an elementary school, and they'd have no problem punishing all of us regardless of evidence.  Still, it was a thrilling afternoon.

technology,3e05wg,Doogolas33,168,Tue Jul 21 04:41:38 2015 UTC,Sounds like a lot of bullshit office drama.   Shocker: self negotiating employees earn different wages.
technology,3e05wg,tooyoung_tooold,67,Tue Jul 21 04:13:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. You're not forced to work with one rate or another. Salaries are always negotiations, especially at huge companies. My friend and I work in dev at a large bank, we were both flipped from contract to full-time at the same time. We were both offered the same rate. It was, admittedly, a great salary given the work, but he accepted immediately while I maintained that just because it's a great figure doesn't mean that it's not their (HR's) starting-point. I replied to my offer letter asking if I could get more as it was a lesser rate than contracting and was immediately (within 5 minutes) offered $2500 more. The other guy knows, and is pissed, but at himself for not asking for more.  It's in a company's best interest to get the best talent for the lowest salary. If you accept a salary you're not happy with, then that's on you. If you learn your coworkers who do same/more/less work than you are making more, there's a lot of ways to deal with it. There's sites (http://www.glassdoor.com) that offer salary information and you can confidentially ask others, albeit it's better to ask if they make more than X rather than ""What X are you being paid?"".   I'm not in management (have been before but for teams so small it doesn't relate), I do believe people should be paid what they're worth and I'm all about re-evaluating compensation based on performance, but at the end of the day you're the one who accepted the offer and, ultimately, you're the one that's going to have to warrant more if you want more.  It's a known taboo (whether you agree or not) to discuss salaries. You have to face that when you're working for a big company you have to ""behave"" the way they want. It's what you give up in exchange for being paid that well (or not). It doesn't always make sense but that kinda falls in line with how larger companies work in my experience.  BUT, for disclosure, I work in a smaller city, much less competition around, and my colleagues and I are super-grateful for what we're being paid. I'm sure it's different in a town like that with a company like Google.  However, as I stated earlier, there are other ways to exchange this information without compromising your position. I believe in transparency, I have friends that work in local gov that have all their salaries readily-available online. It helps I suppose but at the end of the day, you and your employer agreed on a compensation package (salary, benefits, etc.) and you have to realize that if somebody is making more for the exact same job, the company isn't at fault, your negotiating skills are. It's hard to hear, and I've been on both sides. It's a learning experience and I hope from this thread that a lot of people have learned from it."

Here's the kicker, I was the senior guy on the team. (As far as working for the company.  I was the youngest guy in the team as well.)  I pointed this out to my manager, who said he would help me approach his manager and ask for a raise.  We did and courtesy of my manager we had a pretty solid argument to at least bring me on par with the next lowest paid person on the team, while shooting to match the highest paid person since I had more qualifications and seniority.

Here's why it happened:   Youtube.com/lush & youtube.com/user/Lush originally belonged to this dude. In 2014, youtube allowed users to rename their channels (sweet!). End 2014, youtube introduced a new youtube.com/c/Lush user url format (not many knew about this). The new URL format also OVERWRITES where the  youtube.com/Username points to, (but not youtube.com/User/Username - which remains the same). Youtube accounts are now linked to Google+ pages!!! The Youtube.com/c/Username is given ""by an algorithm"" to whomever has the google.com/+Lush page (the cosmetics company, with 40,000 G+ fans in this case). FYI: Lush the youtuber has 900,000 youtube subscribers. All Lush cosmetics had to do was click one of the many prompts to claim their new youtube url, and they received youtube.com/c/Lush -- which is fine (and not their fault at all). The crazy part is that Youtube then overwrites where the old youtube.com/Username points to!!! It does this in all cases.   Not that this is fair in any way, but if the guy had got his G+ page a custom URL, and linked his youtube & google+ pages, this might have been avoided.  I'd like to know more about how usable youtube.com/username was in the past, and whether youtube ever suggested linking directly to it."

After a long hard week full of days he would burst through the door, his fatigue hidden behind a smile. There was an icy jug of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz in his right hand. With his left hand he would grip my waist - I was always cooking dinner - and press the cold frostiness of the jug against my arm as he kissed my cheek.

If they don't treat us, the product, like customers, they run out of product. I think that's a fairly unique phenomenon in commercial history. We are still customers. We consume a service they provide. It's more like our data is a byproduct that is very valuable.  I think a better comparison would be a beehive. A beekeeper isn't keeping the bees for the bees' sake. He's doing is to sell their honey. The Bees (more or less) gladly give their honey to the beekeeper in exchange for safety, security, and a good environment to reproduce and make more honey. Beehives make it way easier for bees to make honey, and as long as the beekeeper gets to make money off that honey, he'll happily maintain the hive.

If you're not paying for a service, you aren't a customer, and cannot really expect customer service.   These companies need users of course, so they will try to make the experience as pleasant as possible and give the userbase as much as they can, but individual users are absolutely meaningless. So the only reason they will act or react is for PR purposes.  As long as we don't pay for online services, we can only expect to be used. And I'm not saying this with any bitterness: it makes perfect sense. Their actual customers are advertisers, not you as an individual.   It's an imperfect analogy, but I work in the sector, and we say this: we are the chickens in the chicken farm. The user's satisfaction with the service can be thought of as the poultry's health. In poultry farms, they need to keep the mass of chicken overall healthy, but they will not lose time nursing back to health sick individual chickens. Individual chickens don't matter. What matters is whether or not people will buy the chicken meat. In the same way, individual users don't matter as long as there's no risk they'll cause the company to be losing a mass of users. Hence the reactions solely when the stories go viral.  We either have to get used to paying for our internet services if we want actually user-centric services, or just be okay with free stuff in exchange for being used a little and not mattering much. I find both models acceptable, I just know what I'm getting into.  See also: all the recent reddit drama.  TLDR: Users don't matter. The userbase at large kinda does. Advertisers do."

I was having difficulty porting my number off of sprint on to google voice for quite some time, because my sprint number wouldn't accept the automated call that google makes to confirm your phone number is yours. No voice mail, no missed call, no indication at all that the call was ever made.  I waited patiently for two months constantly reopening tickets and trying to get it working, and had I been able to end up porting my number I'd gladly have paid for those two months, but eventually it became clear Sprint either couldn't or didn't want to help, so I requested my account be terminated and I be credited for those two months.  The phone operator actually laughed at me, told me it would never happen, refused to let me speak to a manager, and when I asked him to explain on what planet it made sense that I pay for two months of Sprint trying and failing to fix a technical problem during which I didn't even touch my phone, he feigned technical problems with our phone call and hung up on me.  Two tweets mentioning @sprint and @sprintcare later, they were in contact via DM and gave me a full credit.  It's absolutely absurd, but the only way to get anything remotely resembling decent customer service is to publicly shame companies.

And in 1998 ICANN was formally established, which made it easier to register a domain but also significantly more unlikely that a domain could be arbitrarily reassigned without authorization from the registrant (or someone impersonating them, at least).  But even back in the 90s the IANA, InterNIC and ICANN had oversight panels and formal processes for disputing a domain transfer and it would have been trivial for OP to prove he registered the domain first. To top it off, DNS propagation was significantly slower back then... we're talking 72 hours minimum, sometimes up to a week to reach many local ISPs... so it's unlikely OP would have noticed a change that quickly. So either OP was hacked/impersonated, is exaggerating about his site being 'suddenly owned by someone else' the next day and he didn't bother to dispute the domain transfer... or he's completely full of shit."

Likely this person could easily see that it was active. He didn't do this unprompted, someone above him told the admin to do this. It was a deliberate decision and it was a deliberate decision not to speak to the owner of the account ahead of time.  So really what they said was ""We're sorry that you called us out publicly.

This is the guy that scored the winning goal for Spain in World Cup 2010. He chose this moment to take off his shirt and reveal his ""Dani Jarque, always with us"" message written on his chest. Dani Jarque is his friend who plays for a rival team who passed away. He will go down in history as one of the most cherished and beloved players in Spain and Barcelona.  He started his professional career at Albacete when he was 10 and he spent 2 years there. When he found out later that the club is in financial trouble and in danger of being dismantled, he injected his own money into the club to ensure that the players are paid and that the club stays afloat.

technology,3e1her,Mista_Wong,8,Tue Jul 21 11:23:39 2015 UTC,You're comparing the 'average user' to someone who doesn't even need a computer and can just use their phone for what you described.   You forget that every singe office job uses some type of computer. Stop thinking small scale. You're not going to walk into the office of some white collar business and see the secretary using Ubuntu.
technology,3e1her,mactroneng,-7,Tue Jul 21 12:31:08 2015 UTC,Yes I am. And their phone is running Linux. I am talking about home computers here because generally you don't get to choose your OS at work.  Office jobs have specific requirements that are not met well by Linux compatible software. One of these requirements is Microsoft Office compatibility.
technology,3e1her,S-H-l-T,5,Tue Jul 21 13:02:33 2015 UTC,"I get why Linux is cool and fun and desirable. However, it's still niche in the consumer market.   And it's never going to have the widespread support for 'average users' until business start using it. It's the same way that OSX (used to be) more of a niche (particularly for people doing graphics work on photoshop) until those needs got pushed out to the standard consumer market.   And to be honest, it's not like Linux is a safe place either. It has REC bugs of its own along with security issues resulting from running some cross platform code (flash for example).   It's just a stupid argument because it's like someone trying to say a Ford is better than a Chevy, but I just want a car. I don't care."

Try to use Microsoft office, can't get it.    99% of people don't want to use 'Microsoft Office,' they want to use an office suite; many already use LibreOffice on their Windows computer. Next!   play a few games   All casual games work on linux. Full games, while a major industry in terms of $$$, only represent a fraction of users. Most users will not be affected by the reduced gaming options on linux.  I can say from experience, have switched almost a dozen average users to Linux many several years ago, I have received no complaints about its usage or wanting to do things they couldn't do."
technology,3e1her,Sacrix,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:36:04 2015 UTC,"I consider an average user to be someone that uses their computer for work and not for personal use. Most average home users could use a *nix based system just fine, especially if its one of the distros that is made to look and work similar to windows.  My average work user, scattered across several different businesses and home offices requires windows for one thing or another. There are a large number of medical and government webpages that require internet explorer to run (which in this day and age is stupid, but they exist). And most software for business applications on a workstation level are only made for windows. There are often alternatives but in order to use those the entire company would often have to switch. For a single employee running a home business or even a small business with a few users that's not a big deal, but for larger companies that have time and money invested into doing things the way they do them it's very hard to drop everything and make a change.  Even the receptionist's at many places would need to stay on windows for compatibility reasons. I would recommend away from mixing different software platforms that work in the same file type on the off chance that something is not handled the same way in both programs (say open office to Microsoft office for example).  Many programs may run inside of a system such as Wine but it's not guaranteed to work and adds another thing that needs to be supported by the IT guy (me) which means that when something doesn't work they have to call the IT guy and pay more money for to have it diagnosed.  Tl:Dr Average home user could switch to linux, average work user could not switch without potentially causing other issues and would require an investment in time and money by the company, just because the software is free doesn't mean you don't have to pay someone to install and support it, and someone who supports linux will probably charge more."

The more useful versions of Linux are in the server world (Centos, Debian, Redhat) and on Mobile, which we all know is Android.

There were a lot of bugs and complaints, cortana was far from polished (couldn't ask it about calendar, starting programs, or really anything besides being search and weather) as was the Spartan browser. Hotkeys either didn't exist or weren't the same from windows 8 (such as windows + q). After it started crashing on shutdown I reverted back to 8.

I just truly doubt with how public they have been making this process they would RTM a build that is massively buggy. That is the build that will go on brand new computers, etc. It's not just people upgrading from a previous OS. If they were to RTM a shit build, imagine what the OEMs would say/do. It is always possible they could back another OS. It could be any OS from Linux to something we never heard of. I just don't see Microsoft taking that huge of a risk to sully their ""last OS""."

I live in NYC, where there is no Google Fiber, and pretty much everyone has to deal with local ISP monopoly (the alternative being satellite). Due to Google Fiber entering the fray--and getting crazy percentages of customers to switch where they're offering the service--Time Warner Cable recently tripled their maximum internet speed at no extra cost. So I now get 300 Mbps DL/20 Mbps UL, for about $80/month including taxes & fees. I hate TWC, relished every moment of canceling cable with them...but I have nothing but good things to say about their new & improved internet speeds. And I am almost 100% certain that they would have never done it if it weren't for Google Fiber. Why would they? Everyone had the same crappy speeds and inflated prices. Google changed the paradigm enough to make the big ISPs worried. And we finally got a bit of real competition."

The moment Google fiber is next door all of their rates are halved and speeds are doubled at the press of a button.  I'm pretty sure this is the reason monopolies aren't supposed to exist in the first place."

Once you go over that cap you get charged an overage fee of $10 per GB you went over. $10 per GB is 86 SEK per GB (at the time of this comment).

Remember, this is all for the 30 gb plan. 30 GB of an entire home network of desktop computers/laptops/wifi-enabled devices like consoles/etc. Thankfully the overage charges appear to stay the same but holy hell does the price go up if you want a cap that could be called reasonable.  Let's say you wanted 100GB of monthly allowance (Verizon's highest offered tier by the way). The price jumps from $225 to $710! That's data only too. If you were getting data and phone it'd be $750.

That's not how this works.  Even with Samsung contributing heavily to stuff like Linux and standards, cross-licensing patents with companies, and manufacturing parts for other companies, Apple still also interacts with these companies a fair bit, cross-licensing patents (now that they've started dropping their lawsuits), buying parts from these companies, and helping develop standards.  It's not a matter of one company interacting with the industry more than the other company, it's a matter of aggressive patent litigation stifling development, and companies being worried that they'll be targeted next."

technology,3e255p,elnjry1,6,Tue Jul 21 11:11:26 2015 UTC,"Here's the article because fuck the New York Times' paywall.   Let us begin with a toast to the unsung hero of the social-media age: the moderator. Slayer of Internet trolls! Extinguisher of flame wars! Bulwark against race hatred and child pornography! The Internet as we know it could not exist without moderators, constantly pruning back the wild undergrowth of human nature that proliferates there. Nearly every major commercial site with user content is policed by human moderators. Some are unpaid volunteers who agree to enforce administrators’ rules; others are outsourced workers in the Philippines who flag dirty pictures posted to social media, or domestic employees who delete libelous comments. If you want to see what the Internet looks like without moderators … well, I’m not even going to tell you where to go, because we’d all be raided by the F.B.I. Let’s just say it’s immoderate.  Moderators are, by definition, forces for stability and civility in the raucous digital realm. Or that is, they’re supposed to be. Recently, the influential online message board Reddit was plunged into chaos by its army of volunteer moderators. It all started in early July, after Reddit abruptly fired an employee named Victoria Taylor. Taylor was well liked by Reddit’s moderators. She was the liaison between the company and its hugely popular Ask Me Anything section, where celebrities and other notable people answer questions from the Reddit community. Although unpaid, the moderators of Ask Me Anything approach their task more seriously than many people do their day jobs. Upset by Taylor’s disappearance, they shut down their entire forum, which gets millions of visits every day; this exploded into a sitewide protest, as dozens of other moderators locked down their forums as well. They wanted to give voice to their feeling, in one moderator’s words, that the company’s bosses ‘‘do not respect the work that is put in by the thousands of unpaid volunteers who maintain the communities of the 9,656 active subreddits,’’ as the individual forums are called.  The Reddit Revolt, as it came to be known, made headlines worldwide and made Reddit useless, at least temporarily. Much of the ire was aimed at Reddit’s interim chief executive, Ellen Pao. A petition demanding Pao’s resignation reached more than 200,000 signatures, and she was inundated with abuse on social media, some of it sexist and racist.  A week later, Pao resigned. Pao’s official reason was that Reddit’s board asked for a level of growth she felt she could not deliver. (Reddit recently raised $50 million in venture capital.) Nevertheless, the companywide disruption revealed the extreme power of the site’s moderators, and the unpredictability with which they wield it. At the height of the controversy, Reddit’s chairman and co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, pleaded with moderators to reactivate their subreddits. He sounded rather like a zookeeper, trying to coax back into its cage the angry lion who had just devoured a park guest. There is nothing moderate about holding the 10th-most-visited website in America hostage over a personnel change. How could a site’s moderators turn into its main source of volatility?  The answer springs straight from the dominant business model online, in which everyone is trying to capture enormous traffic while employing as few people as possible. At Reddit, which Condé Nast purchased in 2006, then spun off in 2011, more and more work has been outsourced to unpaid moderators as the site and its traffic have grown. Many of the most popular subreddits have been created by their moderators, who retain effective control over them. The idea of ‘‘moderating’’ presupposes an outside vision of what is and isn’t acceptable in a conversation. But when moderators set their own rules, with no incentive to conform to anyone else’s standard, they can look a lot less like custodians and a lot more like petty tyrants.  Today Reddit is governed, insofar as it’s governed at all, by a cabal of high-powered moderators who coordinate with administrators in private forums. The most influential of these forums, Modtalk, allows access only to moderators who oversee subreddits with a combined subscriber base of at least 25,000. A convoluted moderator culture has developed, full of intrigue and drama. Moderators are deposed after power struggles; the community is periodically wracked by allegations of payola and other schemes in which moderators game Reddit for personal gain. Moderators parse Reddit employees’ every post to see if other moderators are in or out of favor with the company. When Ohanian made his first public comment during the Reddit Revolt, he first petitioned Modtalk, and only afterward spoke to the general masses.  The moderator class has become so detached from its mediating role at Reddit that it no longer functions as a means of creating a harmonious community, let alone a profitable business. It has become an end in itself — a sort of moderatocracy in which the underlying logic of moderation has been turned on its head. Under the watch of its moderators, Reddit has become a haven for extremists: The Southern Poverty Law Center recently called it the new ‘‘home on the Internet’’ for white supremacists, and it also functions as the central organizing point for the dubious ‘‘men’s rights’’ movement. For years, a moderator with the handle Violentacrez presided over an empire of execrable content on the site, including a hugely popular subreddit that shared sexualized photos of under-age girls, and another that glorified violence against women. (In 2012, when I wrote an article for Gawker outing Violent­acrez’s real identity as a programmer in Texas, other moderators rallied to defend him, going so far as to ban links to Gawker.) Any attempt to enforce real-world norms is rejected by the moderatocracy as impinging on their absolute authority over their miniature domains. Even before the revolt, Ellen Pao sparked much consternation by instituting an anti-harassment policy and banning a handful of subreddits with particularly vile content — Redditors nicknamed her Chairman Pao. Ohanian has excused Reddit’s underbelly as an inevitable result of human nature. But Reddit has made a strategic choice to abdicate responsibility to the moderatocracy in exchange for the promise of meteoric growth, even if its new chief executive, Steve Huffman, recently vowed to crack down on the worst subreddits.  History shows that things end poorly for companies that rely too heavily on moderatocracies. Probably the closest analogy to Reddit is AOL, which in the 1990s built a corps of thousands of volunteer ‘‘community leaders’’ to moderate its chat rooms and forums. Those community leaders eventually revolted, too; some sued for back pay, and AOL was forced to settle for a reported $15 million in 2010. The tension is intrinsic: Unpaid moderators will always feel the company does not appreciate them enough for the free labor they donate. Eventually, the company will change in a way that upsets the moderators. A tiny spark can ignite the built-up resentment.  So what will become of the moderatocracy? The hottest tech companies no longer want to run communities, with all their messy, unprofitable human drama. Instead, they want to make platforms: slick, frictionless, infinitely monetizable. Companies like Facebook and Google try to create the illusion that their platforms are moderated by algorithms, not people. They quietly employ huge teams of human moderators, working under strict nondisclosure agreements, and yet these platforms feel the same pressure as Reddit to expand faster than their human resources allow. So an increasing amount of what once was moderation now falls to normal users like you and me. We flag offensive photos on Facebook and frauds on Airbnb. We report the troll on Twitter, and when they are quickly suspended, we feel extremely gratified — and extremely powerful. The moderatocracy lives on inside us all."

technology,3dyong,Victawr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the real estate lesson. $2300/mo works out to $27,600/yr. You made $90,000/yr. Even factoring in things like food, clothes, insurance, etc... that's still a fuckton left over for an intern. How much do actual employees make? Unless you went balls out on where you lived, I have little sympathy for you. Interns here are lucky to get a stipend let alone pay, with contracts being maybe $25-30k. Housing is cheaper, sure, but the net difference is far worse.  I believe you that you make that much... but I don't buy that it's the low-end or that the average is supposedly $10k/mo. You are one of the lucky ones."
technology,3dyong,quigilark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"Food, clothes, insurance, tuition, and of course copious amounts of alcohol.  Not looking for sympathy at all lol. Just saying that after taxes, housing, and all the aforementioned things its really low for the city itself. You should check out some of the FT salaries. Its unreal. Absolutely absurd.   Yeah as an intern we're raking it in. But we're making trash compared to what others make out here in tech. Some companies here pay their interns more than their recent hires. Not all though.   Yeah, interns here are lucky as shit. But that's tech man. Microsoft interns are shitting cash too. NYC startups somehow throw the same numbers as well.   Tech internships are insanity. Financial algo internships pay even more. If you want to make money, learn to code.   Silicon valley tech internships are even crazier. I mean, Microsoft interns just got a private maroon 5 concert last week. Like wtf.     Yeah, 10k is the norm for people my age out here. Anyone in 4th year engineering interning out here is gonna get paid that or damn close to it.   We're lucky as fuck when comparing ourselves to people from other schools or areas (palo alto + san jose companies pay way less), we know it."
technology,3dyong,Victawr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:21 2015 UTC,That's still much less than $10k/month.
technology,3dyong,SidusKnight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:58:20 2015 UTC,Not including full benefits?  That's also average. Upper year students make the 10k regularly.   Yelp interns get 7500+1500 housing  Lookout gets up to 9000  Quora is 8500+2000 housing.   You get the idea.
technology,3dyong,Victawr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:03 2015 UTC,"Not including full benefits?   Didn't you say it was 10k + housing&perks?   That's also average.   You said 10k was average.    I'm well aware there are interns making 10k/month, my point was that it's not the average."
technology,3dyong,SidusKnight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:48 2015 UTC,"We go to the same school. How have you not even heard of this?   Jane Street is $12-15k/mo  Morgan Stanley is as high as $11k/mo  But I mean, you should also know companies like DropBox pay up to $11k + housing.   Carezone pays $10k/mo and then housing.   Google interns make $10k/mo at a senior level.  Many interns in SV are raking in shit tons of money. Some above $10k, some below.  Keep in mind housing stipends unspent are still collected as payment. As a combined total, $9-10k is easily the most common I've seen.   Not sure why the pedantry lol."
technology,3dyong,Victawr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:26 2015 UTC,"Again, I totally get that some interns do make 10k/month (isn't Jane Street in NYC though? doesn't matter).   As a combined total, $9-10k is easily the most common I've seen.   It's possible, but not only is 'people you know' not necessarily representative of most interns, people making more $ could be more likely to open about this sort of thing, etc.    Anyway, even if the average is eg 8k, it's still quite a bit of money for someone who's ~21. And this is a really silly thing to be arguing about."

He didn't show up for 30 min. We just sat there until someone went to the CS department to notify someone. A few minutes later the office assistant came and told us class was canceled since the professor never showed up, but she looked a little disheartened.

Most of the times, dying is a very ugly process. There's no dignity or poetry in it. It's your organism irreversibly breaking down and you - and your loved ones - being fully aware of the process.  To end on a high note - there is a slim chance that we'll overcome aging in our lifetime.  Fun fact: right now, we spend more money on cosmetics than on research to stop aging."

Also the universe is so massive and is so old the likelihood of finding  evidence of another species (who are still alive) is very slim.  If I remember correctly the sphere of influence around earth is about 200 light years and those would be signals produced by our first and very crude radio signals. Edit: In regard to where that fits in the Milky Way that's smaller than a grain of sand on your average beach.  Modern Communication systems are much better at using energy and the signals we use for radio/TV fade out much quicker than the signals we sent when the technology was new.  Alan Degrasse Tyson mentioned that if we did make first contact with an Alien speices that could travel through space with advanced technology the exchange they would have with our brightest Humans would be the same as us communicating with the smartest great apes or that of a young toddler at best.  In this subject we anthropomorphize too much. If there are other intelligent life forms out there, what drives them could be concepts that we just could not understand."
technology,3dxpaa,Lethem,6,Mon Jul 20 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"is it not a massive assumption that another form of intelligent live would have technology that creates radio waves?   As far as we know, electromagnetism is a fundamental part of nature. It's not just a thing we prefer, it is the only cheap way of 'wireless' communication.  (The alternative for moving information through space would be manipulating gravity, the only other force that works in vacuum at such long distances. But it seems that in order to do that you need to move enormous masses or if you know better than us, at least that much energy in some other form.)  If any other kind of field/phenomenon that can transmit information this cheaply and this far exists, we never noticed a single effect, not a single one, of it.  If a ET lifeform hasn't created a technology to scan and transmit pretty much in all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, it's not what we consider 'intelligent'. We call intelligent something that is at least as capable as we are. Sure we were intelligent for at least 100000 years before the EM discoveries of last century, but this ""setup"" time is considered negligible in the long times we are considering.

Nope.  Optical SETI is a thing.  However, a massive assumption is that aliens would broadcast in all directions in space, rather than directed transmissions.  They could use their star as a gravitational lens to direct signals at the Sun, and the Sun to focus the signal to a point.  That would be vastly more efficient than broadcasting in all directions.  The downside from our standpoint is the focus is ~800 times the Earth's distance from the Sun (800 AU), and none of our probes have got that far yet. Voyager 1 has made it to 132 AU, and that's the farthest we have got so far.  Of course, the aliens may not want to talk to any puny races that haven't even reached their star's focal distance."
technology,3dxpaa,danielravennest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:25:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are mostly correct.  The chances of us finding any signal is slim, because the universe is awfully big.  There was a formula, called the Drake equation, that deals with this. It multiples all the variables we can imagine to determine if there is life and if it is intelligent. One of the last terms was trying to determine the rate at which intelligent life destroys itself (this was thought up during the cold war and it seemed pretty inevitable that we wipe ourselves out). Basically, this gives each civilization a window of existence, which has to match up with ours in just the right way.  However, it is possible that intelligent life has evolved on a other system millions of years before ours, and their signals are just now hitting earth. They may all be dead, but whatever.  Lastly, it is more or less assumed that a) intelligence is a dominant strategy and will emerge on any planet with life, given enough time and b) intelligence will more than likely discover radio signals anearn to use them.

technology,3e0a66,IMPF,4,Tue Jul 21 11:14:16 2015 UTC,100% is a bit far fetched. Just because you don't use physical doesn't mean others don't. I'm sure digital is a large proportion of PC sales but there are still philysical PC games in all the game stores ( at least where I live).

I forget the exact percentage, but I believe roughly 80-90% of exploits in the wild are on patched vulnerabilities.  When I fix a computer with a virus, it is almost always on a PC that is coincidentally unpatched.   As a current Sys Admin, I will say that I have never seen a patch break any of my systems within the past 5 years. The closest I have seen was a virus that activated upon restart, which was coincidentally during a Windows Update cycle.  This policy change makes it much, much harder for hackers to get into computers, and it makes my life a lot easier by not having to run through 100 Windows Updates after cleaning up a friend's computer with a virus that they probably wouldn't even have if they just patched their computer."

In my opinion, it doesn't justify avoiding patches though, For the average user, they're more likely to download a virus (one that would not work if patched), than run into an update that breaks things.   With that said, the patching process for Windows 10 is also changing, so that the public does not get feature updates until they have been tested by 2 channels of public betas, so patches that break computers will probably happen much less."

How they handle it has also changed - extra layers of testing between MS and end users, plus scheduling for any reboots seems quite a bit smarter now.  It plans for a time when you're not using the machine, and even then it won't reboot unless the machine is actually idle (even having a VM running, without it doing anything, was enough for it to cancel the reboot and add a notification asking me when to schedule it)."

technology,3dyk9v,MasterK999,43,Mon Jul 20 16:47:05 2015 UTC,Gawker published a post about the CFO of Condé Nast attempting to pay a gay porn star for a night in a Chicago hotel.  This story came from the gay porn star himself who admitted to Gawker that he was only telling the story because the CFO refused to give in to his blackmail demands. The story had no other corroboration other than the first hand account of an admitted blackmailer. The story would never have passed editorial muster at any real news organization.
technology,3dyk9v,plutosicemantle,21,Mon Jul 20 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"The gay porn star is also the worst source possible in terms of credibility since all he came up with when contacted by other media were conspiracy theories rants. Gawker always scrapes at the very bottom, but this story was destined to blow up big time, possibly putting them beyond salvation."
technology,3dyk9v,MasterK999,18,Mon Jul 20 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"The real problem I see it is that the ""editors"" at Gawker seem to know nothing about journalism.  You see gossip rags like the National Enquirer know where the lines are. (even they mess up and get sued sometimes). There is much more leeway on single sourced stories if the person is a public figure which is why you see crazy stuff about celebrities and politicians so much. The CFO in question is not a public figure so a story like this could really blow up in their face."

I'm speaking from both an advertiser perspective and a user's perspective. Customer service applies to both.  Either way, they need to up their game considering some very prominent Instagram users are leaving/upset with the level of choices Instagram has made recently.

technology,3dv3y0,OhHiAndie,271,Mon Jul 20 00:32:58 2015 UTC,"Okay. On one side, I understand why Instagram would want a celebrity to have an ""easy"" username (if someone's searching for, say, Paris Hilton, they'll probably check if @ParisHilton is her account first, as opposed to @TinkerbellsMommy12345.)   They're doing social media marketing these days, so they'll probably give some priority to the people who can draw in brands. A celeb having a username that is relevant and easy to remember gets them more followers, which means more people will see the sponsored pictures they post.  BUT, the jerk move was to not have a more clear process for this. Why not ask the ""regular"" person if they want to give their username to a celeb? Why not have some sort of system where, if they want it so bad, the celeb's team can BUY the username off you?  Just straight up closing someone's account with no explanation or warning, just so it can be given to a celebrity, is a terrible move. Instagram should know better than to just cave in to a famous person's PR team and do that to a regular user."

Counterintuitively, during the high acceleration of launch the helium tank feels a large force upward, because the helium in the tank is highly buoyant.   Huh? A bottle of helium at 5,500 psi is buoyant? Not in earth atmosphere it isn't.  ETA: But I'm assuming it's in earth's atmosphere. It could very well be inside the tank of liquid oxygen, in which case it would be buoyant. And it would make sense to put it there.

(Do they have to strap down the tanks of 2000psi helium you can buy at the store for blowing up balloons? No, of course not. A tank of helium at 2000psi is not buoyant.) Put a tank of 5,500 psi helium in your car and accelerate and the tank will do exactly what you'd expect a heavy object to do. It doesn't matter if it's compressed helium or compressed hydrogen or compressed air - if the tank is not buoyant just sitting there it will not be ""more buoyant"" under acceleration.

Carefully read the following sentence:    This underbelly consists mainly, but not exclusively, of angry white dudes who want to spew as much hate as possible at women, people of color, and LGBT people.   The argument here is that the ""underbelly of the internet"" - which is just a small group of otherwise perfectly normal users - consists mostly of ""angry white dudes."" She's not claiming all white men are bigots, but I'd say she's definitely fair when claiming than a good portion of the racist, sexist, and homophobic sentiment comes from white men. Now, if you want argue otherwise, I'd be open to that, but I think you'd probably be wrong about that.  People are missing the heart of the article, which is that keeping /r/coontown open is fairly ridiculous and the Reddit's pretension to being a ""haven for free speech"" is problematic. Here's her main point:    Why not just ban the crappy subreddits? On what planet are a bunch of white supremacists and woman-haters entitled to have someone else pay for space for them to organize and encourage each other? This debacle demonstrates, above all, that libertarianism is not the coherent ideology that it purports to be, so much as a cover story for protecting or even perpetuating bigoted behavior.

Where I am looking for an exchange of ideas, you seem to look to agitate and escalate.  This does not usually solve problems but instead makes them grander.  Notice my response defensive and poignant, to which you got somewhat aggressive while reading it that was the very point of escalation.  However if we stick to less invasive word usage tempers will not flair and ideas can at least be heard and not to pick apart one's speech but to actually weigh the value of the idea being discussed.  Reddit is a place to discuss and if you want to see what the latest hate speech is (sadly) it is the place to go.  But ignoring a subject entirely is a cowards way out and as I mentioned before just makes more irritation.   Now I'm sure you really want know how I come to the even more racist part, here you go.  look no further than a hotel or fast food chain if the manager is of a certain race the staff will generally be all that race, so much for inclusion...

This is a legitimate business risk they know they're facing, and they will have built in enough margin to pay any fines, charges and back pay/overdue benefits while they readjust their pricing and commission structure.  Mostly, they'll just increase pricing to compensate. Most of the Uber Black guys I've talked to are happy as independent contractors and drive for other companies too, not just Uber. They'll likely choose to stay as contractors.  UberX drivers are more likely to switch to an hourly wage + commission/incentive structure. These are the guys claiming exploitation and demanding benefits (often rightly so from some of the reports I've read). Uber may take on the ownership of more cars and get drivers to work ""part time"" driving a ""company car"" (like how many taxi medallion owners make sure their medallions are earning money 24/7)"

First of all, common carrier regulations apply to telephone service based on end user interconnects, not point to point carriage.  So changing a pots network from copper to wireless digital changes nothing in the regulation of the network.    Second: for a long time the same reasoning applied in reverse to internet data, IE internet is not governed by common carrier regulations no matter how it's transmitted point to point.  Third: There is 0 indication that copper is being replaced by wireless broadband, the big infrastructure works that are going on right now is copper to fiber optics and digital coax.    fourth: common carrier regulations have just been passed for internet service rendering this discussion moot  fifth: The author is clearly not educated in large scale network infrastructure.  Verizon and AT&T are aggressively installing fiber optics for high level bulk data interconnects, they are just putting a moratorium on fiber to the curb, IE a fiber optics cable going into residences.  But copper simply cannot cope with large scale data demands at the backbone level and is being replaced by fibre.  This is what they mean by 'territories'    Sixth: wireless broadband services are managed by AT&Ts and Verizon's mobile divisions, and wired internet by the internet divisions.  Any move to switch large numbers of customers from one service branch to another would be preceded by trememdous financial upheaval in these business units.

Windows 10 will get security updates for 10 years, combined with feature upgrades. However as we know with Apple/Google they combine both to bloat hardware down so one has to buy a new hardware more often.  So as long as one buys a reasonably powerful machine, like a light gamers box or workstation laptop, then there shouldn't be a performance problem for most users and the feature bloat shouldn't be a problem too much as the hardware will be able to handle it.

For example, there may be ads in the tile portion of the start menu. Just think how much money there is in displaying ads to billions of consumers for hours a day. Ever since Microsoft bought Skype its been flooded with ads that get in the way of information, despite being monetized in other ways(skype credit).  There's clearly an ulterior motive to giving out free upgrades to home users. They still have to support win 7/8 for a while for business purposes(they don't get a free upgrade), so it's quite clear they're looking to monetize windows home in other ways.   Why else would they give out an upgrade for completely free? It doesn't change their product support lifecycle for win7/8(and they have no legal obligation to support those), it doesn't    The end user license agreement (Eula) also has a clause within it that says: “By accepting this agreement, you agree to receive these types of automatic updates without any additional notice.”    My guess is the home versions will have ads, but the enterprise versions won't. Microsoft has such a monopoly on the OS market that they don't really have much to lose by this. Apple PCs are still super overpriced and limited, and Linux isn't beginner friendly.  Windows 7 already installs updates automatically by default, you have to go out of your way to disable it, so I doubt this is Microsoft trying to keep people protected."

But to answer why they are giving out the upgrade for free, it's so everyone is on the same page. Having millions of users on multiple OSes is a nightmare, but having everyone on the same OS is a godsend. Plus, it is to drive their Microsoft Store so they can get more app downloads and get more developers making games for it. They can afford to give out the OS for free because they can make up the money elsewhere, be it advertising or store sales. I'm also pretty sure Windows itself isn't what makes Microsoft the most money, OEMs get it fairly cheaply and not many home users buy the OS alone.  I personally don't think they will go overboard if they did introduce adverts other than recommended apps. I don't really think they will introduce adverts like that. The only reason they did it with Skype is to keep it free for those that don't pay for credit which is the overwhelming majority."

I completely misread his message and now I realize he was talking about the same things I was thinking of.  Microsoft will still need to support Windows 7 & 8 until the end of the support lifecycle in the 2020s.  Giving away Win10 won't change that obligation.    Perhaps they could have ended support early if they were to declare that Win10 wasn't a new product but rather an update to the existing Win7 and Win8 products (similar to how a service pack ends support for the RTM); but it doesn't look like they're planning that.  I suspect that they're giving away Win10 for marketing reasons:  They may be hoping for fast uptake and the ensuing media buzz to rekindle interest in the Windows ecosystem.  Or perhaps they're hoping to boost the interest in the Windows Store.  Or perhaps they want a large install base to setup some sort of tie-in with a future product like the hololens."

At //build/, they announced an ambitious goal to have over 1 billion devices on Windows 10 within like a year or two. To me, that's a good reason for it to be a free upgrade for 1 year. It also helps that Windows 10 UWPs are compatible with their Windows 10 Mobile OS (same kernel, api, etc, etc).  They've got several motivations (/u/Mista_Wong gave a good answer too) but honestly a large base of users all running the same OS also means that developers (like me, and if you're actually a programmer [Fuck Riven top lane]) then your life is easier since you only have to worry about Windows 10 (however .NET made that work a bit easier) for UWPs (which is their main goal).  Once you get the user base on Windows 10, then developers will build on the platform using the tools. More developed apps and games means more users. More users means more that developers will target the platform. It's a positive feedback loop."

How much of this is due to slow devices and how much of it is due to slow mobile networks? Is Apple deliberately crippling iPhones with 1GB of RAM to keep people within its native app ecosystem? (Probably not).  How much of this is inherent to the medium vs. a consequence of the way ad networks slow page loads down? You don't see many performance issues on static sites rendered by Jekyll. Do the performance degradation caused by ad networks make monetizing a website a catch-22? Should we be surprised that an open medium with no barriers to entry is hard to monetize? Is it worth waiting a few extra seconds in order to preserve that open medium?

And of course then there are the pages that hijack scrolling or use really terrible UI elements because they look cool.

In the modern world, knowledge is power.  Knowledge is a weapon.  Now more than ever before.    We surrender knowledge of ourselves to authorities (taxation authorities, government organs, companies with which we interact) to the extent that we must.  But it's a necessary evil.  A cost of doing business.  Or even a punishment for and repercussion of crime (individuals on probation being a strong example).    To say that I do not wish the NSA to have the details of my email interactions with business partners (for example), is not to say I do not believe any party should know any thing of any other, in our society.  It is, rather, to outline one of an infinitely complex set of criteria for the acceptable use of information.    Some people, in this case, view the divulging of personal details to the public to be an acceptable repercussion for the specific actions which led to their being collected.  But to suggest this view must imply a universal absence of interest in privacy is exactly the opposite conclusion, to that which ought to be drawn from this.  Precisely because this information being divulged is a negative repercussion, the punishment fits the crime.    To suggest that anyone believes in a system wherein no one knows anything of anyone else at any time is childish.  We can't all live as hermits, all the time.  In the real societies of our world, personal information is carefully managed, protected, fought for, shared, and sold.

I'm not gonna lie, I made an account on the site because I had a couple of drinks, and a friend and I were curious and thought it would be funny to check out, but I would never put personal info in there, and I'm not shallow enough to actually pay for anything on a site like that.  I mean, what info can they really hack from a fake account?  I'm surprised that a lot of the population would use real info/pay for this stuff...   ...but at the same time, I'm not surprised at all."
technology,3dwqzs,DostKd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:00 2015 UTC,Apparently they hacked it partly because there's a fee for deleting you account and even after deleting the account the company still has your information. This information is what the hackers accessed somehow.

Let's try explaining this with a story and John and Ashley (feel free to change the names/genders).  They are in a relationship (4 years in) and something goes wrong. maybe they have money problems, maybe something happens to a family member, it doesn't matter. Something happens.  The relationship starts to break down and John ends up meeting a nice guy/girl at a bar one night and sleeps with them.  Ashley in the meantime signs up for an AshleyMadison, where she starts chatting with a few people as she is missing affection at home.  John comes home one day and comes clean, telling Ashley everything. Ashley also tells John about her account. They realise they are still deeply in love and decide to resolve their issues.  Ashley deletes her account. John stops drinking. They speak to a counselor and everything is going really well.  Then a year or so later the site gets hacked and some dickhead dumps all the data online. Remember that info from deleted accounts has not been removed (the article clearly states this)  The next week one of John's colleagues takes him aside and says ""Hey man, did you know Ashley is cheating on you?"" Soon the whole office is sure that John has been cuckolded and John is also unsure, after all, the data doesn't say if she deleted the account or not, just her name and credit card number.  Ashley has bigger problems, the credit card details have been used to steal money from her account, she spends a few hours on the phone with her bank trying to get it sorted. She calls her friends, except now she's that ""cheating bitch"" who might try and steal their men! Half of them cut her off. At her job, her boss asks if she feels she is doing the right thing working in a family oriented business.  For the rest of their lives, Ashley and John are marked in their town for what happened. They brush it off mostly but sometimes it gets hard. They're thinking of moving.  But who gives a shit about them, some guy cheating on his wife in New York was caught and justly lost his stuff. Fuck him!  Disclaimer - I have never used the site so I don't know if it really offers chat functionality or not.  Edit - spelling"

You seem to be suggesting that it's the on the psychologically abused not to care. That's not how normal social relations work and that's not the solution societies use to deal with people who commit non-physical or indirect harms.

technology,3dudcj,Myrtox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:01:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but it works both ways.  Without users the creators will go elsewhere. Without content then so will users.  My point is simply that the creators will budge before the users do unless Google manage to screw up the user experience very badly. For most this might be a fundamental change in UI (more than Google+ integration, clearly), removal of features, imposed restrictions, etc.  Far as the user is concerned there's little wrong with YouTube. Problems like the content ID system or how monetization works doesn't concern them.  Even if people get bored like some have with Facebook the cost to compete with YouTube is much greater than the cost to compete with other, simpler networks, like Snapchat or Twitter.  Twitch seems to be biggest competitor to YouTube and only really for streams, something YouTube is trying to improve. Even then I'd rather watch a VOD on YouTube because the system loads faster.

technology,3dudcj,flipdee,2,Sun Jul 19 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"Youtube is a single website, with content from different creators. The same way a cable network has content from different production companies.   Not quite. If a cable network (in this case we'll assume that ""network"" means a group of channels owned by an individual corporation, e.g. ABC Cable Network Group channels, and not a single channel) declines to purchase the rights to run a show and fund its production then the content provider can move on to a different network. In this case, if that content is good and engaging and competes with another good an interesting show on an ABC CNG channel, then ABC CNG may have lost that viewer due to the linearity of how cable television works.  However, YouTube doesn't make that decision. It gets all the content providers, and since content isn't competing against each other in all time slots it can essentially ""double dip"" on both pieces of content. So in this case, YouTube is more like Comcast than ABC CNG. Comcast gets to count you as a viewer whether you're watching ABC Family or FXX, just like YouTube gets to count you as a viewer whether you're watching Geek and Sundry or the latest Justin Bieber single.  Now, this is where the ambiguous and editorialized title (nowhere does it say that we're talking about individual ""stations"" or ""channels"" in the article, they use the word ""network"" which could be interpreted as one channel or a group of channels) and the shoddy analysis from BGR falls apart: YouTube viewers and cable viewers are not mutually exclusive. You can watch cable TV and watch YouTube, so while they are competing for eyes, they're both getting viewers and I suspect there's a large overlap between cable viewers and YouTube viewers.  Also pretty bad is the fact that YouTube's numbers appear to, in this case, count global views, which is a possible audience of a couple billion Internet users, while US cable networks only have a potential audience of a few hundred million. If the numbers are adjusted to include only US viewers on YouTube, then BGR doesn't indicate that.  The title is also a bit inaccurate since the article is just talking about viewers 18-49, which automatically rules out a large portion of the American public that is largely computer illiterate. So it may be that, for example, Fox News in fact has a larger viewing pool than YouTube does, when you include all demographics, and restrict YouTube's numbers to include only the United States.  So there's a lot of shitty analysis done on this, and we really are comparing apples to oranges, and applying that comparison to kale."
technology,3dudcj,Kichigai,4,Mon Jul 20 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"Not a legitimate comparison. YouTube has content from every possible creator (including those very cable channels it is comparing itself to) across every genre and area of interest. Cable channels all have niches: sports, news, food, movies, comedy, family, etc.  Apples and oranges."
technology,3dudcj,206dude,6,Sun Jul 19 19:10:33 2015 UTC,"The article says cable network, not cable channel. There are networks which cover multiple genres/interests, and if they were as successful as Youtube they would cover many more. If there was a cable network that was so successful it had content from every creator across every genre, would we be unable to compare it with other cable networks simply because it was so successful?  Youtube's model obviously isn't identical to a cable network, but that doesn't mean they're incomparable. It's one company (much like a cable network), it just so happens that their model allows anyone to create content for them, which is obviously a huge advantage."

Excel on my computer does not do that (or at least does not ask permission).

I generally wait before installing upgrades to see if there are any major problems with the current batch of upgrades.

Extremely greedy of them. They saw apple and google making billions from their app worlds and they looked at their desktop model and thought lets scrap 20 years of application development, open source software movements, lets forget all that and force uses in a gate keeper software development scenario where MS get to make money off every app sold.   Then with windows 10 they have tried to back track on their failed windows 8 and now they are trying best of both. I can at least ignore all the non sense in windows 10 when in 8 it was not possible. However in a longer time line, i realy dislike that they have ultimately turned their back on real desktop applications in favour of a cheap and shitty app market, just so they can make more money.  i have a windows phone with work, got it free and i absolutely hate the OS.

I get the argument that you have to pay for yours, so everybody should have to pay for their own. I personally have been in a situation where i could not afford a cell phone and tried to find a job. it's near impossible. Potential employers expect you to be able to be reached at any time. And they call during working hours, which is also when you're out trying to find a job. I know people will abuse the system, but i would rather pay to give out phones if even a small percentage actually use them for necessities .  Another point is that the program was set up when landlines were the norm. certain companies realized they could use this program make money  with cell phones as well. The money is making profit for these companies or they wouldnt do it. So don't put plame on people with ""Obama phones"" (he had no part in it and it was set up way before he was president"".

I guess the UK doesn't do judicial review like we do in the States (which, come to think of it, should be no surprise, since judicial review in the US started out as a sham and turned out to be... well... great.)

Their argument was that private copying happened anyway and wasn't enforced (and some publishers had publicly stated they were happy with private copying - although this when they were trying to appear reasonable and not out of touch, before they realised they could make some free money from it), and so the compensation for this copying was already included in the price of CDs etc..  The judge was fine with this reasoning, but while the Government had set out what evidence it needed to gather to show this was the case, they hadn't actually collected that evidence.

Absolutely crazy stuff. You could of course just record that audio stream with some recording software, rendering the whole DRM useless after one play of the Album.    EDIT: Bullshit just escaped my keyboard. This is all wrong and I don't know where I got it from. I just checked up on the DRM used, and it is called XCP-Aurora by a company called ""First 4 Internet"". What it actually did was quite different. There was Raw audio on the CD, but it was not accessible from Windows PCs.  Firstly, the CD wasn't marked as an Audio CD for windows, it had an AutoPlay executable that would ask the user to agree to an EULA. If they didn't, the CD would be ejected. If they did, the CD would install XCP-Aurora and the proprietary audio player without any notice. This software was installed like a rootkit would be, so it messed with the way the OS worked and hid itself from the OS in every possible way, so you couldn't uninstall it, you couldn't even see it in the Task Manager. It detected if a protected Audio CD was inserted and would write random noise onto the data stream of the disc drive for every single process of the OS that used this stream (apart from the proprietary one of course), so you couldn't play or rip it on windows, no matter how hard you tried. Linux and Mac OS were completely fine, though. Still absolutely crazy.    As if that wasn't bad enough already, the way it did that was by running a query on the primary executables of every process running to detect whether they were using the Audio disk stream, which resulted in continuous reads from the HDD, meaning that it would shorten the lifespan of the drive and slow down the PC. To inject the random noise, they installed a fake disc drive driver that intercepted every call to the disc drive.  And as if that wasn't bad enough already, because XCP nested itself into the OS so deeply into the OS to cloak its existence, it opened a few additional vulnerabilities that were used by viruses and even game hacks shortly after the first unveiling of the software. What they did was intercept every single call for the listing of processes, directories or registry listings, so they could remove their own process, files and registry entries from every process that would try to uncover them.  And if that wasn't bad enough either, the ""uninstaller"" that was later released by Sony just unhid the files, but didn't uninstall anything, it just unhid some of the files of the rootkit and the way it had to be installed required you to fill in your email address which could be used for promotional purposes and required you to install an ActiveX control in Internet Explorer which opened even more security holes.   A real uninstaller was later released by Sony, but that whole thing was a disaster.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Copy_Protection"

technology,3dwjt2,strattonbrazil,2,Mon Jul 20 08:56:13 2015 UTC,"Well I am actually an engineer in this industry so let me break down my concerns for you.  Asphalt is supposed to crack, that's how it releases pressure in an overstress condition.  The article wrongly attacks this as one of its bad traits.  But the reality this cracking is only a long term serviceability issue. As long as it's in place it's doing it's job, which is providing a protective surface for the soil beneath it.  The soil takes the loads, not the asphalt.  In the case of these hollow plastic roadways, they are essentially placing a small frame on the soil.  This frame will be subject to bending and shear forces the asphalt won't.  So in an overstress condition, instead of cracking in place, you could have structural failure. Not necessarily a full on break, but most likely a permanent deformation.  Additionally you may see long term fatigue failures (little stresses deforming or breaking over periods of time) just like we do on bridges."

Or rush hour in a big city? More prime sun light hours where the panels don't have access to the sun.  And let's not forget roads get covered in oil and dirt all the time.  Another big hit to their efficiency.  You know what location stays clean, never has traffic on it, and requires far less engineering? Roofs.  Think about engineering value.

The funny part is intel has given so many of the SoCs that the indian tablet manufacturers have started to put them in mini-PCs for ~99$! So you have Atom now undercutting higher margin Core parts.

A camera has perfect motion blur since the shutter stays on for 1/24 of a sec, it records the correct motion blur that occurs during that time and so the motion looks smooth.   In gaming each frame is rendered a still image with motion blur added as an effect. This does not work nearly as well as a real thing. So to compensate, you need to create more still frames and have the eye reconstruct the motion blur.   As a result movies look perfectly fine at 24 fps, but games will look noticeably choppy."

Interestingly enough this is not always the case. Traditional 24 fps film cameras have 1/48 s shutter or shorter. There are ways to make shutter longer on film, but this leads to some additional artifacts (some films were shot that way).

As long as people enjoy the Model S, it'll further support Tesla and get the Model X (albeit late) and 3 on the road, which I expect to be late too.  Either way, with a full charge every morning (30 miles of charge per hour with a dryer outlet) and their Supercharger network growing every single day, it's hard to not see so many benefits of EV's.  Especially only costing between $30-40 a month to charge on average.  I'm putting all that gas savings into my payment when I get mine.  I'm just glad Tesla is around, because they're a good role model.    Maybe except for the timeline thing, but I'd rather they take their time than massively screw something up which is really important for a company who is an up and comer going against auto manufactures who have been in the business for decades."

Tesla has always claimed they are production constrained, with waiting lists, which is only true because they haven't ramped up production much.  The secret is the pool of rich people that want a Tesla is just too small.  It shows the Model 3 will need to be a really compelling car to sell more than niche numbers.  Things like waiting 3 hours at the SuperCharger to charge up your car on the holiday trip actually matters."
technology,3dy9dj,fauxgnaws,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"I'll have to disagree regarding AWD.  Not everyone wants AWD, and the Model S already has high marks in harsh conditions even before the Dual Motor was announced.  Also, this could appeal to people who do not have the need for 85kWh, but are also interested in more space in the front trunk.  In fact, one owner whom owns the most Model S', lives in the arctic circle, and none of those Model S' have Dual Motor.  Regarding ""ramping up production"".  Right now, their batteries are supplied by Panasonic in China and they are the current bottleneck.  The last car I bought was a Volkswagen CC at $36,000 and I had to pay premium gasoline (didn't have to but I prefer to use the recommended) and my maintenance went through the roof after 100,000 miles.  It got expensive really quick.  I sold it and started a 24-month lease so I can save and when it's done I'll be lined up with some savings.  I know the Model 3 will attract a lot of buyers, but even myself who was on the fence at $36,000 (not including gasoline) puts me right in line for the low end Model S with an effective comparable cost to my Volkswagen.  And it'll be a little better if I decide to put a little down.  That's just my scenario -- but of course everyone's is different, and you can't rule out that if people are given the option, it'll attract buyers regardless."
technology,3dy9dj,110110,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:06 2015 UTC,"They specifically didn't buy the AWD model, or it wasn't available at the time?  There's a 70 kWh dual motor so battery size isn't a factor.  Trunk size, maybe like one person makes a buying design for a sedan based on that.  You believe that batteries are in short supply, even though they are using mostly stock batteries and nobody else has a shortage and Tesla has the power wall as well.  There's no battery shortage.  Are you not from the US?  100k miles of gas is only like $10k, getting you nowhere near the Model S.  With the tax credits running out, I'd be putting my money on hybrids.  Volt or a compact sized version of that. Or i3 with extender; you can go camping by just taking a 5 gallon jug of gas with you.  There's going to be some Leaf type buyers that get a cheap Tesla, but I bet cars for the masses will be hybrid for a decade."
technology,3dy9dj,fauxgnaws,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:52 2015 UTC,"It wasn't available at the time.  I agree those people would choose Dual Motor now that it's available.    I'm familiar with the PowerWall and the energy storage implications with constraints.  They are working on Model X and PowerWall but beyond that I don't think they can push too many cars out the door with their currently supply.  I could be wrong if someone has some data to show, but I am sure much of that is inside information.  My average was 20,000 miles a year, and when gas was $3.50-4.00 a gallon, yes -- it is very easy to reach more than $10k.  I was over 100,000 miles (I just put that as a metric).  I averaged nearly $250 a month in gasoline (sometimes more). Which equates to $15,000 in gasoline for the little over 5 years I had it.  Believe me, I've done the math.  I'll be getting the Model S (with a down payment) before the tax credits run out, which are expected to cover around 50,000~ Model 3's at the current US output rate.  This could go up though.  And I say 50,000 because that's the last number I recall someone mentioning, that could be off.  I don't expect it to be an overnight transition, but I really just think it's important for people to at least be open to change, which is seemingly hard for people to do."

For instance, I work in IT and having notifications on my wrist, rather than having to pull my phone out every five minutes, has been a tremendous help (though I am hoping they will introduce email replies in the next update). I know other professionals in different fields who use it for the same purpose. But I also know several younger people who wear it mostly as a fashion statement. And there's even another group of people I know that wear it for fitness.   The one thing I will say is that, for my purposes, it's a somewhat overpriced gadget. I have yet to decide if it's a necessity or just an accessory. Which I guess is what a watch is to begin with. Regardless, I purchased one while keeping in mind Apple's 14 day return policy, because I wanted to try it out but I wasn't sure what I was going to use it for. I'm currently in week 3 and I'm glad I held onto it. Even bought one for the wife, who is not a techie and would've told me to return hers had she not found a use for it."

If Apple was having 1 failed product launch after another... on and on and on repeatedly -- but still somehow staying afloat,.. then I might agree with you.   But that clearly isn't the case. Apple is having one of it's most successful runs ever,.. staying in the Top 5 of ""Customer Satisfaction"" (JD Powers awards) for something like 10 years now,.. and showing growth in the PC sector where most other companies are seeing declines.   This isn't merely ""because Marketing."" Apple certainly does do some pretty suave marketing -- but the reason the marketing works so well.. is because they back it up with great products. (IE = if their product-launches were failing right and left,.. no amount of ""great marketing"" would save them)."

As a tech nerd that goes way back, I can't think of any other company that has managed to reach the level of intense, often blind zealotry that Apple has.  I'm not disputing that many of their products are excellent.  Their MacBook Pro line is sick.  The iPhone has had it's moments of sheer brilliance, certainly including the launch iPhone which I saw as cool on the level of holding a light-saber in my hand.  They have brilliant engineers and the best UX people around.  But.  But I don't know if you took the Apple watch and removed the Apple logo and the Apple marketing if it would have sold anywhere near the volume it's sold.  Even with the integration with the iPhone and iTunes intact (keeping the infrastructure), I don't think it would have sold if say Samsung or Microsoft had released it with their own similar level of marketing push.  I don't think I'd see it on all the talk shows and in the news if it weren't Apple.   That's hard to gauge when it comes to asking ""why is this selling?""  I wouldn't dispute (despite my original assertion) that it's not selling entirely because of marketing, but I do think it's selling far, far, far more because of that than because of its intrinsic quality."

Sure, it has quirks like all the other languages, but no language is perfect, and many programmers have made their decision to stick with the speed of PHP rather than the strictness of other languages.  PHP is used in a lot of applications. Because PHP is extremely popular as ""the language of the web"", many related professions such as web designers, SEO marketers, ""site admins"" tend to know a little bit of PHP. That's okay.

Many of the US's top IT managers have lied about their degrees or other credentials.

The actual description of the patent is as follows;      Method and system for targeted advertising of goods and services to users of mobile terminals, based for example on the users' profile. Goods and services are marketed to particular target groups of users sharing a common profile which may be selected to increase the likelihood of the users responding to the advertisements and purchasing the advertised goods and services. The common profile of users may be based on the amount of pre-paid credit available to each user.       So an example was given of using a pre-paid credit balance (which wouldn't generally be considered a credit card).  And later in the filing;       Generally, the advertisement management system 14 is arranged to determine and select which advertisement or advertisements are delivered via the communications network 18 to the user of each mobile terminal 16, i.e., by appropriate control and management of the delivery element 32. This determination or selection may be based on the likelihood of the user being able to purchase the advertised goods and/or services. There are several ways to assess the likelihood of the user of a mobile terminal 16 being able to purchase advertised goods and/or services.

technology,3duth8,slartibartfastr,-7,Sun Jul 19 22:05:16 2015 UTC,"Hah, that's really gonna backfire. Watch and wait, publishers are going to make their sites ""incompatible with Safari"" so you'll be forced to use Chrome mobile or something which doesn't have ad-blocking built in.  Of course though, you're still stuck in Apple's ecosystem. Even if extensions on Chrome mobile existed, you wouldn't be able to use them because Apple just simply would not allow Google or anyone to run extensions on their own (and using the App Store would be unrealistic, really). Back when I had an iPhone, I absolutely hated Safari.  The fact that it's forced and you have basically no other options for a default browser is really irritating."
technology,3duth8,Inaspectuss,7,Sun Jul 19 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"With your logic, the only platform supported by websites would be iOS due to them probably being the only ones without AdBlock capability."
technology,3duth8,pablo72076,-4,Mon Jul 20 00:13:41 2015 UTC,"Having it built into the browser by default? That makes total sense that advertisers and content producers would block it.  Yes, with Android, you have the ability to do so, but do a majority of users know that their phone is capable of it or even have it installed? Nope. Same thing with PCs and Macs. A majority still see ads - and probably don't really know about adblocking software, so they'll still be earning revenue for publishers. When one publisher has a particularly large userbase of iOS or iOS makes up a good portion of their traffic, they're losing lots of money because of the ad blocking by default. In that case, it'd make sense to block Safari traffic completely.   It's not adblocking software that's the problem, it's the fact that it's enabled by default, and the fact that many users would not know of or have it otherwise. Imagine if Google wasn't an advertising company, but still has the popularity that it does, and has Chrome with adblocking by default. Do you know how screwed all the advertisers and publishers would be?   Sure, Safari traffic isn't a majority of web traffic, but it's a fair share, and because of that, publishers and advertisers would lose a considerable amount of money."

But this isn't just a problem for Apple, all the tech giants are copping it, and with that we're seeing a lot of patent applications which cover vague grey areas that weren't historically patented because they weren't seen as being unique or valuable.

I think Chicago's going to get their money- for now- but I think I've got a solid case against this bullshit, and I'm starting to take notes for a court case against them now, assuming I get to that level later.  Basically, I'm building a new kind of P2P software that can be authenticated- so you can prove who sent what to whom- with the idea being that you can make it so that the authentication lets anybody with the stuff upload to anybody who has bought it, but nobody else, and for uploading, you get some % of the sale price.  Read as: you get money for uploading to people that have paid for it, as long as you upload the correct thing.  Even if you didn't buy. Which is how pirates can earn money to pay the content creators of the content they've pirated- automatically.  It's not a new idea, but I think I've solved the big problems and I'm building the fucking thing, and so the case against this kind of tax in Chicago will be that, since the tax would presumably be applied to my users in Chicago as well, and these users would already have income tax, and this would impose a double tax on that income- something I think they wouldn't be able to defend in court.  BTW, if you know anything about this shit, I'd love to hear from you.

technology,3dsb14,aesu,3,Sun Jul 19 10:31:14 2015 UTC,"Well, to start, mine is open source, and the fact that centrally regulating this also means having a marketplace by default.  Something like a blockchain works, but at the scale of the network transactions, it's much better to have a central server that tracks this stuff, especially given how the authentication works under my design.  Also, I know this is going to happen, and I've accounted for it and want to encourage it.  I think this is the better sort of business, and that means that people will necessarily copy it. So on some level, I want to encourage that, because this is built from the ground up to let people cooperate.  Being ""A company"" doesn't mean we have to assholes; it just mean's we're in a legally recognized group that can take legally recognized actions with legal protection.  So it's an open-source sort of company that anybody can cooperate with, but part of anybody being able to cooperate with it means there has to be some legal entity that can, for market reasons, be shown to be responsible for delivering content.  It's a company designed to solve humanitarian problems, no matter who's at the wheel, because part of having a feasible solution to any humanitarian problem necessarily means it has to be self-sustaining and replicable.  and it's step one.  If you follow the reasoning of paying people for supplying stuff, you probably follow the reasoning of paying people for supplying work; and then it logically follows that some people will do the work better than others, or offer to do more for free, if they want to. Combine that with projects like folding@home, and I think this thing has a shot at doing things like helping find cures for HIV and cancer."

The content creator would look at the option of buying time on AWS (to use the AWS server as if it were an uploader) and sharing % of his sale with other uploaders, and would conclude that it's only reasonable to use other uploaders if they do it for something that amounts to no profit (if you consider bandwidth costs). What you're trying to do is make common people sell their PCs as servers, which is not cost-efficient at all. You say:     Which is how pirates can earn money to pay the content creators     Every economic gain has an added value behind it, you have to think what is the value in this case; and it seems to be bandwidth (which is not cost-efficient, user actually loses money, at most saves a bit on his ISP fee) + possibly marketing. The good part of your system is that users could market to each other and receive a % of the sale as a reward, like a crowdsourced marketplace, or crowdsourcerd advertising; which although some stores already use as a way to boost sales, there aren't any stores that are based solely around this. The core part of your idea is crowdsourced marketing, the P2P part could still be interesting for the vibe of the store/system, but isn't providing any significant value, it could perfectly work with just links and a central server, or one server for each content creator. Also, your software doesn't try to solve the Chicago tax problem, the unrelated lawsuit does; these two don't seem to be related at all."

That's 215$ Klowned is gonna lose. Klowned gets 20 fucking letters in the mail from attorneys who will go to court in his place for a low price of $85 bucks. Klowned made bad choices in life, but regardless he does, but just barely, manages to make more than 85$ a day, so it's net profit to pay a lawyer to go to court in his place. Accounting for the money and the amount of not pissing of not pissing off your employer in an at-will employment state, Klowned goes with a lawyer.   The lawyer makes 85$ off Klowned, and say he did 9 other people that day, $850 total  and the court makes 215$ off Klowned. The lawyer and the district attorney are on a first name basis and both went to law school together.  I can't say I've sat down and traced how many palms that meager 215$ greases on it's long long journey from Klowneds broke ass pocket, but he knows it's more than 2, because he already knows the Assistant DA and the lawyer got paid.   Klowned pretty happy he doesn't live in a state that incentivizes massive civil forfeiture abuse, but the amount of money being produced from traffic tickets is pretty easy to see, last time Klowned represented himself he counted about 100 people coming and going. 185$ court cost for each of them, $18,500 in only an hour that Klowned had to stand in line.

Taxi companies would actually love this as they would be able to make more money with less overhead.  Sure the actual drivers might hate it, but they really don't have much power.  I mean its not like you can go on strike.  Its actually the police and fire/ambulance that will fight it more than anyone.  You have to think that this would allow you to phase out around 25% of the police force.  Instead you would find that they would specialize the police force and focus more on investigation.  It would actually be good the public and for crime rates,  as they can focus a lot more, but you do lose some of the force.    The biggest change would be for the ambulance and Fire response.  It would allow you to phase out the majority of those workers.  Most of the responses by the fire department are actually overwhelmingly vehicular accidents.

You said it yourself that computers are better in the vast majority of situations, and I agree. But that doesn't mean they are better in all situations. I'm specifically thinking of inclement weather, where vehicles may be better off with a driver, and where this would mean lost time and productivity for automated semis, driver based semis could continue. Your example unloading a television, what if everything goes well, but the person decides to take a few more items out of the truck, because it's packed full of delivery items for that day, or they grab the wrong item. Without an employee there to sign off on the item being safely delivered, time and money is lost correcting this mistake. I think it's a worse business decision to not include a driver because it can cost you time and money. And it's all about the money.  Just to make sure I'm extra clear, the driver would probably be sitting there doing nothing most of the time, much like I imagine tram and train conductors (sorry if I'm wrong and they actually do things), but they are there if needed for liability purposes."

Farmers moving to big cities, taking jobs in factories. When factories started using more automation, it did not end everyone's job. It is a process, that takes several years/decades. Those, who were laid off, either found an other manual labor, or trained themselves to do something else. Service industry grew a lot.  People who think trucker jobs will go away completely, are nuts. Just think about how backwards are the people around the world still. We are using trucks for long range delivery, instead of trains! Large trucks should be used only to take the goods from local train depot to the city. However moving goods cross country/continent should be done via rail-works, which is cheaper and more effective. Mentality did not change for a century, regardless of the effectiveness. I agree, that some places it's just not worth it.  I actually am waiting for the time, when I can simply borrow a self driving car from a shop, to get my groceries home. I live in the city center. I either chose home delivery, or go out frequently to buy groceries, as I cannot carry that much to store them for several weeks/months.  If we were rational people, almost everyone would use public transportation, and cities would invest billions upon billions to improve public transit systems. We are NOT rational. We like to do things on our terms.  Self driving cars are coming, but it will take ~20 years until they reach a proper impact point in society. And about costing cities millions? It was already mentioned, less accidents, less hospital need, EMT, Police, Firefighters, etc...

technology,3du2b9,DanielPhermous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:59:48 2015 UTC,There were a couple posts about it in /r/multicopter yesterday. From my understanding the guys at the RC field didn't know there was a TFR due to the fire. The pilots of the firefighting craft just saw drones nearby and so did a safety hold. They contacted the people at the field and they stopped flying. So Im assuming the media just picked that up ran with it and have turned it into saying the pilots were right over the fire intentionally interfering.   I wasnt there so I dont know the truth either way. But they also dont present any evidence that they were hovering over the fire. The statements Ive seen from the firefighters just said they were nearby. The news helicopters obviously didnt have trouble flying in the same airspace and getting footage so if there were drones directly above the fire I would expect they would have some footage of them doing so.

You're assuming that the news choppers were there at the same time as the drones. Isn't it more reasonable that they, like the water bombers, hung back until the area was cleared and the okay given by the person in charge? In an emergency, news choppers are generally under the command of the authorities for exactly the same reason why drones should be banned."

technology,3du2b9,shortarmed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:28 2015 UTC,"A drone colliding with a helicopter blade, while there is a low chance of that occurring, can cause catastrophic failure of the helicopter blade, and subsequently will cause that helicopter to crash. It's unlikely that a drone could fly upwards into a blade, but it's much easier to assume that a drone could be flying above the emergency helicopter and get pulled downward into the blades. Then you have a very expensive emergency helicopter with several trained crew that has crashed into a goddamn fire. Helicopter crashes are not known for their survivability, especially not when crashing into a dangerous area.  Drones are tiny, very fast, but still have enough mass to take down a helicopter. Sure, the unrestricted airspace at low altitudes should generally be open for public use. However, a fire or other emergency situation should also take priority over ""hurr durr this is some cool footage"".   It's an extremely low risk scenario, but also an incredibly bad result if it does happen."

Today they are saying 5 drones. Smells like BS to me. Where are the pics and videos of these drones flying close to the forest fires? They don't exist.  I do think the fed will use these made up stores in the future to pass strict laws. The FAA is in the process of making laws so this will just help pass stricter laws.  The first drone ""story"" where it grounded fire aircraft was a few weeks ago during the Big Bear fire. That drone was reported at 11,000 feet (no home made or store bought drone can get near that height) and was orange and white. My guess is a government drone and there was a lack of communication between departments. Again no photos of it.

Even if it did I suspect the damage might require someone to check the rotors over when it lands but it wont take it out of the sky.  The wash from the helicopter rotors will keep the drones away unless someone aims specifically at the tail and even then would probably have to come in from a high angle.  I have not heard of bird strike being a major issue for helcopters. For large arcraft travelling at many hundreds of miles an hour, yes."

Then go read the specs (or test) a drone in those conditions. Finally, do a search for birds and helicopter crashes. Read the military study. The birds that cause this are moving faster than the drone can, at a chopper moving way faster than a fire copter, with twice the mass of the drone in a smaller surface area and crashing through the windshield, something a hobby drone simply cannot not do in those conditions, if at all."

I'm not comfortable with just giving a 15-20% tip no matter what the drive was like so that's a major problem.  2) when I bit the bullet and just decided to set it at 15% it didn't even work!

I run my CX bike on 700x40c or 35c tubeless (wire beads) with 2oz of OrangeSeal sealant. The rims are made for it and have Bontrager rim strips and valve stems installed.  I use 26""x4.6"" Specialized Ground Control tires at anywhere from 6-15 PSI on my Fatbike. I wrapped the rims with 4"" wide, 11 mil thick tape and double layered at the seams to make sure I had no air holes where sealant could get under the tape. I mounted the tires with Stan's valve stems, took the core out, aired up with a compressor to set the bead, drained, put 4oz of Orange Seal in each one, aired back up, and shook it a little.  The majority of the sealant sloshes around in the tire in case of a puncture, but a little of it sometimes is needed when mounting. Oddly enough, my non-tubeless-ready (fat bike) tape system didn't leak sealant when mounting initially, though my tubeless-ready rims needed a little at the rim seams to get it to seal up. A non-issue, but interesting at least.   Once you do it, you'll NEVER go back. Less rotational mass, VERY hard to get a ride-stopping flat unless you run way too low PSI for the terrain and burp air out, but even then you can typically just pump it back up. Tubes suck ass.

Current regulations mandate the existence of a high and low beam and ban any ""in-between"" settings. This effectively bans Adaptive Driving Beams which vary the pattern and intensity of illumination to maximize visibility and minimize impairment of other driver's vision.

The highways here in town range from about 65 to 85 mph (posted speed limit) with most being around 75.  http://www.txdot.gov/driver/laws/speed-limits/approved.html  In Houston, people drive about 80 mph on the beltway. I got pulled over for going about 85 in a 65 (actual speed limit). I asked at what speed they start actually looking to give out tickets and he said it's not until they cross the 80 mph hour mark.

She openly admits that ""it is true that there are more men than women applying for jobs and programs in Silicon Valley"". So, if you have 10 open positions, and 100 applicants apply, you hire the 10 best of them. If only 3 out of 10 are female, then, all other things being equal, you'll have 10 positions filled, 7 male and 3 female.   So women will be under-represented; the atmosphere will be of 7 guys around 3 girls, and trend towards the typical male atmosphere - dick jokes, talking about how hot the latest actress on the latest show is, etc.  This builds a culture that women then don't want to be a part of (Note 1); fewer women apply, the ratio goes closer to 10 to 1, and the male atmosphere gets louder and bolder.  ""Just hire women"" doesn't seem to do anything to fix this, unless you start to hire more women by skipping over better qualified men. If 1 in 10 applicants are really good for the job, then 7 out of 70 men will be good for the job, and 3 out of 30 women will be good for the job - you get 10 applicants that are best for the job, unless you start skipping over men in an effort to make the job atmosphere closer to 50:50.  I'm not seeing the fix here.  Note 1: I'm not saying this is OK. Work shouldn't be a ""boys only club"" and all men should stay professional at work and not say things that will isolate co-workers. I'm not saying make a safe haven out of every workplace, but keeping it professional stops a lot of the problem here."

technology,3du6pl,anthonyvardiz,3,Sun Jul 19 18:19:02 2015 UTC,"Long time DK2 owner here. All three will be reasonably decent quality options hardware-wise. The answer to the question for most people is ""Too early to tell, check back in six months"". The choice is less about the hardware itself, but what software will be ready for it at the time. Also, you need to either have or be willing to invest in a somewhat beefy desktop PC, or own a PS4 (for Morpheus).  Software will be in short supply at first, though there should be at least a few quality experiences ready for each unit. But I bet a lot of early buyers might run out of things to do. Personally I game regularly on my DK2 and am for sure getting the CV1, however I may pick up one or both of the others if there's some ""killer app"" that only the other models supports.  When Vive comes out in November, there won't be a lot of titles ready for it, and owning it early may be a little frustrating for non-devs. With Valve behind it, the library of compatible games will grow over time, but as of right now there's only a handful of VR-ready titles on Steam that may have widespread appeal.  By the time Oculus CV1 drops next spring, there will be more VR titles ready for both PC units. This would be a better time to make a choice as the final specs for both, pricing, and more options for games/software will mean a more educated choice.  Morpheus will likely be a great option if you have a PS4, provided the games turn out well, however its too early to tell yet how many titles or how good they will be, though this will likely be the easiest system to run. It will be the most affordable option if you have a PS4 already, and not a beefy desktop PC. The catch is you are locked into the few official PS4 titles, if you want to run weird indie stuff, specialty software or adult content, or create your own VR experiences in Unity/UE4, or experiment/play with with unofficial VR support hacked into older games, you will need a Rift or a Vive.  Vive is most likely initially to play well with Mac and Linux. Rift already quite a few decent titles developed on the dev kits which will be ready for CV1.   Vive and Oculus will require a pretty hefty desktop CPU and video card for reasonable performance, laptop owners will be disappointed.  Depending on how things play out, most ""major"" titles for the Rift/Vive may be usable on both, with only a few exclusives. It's just not yet time to be making this decision, check back in six months is the answer."

No. Many of the emails containing malicious software attachments originated from @stratfor email accounts. The context of these emails make it unlikely that the users knew what they were doing, for example as in the Hacking Team dump when their employees emailed malware packages to each other or their customers.

I want to know who is reading Wikileaks files because those people are journalists and activists who are pretty much the top of the food chain for online surveillance.  There are two very general methods of accomplishing this that I can think of. One is to track traffic on the website. I can do this using XKEYSCORE, ISP record seizures and route duplication or something similar (really I lump HUMINT methodologies like informants into this too, because they are going to give you access to monitoring the site). But what about really smart users who are taking all sorts of precautions; using VPN, using TOR, using additional proxy, using a secure browser or no ""browser"", etc. If I'm a government, those are the people I really really want to know about, because I am trying to 'collect it all' and people not using those methods have likely already been identified and tracked in a variety of other ways.  To identify those people the perfect methodology would be to insert tracking software into documents within a leak. I would include in my leak a bunch of documents that sound very official but dont really contain any material that has mission critical information. I would then get someone else to release that leak for me. Id make the malware look like something else. Id make it look kindof crappy; maybe Id make it look Chinese or Russian. After all it doesn't need to run in the background super-secret like Stuxnet. A lot of these smart people will just be using this computer to read these docs. It just needs to establish a network connection that I can track. Maybe it will load itself on a USB stick. Why waste a zero-day or something fancy on something like that?  I'm not saying that is what happened here. But what I am saying is that it could happen in the future, and here is a situation in which all of these red flags are hit and the overwhelming response has not been to think about these OPSEC problems and have a solid discussion about them but to try and argue why they are irrelevant, no big deal, or to discredit the person who found them.

There is the Linux group of OSes, which come in flavours like Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, and less well known ones like Redhat and Knoppix. Each is an individual OS in its own right, but they're all based on a fundamental Linux (which is just modified Unix) kernal.   Acting like anything Linux is automatically the best thing ever ignores the fact that shit like Canonical exists, and it's still affecting Linux-based OSes."
technology,3dq5y9,TranshumansFTW,5,Sat Jul 18 16:29:09 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. Time to drop some pointless pendanticism up in here. Mac OS X (only OS X btw, previous versions used their own, completely independent kernels) is not UNIX, but is UNIX-like (derived from BSD) and is certified as compliant with UNIX standards. Linux is also UNIX-like, but shares no code with UNIX, OS X, or BSD. And calling each distro of Linux (or GNU/Linux if you prefer, since I'm going to be as much of a pedantic prick as possible) its own OS is sort of a stretch when they all use the same kernel and software, its nothing more than a prebundled set of Linux-compatible software and configs. You could take an Ubuntu install and convert it into a Fedora install if you really wanted to.  And I would argue that even the worst Linux distros are FAR better than anything Microsoft has ever put out. Not that thats really a high standard to meet"

technology,3dq5wy,brennanfee,2,Sat Jul 18 17:29:46 2015 UTC,In what way does that invalidate the study?
technology,3dq5wy,r-cubed,12,Sat Jul 18 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"Numerous ways.  Firstly, 28 is not a sample size to demonstrate much of anything (with the possible exception that a further larger study should be constructed).    Secondly, Craigslist users doesn't represent an accurate cross section of society so the results may be skewed by that particular population.  For instance, perhaps people on Craigslist are disproportionately depressed and this is why their numbers came out the way they did and it had nothing to do with the phone data.  (That's why I called out the lack of a control.)  Thirdly, it seems to me they are using the laypersons definition of ""depression"" rather than the scientific one.  This makes me suspect at the outset.  Your ""mood"" has NOTHING TO DO with whether or not you are depressed.  Depression does effect your mood but it is not a two way street, it is in one direction only.  For instance, if you are not clinically depressed you will still have periods of bad moods.  Having periods of bad moods does not necessarily mean you are depressed.  The layperson definition of depression has gotten to prevalent and it is important to make distinctions in science.  People need to remember that just because a paper comes out with some seeming conclusion it isn't a scientific conclusion until it has been verified, re-tested, peer reviewed, etc.  This is just another example of shaky science being taken up by non-scientists in the media to make some sensationalist claim.  It may ""sell papers"", but that doesn't make it good science.  The results of a study are only as good as the methodologies and care taken when performing the study.  For instance, after more and expanded studies we may find the opposite is true and people who spend more time on their phones are actually better connected in society and merely using the phone as the way to facilitate those connections.  Who knows at this point.  TL;DR  More study is needed.  And especially more rigorous study."
technology,3dq5wy,brennanfee,6,Sat Jul 18 18:24:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply  First, a sample size of 28 is indeed small but is in no way useless. Particularly with large effect sizes (I understand that may not be central to this study in particular but I'm speaking more to the general point) and what analyses are used, it may be sufficient.   You are correct in that craigslist users may not represent an accurate representation of society. But again, we must keep in mind the point of the study. I didn't glean that the study was trying to be the definitive answer between the possible relationship between phone use and depression. In a descriptive cross-sectional study, available populations are useful to begin thinking about larger, more complicated designs. As we classify this as an epidemiologic descriptive study, it's a potential useful first step. The lack of a control, in this case, is not surprising--but you do have a varying level of exposure. Now you are correct about if the population has an outcome distribution that is biased, it's something to worry about--but again, I don't find that all too surprising given the pilot nature of the study.   For your third point, I am not an expert in the measure of depression so I do not feel qualified to comment.   Yes, people need to remember that published papers do not necessarily mean the research is good. However, I find it increasingly exasperating that people immediately look to sample size and parent population. Not to say they are not valid criticisms, at times they certainly are, but more so that people seem to rally behind these criticisms without thinking about the deeper implications. It's low hanging fruit (and again, sometimes, that's ok).   Coming full circle. I do not think the sample size and the source of participants invalidates this study, if the study was designed to explore questions within the bounds of the design. The authors themselves stated that this was a ""preliminary study"". Given this, I find your concluding statements curious. Further study to replicate the results (or not) are certainly warranted. It's a good first step, potentially next with a case control or even better. But that doesn't invalidate the original study.  Now what I fully agree with you on is the danger of sensationalist media coverage of small studies. I've had news published on my own studies that I've felt were missing the mark, and all it does is confuse the non-scientific community.  I appreciate your detailed comments, by the way. I am a professor of epidemiology, and like hearing these viewpoints."
technology,3dq5wy,r-cubed,5,Sat Jul 18 18:54:51 2015 UTC,"I completely concur regarding the ""pilot nature of the study"" and, like you, I completely agree that more study is warranted given the outcome.  My concern centers around OP's title and the article on the whole.  Both are purporting that these are conclusions from the study.  Most people don't understand the scientific method or the scientific process well enough to know that nothing, other than further study is warranted, can be concluded from this study.  It's sensationalist media - and we both agree that is dangerous.  You are correct that I over stated when I said the ""study is invalidated.""  More accurately I should have stated that the conclusion is invalidated or perhaps misleading.  That conclusion is just as likely as the opposite conclusion I posited (people spending more time are more connected with society).  So, I think we are in agreement.  Pleasure chatting with you."

This seems very fishy. Also, there's no mention in the time article this is based on of the title of the study...  Here is a page about the actual paper   ""Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥5) from those without (PHQ-9 score <5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants’ PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5%.

They should also be measuring the content that is being consumed, whether it be research journals, communication tools, social information, narratives, media, etc..

This means that the most happy, fulfilled people are people who take it upon themselves to take or do things despite what others think.

Your ISP, regional and national distribution hubs, etc.  If you go to a site using https:// in the url, it will use an encrypted version of http.  With https, no one but your PC and the website you are communicating can tell what you were sending.  It is also offers something like a guarantee that the website you are accessing is actually who you think it is and not some phishing site that hijacked your browser because there is a digital signature that only the real one can validate.  Make a habit out of checking for the https icon in your address bar any time you are logging in to a website, paying for something with a credit card, and especially doing online banking.  If you don't see the https where you would expect one, try putting it in and seeing whether the site still works.  But also keep in mind that not all websites support https.  Depending on what it is being used for and who the certificate is being registered through, getting a certificate can be expensive and a huge pain in the ass, so many sites, especially smaller ones and those who don't have anything to secure won't mess with it."

That said, at least you could make a case for (potentially) declining sales numbers.  What surprises me is that this blog post was written today, several days after IDC's numbers challenged the Slice estimates and took their methodology to task.  Here's some more information on that.   Slice Intelligence’s data, released last week, is not an accurate depiction of overall global supply and demand, according to IDC. Slice measured online Apple Watch sales in the U.S.  “We’ve been talking to the supply chain and talking to other analysts, from everything we hear sales are going up, not down,” Jitesh Ubrani, a wearables analyst at IDC, told FoxNews.com, referring to the group of suppliers that build components for the Watch.  [..] “Knowing Slice's methodology and the fact that sales really started to slide at the approximate moment Apple added in-store purchases, it is really hard to come to any other conclusion,” Stephen Baker, vice president, industry analysis at the NPD Group, told FoxNews.com in an email. “The acceleration in the decline is likely the result of a lot of potential Watch buyers moving into the store from being forced to complete the transaction on online,” he said.  Slice’s Agarwal agrees. “It’s a sign that the mass market, which is now buying these devices, is a little more cautious. [Those consumers] want to touch, feel, and play with the Watch,” Agarwal said. Both IDC and Slice made the point that the sales surge after online preorders began on April 10 likely represented early-adopters – not necessarily the mass market.   Was the author simply not aware of the actual market authority having weighed in, and Slice even acknowledging the discrepancy?"

Nobody ever says shoplifters face seven years in jail, yet this is the law which applies to the lowliest shoplifter. The ""10 years"" figure is a legislative maximum, which will probably never be applied.  The offence can also be dealt with summarily (in the Magistrates' Court), where the absolute maximum term of imprisonment would be one year (multiple offences, no guilty plea, no mitigating factors).  Realistically, only large scale distributors will be prosecuted. The police don't have the time to deal with wee Johnny who seeds the odd episode of Adventure Time, the prosecutors won't give a fuck, the judiciary will care even less, the legal aid bill can't take it, and the prisons sure as fuck can't take any more non-violent inmates."

Waiting for that release is a big risk (for example, the free newspaper Metro spoiled the Red Wedding the day after it broadcast in the U.S., and I've had numerous S5 events spoiled to me via Twitter this year).  There is no price you can pay to watch this show unspoiled the way it was meant to if you can't get Sky, and this is just one example. The fact is, monopoly media companies (and that's exactly what they are; look no further than US cable internet prices if you don't believe me) don't want to offer consumer choice, because cartel pricing is so much more profitable.

Pirating has decreased due to these new services, but until all content is available everywhere for reasonable prices piracy will continue.  Formula 1 is a good example, some countries simply don't have it available to them on TV or any online service, others such as the UK have a monopoly by Sky who would charge you over £40 per month for access to the full season, while in other countries it's entirely free.

It's thanks to people like you that allows copyright advocates to set such harsh punishments in the first place.   It's not stealing. DeviantART, you know, that popular art site where people upload art and art, has done a nice piece on it to clarify the confusion, because idiots like you keep spreading false information: ""Stealing an object is theft. Using artwork without permission isn’t technically a “theft.” It might be copyright infringement or violate a contract.""  And if you don't like this simple explanation of the actual meaning of the word, you can just refer to this Judge statement that still stands to this very day:   ""Copyright holders frequently refer to copyright infringement as theft. In copyright law, infringement does not refer to theft of physical objects that take away the owner's possession, but an instance where a person exercises one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder without authorization.[12] Courts have distinguished between copyright infringement and theft. For instance, the United States Supreme Court held in Dowling v. United States (1985) that bootleg phonorecords did not constitute stolen property. Instead, ""interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft, conversion, or fraud. The Copyright Act even employs a separate term of art to define one who misappropriates a copyright: '[...] an infringer of the copyright.'"" The court said that in the case of copyright infringement, the province guaranteed to the copyright holder by copyright law—certain exclusive rights—is invaded, but no control, physical or otherwise, is taken over the copyright, nor is the copyright holder wholly deprived of using the copyrighted work or exercising the exclusive rights held.[1]""  So, to summarize:   Theft: Depriving the owner of an item for an indefinite time. Copyright infringement: Copying information protected by copyright without prior permission by the rightsholder.   Furthermore, copying (and by extend, copyright infringement) and theft cannot physically be done at the same time. You can't transfer information (theft, movement of information in the physical sense of the word) and copy that same information at the same time. It's impossible. The two terms are also mutually exclusive: Copying makes a copy, leaving the original intact, while stealing deprives the owner of the information. That is a crucial difference you have to understand if you wish to be taken seriously in such discussions.  There is nothing wrong with rationalization. It doesn't mean what you think it means, it doesn't mean making it a good thing. And to certain extend (mainly for corporate infringement) I agree that piracy is wrong. However, just because you think theft is wrong and piracy is wrong, doesn't mean they're the same thing. Theft is closer to murder than copyright infringement is to theft, from a logical standpoint. And that's rationalization: Explaining shit without necessarily judging the moral values of that shit."

There is a very clear moral line. One does no harm and the other does.  Besides, the claims that it hurts profits is pretty bullshit anyways. Here are some sources.

Because many pirates who would not give a damn about ever buying your product, now may have enjoyed something they wouldn't have otherwise, and are now sharing that information with people they know. Many of whom would buy it. It's like a more extreme version of Steam sales. The loss of profit directly related to the price drops is recovered and then some by the amount of sales to people who now want to buy something they didn't care about before. This entire backlash against piracy is made up by dam builders who refuse to stop trying to slow progress and change. Especially when it seems counter intuitive. The will of people to share things that make them happy with as little hoops to jump through as possible will always win out against draconian laws.

technology,3dq3my,fuelter,2,Sat Jul 18 13:46:17 2015 UTC,"Chain of evidence is pretty solid with torrents:  You download something via torrent which gives the media company your IP and the time-stamp it happens (as the media companies pay anti-piracy companies to use dummy torrent clients that basically just collect the IP and timestamp of every user that downloads the torrent).  Media company then gets the user subpoenaed from the VPN company (getting your payment details (containing your name, address etc), original connecting IP, etc).  If the payment details don't lead back to you, your original connecting IP will lead back to your ISP. Your ISP is then subpoenaed for information of which of their customers was connected using that IP at that time on their system.  You could try using throwaway payment details to pay for the VPN and use proxies or other VPNs to pay for/use the VPN in the first place, but there's lots of ways you can slip up."
technology,3dq3my,Enverex,5,Sat Jul 18 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"It's not that simple. The VPN will never give out personal information to a private (media) company. They will only comply to a court of law. Secondly many VPN don't log who was asigned which IP, again unless ordered so by a court. A court is very unlikely to do so just because of a minor copyright infringement.  So unless you plan to ""commercially"" infringe on copyright on a large scale you are pretty much fine.

The real problemis allowing the execution of arbitrary code within a separate container. Practically the same problem as ActiveX in general.  Most exploits consist of standard hacks and stack overflow attacks with specially crafted ActionScript bytecode, allowing say an ActionScript string variable to be executed directly, allowing that code to run at the privilege level of the browser with all the same capabilities, effectively escaping the browser sandbox and allowing it to do things like write and launch other executables.  These sorts of exploits appear in Javascript occasionally, as well, but browser JS interpreters tend to be far more robust. Considering most browsers separated their plugins into a separate process almost entirely because Flash crashed so constantly, ""reliability"" is not the first word I think of to describe Adobe."

It's a fair point, but the simple answer to that question is yes.   do you have numbers to back that claim up?   We build dams and other means of collecting water and there is always an impact. We usually study what that impact will be for the long term specifically because of times in the past where we seriously messed up an ecology.   I'm pretty sure a country capable of creating solar power is also capable of making dams and other means of collecting water(like canals) and studying what the impact will be.  but even if they weren't, the water is still part of the water cycle even if it doesn't evaporate before it reaches the random house in India."

These open-top buses are double decker buses with partially or fully open upper deck allows passengers to enjoy city sightseeing comfortably. London buses are the subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL) that manages bus services in the London City.   The open-top buses are privately owned buses by tour companies. They're not normal buses, and are not owned or operated by TFL. You pay around £30 for a ticket on the bus which will go on a specific route that shows you landmarks, with a staff member pointing them out and telling you a bit of background information about it."

""Ludicrous Speed"" is already on par with the Lamborghini Gallardo, and beats a bunch of Ferraris and McLarens, and makes other luxury cars look slow.  Tesla has technology on its side as battery technology is rapidly improving, and internal combustion engines haven't changed much in many decades.  Layered graphene cathodes are on the horizon, which increase capacity and charge/discharge times.  Most promisingly, the price per kWh of batteries has been cut in half every seven years.  Electric vehicles already match and beat the performance of high-end gas-powered cars at a similar price point, and it's likely a matter of time before they are competitive with low end combustion-powered vehicles.   Edit: Yes, I was wrong and misinformed to assert that combustion engine efficiency hasn't changed much in decades.  It turns out that direct fuel injection and other technologies have increased engine efficiency significantly since 2005.  But, the average engine efficiency is still around 18-20%, and there is a very hard thermodynamic limit of 35% efficiency that requires a large temperature difference."
technology,3dnk5a,Fauster,80,Sat Jul 18 00:33:00 2015 UTC,To say ICE have changed much in many decades is just plain false. Look at the power output and emissions of a top end in ging from the late 70s to early 80s compared to to modern engine.  Even leaving out forced induction engines a modern V6 in your family sedan makes 50 to a 70 percent more power then a 70s era V8 with a third less displacement. It does all that with much greater fuel efficiency and emissions levels that aren't even on the same chart compared to the 70s version.

In a straight line up to about 115mph, after that anything high end exotic is going to leave a tesla in the dust. On a track Teslas are really slow compared to their rivals due to overheating of batteries. They are hardly true performance cars and are more akin to straight line muscle cars of the 70s. Maybe once they can make an electric car that can actually hold up to a base 911 around a track will they become an actual performance car."

technology,3dnk5a,MichaelArnold,152,Sat Jul 18 01:37:00 2015 UTC,"Full text:  Tesla CEO Elon Musk just announced the most Tesla thing ever: a ""Ludicrous Speed"" upgrade for the top-of-the-line P85D Model S electric sedan that improves 0-60 time by 10 percent — it's down to 2.8 seconds, with a quarter-mile sprint coming in just 10.9 seconds. Tesla also promises a run to 155 miles per hour some 20 percent faster than on a standard P85D. In follow-up questions, Musk said that the upcoming Model X would also have Ludicrous Speed as an option, but due to the vehicle's weight — it's 10 percent heavier than the S — it'll likely be a bit less quick.  Ludicrous Speed doesn't come cheap, though: it's a $10,000 option for the car, so you really need to want to be pressed into the back of your seat. Musk describes the acceleration as ""faster than falling,"" which is true — with the accelerator mashed to the floor, you're getting 1.1 G of force.  The hold music before today's press conference call was a single Ludacris song on loop, which now makes a lot of sense. There weren't any direct references to Spaceballs, but Musk is known for his sense of humor: the Model S's radio volume goes to 11, for instance."

A healthy capitalism has always been a society of independent economic actors.  The thesis of the article is that because the cost to transmit and store information is now nearly free, it is destroying capitalism, and the article gives the example that the sharing economy is ""post-capitalist"". In fact, it is the opposite - peer-to-peer economic transactions is a capitalist utopia envisioned by Coase, who posited that it was transaction costs that prevented it. The Internet lowers transaction costs like never before. The sharing economy is the capitalist economy; the jobs economy was the corporatist economy. The capitalist economy is the post-corporatist economy.  And just because information is cheap, not everything else is - land and energy, and their fruits, food, water, shelter and clothing.

Again, the free market is no utopia -- families will be smaller than some desire, some will never have the resources to marry at all, many will suffer homelessness and worse. But the horror of forced abortions is averted.  Edit: As to whether anything will help the coming mass unemployment caused by automation, to be followed later by the singularity, I don't see anything that will. I don't see how the free market that works when labor is still needed can work in an era of mass automation. And the most commonly proposed solution, ""basic income"", is really just communism and will lead to forced abortions.

technology,3dpzh5,michaelmalak,3,Sat Jul 18 15:55:22 2015 UTC,please explain how basic income leads to forced abortions. You simply don't provide people with unlimited income to raise a family.   The fact that all children will receive basic income as adults doesn't mean that you have to provide it to their parents. Say you get money to help raise 3 unless you take on displaced or orphaned kids.   This acts as a limiting factor in the same way lack of money already does. Most given a choice restrict themselves to a moderate number of kids to devote a decent amount of resources to each.   Given this restriction basic income requires no draconian measures.

It's always been an unnecessary evil, a symptom of lack of control over reproductive capabilities rather than population control. I'm not completely discounting what happened in communist China, but birth control methods significantly improved since then. Universal access to birth control doesn't prevent overpopulation, but it definitely shifts the balance.   I think it might eventually be necessary to apply/pay for a permit to have a kid, with worse penalties for not doing so. I see forced sterilization earlier on the dark-future timeline. I think capitalism has some generally immoral motivations but I think it a combination that kind of combination approach would be much better."

It's a naked use of power over others. A small group has a resource (e.g. army, law, god) that allows them to dictate what the majority does. That's why democracies and republics are the healthiest choices for government. They are more apt to fend off power concentrating strains of economic policy. Capitalism in its most unregulated form dictates that those who have the advantage (e.g. most resources) are those that have the power. In a democracy or republic the people of the state, or company, or kingdom, have a piece of the power. Now a democracy or republic could decide that communism is the policy for them. Unfortunately, capitalism, being the natural law of economy, will always undermine that system. ""I like my hammer, but yours in newer. I like yours more."" Biology relies on need and desire versus access. Demand and supply. How a society approaches that question is called economic policy. Capitalism as policy is simply an acceptance and understanding of the natural law. We make and acquire things and hope we make and acquire enough for those we care about and for ourselves.

Their web ad business will pale in comparison.  Imagine nearly every US citizen's daily commute in an ad-powered car...  It would take some time to get them on the streets, but that's the kind of thing Google could push through.  Assuming Google doesn't monopolize local transportation, self driving capabilities could also quickly (~15 years) become required in all cars on the road since they are so effective at reducing accidents.  Non-self-driving cars might also be outlawed, there are ~30,000 deaths per year (not to mention 2.3 million injuries and $242 billion in costs from ~5,700,000 police-reported accidents) due to car accidents in the US.  That's nearly 3 times the 2014 Ebola outbreak death toll, every year.  The decision would be highly controversial, but the benefits are so massive that (IMHO) it's not at all unlikely."

technology,3drtix,smoke_and_spark,-2,Sun Jul 19 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"ok. Here is one example of what self driving cars are up against.  The leading innovator of these cars right now seems to be google, so lets look at thier.  In order for them to navigate, they rely on 3 dimensional maps of where ever they are going. They are maps of the streets, street lights , stop signs, driveways, lane markings..ect.   Cars are dedicated to creating these maps. They drive around Mountain View and map out these roads. The data gets downloaded and every part of them gets scanned by computers and humans to make sure every inch the car is going to go wont run into problems (though they still do). These self-driving cars cannot go anywhere without these downloaded maps btw.   So, in order for these cars to be able to operate throughout the country, we'd need to map 5 million miles of public roads like this. The 700k miles google has run their self-driving cars? All done on a few hundred miles that they have very painstakingly mapped. I don't mean googlemap or google earth or whatnot. These few hundred miles they have mapped has taken a LOT of work.  Now, take into account a stop sign recently added? A utility or whoever plants stop signs has to call google, and google would have to send out a mapping car to map that stop sign. This would be done every day as crosswalks and other changes in roadways happen all of the time. One missed light or stop sign could cause a lot of accidents if a lot of people were driving these things.   That is just ONE problem with this google car. They also can't tell the difference between a crumbled news paper and a large rock and can'teven read a traffic light if the sun is in the wrong place.   General awareness, situational awareness, common sense. Computers need to evolve in a way that tackles these types of intelligence before we can even dream of such a car.   I'm sorry to be a Debbie Downer on this technology, but I think we need to have some practicality in this sub as well."
technology,3drtix,zootam,0,Sun Jul 19 05:05:29 2015 UTC,"These self-driving cars cannot go anywhere without these downloaded maps btw.   This isn't true. the car uses gps (and yes, some existing maps) and a combination of sensors to basically map the area on all sides on the fly on a level that is actually much more thorough, complex, and situationally aware than most drivers.   The 700k miles google has run their self-driving cars?    you're looking at an article from last year. They are up over 1 million now   All done on a few hundred miles that they have very painstakingly mapped. I don't mean googlemap or google earth or whatnot. These few hundred miles they have mapped has taken a LOT of work.   And nope, thats not how it works.   Now, take into account a stop sign recently added? A utility or whoever plants stop signs has to call google, and google would have to send out a mapping car to map that stop sign. This would be done every day as crosswalks and other changes in roadways happen all of the time. One missed light or stop sign could cause a lot of accidents if a lot of people were driving these things.   Once again, that is not how the tech works. Watch this video. it can definitely see a stop sign and all dynamic road conditions (light changes, pedestrians, cyclists, etc..) IMO it does a better job than most drivers.  At 9:48 it shows a school bus deploying a stop sign, and the car sees it if you have any doubts.........  FFS at 11:16 you see they encountered a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a DUCK in the street... and they could handle it....    I'm sorry to be a Debbie Downer on this technology, but I think we need to have some practicality in this sub as well.   I'm sorry to be a debbie downer to you, but I think you need to learn more about the current state of the technology, and how fast it is improving before passing judgment.  I think we need some knowledge and facts in this sub as well."

That doesn't read the stop signs though despite what Chris Urmson is saying. That's the mapped road and only that now, and these maps are not going to be made on our 4m miles of public roads any time soon  This video are the best case scenarios, and that's fine. There is no mention of the cars stopping for a newspaper on the ground, or not being able to drive in snow, or not recognizing pot holes, or not seeing police officers waving you onto a different lane, or even making a left turn only a higher speed of traffic.   I am all for self driving cars, but these are very tough solutions that will likely take many years to overcome. Just mapping out our public road ways will take many many years."

technology,3dq9pv,exorbitantwealth,22,Sat Jul 18 15:44:50 2015 UTC,Because its barely profitable. Thats why nvidia didnt even want to make chips for the console market in the first place.
technology,3dq9pv,88omega,16,Sat Jul 18 15:49:53 2015 UTC,nVidia didn't make them because they don't have an x86 license from Intel to build a CPU with an integrated GPU.
technology,3dq9pv,cbmuser,3,Sat Jul 18 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"Whew concerned me for a moment, I thought x86 was completely proprietary and tried to figure out how there were so many clone chips (including AMD's K5/K6) early on, but it looks like Intel patented some of their later extensions like SSE3 and licenses them. I think they ""traded"" with AMD; so AMD can use/support the extensions in their processors/APUs, and Intel can use AMD64.  Of course Nvidia couldn't make a very useful console processor without either AMD64 or Intel's proprietary x86 extensions."
technology,3dq9pv,BCProgramming,3,Sun Jul 19 00:10:14 2015 UTC,"I think this generation is the first one that is using x86, hey used to be mips or power architecture. Even the Xbox was some power based proc"

technology,3dq9pv,PhoenixEnigma,2,Sun Jul 19 01:02:08 2015 UTC,"How many chips are they making for computers or phones? Intel and ARM own those businesses. The only thing AMD really have going for itself, sales wise, is current gen consoles."

I'd imagine that a huge chunk of AMD's revenue is going to R&D in an attempt to play catch up with Intel.

technology,3dq9pv,MrNagant,2,Sun Jul 19 06:18:55 2015 UTC,"You'd think profits would be a bit higher, but that would be if AMD had the chips manufactured and sold the chips.  APU combo in two high selling consoles and then a GPU in a low selling console.  That is millions of units that is the most expensive item in these consoles.  Sadly, I think AMD is just licensing out the chips, which there isn't a whole lot of money in licensing.  Look at ARM Holdings revenue.  AMDs revenue is almost 5x theres.  There isn't money in licensing but what is there can be highly profitable.   Nintendo could surprise us all again with something crazy.  I expect AMD again for the GPU.  Makes sense to go AMD so they can have a reduced cost all in one SoC.  Shit, would be awesome if they did an AMD APU with 8GB of HBM.  The console would just be a big heatsink, lol."

technology,3dn8f4,ex_ample,9,Sat Jul 18 02:00:19 2015 UTC,The U.S. government hasn't done a good job of anticipating and taking measures to protect against evolving espionage threats as they relate to information systems.  Both the Snowden leaks and the OPM hack are two sides of the same coin.  The OPM hack was a massive security failure that a (more than likely) foreign intelligence service was able to exploit to gain extensive information on U.S. government employees.  Snowden was closer to a classic case of espionage--taking classified files out of a secured environment and sharing them--but instead of sneaking a few things out here and there he was able to amass a massive trove of digital files due to poor internal IT policy and insufficient compartmentalization.
technology,3dn8f4,fatbottomedgirls,6,Sat Jul 18 07:34:56 2015 UTC,"Well someone made a huge mistake by entrusting the Office of Personnel Management - a bureaucratic organization that is not part of the Defense Department or the Intelligence Community - with this vital security task in the first place.  If you listened to any of the Congressional hearings, it's pretty clear that no one in the top levels of OPM had any clue about IT or computer security. The OPM head kept blaming ""antiquated systems"" but the system that got hacked in the second breach was actually developed in the early 2000s - a timeframe at which they should have been looking at two-factor authentication, encryption of their databases, segmentation of data to preclude on giant spill, intrusion detection systems, etc. The DoD has used two-factor authentication for access to its IT systems for at least a decade."

Secure systems need to be designed to be secure from the ground up, by people who know what they're doing.   You need people with IT and security understanding in management positions or else morons are going to get hoodwinked by slick sales pitches for garbage code.   You can spend more money or you can spend less money and perhaps keep things on paper rather then doing everything online."
technology,3dn8f4,ex_ample,2,Sat Jul 18 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"Folks tend to blame the network and security operations guys (because the generic IT dudes really shouldn't be handling that level of security protocols).... But you can have the best in the business, and if they don't have the money and the equipment required it doesn't mean squat.   That lesson is learned every day in the private sector, where managers are trying to protect their networks with an underfunded budget. The government works the same way. ""I need this gear to do this job, and it's gonna cost this much."" And then watch the appropriations not happen.   And if you don't believe that, talk to someone who does military pen testing. It's not as tight as you hope because of lax behavior by NON computer folks, and dated equipment."
technology,3dn8f4,evilrobert,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:37:18 2015 UTC,"(because the generic IT dudes really shouldn't be handling that level of security protocols)   That's the kind of thinking that leads to security fuckups.  If you want to be secure, you really need all your IT guys thinking about security all the time.    Otherwise they solve problems in insecure ways.  Like if facilities people fixed broken locks with duct tape.   where managers are trying to protect their networks with an underfunded budget.   See that's looking at it the wrong way.  Rather then trying to ""secure a network"" they shouldn't be building insecure networks in the first place.   So lets take an example from this very hack.  They had an online system designed to let people fill out forms online. Lets say they spent $X to build it.  You're thinking they might have spent $Y to ""secure it"", for a total cost of $X+$Y.    But another option would to have simply not done at all and spent $0. Maybe it's a bit of a pain for applicants but I'm sure most of them would have preferred having had to do it on paper in retrospect.   That isn't to say you couldn't have done it in a secure way. The problem, though, is figuring out which programmers actually know how to do it securely and which don't. You can't tell if an app is ""secure"" just by looking at it unless you're a security expert yourself.   Corporate IT culture just isn't setup to do this kind of thing properly."

That is an internal funding issue, because the people towards the top of the agency's food chain didn't want to buy the hardware required for the job.

The real problem is the systems are managed by people who don't know shit about IT.  Salespeople come in and say their systems are the greatest, their programmers are the greatest, etc.  But they don't have any real way of evaluating that.   You also have the ""tiger repelling rock"" situation.  Someone can come in, charge you a ton of money, and say your shit is secure - and if no one hacks you you'll never know if that's true.

technology,3dma0b,superm8n,6,Fri Jul 17 21:58:52 2015 UTC,Space exploration seems as good a place as any to fund research because it's important to the survival of humanity that we get off this rock.   On what time scale do you think the rock escape will be required? Is this to avoid the expansion of the sun into reg giant stage? That is at least a few billion years away.  If we are escaping some other self induced calamity then it is somewhat arguable that money spent directly solving those problems might be more efficient.  I am a fan of space exploration and if there was a way I could direct my taxes that way I would. But I think the survival argument has a shaky foundation.
technology,3dma0b,scubascratch,3,Fri Jul 17 20:54:50 2015 UTC,"Terribly inefficient?  I totally disagree.  Space exploration pushes the boundaries of technology, design, research, and engineering.

Not that it was perfect, but investment into ourselves as a species, in our cleverness, in provable, repeatable processes; science and engineering, we can certainly win.

At its most distant, Pluto lies 4.67 billion miles from Earth. At their closest, the two are 2.66 billion miles apart.  Lets just say 3 billion miles.  3,000,000,000 miles / 83,090 hours = 36,105 mph  (miles per hour). Wow! That's about 10 miles every second!  If we drove 3bn miles at 100 mph getting 25 miles per gallon, It would take 3,424 years to get there, require 120 million gallons of gas, and at $4 per gallon, cost $480 million in fuel alone."

What does that mean? That one is more valuable than the other? I'm sure the Mona Lisa doesn't bring in the same revenue as the movie, but I would say that the Mona Lisa has had a much bigger impact on society. And the value of the materials of the painting certainly isn't worth 100 Million, so should Da Vinci have used more expensive paints to increase the value of the painting? No, and the New Horizons didn't necessarily need more expensive parts. It had pretty much the top of the line hardware at the time. More money does not always mean a better machine. There is a certain diminishing return on value for each extra dollar spent. Also, the NASA budget is 18.4 billion dollars annually. The New Horizons mission is only a tiny portion of that.  In short, people need to understand that money is not the bottle neck with NASA. There are a finite number of people who can design projects like this. There are a finite number of engineering firms that can build the hardware."

Wants versus needs are the real discussion here I think. As a species we have accomplished incredible things. We've modernized our planet to fit our needs and we have built a habitat wherein our species can survive and thrive and grow, sometimes seeming endless in the bounds of incredible adversity and strife. Yet it all depends on, and is make or break on the concept of money.   We consistently ignore the needs of the many with the thinly veiled argument that everything costs something. Cost is relative and when it's concerning our knowledge, and the vast array of things we still do not know, we keep trying to justify the cost of something that is priceless to actually know. If we could unite as a species and give ourselves a future that is filled with the adventure and excitement of ever-expanding knowledge, and less on the trivial needs of a consumerist culture we keep perpetuating, maybe, just maybe we could actually make our world a better place.  TL;DR IF WE STOP FOCUSING ON HOW MUCH STUFF COSTS, INSTEAD FOCUSING ON WHY IT MUST BE DONE FOR THE LONG TERM BETTERMENT OF HUMANITY IS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST"

technology,3dmdh4,kayGrim,7,Fri Jul 17 22:46:31 2015 UTC,When you open the client you connect to a bunch of users that are also running the client. These other nodes let you know what posts there are on the network. Once you know what there is you can start asking for other nodes to send you the posts and they are stored on your computer locally in a database.   When you make a post you send it to all of the nodes you are connected to and they send it on to the nodes they are connected to and this continues until everyone has a copy of your post (Once you send it you can never take it back). Because of this there is no way to tell who wrote a post. You cant tell if someone sending you a post wrote it or is just forwarding it from another user. This makes aether in theory anonymous. Posts on aether are currently set to last 6 months so after that time the network will stop sending them around and only users that have them will be able to see them. This is not set in stone and could be changed in the future.  Because of the way aether works its impossible to remove a post. Just like how you cant remove a file from bittorrent. As long as one user still has the post then it will still be available making aether 100% resistant to censorship    There are a few problems with the current client/protocol though.  Right now the client has problems finding other users and even connecting to them once it finds them. This can make keeping your posts list up to date a little hard. This is getting fixed. The protocol for aether is getting switched from AMP to HTTP which should help with some problems.  Also there is no way to register a user name right now on aether which means 20 people could be using the same name. Its planned in the future that there will be an optional way to register your username.  There is also no way to stop spam. Spam hasnt been to bad on aether because it has a small user base but there are no ways to stop someone spamming everything and ruining aether. Some ideas are going around about how to solve this problem one way being Proof of work  If you have any other questions about how aether works I would be happy to answer them

After you've downloaded the client, you connect to a few nodes that will send you the boards and the posts. Text only. Because it's decentralised, you can't be sure whether a board exists or not before stumbling onto it, so there are lots of duplicates, and I haven't found many active boards. I really wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for an alternative right now, but you could check in every few weeks/months to see how viable it's become.

You can see that users reported two (now banned) jailbait subs which had young teens and that the content was illegal. Here's a post in which some users posit that, since those subs were virtually being spammed with illegal content, they thought it must have been a false flag campaign to wanted the subs banned--purely because there was so much illegal content. I didn't want to go verify it myself because I don't need my history/temp files/whatever to show naked little girls.   I was a user all the way through that.

Somewhere there's a great video of the guy who created Something Awful talking to a college class about how folks group together, particularly in their own private little groups, and everyone gets to think their own perversions and preferences are the norm. This site has some great sections, it has some not so great sections (according to some but not to others), and then there's some sections that should go because they're not at all protected under free speech. If FPH stuck to just talking shit about fat people, you'd have no excuse but hurt feelings for not liking it. If it was hidden from the general populace, like a lot of subreddits should be, you'd have a happy (with itself) user base that can generate a profit (somehow).

This rule was introduced only a month ago to throttle troll account.   If you post unpopular comments on voat and they get 'downvoated' your account gets throttled.

Perhaps I just want to shame people for not living up to my standards, is that so wrong? Additionally I've always wanted a public forum where I can get advice on how to hide drugs, purchase and kill prostitutes, and steal cars, as these are all expressions of my core beliefs.  Reddit's new policies are oppressing me and people like me.  Finally, I've long been upset at the lack of CP on reddit.  What kind of nazi would censor a person's sexual preferences? These are all things I hope I can find on Voat.  /s  In all seriousness, whether or not you agree with some, or even all, of the new content policies, are you going to miss the censored material so much that you want to go hang out with the people who got kicked out?"

For anyone looking for some alternatives other than Voat:  Snapzu - Excellent content and community. XP leveling system instead of karma adds a sense of progress. Other cool unique features.  The Needs - Good content but a lot of it looks automated, possibly using bots. No discussion so you lose a lot of that community feel.  Hubski - Classic alternative, been kicking it around for 4-5 years, but still little activity. Community is small but nice.  Spreadit - A dark themed reddit alternative that is similar to reddit and easy to use. Content and community is lacking however.  Stacksity - Looks like 9gag but has decent content and links. Needs more users.  Empeopled - Gives you more influence based on the amount of up-votes you've received. Use influence to steer future of the site.  Hacker News - Another old school place for tech and business talk. Also has some programming and other discussions.  Many on this list courtesy of /r/redditalternatives"
technology,3dmdh4,Goronmon,3,Sat Jul 18 09:57:41 2015 UTC,"I liked Snapzu at first, but I'm starting to see the problems with the way things are structured. Since crossposting is easy, it feels like the individual tribes (aka subreddits) don't matter as much. This is emphasized by a voting system that tracks votes separately from a meta level (voting on something on your frontpage is a separate vote than on any specific tribe).  So, basically, Snapzu is great if you want a 'better' /r/all, but it's sub-optimal if you are looking for site with discrete communities."

The web was restricted after mobile phones and plug-in-less HTML5 locked everyone into the whims of vendors who all have competing native platforms with better UX and functionality.

Historical awareness was restricted when search engines and social media alike started chasing up-to-date news, directly favoring newness over accuracy.

But really, why should anyone be crying over antiquated technologies deprecated in favor of better solutions?   NAT in the way? Use Hamachi, Evolve, Tunngle, OpenVPN or any other free VPN software to create a virtual network with trusted peers. Or use WebRTC enabled browser applications or any other software supporting STUN like capabilities. There are myriad solutions for NAT traversal that allow software to work behind the relative security of users' private walled gardens. HTML5 replaced insecure, buggy plugins. By working together to create open standards browser vendors created a powerful environment unrestricted by cross platform incompatibility and vendor lock in. ActiveX, Flash, Shockwave, Silverlight, and Java widgets were all notoriously buggy, bloated, insecure solutions for creating rich media. In fact flash had a zero-day exploit as recently as this week. There is no possible way that Google, whose entire business model relies on the success of the web, would hobble it to sell phones. Even if Apple crippled their own browser no one uses it anyway.  Even with the recent Reddit purge there are still plenty of places to discuss distasteful things. Or try searching for controversial political opinions, hate groups, gore, or whatever on Twitter, Tumblr, *chan, or any other social platform. Online communities are overflowing with uncopyrighted, shared, edited, and re-shared material. Fan art and fiction, remixed music, derivative videos... Here are 1,272 rare pepes and a virtually endless supply of obscure music to get you started. Under google's search tools you can select any time range you like. And historical information curated by professional volunteers in wikipedia is far more accessible than trying to dig through news articles of varying quality and the dead mountain of chatter left over from events in recent history. If you want psuedo-anonymity use TOR or host your own mail server or fire up a proxy on some foreign cloud computing platform and use high grade encryption. So what if you can't be anonymous on Facebook or LinkedIn... that would sort of defeat the point anyway. With a free email account from any of the thousands of providers you can still be anonymous on Twitter, Pinterest, *chan, Reddit, Tumblr, Instagram, Vine, and countless other less popular social platforms...

Consequently, they can easily get frustrated by coding challenges they didn’t specifically learn about in their courses, or may solve them with bloated code instead of fresh solutions.

I can't even imagine texting and driving, I'd probably drive off a bridge on to the freeway below.  A lot of people don't check their blindspot and that's bad enough.

technology,3dl167,ketsuban25,154,Fri Jul 17 06:28:31 2015 UTC,You wanna know a trick I picked up. Yuur side mirrors point them a bit down and way out. Your side mirrors are there to cover your blind spots but most people don't use them right.  I point them down to keep glare and other lights out of my eyes when I look in them. Pointing them out so you can just slightly see the side of your car gives you the most visibility. I am 33 and never been in an accident that was my fault. The only ones I been in was where a guy ran a red light and there as about a half inch of ice on the road....nothing I could really do but hold on.  Blinds pots will happen...I have found it helpful to figure out where I can put my mirrors to remove those blind spots. Tilting them down and out helps.

Cars passing me begin to appear in my side view just as they start to leave my rear view. With them that far out, I can see the entire remainder of my blind spot with my peripheral vision when my head is turned to face my side mirror.

Everyone who drives my cars adjusts the mirrors to what I consider to be the ""wrong"" position, because they are making sure they can see like half of their car in the mirror, for frame of reference of the view I guess.  When I adjust my mirrors, I adjust them so that my car is just barely out of sight of the view, so when you look you actually can't see any of my car."

Do you think a driverless car will have some sort of ability to override itself to save the passengers life? For instance, someone could be drunk at night out for a joyride, speeding to their drunken little hearts content, let's say 60-70mph and they're coming up to an unexpected stop sign that you are currently at inside of the driverless car. Would the car sense the impending danger and slam on the gas and swerve out of the way to save your life? How smart are these things?   Do you think using these cars as a taxi service that you can pay for using your phone/card/watch would possibly be in our future? Like the Johnny Cabs in Total Recall or something.

However, if the approaching car was not visible I doubt there is much left do to.  In the future, I think virtually all cars will have autonomous driving that oversees the driver and steps in if the driver is careless. In this way people can still enjoy driving if they wish, but they are protected from doing crazy stuff. So in that case the drunk driver would be prevented from blasting through the stop sign in the first place.  Many cars already have this type of safetly technology to avoid collisions (Volvo, Mercedes, etc ) but it is AFAIK limited to braking, not steering."

Sabotage - illegal, and will have a hefty fine if it's proven who did it.  I am with you: Law enforcement, and other public servants need to be held accountable - especially politicians. But it needs to be done in a safe way.  It's in the same way as driving: A lot of people are decent drivers. Some are good drivers - but some, are terrible drivers. And if you aren't careful - and take precaution, you will end up injured.  A lot of drone pilots will be careful. Some will be well in control - but it takes 1 incident to cost a lot of money, cause a lot of damage, and potentially kill someone in the event of a drone + plane collision."

One is the described in the article and aimed at ordinary consumers/users who quite frankly don't understand enough about updates to make an informed decision and cause Microsoft all sorts of grief by delaying updates and then blaming their OS when it it breaks.  The middle one is for enterprises where admins have some more control over the update cycle and ideally more of an idea what they are doing.  The last one is for embedded or sensitive devices. It is supposed to be for places where you can't easily update because of regulations and certifications or because the OS is running some sort of embedded system. There are no automatic updates here.  If you want full control over your machine you can always switch to the last model.

The business ring delays updates by a bit so that they have had time to be better tested by the consumer ring.  Windows 10 Enterprise has the option of both rings as well as the long term service ring which is the only ring offering 10 years of security updates (something all skus of previous windows have had).  Also Windows 10 enterprise can use local windows update rings that are managed by windows servers in a domain.  I full agree with your concern,  they have already proven they are willing to do this.

I don't want silverlight, stop installing silverlight.  False positives on driver updates.  I've had experienced many times in the past issues where Windows Update thinks I have a certain wifi card or hard drive controller that simply doesn't exist on my machine.  The driver install ended up hosing my system.  Can we really trust MS to not exploit the power that having the ability to directly install software on every Windows 10 machine would offer?

If you connected to the internet before installing the antivirus first, you might have been compromised very easily.

technology,3dlzau,Yrigand,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:53:24 2015 UTC,"Here are some examples where it would be useful:    Child is missing, and phone is off. Retained geolocation data gives the last location the child was at. Seize terrorist laptop, has IM messages to user account x. Retained data allows you to get the src IP of x from the IM service at a given date/time. Request to ISP gets you the physical address of IP x at that time. If a mobile device, this could include geo data. Do that enough, combined with geo data for each message, and you could identify the owner of the phone even if it is a burner. Known meeting of terrorists occurred at location X, but you only hear about it a period of time afterward. Using retained data, you can find all other phones active at that geolocation at that time.   Each of the above are examples of where retained data would be useful. Whether useful enough to warrant the intrusion is a different question. For example, the child one could be met by CSPs/ISPs just retaining the location of the last couple of geolocation fixes. The impact on civil liberties would be negligible, but there would be a concrete benefit, that has actually been demonstrated by the police to be useful - see the Anderson report for other concrete examples.  Your argument about other countries is potentially valid. It'd be interesting to compare clearance rates, and the crimes that retained data has been asserted as being useful for, in other countries. I've yet to see any evidence for all the statements I've heard like ""they are doing perfectly fine"" or similar. Of course, I also haven't seen any good statistical evidence for the government assertion that data retention has been vital."

technology,3drp1i,agumonkey,4,Sat Jul 18 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"As an owner of several MD players - two of which I actually used, some fifteen years ago when what few mp3 players existed held a handful of songs and cost way too much - I found the article very interesting.  I agree when he says that Sony lost a big opportunity with MD-Data, but I think the potential it could have had is underestimated. In fact, I think the entire MD idea failed solely because Sony didn't catch on to the fact that it could be the next floppy. 140 megabytes were a lot of storage when Minidisc came out; CD burners were in their infancy and annoying to use, and if Sony had quickly developed mass-storage capable MD drives, and massive production of cheap discs had followed, minidiscs could easily have become the storage format of the next generation.  Granted USB drives would still have displaced them eventually, but I for one would have much preferred moving data around in small, protected rectangles than in large scratch-prone 120mm discs.  We saw this happen again much more recently, with the whole ""optical media war"" between BluRay and HD-DVD. While the supporters were busy fighting it out, the world watched with mild amusement while they kept busily burning data on DVDs - which were available in such cheap prices that their lower capacity wasn't that much of a problem. And when BluRay finally won a lot of people went ""yeah, yeah, the HD stuff is nice and all, but how much do they cost per gigabyte of capacity?"", then they went ""wait, how much?!"", then they laughed and kept using DVDs, and before economies of scale could bring down the price USB drives and supercheap SATA hard drives came about and stole the market for both portability and archiving.  I'm absolutely sure that if they'd developed the new formats as a data system first, with plentiful burnable discs readily available, the world would have had a much different reaction.  The truth is that ever since audio and video switched from analog to digital, dedicated media formats are just digital storage formats that happen to be artificially restricted to media - and they're always going to fail, because nobody is going to prefer them to universal storage systems that can also store media."
technology,3drp1i,IronMew,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"Just in case, I happened to search about MD history after reading that thread on HN https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9907469  I knew MD were very early, but I only found that article today, giving a lot of insights into the effect of marketing.  It's possible we'd ended up with the same state as today, with the 90s owned by MData, then replaced by DVD/USB. But I'm still curious what the impact would have been on computers.  In 1992 a typical 125M hard drive was 350$. I don't remember the price for a MiniDisc though, but I'd bet it was cheaper than a mechanical hard drive (after all you only buy the medium, the head, spinning mechanism and controller were shared).  Depending on the access time (I bet very slow) it could have changed usage patterns and ideas, leading to different software too. Your OS could allow itself more storage easily, programs too etc etc.  Consumers didn't have massive rewritable media until CD-R got cheap enough. Zip drives were well known, but not used by the average joe like CDs.  ps: thinking about CDs, it's amazing how Sony managed to cram a laser based magnetic writing head into such a small space that early.  pps: I bet the rewritable magnetic bits (as opposed one shot physical grooves or CD-R) gave them a lot of room to allow for mistakes, since you can always pause, resync a little earlier on the track, rewrite and continue. CDs were a lot more strict in that regard."

When I started downloading music I could never have enough MDs and I was always buying them. The 80s were nice to have, you could fit one more song in them, but the price premium was too much so I only had a couple.  A further thought I had: promoting digital formats as universal storage rather than media-centric neatly allows bypassing the entire DRM headache, and seeing how much trouble the entertainment cartels cause every time anything involving media is developed it would seem worth doing for that alone.   Of course, Sony has always been on the wrong side of the fence here - their strict policies concerning DRM and proprietary development, along with ignoring incoming revolutions in technology, have caused many of their products to fail, but they've never learned the lesson. The last one to suffer this sad fate is, if I haven't missed any recent developments, the Playstation Vita, hamstrung by its proprietary memory cards and sidelined by ultramobile gaming."

Any company without Sony's enormous brand influence, gained way back when the old ways worked, would have long failed under this management. Unfortunately for them the people who go for Sony just because it's Sony are themselves old and dying off; the modern customer is more savvy, has the Internet and a much larger selection of brands at his disposal.

technology,3dm4ad,NeedAChainsaw,14,Fri Jul 17 12:51:20 2015 UTC,"This is the exact reason I started using my own email domain with a catchall address and a junk address.  I have all@domain, realname@domain, and junk@domain.  When I signup at bestbuy i give them bestbuy@domain and it goes to all@domain.  I rarely check the all address unless I need to find something like a password reset.  If I find that I am getting nothing but junk, I create a forward for bestbuy@domain to point at junk@domain, and junk has like a 10mb limit, first in first out.  Also gives you great insight into who sells your email address.  For work related stuff (signing up for customer support, having to give up an email for a program download) I use the Blur plugin for fiefox to create a masked email address for just that site.  It serves basically the same features and I love it."
technology,3dm4ad,CJoshDoll,9,Fri Jul 17 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"This is actually really good information!  Whenever I signup for something that needs my email, I use their company name as my first name so that I know which company sold my info, your idea is just a little more sophisticated but seems like the same type of thing.   I also like to create email forwards to other addresses that are spamming me, so I effectively send all my best buy spam to that insurance agent who's been spamming me.  It's my own little petty revenge."
technology,3dm4ad,NeedAChainsaw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"LOL thats pretty hilarious that you forward the spam to other spammers.  You should check out the Blur plugin for disposalble addersses for online stuff.  You can even turn off forwarding but still be able to get to the messages.  For example, (everything forwards to 1 address, in my case my work email) I signed up for something that required an account and used a disposable address that then was sold and I started getting spam on.  I disabled the address from forwarding to stop seeing the emails, but then forgot the login info for the site months later.  I was able to request a password reset email, and even tho it didnt forward to my email, I opened up the Blur console and it retains all emails sent to one of your masked addresses for 2 hours, so I was able to use the password reset.    It just automates the process of what we do for in person emails.  I always used a Blur address online unless its something like creating an account for the utility company, or something I will legit need, and then I revert to company@mydomain as the address.  Blur is free if you just want emails masked and if 2 hours is long enough of a time to retain your emails for forwards you have turned off.  I have only had 1 site so far that wouldnt allow me to use one of their addresses.  They have a paid service for masked credit card numbers and phone numbers, but I have never tried it.  The plugin can also proxy your google searches to anonymize you, but I use disconnect for that.  I use godaddy to manage my domain emails because it was included in my domains and is simple to handle forwards and real mailboxes.  (I have no stake in Blur or GoDaddy, just who I use)"

Then what do you do when you actually do want to try something out before buying.   I have Amazon prime and use it regularly, but if I go to a BB store to audition something I will invariably buy it there, especially if it's something that's physically large.   BB will price match just about any real company (including online ones like Amazon), and the clerks do it themselves right at the register, so the price match process adds maybe a minute to most transactions.   In fact I bought 3 TVs for our guest bedrooms a few months ago and the guy helping me took to his computer so he could search the internet for the model number to find the best price he could to match for me.   The other nice thing is that if I don't like it or it doesn't work out, I don't have to hassle with RMAs, reboxing etc, I just drop it off at the store and get a refund. A year or so ago I even returned a graphics card I'd had for about 5 weeks. For that they had to call a manager over (since it's outside their normal refund window), but he offered me store credit for the full purchase price, which I was very happy with.   I know they can be a pain with the offering of extended warranties and trying to sell you Monster cables and whatnot, but honestly I have found that to be much less intense in the last year or so. The guy who sold me the TVs asked in passing if I needed any accessories (I actually did, I bought mounts there), and if I wanted extended warranty but I said no and he said okay, end of discussion."

His point is that yes, they do, although it's usually not major breakages. The fact that you can control those things through enterprise tools is somewhat proof that it has been a problem in the past - if updates never broke anything enterprise wouldn't insist on granular deployment tools and doing their own testing. However every single halfway competent corporation does just that.  The code in Windows home and the code in Windows enterprise is largely the same. The updates are largely the same. If something breaks in a home install, chances are it's also going to break in an enterprise install (and often vice versa). The exception is issues that arise in enterprise because they've rolled out a crazy patchwork of things on totally different versions that MS never tests. Most enterprise admins consider home users to be unofficial testers for patches."

If you're work is really that time sensitive and valuable, then you will indeed have no problem paying for Pro, but for most people that will be a non-issue.

technology,3dm8mw,SCphotog,0,Fri Jul 17 21:36:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think part of it also has to do with not realizing how you put others at risk by not staying up to date with security patches.

With Apple's upcoming version of OS X, you need to enter a Terminal command to enable the ""rootless=0"" boot flag, restart your computer, and then use a sudo rm command to remove preinstalled bloatware like Game Center, iBooks, FaceTime, Photo Booth, Maps, etc. Not entirely difficult, just not as easy as right clicking a tile and selecting ""uninstall."""

Most people's cars sit around and do nothing all day.  Imagine instead that for $200 a year, you always have a car within 5 minutes of you.  The price might come down to $100 a year if you're willing to ride share.  You never have to pay parking fees again, and you can convert your garage to livable space."

I mean, for example, if I preferred a particular pair of shoes that was more expensive than a different pair of shoes, does it make it illogical to buy the more expensive pair?  Is it only logical to only buy the absolute cheapest thing?  Don't be ridiculous.

They're so competitive with each other and try to undercut competitors at every turn. Insurance companies don't make nearly as much money as a lot of people think due to the insane cost of medical expenses. If you have a 100/300/100 policy and run into someone, lets say they go to the ER for 2 days and then a room for 3 days before getting discharged. You may well have hit your 100k$ limit on 1-2 days in the ER depending on what they had to do. Even if they bump up your premium to like 1500$ a year, you'll never pay them back that entire 100k$ unless you have insurance with them for like 70 years. They make up for all that money because the majority of people never cause that level of damage, which averages out to around 5% profit per person's premium across all their customers."

technology,3dm3n5,Stan57,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"the about config will only work if the website owners honors your ...request not to be tracked   No it won't. Firefox's ""tracking protection"" is NOT the same as ""do not track,"" which is a totally different thing.  Secondly, I'm not talking about popovers or popunders or popups at all, really. I also have Adblock Pop-up blocker installed, and it does the trick for popup windows of all sorts. I'm talking about javascript ads that take over the browser window when you load the page or try to navigate away from it, like those things on Upworthy or other similar sites that say things like ""Like us on Facebook!"" and force you to click on the X before you can actually see the content on the page. (These are also called ""interstitial"" ads.)  For the record, all you're doing with multiple ad blockers is wasting system resources and causing exztensions to fight over who's going to handle the object model of the browser. Having one properly configured ad blocker is going to provide you with WAY less headache, especially as you start to add custom filters."

The best solution is to find open source software that runs on windows and swap out what they use a piece at a time until they are using only open source software. Then once they get used to that software you can change the underlying os and they will find the transition much easier.  Low hanging fruit here is Firefox, Thunderbird, VLC, Libreoffice etc. It is easy enough to ween them onto these if you study their needs in detail and prepare the way by making the changes as painless as possible.   One trick you might like to do is when you switch them to Linux you replace the HD with a SSD and watch it fly like the proverbial when booting systemd.

If you think increasing benefits will not have a proportional effect on taxes in a balanced budget, that's really sad. People like you are running, and ruining, our country, and it explains our debt problem.  The question of who pays for tuition is not ""do we pay or not?"" It's ""do we pay for our own, or does everyone pay for everyone else's without regard to their own personal decisions?"". Socialized tuition only helps the irresponsible and the universities, who will (1) raise tuition even further, and (2) encourage even more people to attend college who have no good reason to do so. Most jobs in the US don't actually need a degree, but universities have instilled some obsession with them into corporate America. Soon you'll need a degree just to work at Walmart. It's not in our best interest to give these universities an even more secure income stream.  You want to go to college? Don't be a shithead in highschool, shop around for universities, and take out a reasonable amount of loans for a degree that will pay off. This is a fine system. Socializing it will only have the effect of (1) spreading out tuition cost over the life of every taxpayer rather than over the duration of your personal loan, (2) encourage shitty decision making by students, since it will not have an immediate effect on their out of pocket expenses, and (3) encourage universities to inflate prices even more than they already have.

When people can't afford to buy shiney new shit because they're tens of thousands of dollars in debt, they can't support YOUR JOB of creating shiney new shit, marketing shiney new shit, or otherwise redistributing and maintaining shiney new shit, so the demand for YOUR labor goes down.

Not to mention any technical college skills like welding, plumbing, etc.  Once automation has taken over your meaninglessly trivial low-wage job people without a college education on average will be performing work that's worth even less money than it is now, and their labor will be less valued because they are not as skilled.   The fact that Americans need degrees for most jobs when they serve little to no practical value to most of those jobs is a travesty.    I won't even address how stupid this is. If you think there's nothing practical to gain from going to college you've either never been to college or had no idea how to effectively utilize the education you paid exorbitant amounts for, which is a goddamn shame.

Why should they need to spend tens of thousands of dollars (through loans or taxes) and 4 years of their life doing something they have no interest in?   I. Fucking. Agree.

Yes, we need to reform the school system and cut the administrative fat involved, but that seems to be a common theme with american capitalism. People doing real work get shafted while office fatcats get fat checks.   Regardless, guess what's gonna happen to workers without a college education in a globalized economy where we can just ship any of our production needs effortlessly across borders? They're gonna be out of the job because we thought keeping up with education was a waste of fucking time while the rest of the developed and developing world passes us by.  http://hechingerreport.org/in-global-education-race-u-s-is-falling-behind/   Yeah, you lost me again.

I dunno. I can't know, Comcast hasn't announced any pricing. But I can know that if Comcast wanted to just pretend no one wanted gigabit service this 2gb program is good enough. They could even make a DOCSIS 3.0 service for gigabit for almost not cost to them and price it so high no one wants it."

You do realize that this is precisely what they're doing with their 2 gig service, right?  They're rolling it out in select cities with a prohibitively expensive price tag.    There's no reason to believe that they won't do the same thing with gigabit service.  This is Comcast we're talking about.  The only new equipment they're rolling out is the DOCSYS 3.1 modems.   All they have to do is slap a prohibitively expensive monthly fee like $199 or something, a $20 modem rental fee, and a locked in 2 year contract.  Then when the general public laughs in their face, all they have to say is ""See, we now have data that nobody in our pilot cities was interested in Gigabit speeds, which is why we have not yet rolled them out nationwide."", giving them 'justification' to continually screw their customers over with shit speeds at high prices."
technology,3djwhs,NightwingDragon,-7,Fri Jul 17 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"You do realize that this is precisely what they're doing with their 2 gig service, right?   No, it's not what they're doing with their 2 gig service. With the 2 gig service they install new wires and equipment which is only used for you. With DOCSIS 3.1 they upgrade the head end equipment and then everyone on the existing network can use DOCSIS 3.1 by just getting a new $100 modem.  They are charging a ton for the existing service because they have to spend thousands (some say tens of thousands) per customer who gets the service to provide it. With DOCSIS 3.1 the incremental cost per customer is rather low after the setup, as mentioned above.   There's no reason to believe that they won't do the same thing with gigabit service.   Except there is. If they upgrade the head end, then the money is spent, there is no reason to discourage people from using the service. In fact they lose money if no one signs up. While with the FTTH 2gb service they only pay per customer using the service so if they discourage you with high prices it is no big deal to them. They don't send out a backhoe to install fiber, they don't incur any costs. These are entirely different situations.  But really the thing is your ridiculous argument that Comcast somehow would put in equipment capable of providing gigabit service to everyone and then not use it to try to convince people that people don't want gigabit service. Comcast will have spent money to be the only gigabit service available in most markets. It is absurd to think that at that point they won't be trying to convince people they want gigabit service so that they have to go to Comcast to get it!  It's classic sour grapes. As long as Comcast doesn't offer gigabit service in most cities they pretend it isn't worth having anyway. But as soon as they have it to offer, they will think much more highly of it!   The only new equipment they're rolling out is the DOCSYS 3.1 modems.   That's not true. They have to upgrade the head end of the system too. DOCSIS 3.1 modems only talk DOCSIS 3.1 to DOCSIS 3.1-capable head ends.  Coax is by far the best thing next to fiber in terms of customer performance. It blows DSL away. Sure, it's not as good as fiber, but Comcast will be able to upgrade customers to gigabit for probably an expenditure of a few hundred dollars per customer. Whereas AT&T UVerse or any system with no wiring in the ground at all will have to spend thousands to put in new cabling (presumably FTTP). Comcast likes money. They are going to take advantage of this advantage they have to put in service their competitors cannot provide cheaply.  Now, will they make it truly cheap? Probably not. They are in it for the money, right? But saying they will make the pricing intentionally so high as to discourage adoption all so they can claim people don't want the service is absurd. It doesn't make financial sense at all. And I can't see how anyone could think that a greedy company wouldn't do it in a way that doesn't make financial sense.   giving them 'justification' to continually screw their customers over with shit speeds at high prices.   Shit speeds? What? That is absolutely not true. Cable providers are currently the fastest speed in most markets. They are not slow, you can get 150 megabits easily. This is not shit speeds. You're disconnected from reality."

Yes. What they'll do is offer it in a limited area at a huge price. Nobody will want it at that price, so when the government comes around and tries to tell them they need to offer gigabit they'll say ""We do in these markets and nobody wants it.""  That way they don't have to roll it out everywhere at huge expense, and the government officials too stupid to take their bribes will believe their assertion that people don't want it.

If they wanted to do it that way they would just keep their existing unaffordable service and not add gigabit over DOCSIS.   That way they don't have to roll it out everywhere at huge expense   The reason to do it over DOCSIS is that it isn't a huge expense. It's a much smaller on than adding fiber to the premises.

Cities applied and received the funding to it. The goal was to try and get better internet to less densely populated areas.  So many cities received the money and installed fiber all through the metro areas of the city or outskirts/rural areas depending on the situation.  The providers just have to install the last mile and then provide service.  The providers aren't doing it.  Then the city decides to try and startup municipal broadband. Well of course the big providers don't like this. So typically what I have seen done is that they lobby the city council to pass new legislation.  It's hard to outright ban a city from creating a service for people, so what they've been able to do is pass some accounting shenanigans.  Essentially, the city can setup muni fiber and install the last mile. Sure, they can run the service, however any funds paid into the service have to be sent to a general fund or some other specific city fund. Then they ban all general fund/specific city fund money to service the muni fiber.  Neat trick, yeah?"

Because there is absolutely no reason that internet should cost that much, especially considering that the most expensive part -building the long fiber connections - is already done. They essentially just have to hook up to it. Google Fiber's gigabit connection is only $70/mo, and that's less than a quarter of the price.   For comparison, that $300 for 2Gbps is $6.67 per 1Mbps. Even in the US, that's double the average price per 1Mbps, which is $3.33 per 1Mbps. You're think the price per Mbps would go down as you buy more, right?

It is the local loop, the last mile. If you get this service they have to install a new fiber from your house to wherever their nearest fiber access is. This costs significant money, so Comcast charges for it.  People who actually work in residential/commercial internet don't seem to think this is as poorly priced as you do.  https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3d58x5/comcasts_2gbps_internet_costs_300_per_month_with/ct1yflj   Google Fiber's gigabit connection is only $70/mo, and that's less than a quarter of the price.   Google Fiber doesn't even enter an area until they have a guaranteed sign up rate of 20% or so. That means they have 1/5th of all customers in an area. That allows them to amortize the costs of the service much better.  This service offered by Comcast is literally one where they come and install fiber just for you if you sign up. Fiber they never plan on using again because they will be offering gigabit service to most people over their existing HFC network, not FTTP. So yeah, it's expensive.   For comparison, that $300 for 2Gbps is $6.67 per 1Mbps.   Just mbps per dollar doesn't capture enough information to make useful comparisons."

So yeah, the prices are high. They are amortizing the cost of the install across 2 years (plus an up front) instead of over a decade.  They're probably too high for most people, I can't blame anyone who says that they wouldn't sign up for it because it's just too expensive."

The predictions from Tesla at the time for the lowest cost model were about 47 k, so everyone was running with that. We now know the out the door price ranges from about 80k to a little over 100k.   Really, I think one of the main reasons for the high cost is it's an all aluminum vehicle. Unless sold at a loss for one reason or another(first gen Insight, Audi A2) I don't think any auto manufacturer has ever made an all aluminum car that was relatively inexpensive.   The next step for yet less weight is carbon fiber, but that too is relatively expensive to produce. Even if you bring manufacturing down, it takes a lot of energy to convert plastic to carbon fiber."

Ordinarily a system like that couldn't stay stable for this long, but the Chinese prop it up to keep the Americans at arms length.   China has gone the opposite way. By giving up some control (the ability to do whatever they want without care for the wants of citizens), they've allowed themselves to enter the rest of the world, have an economy, etc. They still have to maintain a military force capable of putting down uprisings if they occur, but it's more of a contingency since most citizens are ""happy"" to live their lives and, importantly, go to work. Occasionally though, when something is a big enough issue (repeated protests despite being put down each time), the government finds it just easier to capitulate in some way, especially if it's something over which they won't ""lose face"". The world has seen the pictures of the pollution in their cities, their citizens don't like it and due to their size they're very dependant on oil which won't last forever.

In practice, they don't need be to registered and no license or insurance is needed. Socially, most people live in cities and have commutes under 10 miles or so. Finally, there's a less of the Americanism with demanding their own McMansion in a copy-pasted suburb 30 miles from work so they can drive their 200+hp 3000lb vehicle which they identify with as a person.

It could be that they don't have access to Tesla's information or that other ""market-leading actors"" are dragging the average up. Also, they derived the cost per kWh from his statement (he didn't say it outright), which means that they could be wrong (and the quote is two years old too).

That's pretty good, but if I pick a couple of ""sports cars"" for comparison:  On the muscle car side of things, Chevy's own Camaro will make 0-60 in half the time.  For lighter cars, a Lancer Evo will make it in about 5 seconds.  And if we're talking about a proper sports car, the Cayman will do it in just over 4.

Essentially, it still isn't ""clean"" to make batteries. It requires the same supplies to make anything else. Clean water, Electricity, Oil, planes, trains & automobiles for shipping resources to & from, etc... Then there is a lack of universal recycling programs & if it isn't government regulated (read: required), it'll just end up in landfills/poor countries. And the elephant in the room, what's recharging all these batteries ? Humans do not rely on 100% on renewable energy yet, so we're still powering the grid mainly by coal & oil and aforementioned resources to make, supply & maintain everything.  It's not all doom & gloom. Electric motorized vehicles are the future, but relying solely on batteries to power them won't cut it in the long term. My opinion is we'll see gas powered generators combined with capacitors & small batteries to power all the electric cars of the future. We see it already in many hybrids & sports cars (like the Porsche 918 Spyder)."

If you were looking at pure benchmark numbers like this article is, you would think that IE9 was absurdly fast. Anyone that has used IE9 vs chrome or any other browser knows thats absolutely not true.   Turns out that IE9 was developed with a function that outright skipped the tests (not specifically intentional to this test) due to ""dead code elimination"".

A kindof spammy article from a likely biased site is here: http://fiberforall.org/your-internet-speed-test-might-be-lying/  But two ways it can happen are:   ""Speed Boost"" - This is something a few cable providers offer (I believe Comcast, Time Warner and Cox do it) which basically speeds up the first ~30 MB of whatever you connect to. So the speedtest goes fast because it fits inside that small improved speed download window, but the steam game you are downloading is still going to go slower than the test through no fault of Valve. Traffic Shaping - This is a pretty typical practice on networks. Things like voice calls will be prioritized higher than downloading a file if bandwidth is limited. This can be abused by giving speed tests the same priority as voice calls. So you run the speed test and it goes through at 100mbps, but if you were to then try and download a file, your speeds would dump to 20mbps."

Dead Code Elimination is a pretty common optimization. I'd be surprised if other browsers don't use it (well, actually... they must be doing something with all the resources they hog). If anything, this shows that Microsoft is doing it better than the others.  Of course, benchmarking clever software is difficult, but in this case any browser not ""cheating"" on the test just isn't working properly/efficiently."

In other words, take all this hype with a grain of salt and wait for real world use testing to come out before you get excited about how fast something is."

Even with 1GB of memory I could not run Vista well.  7 felt like the OS Vista should have been in the first place, and in hindsight it was the best OS Windows has released.  XP was a big deal because it was the first consumer OS built on the NT kernel, and while it was a bit of a nightmare with regards to older peripherals and some software because of it, it was by far the most stable Windows OS in a long time and came with a lot of great admin tools.

I didn't want a giant phone, I wanted a very portable computer.  Around that time I lost interest in Apple. Their ecosystem was a bit too closed for my tastes, more and more hardware got locked in, less servicabele, and just their style changed. Even OSX today now is becoming more and more like iOS. I've even heard people say ""I hope they just focus on iOS and get rid of OSX.""  That is so cringe worthy!  I jumped ship to Windows Vista, but 7 was on the horizon. 7 has been very nice to me.  Then I saw the Surface. A device that I once expected Apple to make. I'm sorry, but for usefulness the Surface destroys any phone OS tablet any day in my book.  I haven't been able to justify getting one as I have a pretty decent tower, a gaming laptop, and a wacom graphics tablet (giving me that stylus pressure sensitivity) but if I have to replace that laptop for some reason, or come across some extra money, you can bet I will take a good long look at the Surface."

technology,3dhzmq,ssylvan,5,Thu Jul 16 14:50:54 2015 UTC,"It uses process-based sandboxing for tabs (just like IE and chrome), but it's also using the new windows runtime, which is significantly more secure than an app that talks to win32. So even if you manage to compromise it, you can't really do anything very harmful to the user's system unless you also compromise the kernel or something to bypass the app sandboxing.   In short, it has every potential to be significantly more secure than chrome or firefox - of course a browser that has never had any serious attacks levied against it will probably have some security bugs. But at least it's using a more secure underlying technology so all else being equal it's reasonable to expect it'll be more secure in the long run."

It has the possibility to be audited, to be forked and to be ported.  For some examples:   OpenOffice was forked to become LibreOffice, which has been significantly better. The UE4 editor was ported to Linux before Epic Games was able to. Power user community members are able to submit patches to bugs (these are known in the open source community as drive by patches). Valve hired LunarG to help improve linux graphics drivers. CyanogenOS/CyanogenMod is an android offshoot that was only possible due to android being open source. Android was possible thanks to the linux kernel being open source. SailfishOS is possible due to Linux being open source. Chrome itself is possible due to the webkit engine being opensource. An uncountable number of embedded electronics are better (TVs, fridges, etc.), due to linux and associated code being opensource.   If you are an 'enterprise' user, there are additional benefits to be had. Say for example that your large company used Libre Office extensively internally. You could hire a developer or two to work on Libre Office and tailor it to your needs. You also don't have to deal with licensing, which for a lot of enterprise vendors, is a total shakedown (looking at you, Microsoft).  Edit: Added * word in first line"

If you ask me the day reddit started it's decline is when lolcats started taking over and reddit decided to create a subreddit dedicated to meaningless content, or just pictures. Man I hated those ""icanhazcheeseburger"" pictures. Before then the community was very informed, politely corrected spelling, asked for evidence in arguments when none was given.  This started declining long before the digg diaspora.  Sure we've got /r/TrueReddit but it's still not the same as it once was.  Hacker News is far closer to what reddit once was.  It's actually quite sad.  While I tend to think Pao is an opportunist, and will spin this as herself being a victim as much as possible and as her being a beacon for an inclusive respectful internet to garner some status in the mainstream press I also think reddit died a long time ago.  In order to make as much profit as possible reddit will attempt to appeal to more and more mainstream audiences.  So far it's been a race to the bottom -- as more and more sensational and easily digestible content is what most people come to reddit for.  The trolls won long ago.  Most of them aren't intentionally trolls just users who want easy to consume mindless content.

It's completely fair to want to make money, but there needs to be a balance between making said money, and maintaining the quality of your product. With TV they cashed in on the easy buck with reality TV and programming in general took a dive. With video games they realized they could make more by nickel and diming the consumer, and the medium suffered for it. The internet is just on the cusp of succumbing to this same same scenario, and it really bums me out to think of what it will become.

People have a lot of nostalgia as far as video games, but again it's hard to argue that overall games have improved in tons of measurable ways and the market is bigger and more diverse than ever - especially with the rise of digital distribution and indie development.  I'm sorry but go back and boot up some ""classic"" games from the Playstation days and earlier.  Very very few of them truly hold up outside the lens of nostalgia.  Nor has gaming ever been a low cost hobby.  Thanks to ""corporate greed"" we can get the internet in our pocket nearly anywhere on earth, and while by it's very nature content online is always changing, looking back into it's infancy in the 90s, I again don't really long for the ""gold old days"".  Yes, monetization has lead to some minor annoyances common to the web these days, and it has destroyed certain corners of the internet, but there is exponentially more content and we can do much more online than ever before.

The Digg Invasion, the Subbreddit diversification, ... were changes in culture but not about the fundamental ownership of the sites core values.   We are reddit. It is us acting in groups / pools / swarms / hordes. It is a bitch session, something awesome, a request for help, an exchange about what is going on in the world...   The corporate agenda in that quote says that somebody external to us gets to decide what is ugly and what isn't. The perhaps defensible banning of some subreddits is nothing compared to a reddit where content is even in a small way wired behind the scenes to advertisers and 'mainstream audiences' or where what is visible is ranked that way.   That isn't us. That's mainstream television compared to a youtube channel.   I've been here a couple days short of 10 years. I've been pissed off many times. I'm not pissed off now. I'm just thinking that this venue is likely to start losing a lot of what made it interesting."

I'm sure you would agree banning child porn subs for example is necessary. But the same arguments could be made for that as well. In fact when /r/jailbait went down there were more than a few people who did.   Ultimately it comes down to how you decide what stays and what goes.

Using this data-backed ""proof"" of correlation (despite the fact that the correlation is actually just their shared correlation with a shared underlying factor), I can pretty much make my point (although people often say that they know that correlation does not equal causation, the truth is that people are persuaded by well-presented correlative 'links' all the time).

technology,3dio39,Chancellor_Bismarck,2,Thu Jul 16 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"As someone who opposes the recent direction of reddit, I really resent being lumped in with people making death threats and harassing people. What people fear is an ever expanding definition of harassment that will change reddit into something like this:   LYNNFIELD, MA—In an effort to provide sanctuary for Lynnfield College students exposed to perspectives different from their own, a new campus safe space was dedicated Wednesday in honor of Alexis Stigmore, a 2009 graduate who felt kind of weird in class one time.  Addressing students at the dedication ceremony, parents Arnold and Cassie Stigmore noted that while the college had adequate facilities to assist victims of discrimination, abuse, and post-traumatic stress, it had until now offered no comparable safe space for students, like their beloved daughter, who encounter an academic viewpoint that gives them an uncomfortable feeling.  “When our Alexis felt weird after hearing someone discuss an idea that did not conform to her personally held beliefs, she had no place to turn,” said Arnold Stigmore, standing outside the $2 million space that reportedly features soothing music, neutral-colored walls, oversized floor cushions, fun board games, and a variety of snacks. “God forbid any of you, in your years at this institution, are ever confronted with an opinion you do not share. But if you are, you will have a refuge on this campus.”  “I’ll never forget the morning my daughter called and told me in a trembling voice, ‘Mom, my professor said some stuff today I didn’t like.’”  “If unfamiliar thoughts are ever provoked in your mind, or in the mind of someone you know, you can come to this place and feel safe again,” he added.  As they have done often over the years, the Stigmores spoke openly about the time their daughter attended a class in which her political science professor “completely ambushed” her with standard course material that did not fit comfortably within her world outlook. Feeling unsettled, the college student reportedly had no way of coping with the challenging position that did not require her to consider the opinion, analyze its shortcomings, and think of possible counterarguments.  Alexis, then a dean’s-list student in her junior year, described spending 40 harrowing minutes of class in a distressed state, forced to look at the world through the eyes of a set of people she disagreed with.  “I’ll never forget the morning my daughter called and told me in a trembling voice, ‘Mom, my professor said some stuff today I didn’t like,’” recounted an emotional Cassie Stigmore, who also remarked that Alexis was left further traumatized upon looking at the course syllabus and finding it contained a book she did not want to read because it was written by an author whose politics she opposed. “As a parent, I’ll always wish I could have been there for her in that lecture hall, protecting her from those unwelcome concepts.”  After pausing to regain her composure, she continued, “If this safe space had been here then, my Alexis would have been able to surround herself immediately with people who would have reiterated and reinforced all the views she had when we first sent her to college—but sadly, it wasn’t, and she was left to deal with that new, unwanted idea on her own.”  Lynnfield president Dr. Timothy Crowley praised the Stigmores for their generous contribution and for raising awareness of an important issue. Since the family went public with Alexis’ story, a number of students have come forward saying they too have been exposed to alternative views on academic subjects, including several who Crowley applauded for their recent successful initiative to prevent a mainstream political figure from participating in a debate on campus out of concern that the exchange of ideas might make some people feel unsafe.  As he toured the new facility and examined a plaque commemorating Alexis Stigmore’s courage in the face of personal tragedy, Lynnfield class of 2017 member Jerrod Bryant told reporters he would be sure to use the space after attending his next Contemporary Civilization seminar, a course he is required to take even though it covers areas of study he personally disapproves of and believes should not exist..  “As soon as I stepped foot in this place, I knew I would never feel weird here,” Bryant said. “Every college should have a space like this, and thanks to caring parents like the Stigmores, we have one here for our community. It might be too late for Alexis, but it’s not too late for the rest of us.”  Sources confirmed a separate donation has also been made to provide a safe space and counseling services for straight white men at the college who won’t shut the fuck up about how they’re the real victims on campus these days.   http://www.theonion.com/article/parents-dedicate-new-college-safe-space-honor-daug-50851?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_campaign=LinkPreview:1:Default"

I've posted unpopular ideas before, and the hivemind downvotes them to oblivion, regardless of any merit behind my post. All too often people use the vote buttons as ""agree/disagree"" and this is exactly how you get hive minds and pitch forks. This shit needs to stop. period.  What I recommend is a simple thing. All it takes is a little decency. You don't have to agree with everything that's posted on here, but if you're going to take the time to actually disagree with a post and leave a dissenting comment UPVOTE THE POST YOU DISAGREED WITH! Clearly you thought that the comment was at least worth replying to, and I assure you this person is not alone in their views. And if you think your points are valid and shed light on the error of the person you're replying to, then you absolutely want to upvote their post, otherwise, you're sending both of your comments into the downvote abyss.  Basically, don't be a whiny baby. Be confident in your own views that you can upvote and call attention to views that contradict your own. A shouting match is not a discussion, and when you use the reddit voting system as agree/disagree, you're turning what could be an enlightening discussion into a shouting match, and the hive mind will always win a shouting match."

The reason is the shale gas boom, of course.  Edit: I re-read the comments, and the nuance is around the use of the term 'by-product'. Asphalt is produced from asphaltenes, which are the dregs left over when distillation and then vacuum distillation have been done. 'By-product' kind of implies that there are few economic uses for the material, and that is true for asphaltenes (only useful for asphalt) and not for the light hydrocarbons. Arguably ethane is really only useful for ethylene, but it can also be used to increase the energy content of natural gas. If not for ethylene production though, there would be a huge surplus of ethane on the market, and a lot of imperative to just leave all of it in the natural gas rather than extracting it. But that would increase the energy content of the gas, and cause problems for some downstream industrial customers who have NG-fired equipment that is spec'ed for a certain energy content range."

There are already concrete and ceramic composite formulations for roadways that last 10 times as long as asphalt.  Total amortized lifetime costs are almost half that of asphalt.  Problem?  Municipalities, always stretched for cash, can't afford the up front costs.  So it's better to put in the cheaper material and fix it in a couple years (on that year's budget).   This is a political reality that will never change.  If I am a county commissioner do I approve a cost of $750K/mile, $850K/mile or $1500K/mile?

My concern with fires is how they're planning to encase pipes and cables with it.  Now if they need to replace a fire damaged section, they're going to have to pull up those pipes and cables too.  Normally that stuff is far enough below the surface that damage isn't an issue.  An asphalt road surface is still damaged, but I think it would be easier to repair.  Although if they plan on using a type of plastic that's easily welded, some repairs may be easy as long as the cables and pipes inside aren't damaged.  On lesser used road, an impermeable road surface would also mean less water making it into the ground, and then into aquifers.  That means sewers have to work harder, and aquifers aren't recharged as much...and places like California can't afford to do that."

""Slippery when wet"" isnt the issue.   What about tire dynamics. As a performance driving enthusiast how does this affect and correlate to current tire performance stats and how will they differ.   HOW WILL THIS AFFECT ..THE TIRE MARKET.... I forsee lateral grip being a problem to deal with, as lateral grip and (fun stuff in cars) comes from Interlock, the interlocking and TEARING of the rubber fibers against the asphalt surface. (which is why lateral loads tend to chunk, wear tires and HEAT CYCLE them a lot more) tires behave VERY differently when doing high lateral loads, than they do doing high Longitudinal loads.   So while it might be fine to use a plastic road for say ..an interstate highway or a European A motorway. meh ........see treads dont work well under high lateral loads its entirely different. Assuming the treads evacuate enough water, you require bonding and shearing , which is inhibited by water, which is why wet roads provide about 80% grip vs dry, and actually more porous and rougher roads are more stable in the wet for this reason (because you can divide total force over smaller unit areas) Which isnt as good in the DRY ..but more cement based surfaces are interesting in the wet, you will loose grip quickly due to logitudinal acceleration or poor throttle discipline, but steering response in the wet and how each end of the car responds to lateral forces is arguably better."

technology,3dms3v,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:17:37 2015 UTC,"Brain-Based Algorithms Make for Better Networks  Released: 10-Jul-2015 12:00 PM EDT  Embargo expired: 16-Jul-2015 2:00 PM EDT  Source Newsroom: Salk Institute for Biological Studies more news from this source  Citations: PLOS Computational Biology  Newswise — LA JOLLA—When it comes to developing efficient, robust networks, the brain may often know best.  Researchers from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and Carnegie Mellon University have, for the first time, determined the rate at which the developing brain eliminates unneeded connections between neurons during early childhood.  Though engineers use a dramatically different approach to build distributed networks of computers and sensors, the research team of computer scientists discovered that their newfound insights could be used to improve the robustness and efficiency of distributed computational networks.   The findings, published in PLOS Computational Biology, are the latest in a series of studies being conducted in Carnegie Mellon’s Systems Biology Group to develop computational tools for understanding complex biological systems while applying those insights to improve computer algorithms.  “By thinking computationally about how the brain develops, we questioned how rates of synapse pruning may affect network topology and function,” says Saket Navlakha, assistant professor at the Salk Institute’s Center for Integrative Biology and a former postdoctoral researcher in Carnegie Mellon’s Machine Learning Department.   “We have used the resulting insights to develop new algorithms for constructing adaptive and robust networks in other domains.”  Network structure is an important topic for both biologists and computer scientists. In biology, understanding how the network of neurons in the brain organizes to form its adult structure is key to understanding how the brain learns and functions.   In computer science, understanding how to optimize network organization is essential to producing efficient interconnected systems.  But the processes the brain and network engineers use to learn the optimal network structure are very different.  Neurons create networks through a process called pruning. At birth and throughout early childhood, the brain’s neurons make a vast number of connections—more than the brain needs.   As the brain matures and learns, it begins to quickly cut away connections that aren’t being used.   When the brain reaches adulthood, it has about 50 to 60 percent less synaptic connections than it had at its peak in childhood.  In sharp contrast, computer science and engineering networks are often optimized using the opposite approach.   These networks initially contain a small number of connections and then add more connections as needed.  “Engineered networks are built by adding connections rather than removing them. You would think that developing a network using a pruning process would be wasteful,” says Ziv Bar-Joseph, associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Machine Learning and Computational Biology departments.   “But as we showed, there are cases where such a process can prove beneficial for engineering as well.”  The researchers first determined key aspects of the pruning process by counting the number of synapses present in a mouse model’s somatosensory cortex over time.   After counting synapses in more than 10,000 electron microscopy images, they found that synapses were rapidly pruned early in development, and then as time progressed, the pruning rate slowed.  The results of these experiments allowed the team to develop an algorithm for designing computational networks based on the brain pruning approach.   Using simulations and theoretical analysis they found that the neuroscience-based algorithm produced networks that were much more efficient than the current engineering methods.  In the networks created with pruning, the flow of information was more direct, and provided multiple paths for information to reach the same endpoint, which minimized the risk of network failure.  “We took this high-level algorithm that explains how neural structures are built during development and used that to inspire an algorithm for an engineered network,” says Alison Barth, professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Biological Sciences and member of the university’s BrainHubSM initiative.   “It turns out that this neuroscience-based approach could offer something new for computer scientists and engineers to think about as they build networks.”  As a test of how the algorithm could be used outside of neuroscience, Navlakha applied the algorithm to flight data from the U.S. Department of Transportation.   He found that the synaptic pruning-based algorithm created the most effective routes to allow passengers to reach their destinations.  “We realize that it wouldn’t be cost effective to apply this to networks that require significant infrastructure, like railways or pipelines,” Navlakha said.   “But for those that don’t, like wireless networks and sensor networks, this could be a valuable adaptive method to guide the formation of networks.”  In addition, the researchers say the work has implications for neuroscience and believe that the change in pruning rates from adolescence to adulthood could indicate that there are different biochemical mechanisms that underlie pruning.  “Algorithmic neuroscience is an approach to identify and use the rules that structure brain function,” Barth said.   “There’s a lot that the brain can teach us about computing, and a lot that computer science can do to help us understand how neural networks function.”  Picture: Salk and Carnegie Mellon researchers developed a new model for building efficient networks by studying the rate at which the brain prunes back some of its connections during development. In this model, nodes (such as neurons or sensors) make too many connections (left) before pruning back to connections that are most relevant (right). The team applied their synaptic pruning-based algorithm to air flight patterns and found it was able to create routes to allow passengers to reach their destinations efficiently.  http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/636970/?sc=dwhn#"

If it was only that, Hulu would be a tolerable niche streaming video provider.  But worst of all it is part owned by Comcast. That is why Comcast throttles and injects jitter into Netflix.  It is why Comcast imposes caps Hulu is exempt from.  It is why they refuse Netflix's free CDN speed and quality improvement servers which also reduce total Internet backbone usage by half.  It is the basis for numerous lobbying and legal efforts to cripple innovation in streaming entertainment.  That makes Hulu not only a sucky service, but an enemy of the people.  Rating: 0/10.

The reason I bring it up is because they drive money from getting new shows to original content. But like as long as it is not to much of an increase I am ok with it."

The whole purpose of cord cutting is to save on money by ditching overpriced cable for cheaper streaming services.  I have no problem with a small bump in price.

Defensive choices would be a yes/no choice. By using an autonomous vehicle, you would no doubt agree to abide by it's 'terms of use' - such that you agree to the computer intervening where appropriate to reduce incidents. And by effect, you are made aware of the circumstances where your autonomous car would intervene (such as the ones mentioned above).

Or even use a 0-day exploit, given how long VPN has been in use for and how widely it's used. And it's not a single cohesive network like Tor, it's just a protocol that networks use.   On Tor, there are no providers to serve warrants on, there is no direct route to effectively chase internet traffic through. The entire project exists for the sole purpose of avoiding government snooping.  Then there's also the fact that Tor itself does indeed contain lots of prime targets for them.

At least knowing the code behind the framework opens things up a bit. Like I said, partially open. And it's not completely open, and not very widely open at all. But it's something, which is still more than nothing. It means programs can be written that won't leave as many security holes because people can have a better idea what the code is doing.  As for the 1 out of 6, I didn't say that 1 was just malware, but that malware was a part of it. I said it could be one of any number of painful events. By far and large, the most introduced thing was performance hits and increased crashes. In personal experience and testing, I found that a fully updated windows 7 installation will crash, on the same hardware, about twice as often as a fresh installation of windows 7, and about 5 times as much as a windows 7 installation that ONLY gets bugfix updates. Also, with each update, it's a mixed bag whether it will be a performance hit or a performance boost, with a fully updated windows 7 definately performing worse than a mid-range updated windows 7.   As for speed, DX12 adds in a lot of new shading & 3d features that can hog a lot of processing power when active. It makes it prettier, yes. Whether or not it will go faster once it's the ""new standard"" remains to be seen, but at present, that's not the case. But 10 is faster with startup/shutdown and programs, but that difference is negligible from most I've talked to.   So, in short, until DX12 proves otherwise, speed differences between the two OS's counts as negligible in my book."

A mid-way updated windows 7, in my testing on identical hardware, would often out-perform the fully updated 7, often significantly (much greater than the percentage differences between a fully updated 7 and 10). I'm currently running a update-cherry-picked version of Windows 7, and I've only had two crashes this year despite near constant use and code development, some trying to clean up some very buggy code.

It looks like the fact that batteries are becoming cheaper faster than anticipated is going to play a big part in the surge of renewables:   The truly surprising part of Tesla's Powerwall announcement, however, was its price point. In 2014, the average cost of installing a stationary Li-ion battery in a California home was $23,429, according to The Wall Street Journal. In May, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that these batteries would start at $3,500, plus a $500 installation cost.  The research suggests that the cost of producing battery packs for electric vehicles has fallen dramatically between 2007 and 2014, to lower price points than previous optimistic projections had expected. “Results show that costs in 2014 were probably already below average projected costs for the 2020 time frame,” Björn Nykvist and Måns Nilsson wrote in their recent paper.   So if you combine the steady march of cheaper battery prices with the steady march of cheaper solar power you get renewable power that is becoming both much cheaper and more reliable."

It pushes the problem back a few decades, maybe, but it's not the end-solution. This isn't even getting into the oil requirements to actually dig, collect, transport and process the materials needed for nuclear reactors..   If the US wanted to produce enough nuclear plants to power what they otherwise use for electricity (electricity, by the way, is 20% of US energy consumption. Most is liquid fuel, IE oil) we'd need to produce 20,000+ nuclear power plants. Even ignoring the massive construction costs it's not feasible and not long-term.

We don't even have a fraction of the production needed for other fuels. Thank climate change deniers who fight alternative energy for that. Doesn't even have anything to do with climate change. Oil is a limited resource, period. The US has 2% of the worlds reserves, period. Drawing more and more oil each year, does not mean more exists in the planet. It means we will run out faster, period.  What's going to happen when reality hits home, the US is dependant on enemy-state foreign companies for the fuel that their society revolves around, all of the production of alternative energies is in other countries, all manufacturing.. China has been destroying US solar companies to establish a near-global monopoly. What fuel are they going to use to transport those solar panels to the US? Do you know how much fuel transport ships cost? The amount of solar panels needed to produce anything worth a damn? Why would china send that when they need it? How will the US pay for it when this dramatic halt in productivity comes.. it probably won't help the economy. Oil is the biggest productivity booster, period. nothing else even comes close. That's why it's everywhere. Except in our planet.  We have seriously hard questions we need to address over the course of the next century, perhaps even half-century. I feel like almost no one is even having the conversation."

Or not run out, but we've passed the peak - there will be less and less each year, soon, as the world demands more and more).   This is pretty much dead wrong. Not only has the world’s oil supply failed to disappear, but production has substantially expanded in the past couple of decades and will continue to do so. Since 1995 alone, the year that Hubbert (who developed the notion of peak oil) claimed that global oil production would peak, production is up 33% to over 93.2 million b/d, and both the EIA and IEA project that output will increase by about 1 million b/d per year for years to come. New oil supply has actually been rising faster than ever.   It's not a limitless supply, but by all current measures, we are nowhere near the peak."

For instance, simple external hard drive sync works well on Win7, but try to install and then sync the same external drive in a Win8 desktop and nothing happens! I'm guessing Win10's architecture is more similar to Win8.1 than Win7.   I suggest most people should test Win10 before fully commiting thereby deactivating their Win7 license.

CDMA phones, on the other hand, didn't require the use of SIM cards. However, activation was more of a pain. You either had to call into customer service and read to them the ESN, log online and activate an ESN, or go into a store to activate an ESN. This process is very inefficient and very slow. Not only that, you run the risk of having server errors that makes the process that much harder.  The last time I went into Verizon, it took nearly 30 minutes to get 3 phones activated. The store computers had communication error with the activation server, so it took a while to activate the phones.

Alexis (kn0thing) about it in Forbes   Speaking of the founding fathers, I ask him what he thinks they would have thought of Reddit. “A bastion of free speech on the World Wide Web? I bet they would like it,” he replies. It’s the digital form of political pamphlets.   Reddit was about free speech. To say other wise is silly. Reddit is free to change their minds about that, but bullshitting that Reddit has never stood for it is a load of crap and insulting to their userbase.  The problem with censorship is: where do you draw the line? Some groups would label the men's rights movement as a gate group, let's ban them. Christians are seen as bigots to atheists, let's ban their subs.   With how Reddit used to treat free speech, if you got banned for being a dick you were free to go make your own sub where you can be a dick freely. Moda can suppress speech to some extent, but those advocating for free speech aren't advocating for a Mad Max world were anything anywhere goes, but a place you won't get permabanned for going against the grain. If you feel  /r/science is pushing an agenda you were free to go make your own science sub. That's freedom of speech."

And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.""  I totally agree with that statement. Racism, violence or hate directed towards a group of people, suggestive or sexual content featuring minors - These topics shouldn't be on Reddit. If you want, you can defend the merits of racist circle jerks, snuff films, and child porn, but ""free speech"" doesn't even apply to this discussion. None of those topics are protected under 'freedom of speech' anywhere, and certainly not here.  Freedom of speech has always had limitations. You cant shout ""Fire"" in a crowded building, you cant lay on unwanted sexual advances towards whomever you like, you can't threaten someone or a group with violence or danger. ""Free Speech"" is an illusion that never existed on Reddit or 4Chan, or any other website, for that matter. It's not your 'right' to make someone feel violated or in danger because your inflated self-worth revolves around an abstract concept like ""free speech"".  also, im a part of Reddit's userbase, don't make it seem like everyone on your side are the ""real redditors"". you can go have fun on Voat"
technology,3dhux5,Byrnhildr_Sedai,4,Thu Jul 16 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they've back peddled, hence I used past tense.  That's incorrect, racism is legal in the US, as is hatred. Only if it exists in words and not actions (that is actually acting on that hated) and online it's in the form of words. And speaking outside legally protected, for a time it was protected on Reddit, 4chan, 8ch, Voar, etc. There are places online who hold out true and don't ban people for beliefs but actions.  Cp and sniff are illegal though, pretty much internationally, due to them having a victim. Not even under the US's wide protection on speech are they legal, they do more harm than good. (And only the possession of cp is illegal). Nor is racism comparable to cp.  Actually, that fire in a crowded theater example has been overruled buy Brandenburg vs Ohio. You miss the commonality between your examples: they all involve the immediate actionable threats to someone's safety. Being racist doesn't produce that, unless it's coupled with something that already produces that effect. Ergo a racist threat is not protected because it's a threat, not because it's racist. Racists comments are not threats.  Racist and sexist comments are protected under free speech.   ""Free Speech"" is an illusion that never existed on Reddit or 4Chan, or any other website, for that matter.    I'm not even sure how to reply to that, of a website acts in a manner that protects free speech, non threatening words, then it's not an illusion.   It's not your 'right' to make someone feel violated or in danger because your inflated self-worth revolves around an abstract concept like ""free speech"".   No one is arguing that free speech covers actionable threats to people.  It is my right to have my voice be heard, regardless of my political opinions. Just because I don't toe the Democratic party line doesn't mean I lose the right to speak.  That's free speech, not threats.  My inflated self worth? I'm trying to have this conversation in earnest, so shove it with the insults.     also, im a part of Reddit's userbase, don't make it seem like everyone on your side are the ""real redditors"". you can go have fun on Voat   I've never done the sort, I've never implied you're not a real Redditor. Why do I have to leave? I'm just as much of a user as you, I'm just as much of a product to Reddit. I'm unhappy with how things are going and more unhappy with how unprofessionally Reddit has handled things. I'm being vocal about that, why is it so wrong for me to complain? I'm using my words, to see if I can make change by persuading the admins to change their course. Free speech gives me the right to complain, without it dissenting opinions might be banned."
technology,3dhux5,silverbean,-2,Thu Jul 16 19:39:33 2015 UTC,"well, you've defended the merits of racist circle jerk subreddits admirably. You're right, it is legal to be racist and bigoted. I'm guessing you're totally cool w the subreddits that were removed. They are expressing their right to anonymously shame fat people, to discuss violence against blacks or Muslims or whoever else is the target of organized internet hatred. We might as well have a subreddit to discuss the positives of child pornography (so long as no laws are broken), if this site is suddenly about the free expression of every single idea out there. All I'm getting off your comment is - so long as they don't break any nation or international laws, it should be a free-for-all.  This is not an example of ""I disagree with what you say but I will fight for your right to say it"" - Freedom of speech really has nothing to do with the removal of these subs. These groups are hatful and I think Reddit is much better off without them. Really, we should be able to agree that subreddits dedicated entirely to shaming or hating on people should not be here.   R/Trees is wildly popular and I think there's a meth users subreddit that gets a lot of traffic. There are plenty of weird and perverted kink subs. Those should remain on Reddit, and no one is talking about banning dissenting ideas in particular subreddits, but sale/purchase of illegal items, sexually explicit content of minors, and hate groups should not be on this site. I don't care if the constitution protects your right to be racist, bigoted, and hateful - those people are wrong and they should be left behind. I really do not want the KKK organizing rallies on Reddit, and I think we can agree that racism and bigotry incites and causes violence. That is not too much to ask and no one is stepping on your free-expression toes."
technology,3dhux5,mismanaged,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"You are deliberately missing the point.  What about when /r/trees is banned for encouraging illegal activity? Will you say ""Oh yes drugs are harmful they were right to ban it?""  /r/opiates had someone writing there saying the sub had contributed to a friend's death, what happens when that sentiment leads to the sub getting banned?  What happens when /r/nsfw is banned for making pornography easily accessible to children? (plenty of young people on reddit)  Just because we disagree with people doesn't mean it's ok for us to kick them out.   I think we can agree that racism and bigotry incites and causes violence.   Seriously? Let's start banning /r/gaming because videogames cause violence, along with /r/gore (desensitises people) and all the religious subreddits because hey, their philosophies advocate killing people for being gay!  Want a hateful community to up and leave? Post contrary opinions on their sub. If everyone who was against racism actively frequented the hate subs and posted contrary content/opinions there constantly how long do you think it would last? Not only, you might actually change someone's opinions and make one less person hateful.  That is why freedom of speech is important, they get to talk and we get to disagree. Forcing them into another place where they will just be in a philosophical echo chamber is not the right idea."

These are the views of a couple of individuals in San Francisco, which do not represent the world in any way for a base line.   It's the height of arrogance to assume your views present the majority's.  This is why freedom of speech is so important otherwise you end up with the few at top deciding for everyone what's an appropriate viewpoint and what's not.

Based on my experiences with the Youtube music beta, this is likely Youtube trying to get its ducks in a row for copyright owners. The main reason I signed up for the beta was that it allows youtube videos to be played in the background and/or with the screen off- but that feature craps out without warning if you try it on certain vids, likely as a concession to companies with content claims (Nintendo soundtracks are the most reliable example I've found). Knowing that they're going after other tools like this to enforce that behavior is really frustrating. The user experience is awful."

technology,3dm6cb,jandhyde,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:24:39 2015 UTC,I was conflicted over the title and finally decided on 'a self-awareness test' as there are multiple interpretations as to what constitutes self-awareness.  Here's for instance another AI who passed Turing test by pretending to be a 13-yr old Ukrainian boy from Odessa.
technology,3dm6cb,jandhyde,2,Fri Jul 17 13:31:21 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate your enthusiasm on the topic that particular example is not a good one.  I've read about it before and you can find several articles explaining why that chatbot didn't actually pass the Turing Test.  Here - https://nathandickey.wordpress.com/2014/06/22/did-a-computer-program-pass-the-turing-test/  Here's an even better article - https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-computer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml  If you don't have time to read either article here are the highlights...  ""It's not a ""supercomputer,"" it's a chatbot. It's a script made to mimic human conversation. There is no intelligence, artificial or not involved. It's just a chatbot.  Plenty of other chatbots have similarly claimed to have ""passed"" the Turing test in the past (often with higher ratings). Here's a story from three years ago about another bot, Cleverbot, ""passing"" the Turing Test by convincing 59% of judges it was human (much higher than the 33% Eugene Goostman) claims.  It ""beat"" the Turing test here by ""gaming"" the rules -- by telling people the computer was a 13-year-old boy from Ukraine in order to mentally explain away odd responses.  The ""rules"" of the Turing test always seem to change. Hell, Turing's original test was quite different anyway.  As Chris Dixon points out, you don't get to run a single test with judges that you picked and declare you accomplished something. That's just not how it's done. If someone claimed to have created nuclear fusion or cured cancer, you'd wait for some peer review and repeat tests under other circumstances before buying it, right?  The whole concept of the Turing Test itself is kind of a joke. While it's fun to think about, creating a chatbot that can fool humans is not really the same thing as creating artificial intelligence. Many in the AI world look on the Turing Test as a needless distraction.""  Edit: Your original post is incredibly misleading.  It did not pass a self-awareness test.  It processed a few If-Then statements.  There is no consciousness behind those robots, nothing to make it self-aware."

That's like each one holding a light and the ""scientists' turn 2 of them off, then ask which one has a light that's on.

technology,3ddpb2,acidmonkey,19,Thu Jul 16 03:52:01 2015 UTC,"Reddit is no longer homogenous enough to have a content curation system based on a gross total of community votes. Back in the early days of reddit, quality content made it to the front page more often than reposts because the community voting for it shared similar interests are were more in tune with what content they had already viewed.  As the user base grew it created a cascading cycle of reposts where content that had already made it to the front page was then reinvigorated by new users who hadn't seen it. As the new users outweighed the old ones, it started to alienate the original base and make it harder to get original content noticed.  Now reddit is at critical mass where the vast majority of posts that make it to the front page do so because they pander to the lowest common denominator of the current, very large user base. Unfortunately, this kind content is usually not very good.  What reddit needs to do is move to a more relativistic and personalized method of content curation. This is no simple task, and would require a total overhaul of the systems involved. Upvotes need to have more meaning for the user, not just the content creator. As well as elevating content it needs to act as a personalized filter, identifying other users who voted similarly and using their voting habits to influence your future content. By creating invisible networks of users it will naturally elevate the discourse and content on the site.  There are a number of other methods that could be used as well, but that's the basis of my idea."
technology,3ddpb2,Narshero,21,Wed Jul 15 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"Perhaps one solution would be to split Reddit into smaller communities based on topic, and allow users to view content from only those communities they wished to be involved with. The smaller, more individualized communities would hypothetically bypass the issue of repost cascading that you described, with lowest-common-denominator content relegated only to the largest or the least tightly-focused communities.   We could even come up with a catchy name for these sub-sections of Reddit. Demi-Reddits? Categor-reditts, maybe? Whatever, we'll think of something.  (I'm mostly joking. My real point is, your personal frontpage will only continue to be crap until you un-sub from the places where that crap content is posted.)"
technology,3ddpb2,acidmonkey,3,Wed Jul 15 20:39:19 2015 UTC,"Sure, if you're only subscribed to small subs that's not an issue. But that's becoming increasingly difficult as the higher quality subs will begin to quickly grow to unsustainable sizes."
technology,3ddpb2,jippmokk,3,Wed Jul 15 20:49:23 2015 UTC,"I think the mod system is another issue. I'm starting to doubt that large forums being moderated by individual users is optimal. I've seen this in community after community. It always ends up with infighting, drama, power-abuse and so on. This is mostly due to to mods in general not always being the most mature and even keeled.. and those attracted to power and status are the ones that shouldn't wield it. Or it might just be that assignment of mods is pretty random and the chance of finding good ones are very small. Also having specific persons wield power paints a target for trolls and dissidents.   Karma , mod status etc have both great pros and cons. The pro is that it triggers people to chase them, submitting more content and moderating. The con is that it creates a meta game where the achievement of such can become more important than the quality or joy of it.  Some subreddits have done a  tremendous job so you can't fault them all. I does however seem to add an unnecessary power-struggle dimension to some subreddits.   also think the dynamics change depending on the subreddit and size, and they need different solutions.  Basically mods have two functions. To enforce the rules and curate content.  It feels like enforcing part could be substituted by more intelligent crowd-sourcing, an emergent system where the collective will ranked by historical performance would identify spam and  content that break the rules.     Forming and ""shaping"" an subreddit is harder to do, if it becomes too much of a democracy it will only cater to the lowest denominator. However, maybe this dimension could be eliminated by your suggestion above, it doesn't matter what content is submitted since your view of  it adapts to your personal tastes.  Now obviously mods are needed for some other aspects, coordinating and acting as a ""voice"" of the community. But perhaps by removing some of the most blunt weapons there would be less infighting.  Anyways, community building is a really tough subject and changing an existing one even more so. What am I describing would be different but not necessarily better since  no doubt that model has it flaws as well, would be interesting to see though. Slashdot kinda went in this direction and it seemed to be working quite well."

technology,3ddpb2,DeliriousPrecarious,76,Wed Jul 15 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"Digg died for MUCH SMALLER infractions.   And this is where I completely disagree with you. Digg died because they fundamentally changed the way users interact with the site. In reducing user engagement and moving to curated content they totally changed their business model. Digg became something more like the huffington post than an actual community driven news aggregator.  What Reddit is doing, in purging these marginal hate subs impacts a minority of users by removing places where they used to congregate. The majority of users really don't care because their interaction with the site has not changed in any meaningful way."

Reddit has made some glaring errors lately, and I don't doubt they'll go the way of Digg, in time, and much slower, if they keep it up like this.

I'm not new at internet forums.  Trolls exist; wacky personalities exist.  The personality spectrum is fine and a part of what you get for dealing with people outside your immediate circle of friends.  The community in 2015 is out of hand.  Following the FPH banning I witness a total and complete hijacking of the front page for a solid week wherein I couldn't so much as open this site without being flooded with horrible tripe and the absolute most awful of behavior imaginable on a website.  That period drove me to various meta-Reddit subs, some of which I've been posting on for a good while, but others I had not.  I can't in good faith believe this site's community is going to take whatever plans Steve has lying down.  Once the content and subs are removed (For what it's worth I believe multiple meta-Reddit subs will also be removed), I expect an outcry of much larger proportions will take place.  It sucks.

I think it's the best web-based forum UI out there. But the karma system and the centralized control really lets the air out of it. Even the reddit admins tacitly admitted that they have lost faith in the karma system last year when they decided to hide up/downvote ratios ""(?/?)"".  I still think that decentralization, no community censorship (a.k.a. karma), and client-side filtering is the way to go."
technology,3ddpb2,ElectronicZombie,3,Wed Jul 15 18:53:10 2015 UTC,What do you mean by decentralization and client-side filtering?
technology,3ddpb2,rumpumpumpum,3,Wed Jul 15 22:20:00 2015 UTC,"Decentralization is where a service is made up of a network of hosts that operate independently of each other, and users of the service can choose which host they connect to. IRC and UseNet are examples of decentralized services. It allows users to choose which host they patronize based on the host's policies, performance, or pricing.  Client-side filtering is where you do your own filtering within your client software. If you don't like another user you filter them out, just like spam filters in email programs, so that you no longer see them. Once again IRC's /ignore command and UseNet client's killfiles are examples of client-side filtering. It gives individual users control over what they see and eliminates the bullshit associated with group editorship systems like karma which have the side effect of turning discussion forums into popularity contests."
technology,3ddpb2,Khnagar,3,Wed Jul 15 23:11:27 2015 UTC,"The threaded discussion forum type on reddit is very old, and not really particularly great or improved compared to other places that have used it before.  The main reason for hiding the downvote/upvote count was probably to make it less visible when admins and mods prevents certain topics from hitting the first page on a subreddit or from appearing on the front page.  Like today, when one of several posts critizing Amazon Prime Day got 5000+ points in less than four hours, but somehow did not end up on the front page.  Reddit could also implement public mod logs, like other forums and places have. That way everyone can see what has been removed, banned and the reasons for it. Technically this is not difficult or time consuming to do. But reddit admins are not particularly interested in that kind of transperency.  A relatively hands-off approach as far as content goes is what has made reddit into what it is today, but the messages from admins lately make it clear that some offensive content and communities will be removed."

The main reason for hiding the downvote/upvote count was probably   Here's the original announcement thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/   Reddit could also implement public mod logs, like other forums and places have.   But they won't, and there's nothing you or I can do about that no matter how much of an improvement it would be. In a decentralized system we could boycott a server that refused to make improvements without having to find somewhere else to go. We could just go to another server with the same service.

Beyond that I haven't heard anything good about it's functionality.   how Voat isn't a viable substitute either   Voat has a lot of unused space on both the left and right sides. Links are light blue and the page background is white. Reddit uses a link color that is just a little darker than Voat and as a result it is easier to read. Reddit's font is a little larger and thicker too. The combined effect of these is that Reddit is a much better reading experience.  Other than that Voat is in early development.

Reddit serves a population that's orders of magnitude larger than Voat and needs a viable business model to keep the servers running.

Those of us that realize and accept that Reddit is a for-profit corporation have no problem with a team of admins removing hate communities or banning users.  We assume that they are doing it, and - in fact - believe that many of the better channels (like r/science) are better for it.  Reddit business model = Google business model.

No, that's not the issue. That amendment is based off of the free speech ideals of the enlightenment, not the other way around.   We all know it's a corporation and can do what it wants.

Morality, free speech, and all those beautiful things, pale in comparison with seeing one's pockets full. How many changes has this website seen in the last years? Investing in development is costly, and people at the top rather have their pockets full.  Reddit is like the automobile industry.

Since about five years I managed to convince my employers to move to Unity more and more. I'm not a designer who learned some scripting. I did C++ / Direct X years before Macromedia Flash existed.  Thing is, actionscript is a great language with an awesome standard library. The flash runtime has loads of functionality built-in. But Adobe just decided to fuck it all up. Until today, I have no clue why. They were doing so well. But they never improved the promising flex UI system, they let it die. They never fixed the eclipse bugs after flash builder 4.7. They never adopted a better IDE, like FDT, they stuck with mediocre. They never upgraded Flash Professional (the editor) to work with the updates to the framework, most significantly Stage3D. At one point, I think it was in 2013, they presented a very ambitious roadmap, suggesting flash as the biggest game platform, with an audience bigger than playstation, Xbox and steam combined. But that was just talk.

Implementation HAS to be left up to the browser developers, you can't change that. So if Google wrote an HTML5 feature into YouTube, and it only runs in Chrome, is Chrome not following the standard, or is everyone else not following the standard, or does the standard leave too much to interpretation?

Sure, the governments do work much slower than the public sector but a lot of the times it is because of the vendor. Some entities are behind on purpose, others are because they have no alternative. Or, if they do they can't switch because of budget concerns and lifecycles they have to stick with or just because some lazy lawyer wants to hold up a contract just because he can.

First it was, we need more freedom in the browser, no, security reasons, remove it, you have to create proprietary ways to achieve the same thing.  Death of flash means the death of millions of games and entertainment. Death of NPAPI means the death of plugins like the unity webplayer. It hasn't taken off really well but there's still a lot of content out there that will simply not work in the future.  And the unity WebGL is a joke! It's bloated, slow and doesn't have features that browser games need. Sockets cough  Pushing this is only the death of choice. Security reasons? Meh, maybe it's just my ignorance but I've seen no actual hacks of flash or another plugin that were severe. But that's only based on 15+ years of experience so take that with a grain of salt. Maybe there is, but then again, there also was the PNG steganography exploit that embedded JS code in the actual image. It's not that these security flaws will go away just because you drop features."

Thing I learned, Flash uses the PPAPI from Google since last december. It's a sandbox API, so there should be limitations within Flash from the browser.

Enterprise SSDs are almost like RAM, losing data if they lose power for several days. So of course the speeds are going to be similar. An EVO 845DC is a $650 SSD and has about the same IOPS as 1600 CL9 RAM: 100,000.  Your consumer level SSDs are still not as fast as RAM, don't go thinking that."
technology,3dfnsp,Iggyhopper,9,Thu Jul 16 05:22:08 2015 UTC,"Most DDR3 1333 RAM has a throughput of around 22000MB/s.  Even enterprise PCIe SSDs cannot yet match that without saturating the CPU or BUS first, even in a RAID array.  My current desktop has 32GB of RAM, that I bought for $100.  It goes at around 25000MB/s.  My SSD runs at 500MB/s  Even if I had 10 PCIe SSDs(which cannot fit even in most server chassis), and the PCIe lanes to handle that much I/O throughput, you are still only looking at around 10000MB/s at best, and that will saturate your que long before a better speed is reached.  Currently, RAM is the cheapest and fastest way to keep stuff hot.  A RAMdisk will run at around 6000MB/s, which is a shit load faster than any SSD on the market, and while it will lose data on power outages, most servers are on battery backups to withstand a power outage and still get a clean shutdown."
technology,3dfnsp,chubbysumo,3,Thu Jul 16 06:40:27 2015 UTC,"Another incredibly important metric is access times.  Modern DRAM can be accessed in about 100ns.  The very best SSD is somewhere around 0.01ms, two orders of magnitude slower.  Not so important if your reads are largely sequential, a dealbreaker if you expect fast random access.  Taking a >10,000 cycle stall every single uncached access is simply unacceptable.  tl;dr: Flash isn't going to replace DRAM anymore than DRAM replaced CPU cache.  They serve very different purposes and require different characteristics."

technology,3dfnsp,TheArabianKnightMC,2,Thu Jul 16 06:57:19 2015 UTC,"enterprise storage industry has had all-flash arrays for a few years but they are only recently coming into their own.  My banking client is currently running a proof-of-concept bake-off with all-flash arrays from several different storage vendors.  You would not believe the speeds and throughput (IOPS) they can achieve.  Also storage arrays using flash drives as a front-end cache for hybrid storage aggregates (SSD drives and physical spinning disk drives in the same virtual storage device) have been around for years.  Essentially, every thing that is 'hot' (i.e. accessed frequently) is held in the flash part of the aggregate while less-accessed data goes down to spinning disk.  So yeah, at an enterprise level, flash (SSD) drives have been used for a while now but they are pretty expensive - for instance, my customer paid 96K for a shelf of 24 400GB SSD flash drives.  That works out to about $1000/TB, but that is pretty heavily discounted.  That price also factors in 4 years of warranty support.  I know you can get consumer grade SSD drives for much cheaper."

technology,3dcco6,mach-2,262,Wed Jul 15 04:54:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's much regret needed here.  To be clear, Pao did not deserve the racist, sexist, death-threat bile and vitriol thrown her way; a lot of people were downright vile. Nobody deserves that.  But as a CEO, and especially as a communicator, she really did not do a good job. /r/fatpeoplehate was handled very poorly. Firing Victoria (deserved or not - and we'll never really know) was handled poorly.  The whole point of corporate leadership is to provide leadership, and a big part of that skillset is to communicate with the people you are leading. In a community-customer environment like Reddit, that means communicating with your customer base as much as your employees.  She failed at this on multiple occasions and riled up the whole user base. An effective CEO would have realized that there was going to be significant user pushback in advance, and would have had a plan in place to mitigate the consequences before pulling the trigger.  With a user base this active and this reactionary, you cannot shoot first and put out the fires later.  And now the Eye of Sauron is on Reddit. Gawker, the NYfreakin'T - the press is watching and reporting in real time. Uncalcuable damage is being done to Reddit's reputation right now, and it is ultimately Pao's fault as an operator for allowing things to get to this point."
technology,3dcco6,NorthStarZero,98,Wed Jul 15 05:54:59 2015 UTC,According to a post by Yishan (source: http://arstechnica.co.uk/business/2015/07/reddit-loses-another-prominent-female-employee-as-chief-engineer-quits/) the decision to fire Victoria was Alexis' decision and basically let Ellen took the fall for it.

technology,3dcco6,TheAllMightySlothKin,135,Wed Jul 15 05:36:09 2015 UTC,"Hope the people at Voat are ready this time.   I thought I read it was a single guy who built it as a university project? If so, he's doing well for himself.  That would actually make sense, though.  Reddit was originally built by early 20-somethings and it's always had scaling issues. Not to the level Voat has, but in a similar vein. People who know how to code, but haven't had to deal with SCALE lack experience with scaling.  I'm with Paul Graham (yCombinator) on some of this... people without years of biases can come up with great ideas. BUT, that does not mean that those same people can carry it to fruition.  I have worked with some excellent engineers in my career and I'd be willing to bet dollars to donuts that if they were properly funded 5-6 of us  could build a 100% free-speech Reddit clone (possibly with useful mod tools) in less than six months.   The problem is that ""properly funded"" means something different when you're hiring people who are old enough to accrue the necessary experience. Those people do not live off Ramen and they certainly can't be expected (forced?) to move to the Bay Area without 2-300k salaries. I'd expect a 100-150k salary + expenses to be average, if you allowed 100% remote.    TLDR: If the community wants a reddit with free speech they're going to have to pony up... and I don't mean turning off adblock. A proper clone needs 6-800k a year in development staff alone. Figure in some generic admins and a /u/chooter or two and we're looking at 1.5 million just to break even.   I'm dubious the Kickstarter / CloneGold contributions would even come close."

Ellen as CEO, would be violating her NDA if she revealed the private details of the board and their future agenda  She would be fired if she tried to save her own ass by revealing, ""It's not me that wants to ban the subreddits, it's the board! I'm fighting to protect you ..."" yada yada yada.   I mean, it would be pretty hard to work for your bosses after throwing them under the bus (she already learned that the hard way).  If Yishan had leaked this info a while Ellen was CEO, she would still likely be fired  Yishan is still Ellen's friend  They could have accused her of politicking through Yishan  Or at best, it would make the board look really, really bad, and just put Ellen in an even worse position, trying placate both the community and her bosses while moving the company forward.  She did what she was paid to do, take her lumps  Who knows? If they hadn't convince Huffman to come back (the only other truly viable CEO option) maybe they would have weathered the storm with her.   https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3t0ks?context=3     [–]yishan 202 points 4 hours ago   No, I'm probably un-hireable now  I'm pretty sure no one will ever hire me as a CEO or any other executive position again.   https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3outy?context=3"

It's not like our worlds stop revolving around the sun once Reddit starts to suck. Reddit is the one that's screwed if they continue on this path. Some one else will build something to put in it's place. Voat isn't doing too bad now when it's not being DDoS'ed back to the Stone Age.  The hate based subreddits suck and they are full of shitty people, but the world is full of shitty people. Getting rid of the subreddit doesn't get rid of those people. It just pushes them into other communities where the can do more damage or pollute other good subreddits.  There's no horse to back in this fight, just sit back and enjoy the fireworks as it burns. Reddit Corp will either come to their senses or it will crash and burn. It wouldn't be the first time good sites have tanked and I am sure it won't be the last. Ellen Pao wasn't good for reddit, but it doesn't seem like anyone else who is actually left there is. There are a lot of news articles claiming that Reddit is a hateful, toxic community. Sure, while some of that exists in pockets on the community most of us aren't like that.   Reddit Corp. however does seem to be filled with quite a few toxic elements that are not good to have in any business environment. It's pretty much out of our hands and the boards is going to do what they want to, so lets just sit back and watch them torch what they built and try to enjoy it while it lasts.

technology,3dcco6,notsurewhatiam,203,Wed Jul 15 05:39:33 2015 UTC,That's one major problem with the upvote downvote system in reddit.   Highly upvoted comments may seem like the 'correct' opinion/response and vice versa.
technology,3dcco6,yrogerg123,26,Wed Jul 15 06:07:36 2015 UTC,"Have you ever tried a large forum without a filtering system? It's way fucking worse. At least here you can let somebody else wade through the shit, and just assume you'll see ten or so relevant comments in each post. Obviously, you're not seeing the ones that cut to the core, but you definitely wouldn't ever find them at first glance in other formats either. I'll take what's popular over what's first any day."
technology,3dcco6,Watertor,46,Wed Jul 15 06:11:32 2015 UTC,"I think upvotes are a good system to help weed out the shit posting but I feel downvotes are the problem, it destroys countering opinions and actual discussion. If people cited themselves more there would be no real concern for the most popular answer being the right one because the right one would be supported by facts and not buried by downvotes before others have a chance to get to it."
technology,3dcco6,HRTS5X,37,Wed Jul 15 07:46:37 2015 UTC,"The whole system, not just the downvotes, needs to be culled for something that doesn't give way to ""I agree with you"" spamming. Hiveminds exist because of upvotes just as much as downvotes. People are too impatient to read one comment let alone a whole thread.  The system should go off of replies. This leads to incentive being given to not respond to troll comments. And comments that give way to actual discussion with numerous replies are more likely to be seen.   It's not a perfect system but the up/down vote system is awful. The best I can come up with."
technology,3dcco6,Stosstruppe,12,Wed Jul 15 06:46:48 2015 UTC,"Youtube uses a reply-total based system as far as I know, and it's utterly awful. People just say extremely controversial stuff to troll, and people will still reply. Many Youtubers just outright ban their comment sections and tell people to go to Reddit to discuss videos. Even if there's incentive to not respond to troll comments, it doesn't mean people won't. No system is ever going to be perfect, simply because you're giving the power to decide what's good to humans, and humans, absolutely including myself, are biased, oftentimes uninformed or otherwise just not reliable. Up/Downvotes aren't too bad as far as things go."
technology,3dcco6,Duggers,30,Wed Jul 15 06:48:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah well just because a comment has 600 upvotes doesn't mean its right or wrong. Same if someone is -125. Some subreddits don't like to hear the truth, some subreddits are really sensitive to unpopular opinions."
technology,3dcco6,ArsenalZT,251,Wed Jul 15 08:08:47 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means an active poster on the site, but I joined the site 8 years ago and have been a hardcore lurker since.  I don't know if it's because I was a teenager at the time and I've matured since but more and more I've found that vast swathes of the more popular subs have lost their appeal for me because of this mentality. There are lots of smaller subs that I still enjoy viewing though.  Maybe I'm just a hypocrite for not taking part so much."
technology,3dcco6,AnOnlineHandle,38,Wed Jul 15 07:53:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's the evolution of things, both the site and us as individuals. As its gotten more popular, Reddit attracts a younger crowd. But we as people kind of become jaded to the same jokes and circlejerks and mentalities, so it doesn't have the same magic.  It's like most things in life I suppose. You have to find your own ways to make things interesting and new, otherwise you stagnate."

Much of the content back then was interesting or amusing stuff. It was kind of an intelligent website. But now it's just filled with memes and stupid injokes. As the site has gained in popularity the content has degraded which is a byproduct of popular culture really, things are dumbed down for the common denominator.  However, popularity has brought a ton of people to the site who have built great, interesting communities that are untouched by memes and drama.

You can install special panels on your roof to assist water heating. This is much more efficient than PV panels and saves either electricity or gas depending on what type of water heater you already have.  Also for solar plants, much better to use mirrors to heat a liquid and then use a standard vapor turbine to create electricity. It's also obvious how you store energy in this case: large tanks with heated liquid. That exactly how the largest solar plants work, eg. Andasol in Spain. Batteries are crap for energy storage. Energy density is orders of magnitude lower than say oil.  Also knowing the poor building standards in US you will save more energy by better insulating building. That will require less heating and/or less AC. Of course depends on the location, but the cooler it is the more this insulation will net."

The US currently has enough raw ore stored to support the whole worlds current consumption for decades (And this does not include the massive reserves still in the ground or the rest of the world reserves.)  The only reason China was able to corner the market is because they were willing to pollute the hell out of their lands to corner the market. After they tried to mess with the markets companies and governments all around the world restarted refining in other countries.  On a side note.... that green power you are getting from Solar.... does not have as green a footprint as we would like.

You can't refuse to because I'm a minority (granted many times minorities just aren't seen... black people just aren't visible at night!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coWeV7UpP4U).  Once the taxi stops and the passenger opens the door the taxi has to take him/her to their location (provided it is within the legal service area). They cannot refuse to go to the Bronx after 11pm.  Now Uber's services are different in two important ways:   Passengers are rated by drivers. Its possible that Uber drivers could systematically downgrade minorities in ratings and then under serve them. So the state needs data on average passenger ratings together with associated protected statuses of passengers to verify that is not happening. Drivers know the destination pickup location before pickup, so again they could systematically be refusing to serve certain neighborhoods, so again the state needs information on pickup/drop-off and service response times to verify that nothing discriminatory is going on."

Drivers are required to have a special type of insurance to delivery pizza, as well as to deliver any goods using their personal vehicle.  Most, if not all drivers don't do this.  I bet Uber drivers don't do it either.    With taxis, at least you have experienced drivers in an insured vehicle.  Uber gives you people with cars and virtually no guarantee of insurance except for the driver's good fortune to go out and buy insurance.

On top of that you must maintain regular maintenance, the vehicle must be mechanically sound and be in top worjing order.

Don't know about other states. But most of the time even with the fee it comes out more profitable for the driver than being a cabbie and because of uber's strict requirements for driver's to meet their cities rating standards it pays off for the passenger as well. I've been driving uber for about 6 months now. Work 2 nights a week, make about 500 a week off of maybe 12 hours and when I have been questioned by local cops for parking in taxi lanes they were knowledgeable enough to just say okay you're set and leave me be.   Now I'm not in a city with a heavy cab presence so I have that benefit of a taxi union not having a strong enough presence but uber for the most part covers their ass and the ass of the drivers especially when it could lead to company shut downs because of risking the passengers."

Anyways, Uber offered a job, but put all the risks on the drivers, and this has backfired against them because I am sure they did not expect to get sued like they have been.   As it stands, all Uber drivers need insurance, but Uber doesn't specify to them that they need a special type of insurance because they are now commercial drivers, if employed by Uber.

technology,3dg7u9,jmontygman,0,Thu Jul 16 07:21:23 2015 UTC,"But the stats show many HBO subscribers cancel when their main show isn't being run. Where as Netflix users typically keep the sub all year (because the content changes frequently enough). I know it's a knit picky difference but it shows a difference in the customers and what they're subscribers to especially since HBO was tied to the TV package. Adding and removing it wasn't that big of a deal for enough people. It was just adding and removing the ""premium"" channels when cool stuff was on.  My point is that if Netflix can slowly start adding more ""premium"" content they can start slowly charging more and more. Which in turn is going to pressure channels like HULU, HBO and STARS. Those channels don't really have a lot to fall back on right now. Especially Hulu and Stars. HBO could try and shell out another hit show but that isn't exactly easy. Netflix has a much better approach with originals. That way they can shotgun out a dozen shows a year and pick the few that really have traction and continue. Everything else is/was a nice little mini series.  I have a lot of faith in Netflix to ride this one out. To be honest I think HBO is riding their brand and like 2 or 3 popular shows. And I think stars and Hulu are just waiting to be crushed by the bigger players.  Edit: I also believe Netflix will be able to keep all of their original series. And I'm sure they bought the rights to several of them. So with time they could build a pretty good collection of their own exclusive content. Just a thought. Seems like if you take away licenses. Netflix and HBO are some of the only services with actual exclusive content."

technology,3diuio,UnluckyPenguin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"something about this seems off....  Sending communications through a cellular network does decouple the internet access and could work for a dead drop access point that is used once for a short period of time and then never again as it would be less likely to ever be tracked back to the physical device.  But if you are utilizing cellular networks, which are watched and tracked by the phone companies I wouldn't be surprised at all if the NSA would detect it immediately before it even connected to the end point WiFi network.  If authorities did ever locate the device I'm guessing it would not be too hard to determine the cellular account information and track it back the originating end point.  Even if you have systems to monitor the end points and attempt to erase or destroy them should someone show up to monitor them, a sting ray device could potentially monitor out of visual range.  I would also consider the towers them selves compromised from an anonymity perspective.  Seems like building mesh net in dense urban environment made up of multiple devices that allow one to bounce traffic around to multiple access points would provide more anonymity, especially if such a net utilized with (can't find the right term but its something like this) pulsating data bursts and each node generating a high percentage of random and or replayed noise to all other nodes within range.

technology,3dgd2y,caster,5,Thu Jul 16 06:04:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, everyone saw this wall coming from far away. It's already here and nothing magic has happened. Nobody expects the shrinking rate to go to r=0, but it will definitively slow down, at least until a very different tech comes up -- but who knows how long it will take.   If and when it does come up, there's no reason for it to be as fast (or as slow) as Moore's law was. Moore's law was in large part an industry construct anyway: there was a large incentive to not go slower than it (since your main competitor was expected to keep that pace), and a strong incentive to not go much faster (throwing all your technical improvements at once may leave you for a long time without progress, jeopardizing value generated by new product lines).  I honestly think it will be great seeing the industry shift towards looking for architectural innovations. We are stuck with an essentially 50 year old model of computing (save a few improvements like multi-threading and pipelining) due to Moore's law."
technology,3dgd2y,darkmighty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:30:40 2015 UTC,"shrinking rate to go to r=0   That's a very narrow view that dooms Moore's Law once you hit the physical limits of quantum physics.  Suppose instead that Moore's Law is about information processing capability generally, and not just die size on semiconductors. Moore's Law was in effect before there were semiconductors, or even humans.  The next logical step might be photonics, or biocomputers, perhaps even quantum computers, or something we currently don't even know about yet. Much like how we went from analog computers to printed semiconductors, a different medium will succeed printed semiconductors that will be more capable than the current technology.  For example we are clearly seeing a trend of increasing numbers of cores because we're hitting the limits of how powerful one core can get. Perhaps the future of computers is massively parallel processing using a ridiculously large number of independent processors- more like a human brain in some respects.  It's possible there may be a significant gap before this new technology matures enough- it happened with the printed semiconductor. But then the semiconductor obviously overtook everything that came before, in a big way."
technology,3dgd2y,caster,3,Thu Jul 16 06:40:45 2015 UTC,"No that is not a narrow view. That is the definition of Moore's Law. There is no implication about performance, it is merely a statement about increasing transistor density. Moore himself has stated that the law will fail as we approach the size of atoms."
technology,3dgd2y,mabellon,5,Thu Jul 16 07:33:50 2015 UTC,"Right, but what are we talking about then? Because it's not Moore's law anymore. Sure, ""most things will progress some time"" is obviously true. Actually, it's a well known trend that technologies (it was observed even with airplanes, rockets, etc) tend to have a periods of exponential improvement that dies down.   Will computers improve? Obviously. We're still have a lot to improve , just by comparing the capacity/price/power consumption of a brain to a processor. But we can stop talking about Moore's law now."
technology,3dgd2y,darkmighty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:07:53 2015 UTC,"I like looking at this aspect. How many FLOPS can ~1,000$ hardware perform in a given year?  If this aspect continues to climb exponentially then we are still in good shape.  It's more flexible than Moore's law which only regards transistors. Even if we make the move to quantum computers and see an exponential growth in qubits Moore's law will still be dead- qubits are not transistors.  I have a feeling that if it's possible then it will happen. The industries counting on this growth in processing power are so huge that a lot of money is being thrown at this problem.  Exciting next 5-10 years guys."

Because this is a firm contracted by various governments around the world, it is viewed as a Big DealTM  Flash used to be the standard for web animation, but nowadays we have better and more secure alternatives to Flash which allow for web animations to play. The most common is HTML5+WebGL.   Flash has been on its way out for a while. One of the catalysts was when Apple refused to implement Flash in its iPhone in 2010. Another was when it was deprecated in Android. Now it's pulled from Firefox until the security vulnerabilities recently discovered are fixed.   Whether or not these recent revelations will actually lead to complete deprecation of the format for end-users is up in the air.

Well, no, you shouldn't have.  However, I do wonder what the future is for Lumia phones and WinPhone as a system.

That being ""Don't send the nice cabs to the bad parts of town."", combined with cameras keeping an eye on the passenger cabin (it is amazing how effective a ""You are on camera."" sticker can be, even if there is no camera). That being said, I have known a few cab drivers over the years and I can tell you that people are already doing all the things you describe with a live driver in the car. But people still don't avoid cabs. A car that becomes overly filthy will just report to the depot for cleaning, just like a human drive vehicle. A car that suffers damage will report for maintenance and so on.  Defensive driving is also not necessarily a problem. Especially since accidents with self driving cars will most likely be seen as the meat driver's fault due to the known defensiveness of their silicon counterparts. As a result the culture may be pushed to be more careful around automated cars in order to avoid the fine that would almost inevitably be levied against them in the case of an accident.  The real problem I see with them is the criminal issue. Imagine how easy kidnapping becomes if you can hack into a car's control systems, accelerate to a speed unsafe to jump from the car at and then pilot it to an isolated location to pick up your victim. It is an absolute nightmare from a security perspective and the only solution that i see is a manual override button for the autopilot system.

On most highways the prevailing speed is higher than the posted speed. I typically drive 75 to 80 MPH on a highway that is marked 65 in sections and 70 MPH in other sections. My speed is typical with the other traffic on this highway. Shall the self driving car not exceed the posted speed limit? What will this do to the traffic flow? Should we adjust the posted speed limit upward?

But whatever latent fears older generations have of what they perceive to be a magical rocket science fit only the brightest of humans doesn't hold weight. Why? Because it's not true.  If Toyota's code was open source then there's a better chance the issue would have been picked up earlier."

Because of this people will avoid them. A person will get into a self driving cab and find themselves sitting in someone's vomit and urine. Word will quickly spread.   You could say the same thing about any rental item.   The problem with all self driving cars is that they will always, under any and all circumstances, be highly defensive and passive in their driving style. People will pull out in front of them, not let them merge, steal parking spots, walk out in front of them, etc, because they know that the self driving car will be very passive and defensive.   You could say the same thing about busses, emergency vehicles etc.   Criminals will quickly figure out how to ambush self driving cars. They will have kids run out and stand still in the front and back of a self driving car. The self driving car will be trapped as the passengers are robbed, raped, abducted, and/or the car itself is pilfered or stolen.   Criminals can break into your house and rape you, or steal your car, the fact that it's possible in a self driving car doesn't change anything.   How to program a self driving car to deal with scumbags will become a significant challenge.   Simply putting cameras in the cars solves every problem you've listed. There are a ton of SUPER hard problems to solve in creating self driving cars and this is close to the easiest one.  On the other hand, millions of people die each year from car accidents. We spend untold hours looking for parking. My car sits unused for 90% of the time, costing us millions of dollars in wasted inventory."

A self driving car is a more vulnerable target then a house with security. The taxi would stop to prevent from running over someone or hitting them, but it can't perceive bad intention from a criminal and cannot protect it's self or passenger from crime like a normal taxi driver could.  A camera doesn't stop people from robbing banks or gas stations, they just cover their faces when commiting the crime.  I think if you required an electronic payment to be made the card holder could be responsible for damages and the camara could confirm who was using the service at the time."

Self driving car rentals would have to institute the same policy. Hell, even at a bowling alley they make you pay for shoes if you ruin them, and cars are a lot more expensive than those crappy shoes :)   A self driving car is a more vulnerable target then a house with security.   Maybe? A self driving car is a moving target so maybe not. But the point is in either case a person can attack / kill / rape you. This can happen if you're on a bike, or walking down the street, or in a phone booth.   A camera doesn't stop people from robbing banks or gas stations, they just cover their faces when commiting the crime.   That's my point - self driving cars have the same safety / security issues as things as mundane as gas stations. Gas stations are used all the time despite this small risk so I don't think this is going to be a big deal.   I think if you required an electronic payment to be made the card holder could be responsible for damages and the camara could confirm who was using the service at the time.

technology,3dil0y,jousta,4,Thu Jul 16 15:47:09 2015 UTC,"so they had one day that was 80% larger than the others, and there are many accusations that a lot of the sales went to businesses (either to resell on amazon, or compete with amazon) and so the actual number is most likely way less (if amazon sold to a reseller they will lose a future sale, although they might get a cut if it is sold through amazon)."
technology,3dil0y,peacegnome,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:47 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised by this. The sale was hyped up a lot and didn't live up to the hype in my opinion. To be fair though, I only wanted a decent 3 or 4tb drive to go on sale and the only one that did was a Seagate model that had a huge failure rate compared to the average failure rates."
technology,3dil0y,Xitir,2,Thu Jul 16 15:58:00 2015 UTC,I bought a 4k because I knew what time it was going on sale. Not 30 seconds after I added it to my cart was it wait list only.  It was decent if you knew what you wanted and knew when it was for sale but most people didn't know either of those they thought they could peruse the site and get a good deal
technology,3dil0y,mrdotkom,2,Thu Jul 16 16:15:20 2015 UTC,"I knew about sales like that and I kept an eye on the upcoming ones. They just didn't put anything I was looking for on sale unfortunately. I do agree though that they had some decent monitor and tv sales, but other than that and kindles, I felt like it was lacking in quality."
technology,3dil0y,Xitir,2,Thu Jul 16 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"Here is my opinion on the situation...  Every day marketing.  Basically, every day sites like Amazon will reduce prices to be competitive. You can generally never find a product selling for MSRP. It's always 5-20% cheaper on any given day. As such, people complaining about ""bad"" deals are comparing the price to these 5-20% every day prices. While products will be on a 25-50% sale (compared to MSRP, which 7+ years ago would be amazing), they don't feel very good because that is perceived to be a measly 5-30% sale (5% is generally what was ""seen"" on brand-name-brand-new tech items). That ""perceived"" 5% sale is actually 25% off MSRP.  In the end, the only way to make Black Friday or Prime Day sales awesome again (ie live up to the hype) would be to exclusively sell items at MSRP every other day. Amazon obviously won't give up on it's massive market to charge little markup, so that probably won't happen."
technology,3dil0y,missxu,2,Thu Jul 16 19:21:28 2015 UTC,"While I agree with what you're saying, I personally felt that the actual items they were selling were crap. Like they sold one of the worst 3tb drives possible because it was a seagate model with an insanely high failure rate. They sold loads of phone cases that you can find coupons to get for less than $1 without the sale. Overall I just felt like the quality of items they were selling were largely either not what I was looking for or were very low quality versions of what I was looking for. Just my experience though as I know many people got some good deals on monitors, tvs, kindles, etc."
technology,3dil0y,Xitir,2,Thu Jul 16 19:42:04 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you pointed that out.  And I agree... Many people were hoping for 25-50% off GPUs or generally more brand-name/brand-new items. I am one of them.  Although, 25-50% off MSRP still doesn't feel as awesome as it did 7 years ago (See previous post all over again)."

My interests are conventional, but the only thing keeping them around is whether or not they stay conventional.  I'm one unconventional interest away from being given the boot.  With free speech I don't have to worry about who the boot is pointing at because there is no boot.  I think that Voat's approach to this is a good one.  Give the users the tools to block and filter content that they find offensive.  Block whole subs from view if you need to, because you have that ability.  Reddit's approach is to choose for you what's offensive and ban it site-wide, which puts you at a loss if you think they go too far, or not far enough, because you don't have the tools to block subs yourself.  It's  much simpler than a matter of principle: the users will go to whichever system appeals to them.  If Reddit catches most of the SJW crowd, then maybe that's the best fit for the site but it's a drastic change from the initial userbase, who may decide to go elsewhere."

technology,3db7yy,_thedarkknight,12,Wed Jul 15 20:31:24 2015 UTC,"But redditors have an embarrassingly simple idea of what free speech is. If the government were ordering reddit to censor posts then you would have a case, but that's not the case. Blatant hate speech isn't protected speech, I'm sorry. When it's a company deciding that they don't want to be associated with things white supremacy and kiddie porn, that's not a free speech issue. That's an improvement to the site that they own that will allow our free speech to be taken more seriously by the powers that be.   But reddit has been moderating their site since the beginning, just like EVERY OTHER discussion site out there. So I'm shocked as to why this is news. And that's the heart of the problem: No one takes your free speech complaints seriously because you refuse to take it seriously. Every post like this you'll see some genius quoting Orwell, like that's doing something. I mean great -- you're aware of the book 1984... clearly you never did any further reading on the subject of freedom of expression. All I see is a bunch of self-important ninnies making newspeech references with ZERO analysis or understanding of the situation. They all would rather scapegoat Ellen Pao, make incredibly idiotic insults, and basically degrade their relationship with the company further -- I really don't see how that helps anyone make this situation better. The problem here is reddit users have inflated egos and all think they're untouchable. Well they're not, that's just how the world works. The computer screen won't protect you from reality. Sorry?  The thing is reddit has been trying for a while to get muckraking content out of the site -- I don't know about you but I won't be batting an eye if we lose racist or hateful subs. There are laws against that kind of thing too, you know. Laws we agreed on to have a civil society. Now you're basically saying your freedom of speech is under threat -- cause I guess it's so important for redditors to be able to argue pointlessly about politics and news at a level of discourse that rarely rises above facebook posts. You are all fighting for something passionately, you just don't know what that is exactly. It's all some unfocused, vague idea of free speech -- which I should remind you again, you still have because you are on reddit commenting on the situation, saying whatever the fuck you want. Do you notice how reddit doesn't discourage THAT kind of speech? I mean get your heads on straight. I'm not saying they're blameless, I'm just saying you're taking a mundane corporate decision and blowing it up to something it's not. And you sit there and wonder why they feel like they can't trust their users.   Everyone's too concerned with looking like freedom fighters in here to even recognize how free they actually are. You think reddit should just give everyone what they want because you're the user, period. Well that's not how the world works. It just isn't. Get over yourselves.  Your freedom of speech is important, but it's not absolute in all circumstances, nor can it be applied to any situation universally. There are no easy solutions in reality. You may have to let reddit exercise their freedoms too in order to be in a democracy together."

I have a hard time believing that Reddit at large will suffer from truly draconian or oppressive censorship. I personally don't have much of a problem with booting hate groups. That doesn't mean everything has to be whitewashed. You can still have vulgarity and controversial material while recognizing objectively, unreasonably offensive or aggressive hate.  As someone who has used the internet since near the inception of the WWW, I have an increasingly hard time defending people who use their anonymity to hurt people who, to them, are faceless and not real, when the damage done is very real. I used to be like that, and now I'm more than willing to force those people out, since they can't be forced into the light or reasoned with in any way.  Cowardice is not something that should be defended, even if it is in the name of a sacred right."
technology,3db7yy,demize95,14,Wed Jul 15 15:21:11 2015 UTC,"People on Reddit are, for the most part, anti-censorship. It's not actually about free speech, it's that they don't want to see Reddit start to censor content. They also see rules banning extreme content as censorship rather than the admins protecting the site and its users. It may not have been intended as a bastion of free speech, but that's what a lot of users see it as now.  The way Reddit started out, with only illegal content banned, attracted people who weren't allowed elsewhere. Even for people who weren't interested in those topics, Reddit was still acting as a bastion of free speech because of those policies. When sexually suggestive content featuring minors was banned, the administration reinforced the idea that Reddit was a bastion of free speech by saying, essentially, that it was.  This was fine then. Reddit was a large site, but it hadn't attracted the massive number of users it has now. But as it grows, there are going to be more people who want to see hateful communities kicked out. And if it's to grow more, which the board wants it to, then those subreddits need to be banned in order to shift the public perception of Reddit.  The public perception of Reddit, unfortunately, is based on those subreddits. People think Reddit is filled with misogynistic, racist, bigoted assholes. They don't care that it's mostly easy to avoid them by tailoring your subscriptions—they're allowed on the site, which makes it a site that people don't want to be a part of. And unfortunately for Reddit, these people are quickly becoming the only people left to draw in, meaning that either Reddit stagnates but remains a bastion of free speech or Reddit bans hateful communities but beings to grow rapidly again.  Personally, I would much prefer the latter option there. When FPH was routinely hitting /r/all, I stopped using /r/all. After the FPH ban, the fallout still hit my subreddits. Those kinds of posts are something I don't want to be associated with, but by using Reddit I am associated with them. I know a lot of people who feel the same way, too."

Why was /r/neogafinaction banned?  One of the reasons people are against the wielding of power is because it will inevitably be abused. It took about a day for the admins, Pao or whoever is to blame this week to openly abuse this new rule and they continue to refuse to explain themselves.

Some want every post which contains the word penis marked.....others believe it's only required for images of nudity in a sexual situation.

technology,3db7yy,chillaxbrohound,34,Wed Jul 15 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"Allowing someone to say something doesn't equate to endorsement.  Thinking Amish should be allowed to have communities where there is no electricity - or homosexuality - does not mean I agree with their views. It means I think people should be able to live their lives in communities as they want.  This idea that the mere existence of coontown equates to some sort of horrible taint on Reddit is absolutely laughable. In actuality, it shows that this site is truly free and believes in the right of users to express their ideas - however radical - without anyone deciding for them what they are and are not allowed to think.  There is no arbitrary power or authority controlling any of us here. It is up to us.  People who think that these sexist/racist views make the site unattractive for advertising are simply using their political power to attempt to instill controls on what people think through threats. They know that free speech and free discourse may lead to ideas they disagree with being given more acknowledgement.  Imagine if conservatives had been in power, and banned all dissent against homophobic ideas. Society would not have grown.  Free thought is absolutely essential to the forward progress of mankind. Those who would control it or take it away are simply afraid that progress is not going their way, and that their ideas are not logical enough to hold up to the brute scrutiny of fact and objective anonymous judgement of human consciousness.  Don't fall for this. If Reddit decides to think for us, it will die overnight. Coontown and and other subs like it represent not what makes Reddit bad, but what makes it great.  And with your free speech you can discredit those ideas discussed there. Perhaps that will mean engaging with them in a deeper manner than simply assuming they are completely insane. The free discourse here is the only thing that can insure that the correct views prevail.  The truth is that such views largely remain a constant bug because those truths they do offer are hard to access elsewhere. When people like you are willing to admit the faults of your views, I suspect that those areas will remain a source of information for the contingent of reasonable people who currently support them. It is the innate assumption that everything these subs say is a priori indefensible, laughable, and obviously incorrect that actually ironically contains their continuing relevancy and existence. The reluctance of many to engage with them in an honest and critical manner beyond dogmatic rejection is the reason they remain popular."

They've no idea what they've created and are somehow dumbfounded by the clear cause and effect of their actions.  Mr. CEO(s?) you have very little say over what goes on Reddit. Get used to it. You created a content platform, like Wordpress or Drupal or Blogge. You create no content and rely solely on the kindness of strangers to create the material that drives the clicks and pays the bills.  Every time you ban anything for any reason it is a gut shot to viability of Reddit. Every person who has their favorite subreddit taken away has one less reason to visit. One less reason to contribute. One less reason to do the job of both your writing and editorial staff.  So get used to the fact that your platform can be used for unpleasant things. Every business does. No car salesman asks what you're planning to do with the car after you purchase it and none of them would be willing to take the liability for every speeding ticket that car incurs. Why are you? Google doesn't rate the moral implications of the links and Windows doesn't shut down if you're using it to cheat on your wife.   Most businesses are smart enough to realize passing morality test on their clients is an easy way to go bankrupt. I would suggest the same neutrality would be best served here.  Provide a wide open platform, pass no moral judgements and if there is a court ordered reason then shut a subreddit down. Applying editorial judgement makes you responsible for all the content. Your safe harbour protections become whittled away the more you interfere with the minutae of subreddits.  So stop trying to run a content creation site with no paid content creators and start running a platform development site, which is actually who you have (had?) on staff. Leave morality to the mods and the courts. Otherwise find a new site. Pay some writers and publish whatever the fuck you want."

As soon as it was acquired by Conde Nast it became subject to that company's will and whims.  It is not a non-profit, it is not a charity.

What is your vested interest aside from enjoying the site and wanting to be a part of it? Because if you're not putting dollars in, Conde Nast has no vested interest in you personally.  Let me ask you another question: How much would you pay for the reddit you desire? One with no boundaries, ""free speech"" as you consider it, all the nasty (presumably legal, but unethical and potentially abhorrent) content you could possibly want? Would you be willing to pay for that? What price?   If you want that community, your money should follow your words. Because so long as you're enjoying it on someone else's dime, you have no say in policy or content if reddit's administration chooses not to allow it.  Frankly, I'm not sure how banning the most reprehensible of content on reddit is whitewashing, or is somehow going too far, but it's probably simply because that sort of content holds no interest for me. I miss when having an intelligent discussion on this site was the norm, and not the exception."

What you don't seem to understand is that if the admins have the ability to censor anyone and there is no way for us to oversee it then how do we know they aren't censoring things for corporate or government interests? Can you see a list of all people who were shadow banned and why? Can you see a list of removed subreddits and why? How do you know they were banned for hate speech and not for representing certain things admins personally are against? How do you know they aren't getting rid of comments and users and subs relating to some political cause? How do you know they don't manipulate certain posts to make the front page or not?

But I've been here for four, nearly five years I think, and I've watched the site take a downward slide pretty much after the first year. Even prior to that it was good, but I wasn't a member at the time, just lurking.   When I speak of a return to intelligent discussion, it's likely something that won't happen, simply because reddit is no longer driven toward intelligent discussion. It's no longer a technology and new agregator, it's a general site for the general masses. It's a meme collection. It's a skinner box that rewards dopamine for clicks, and a place for people to argue about nothing of consequence and feel like they've accomplished something.

technology,3deler,Bartleby1955,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:50:11 2015 UTC,10 kW seems too low to destroy mortar shells - this is tons of power for a designator or to destroy slow unmanned drones though.  It will be interesting to see if this has practical use at this power level.
technology,3deler,plorraine,2,Thu Jul 16 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"With a 1 watt laser you can start fires. This is 10KW. That's 10,000x more energy. That can definitely heat it up enough to destroy it."
technology,3deler,fRl1jOE_,5,Thu Jul 16 00:08:16 2015 UTC,Physicist here that works with high power lasers including 10 kW fiber lasers - its very hard to damage something any distance away - particularly something thats moving.   Damaging metal usually requires power levels on the order of kWs/cm-2 for a few millisec.  At 200 m/sec a shell moves 200 cm in a millisec.  So to damage a shell with this sort of power (10 kW) you need to track to high accuracy and focus to a tight spot.  An aperture a few inches in diameter is going to have a very tough time focusing to a cm size spot at a few km distance - divergence is a killer which is why the COIL airborne laser had such a huge aperture.  That's why the numbers usually look more like a 100kW laser to describe what they are talking about.   Maybe mortar shells are much softer targets than I think.
technology,3deler,plorraine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:36:11 2015 UTC,Ahhhhhhhh forgot about all the air between two points up to 22km apart.  I'm no physicist but isn't that the biggest limiting factor of lasers in warfare? The fact any beam gets scattered just by passing thru air?  I wasn't a mortarman tho so I cannot comment on the thickness and density of a mortar casing.
technology,3deler,fRl1jOE_,3,Thu Jul 16 00:37:25 2015 UTC,There are a couple of problems with lasers in warfare - but they certainly are coming.     Getting very high power with good beam quality is a tough engineering challenge but either diode pumped solid state lasers or fiber lasers are likely to get there at some point.   Divergence makes the beam spread out - if you make the diameter of the beam larger you can reduce the divergence and the spot size actually gets smaller past a certain distance.    Distance is very challenging. Scatter and distortion from atmospheric effects - the beam wanders around like a mirage does over the desert.  The beam itself will create distortion that you need to compensate for if the target is far away.  So adaptive optics become important - can be complicated. You need to track to keep your laser on target long enough to deliver fatal damage.  If your laser is 10x more powerful it kills 10x faster and you don't need to track as well.     A 10 kW laser can do a lot of things - the Navy I think showed one slicing up rubber zodiac boats and damaging outboard engines.  It would be a good face-melter against soldiers in the open.  It could certainly shoot down quadcopters and even larger drones.  And it can likely damage mortar shells near by.  I don't know it can do all those things at 22 km.
technology,3deler,plorraine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:12:44 2015 UTC,"Also, couldn't a single point of reflection (say if it is raining) cause immediate blindness for anyone hit by it? This would be extremely dangerous to anyone outside in the near vicinity of the laser."
technology,3deler,STDCatcher69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:40:32 2015 UTC,"The eye hazard from laser weapons is a major ethical issue - it will be super easy to use this as a blinding weapon.   If you are shooting at a small aircraft, the pilot is probably easier to blind if not wearing protective eyewear  than the aircraft is to destroy.   I'm not sure about the hazard from rain - I would suspect it would not redirect a lot of power but looking at the target you are shooting with the laser could be dangerous.  You could not get a permit to fire this in the US outside of a military testing range for example."
technology,3deler,plorraine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"A little math:  A 10 kW laser will deliver about 10000 joules per second to target(somebody wanna check my math?) A elephant gun bullet has about 7000 joules of kinetic energy  So a 10 kW laser delivers similar energy as an elephant gun in less than a second. Add on the fact that it travels at the speed of light, is very easy to aim, and has no recoil, it's quite easy to keep it on target.  It's not quite a tank buster yet, but I suspect it can do some damage.  Edit:  For fun, here is a video of a 5 kW fiberlaser cutting torch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YCACZQ72Q"
technology,3deler,Deeviant,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:40:48 2015 UTC,Damage mechanisms are quite different for continuous vs pulsed laser sources.  You'd much rather be shot by that 10 kW laser than the elephant gun.  Laying on a beach outside you are exposed to roughly 1 kW of solar energy (spread over your body).   We used a 50 Joule (not kJoule) pulsed laser to do material processing on titanium parts - that laser would create a plasma ball on the surface that launched a shock wave into the material powerful enough to spall metal off the back surface.  A 50 J Q-switched laser pulse (10 nanosecs long) focused down would feel a little worse than being hit by a paintball gun.
technology,3deler,plorraine,2,Thu Jul 16 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"As a defense against this weapon, couldn't we just cover surfaces with mirrors, or even retroreflectors, so the laser reflects back to its source and destroys the laser instead?"
technology,3deler,lachlanhunt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:01:31 2015 UTC,"Back reflecting light is a tough way to kill a laser but what you propose otherwise is how laser defenses typically work - you want to minimize absorbed energy by either reflecting it away, blocking it or moving out of the way.  So mirrored surfaces, smoke, spinning or fast moving surfaces all have been proposed.  Its hard to make a robust mirror for defending against a high power laser attack as it does not usually take much absorbed energy to destroy the laser coating and environmental wear and dirt will all decrease reflectivity.   Confusing the tracker hardware/algorithm also would work."
technology,3deler,plorraine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"Can anyone here tell me what power would be required to build a scoped pulsed laser ""rifle"" that would let me carefully shoot houseflies off my ceiling from the comfort of my sofa? I would pay $500-1000 for something that worked reliably and was fun to use."
technology,3deler,tomparker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:33:44 2015 UTC,"A ~1 W diode laser that is collimated and reasonably focused at the range you are talking about would do this.  This would pfft the flies pretty quickly if you can track them (or they stand still).  If you build it yourself this would cost < $100 - it would be battery operated and look like a laser pointer.  It would also blind you, neighbors, or pets if you hit them in the face.  The Gates foundation has built devices like this to zap mosquitoes - it raster scans a UV laser beam and whenever it sees substantial backscattered light raises the power to kill the mosquito and forms a virtual curtain to exclude mosquitoes."

When she later posted in /r/suicidewatch, apparently ready to take her life, members of FPH made some rather unhelpful comments. There was an instance where a couple of members of /r/GrandTheftAutoV met up outside of reddit, and posted this innocuous picture on the GTA subreddit. The post was brigaded by FPH and resulted in upwards of 100 bans. A girl posted a comment about her dog dying in /r/LifeProTips, and received these comments in reply, one telling her that she deserved to feel bad, telling her ""I hope your clogged arteries kill you before you have the chance to kill another innocent animal."" Members went to /r/keto and took progress pictures of people who were trying to lose weight, and post them to their subreddit, as this comment describes.  Another [post] describes how FPH members, one named ""fattiesaresubhuman"", would post comments such as, ""Can you fatasses stay away from our sub, just circlejerk about losing 5 pounds in 5 months in here, you fat feminist fuckups."" in /r/progresspics.

Separately, at the least, google publishes some data in its description of sites (I.e. under the link). Publishing that data makes it Googles issue if someone brings it to their attention (of course not reasonable to expect anything fixed until a reasonable investigation has taken place).  The issue comes with if you think about how many people don't click the link. As Google has become viewed as a news aggregator by the average populace, it has to be held to a higher standard than something like a youtube comment.  Think about if someone writes an article such as ""MinscandBoo is a pedophile, s/he raped my daughter"" (with your real name and picture in the article). Do you really think you can bring legal action against the company before that is spread to many many other sites? Playing a game of catch-up with lies on the internet doesn't really work.

For example, my wife works in insurance and has the unenviable responsibility of breaking bad news to people – some of which are bad people.  Having a distinct name + lots of online records, means my wife is easy to find. And sure enough, we've been in this position once already. It's unsettling. But, that's a very specific case. Add in individuals dealing with abusive spouses, spurned lovers, unstable business partners, and the need for broader privacy starts looking more practical.

Take this example: you're a regular person and you end up getting raped. This news makes huge rounds in your local community and soon the locals are talking about it on the internet. People forget conversations had in bars, on the street... The internet doesn't. And obviously your community doesn't really care about your privacy. What then? You can't force them to delete their convo, they're free to talk about you and your unfortune. Years later, whenever anyone googles your name, because they're your new employer, because they wanna buy something big from you but don't entirely trust you, because they're just curious friends... They see a sizeable part of your personal life while you never had anything to say about it. People should still be able to find these discussions, freedom of speech; they should still be able to find the articles, freedom of press; they should still be immediately able to find those articles that link you to corruption... But they have no business knowing deeply intimate facts about your life simply because they know your name, which is why the corruption should appear in your search results, and your rape not.  Yeah, people should learn from their mistakes, this has been a universal truth for literally thousands of years at this point. But this general piece of advice has to be applied to a completely different world these days. If 20 years ago you walked into the girl's locker room as a kid, there'd be some rumours and talk going around the school but eventually it'd disappear. Today shit like this immediately gets posted to facebook, personal blogs, reddit... This ""stupid little thing"" that in our old society used to expire, now is suddenly part of a permanent record of you, one that Google is exceptionally adept at constructing, in the form of search results.  The idea behind the ruling is that a search query for a name is in effect a profile. The data gets scraped, processed, assigned to a name, and then neatly organised and presented for efficient consumption. Just because this happens automatically doesn't mean that it doesn't have very close similarities with manually constructed profiles, Google's algorithm is just that good. And at least in Europe, you have the authority to ask companies to permanently destroy their records (profile) of you. Since there is still the right to know involved with Google's results, this right to be forgotten is actually curtailed to prevent abuse, to protect the public, to prevent important information from getting censored.  In a world where natural expiration of irrelevant, unnecessary information about our private lives doesn't occur anymore, this presents serious problems, and we either transition into a society where privacy loses its value, or we just manually intervene when necessary."

The only thing that changes is that when you search for it on Google, which wants to be the most comprehensive search engine on the internet, they can't show you the most relevant link (to a completely independent website which still hosts that same fucking information).  There are and should be laws in place that allow you to remove certain content directly from the specific website where it is.

technology,3d9583,stewiefet,5,Tue Jul 14 19:49:23 2015 UTC,"Why would I care about the integrity of search results for a company's search engine?   Because the search results are what makes it possible for people to access information, and the right to access such information may be a fundamental right. For example, in Germany, Article 5 of the constitution states:   Anyone has the right to voice and distribute their opinion in speech, writing and picutres and to inform themselves from freely accessible sources without hindrance. Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by broadcast and film are guaranteed. Censorship does not take place. (However note that exceptions exist and are listed further below.)   By hiding content from the index, the privacy rights of the subjects are strenghtened, but these fundamental rights of everyone else are violated - both the right to access the information, and the freedom of the press. Whether content is actually removed, or intentionally rendered impossible to find does not really matter - it is censorship. They just didn't dare/weren't able to implement the censorship overtly by directly censoring the press, so they want to hide it.  I don't see a big difference between banning a newspaper from printing something, or letting them print it but then only making it available in their archives if you know what to ask for.  Now, there is clearly a tradeoff between different fundamental rights (freedom of information/press vs. privacy) here, but your question was why you would care about the integrity of the search results, and that is the answer: Because messing with the results infringes on your right to inform yourself, and if you're the author of information hidden in this way, it infringes on your rights to free expression/freedom of the press."

technology,3d9583,figuren9ne,13,Tue Jul 14 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"It's not that surprising that occasionally, connecting the dots about a person could be harmful.  Think about the law with regards to stalking. It's legal to see someone outside by chance. But if you follow them every time they are in public, knowing their exact commute times, habits, etc, then you are a stalker and that's illegal, even if you didn't see a single private activity. Specifically, it's the act of taping together the little bits of free, anonymous public sightings into a report about the person that actually becomes an invasion of privacy. Google acts as the ultimate data point connector, making sure every public detail about what should be ""some random guy"" ends up pulling everything about a person that they never meant to publish in the first place. And it's going to keep getting stronger... Google Earth will be able to stalk you from space. We need to have an adult conversation about what that means.  It can be legitimately harmful, if say 12 years ago, you somehow were a suspect in the pedo-rape-massacre of 041, but were found innocent. The ability to track that, by searching ""Joe Blah criminal"", would bias potential employers. One solution is full-on censorship of the source material. But I think the data should exist, searchable from other, more academic angles; like a search for history on that event. But when you plug in ""Joe Blah criminal"" into google, ideally it would not come back with results that smear you. Not that there aren't obvious costs and dangers to such index manipulation though."

Meanwhile the person in America can get the full picture and decide whether or not to transact business with this person accordingly.   It might not be a big deal to major corporations that can afford full background checks but for a mom and pop shop, or a personal transaction, it just seems dishonest to hide it from some people and not others.

They don't want to be the arbiters of the RtbF, they were compelled by EU (and Argentine) law. They would much rather save the money and fork over the requests to a separate entity that faces legitimate judicial review. Google has done many bad things, and many good things, but in this case they are doing what they can in the position they were forced to be in - which is an attempt to preserve free speech in the midst of a very broad ruling. It would be much cheaper for them to not have to hire an entire team to process 200,000+ requests and determine their legitimacy. While one can debate the merits of this type of RtbF versus a different right to erasure, one thing that should be clear is that Google is reluctantly forced into this position, they did not seek it out."

Google was so averse to helping the family out of kindness, that the family eventually resorted to the one thing Google does listen to: copy right.    The family claimed they owned the copy right to the pictures of their dead daughter and they should be removed.  It didn't work but it was an interesting discussion of how averse Google is to this right- they essentially refuse to work with anyone who doesn't have a copy right claim (in the US).

Flash does need to go. It can't hold on forever just because ""it technically works most of the time"". Flash has been problematic and a prime source of exploiting computers since it came out. It's not a great solution for what it does. However, for too long, it was the only practical solution.   Here's an example of WebGL being used. And while I don't have capabilities to move the ship around, the ship does show up and animates properly using Chrome on my Android."

We do have games written in WebGL already. These things will only improve. Audio does work - Soundcloud works yet I don't have flash installed. Youtube is my go-to for audio if Spotify doesn't have the song I want. PLEX offers web streaming without flash. So, I think Audio gets a pretty solid checkmark. RGBA has offered transparency on all major web browsers since at least 2010.  I can still copy images in a shitty flash site. I do it all the time. Printscreen gives me your ""intellectual property"" just as easily as 'Save Image As' would.

Even then, states may not see much by way of reduced costs since the DVM will still be needed to process identification cards for people who don't want driver's licenses, robot cars will still need to be registered and inspected, and drivers who don't own a self-driving car will still need licensed.  The whole road infrastructure will still need to be maintained since that won't really change at all with self driving cars.

When CFCs were banned, the options were:   The federal government could carry out all those tests with new propellants (at great expense). The federal government could allow a private company to do all those tests.     In the case of option 2, private companies would only do all that testing if there were a payoff at the end.

People have to sue them all the time just to get the coverage they're SUPPOSED to get. I mean their entire business model works off of paying out as little as possible and charging as much as they can while still having customers.
technology,3daoox,congelar,9,Wed Jul 15 17:40:41 2015 UTC,"Well..  if they didn't understand their benefits at the time of their selection,  then clearly they need some help;  not pity.  The insurance company would explain the yearly prescription deductible to them,  that they have to pay (maybe) $500 out of pocket for inhalers before their coverage kicks in.  Also,  these inhalers are typically 200 dose for the common prescription,  so at twice-daily you still get three+ months of the drug for your $300.  In the case of their prescription,  after two refills the rest would be covered under their standard pharmaceutical co-pay.  I'm also a little frustrated that the journalist didn't take more time to cover this aspect of health care rather than running out to the 'dark web' to score inhalers.  Further,  if you require these kinds of medications and are low-income,  then you could also talk to your doctor.  Most clinical managers will tell you that they have a shitload of samples in their drug storage.  There are more than a few patients who get by with samples from their doctor alone.  In any case,  there are lots of better options when it comes to your health rather than turning to an anonymous and completely unregulated drug market."
technology,3daoox,Damanta,3,Wed Jul 15 04:08:40 2015 UTC,"There are certainly better options than the dark net and this article is clearly written for the shock value, but that doesn't change how messed up it is.  300 dollars for three months is still $100 a month for something that should cost $30. On top of that they're paying what is likely to be around $150 a month for their insurance.  None of this mucking around with calling insurance or begging for hand outs should be remotely necessary in a reasonable world. If someone is asthmatic they should pay for the value of their medicine, not more."
technology,3daoox,congelar,2,Wed Jul 15 04:13:50 2015 UTC,"Well..  carry it out.  With my co-pay it's only $25.  So,  6 months at $600 and 6 months at $50.  $650 on the year.  $650/12 == $54 per month.  That's a lot closer to $30,  yeah?  This is how insurance works and spreads risk.  Also,  this isn't exactly accurate as their coverage would've kicked in somewhere in the middle of the second inhaler.  Also,  $54/30 == $1.80 a day to keep your asthma in check using a synthetic steroid.  It's never going to be cheap,  but $2/day isn't all that bad.  If you want something to be really pissed off about,  read up on how the FDA allowed GSK to re-patent (yes,  RE-patent) the most common rescue inhaler formulation (albuterol) due to a change in propellant.  Fucking propellant.  That made $5 generic rescue inhalers disappear with name brand costing $50 or more the only option.  There are a lot of interests out there that try to get as much out of the patient as possible,  insurance companies certainly fill that role some of the time,  but they are hardly the worst offenders of the bunch.  You also have choice in most cases when it comes to your insurance company.  You get no choice when the FDA decides to fuck you.  EDIT:  something that article doesn't touch on.  What did GSK use as the new non-CFC propellant?  R-134a.  That's right.  The SAME fucking replacement that EVERY OTHER industry used.  Literally ZERO innovation,  but still,  new patent.

Believe me, I don't want to see patients paying anything remotely close to several hundred dollars for medications that improve symptoms and quality of life. I would suggest looking into prescription discount cards from the manufacturer. These cards can be found from the manufacturers website and printed out to be given to anyone in the pharmacy where they will run it as a secondary or tertiary insurance. I've seen copays go from several hundred dollars to maybe $20 with these. Bear in mind that some cards require the prescription to be written for a certain quantity or days supply and may require a primary insurance to be billed first. Also, please don't yell at the technician, intern, or pharmacist that is ringing up your prescriptions when your copay is high. We literally can't control what your insurance bills you (besides the copay cards we add in). We go out of our way to provide cost effective care for our patients, and getting berated for trying to help doesn't make for a good day haha.

They chose to keep it at that temperature so they don't have to re-make the batch as often, ignoring the safety implication. That's what won the case, no other coffee (or food product) would have been anywhere near that hot so it is not safe to assume that the customer will treat it with the safety respect that it requires (spilling ordinary coffee on your lap would be bad but nothing more than a big red mark for a few days or weeks).  It's funny that so many people pick up on this whole thing to talk about but almost nobody knows why the case was actually won and like to flame as though it was some BS (which was how the press presented it, surprise surprise they take the side of the powerful multinational company and slander the individual)."

Went through multiple thousands of dollars worth of drugs last year - drugs which are excluded from our insurance coverage.

technology,3daoox,ReasonReader,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:37:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're looking for.  It was simple - tell doctor we're self-paying, doctor's front office recommended several pharmacies (out of state, in our case) which tend to have deals, doctor's front office also provided a coupon code for one of the drugs.  Call pharmacy to place order, ""I'm not covered for this, do you have any coupons?"", they do, place order using coupons.  Actual details aren't much more complicated.  We had three pharmacies in play - all of whom were able to provide the drugs (there were 4 or 5 different prescriptions).  Sometimes a with-coupon price wasn't better than a competitors outright price (probably a price-match, since I was upfront with them that I would order from whoever had the best deal).  Some of the pharmacies bent over backwards and did things that were probably slightly almost shady, i.e., have prescription for 10 of something, coupon is good for 50% off of one, so we placed ten orders rather than one.  Another one gave me a heads-up that they don't have coupons, but if I can wait two days (I could), they'd be seeing their drug-rep and would make sure to get some.  Can't remember, but I think I got one of them to stack their coupons for me as well, i.e., $50 off coupon per item with a 50% off coupon per order... I doubt that one was strictly within the fine-print of the coupon.  All told it was about $6k of drugs for around $2k over the course of a couple of months.  Total time investment was around 20 minutes on the phone (cumulative).  Edit to add:  Now, mind you, these weren't $2/pill drugs.  IIRC, the lowest priced drug was close to $10/dose (no coupons on that one either, but some decent price competition) and the highest around $250/dose."

Essentially, a bad actor can overwrite a section of memory with their own virus and then use the same access the Adobe client software has to modify your computer.   HTML5/js doesn't have this kind of direct access to memory and hardware- it is much more abstracted. It took a long time and many working groups with some of the Internet's greatest minds thinking about the problem to devise something which replicates Flash functionality in such an abstracted safe and reliable way (ie. HTML5).   HTML5 only came about a few years ago, while Flash has existed since 1996. So Flash has a lot of existing media, mature development tools, and communities of designers/developers/vendors, etc. That is basically why it is still in use. There's essentially nothing* Flash can do that HTML5 can't do with more safety and reliability, all without depending on a third-party vendor's proprietary technology (Adobe).  *A few minor functions of Flash are still being developed in modern browsers. But it is only a short matter of time before all Flash functions are completely replaceable with HTML5.  For more info check out http://isflashdeadyet.com/"

Could you imagine how long that bullshit would have continued if Apple bit the bullet?  In 2008, the iPhone 3G had come out and was still running a single-core ARM processor @ 412 MHz. Are you seriously suggesting Apple give Adobe the free pass simply because the web was running Flash?  Ironically enough, Android came later and offered Flash on devices. I remember briefly switching to the HTC Evo 4G and guess how you were able to gain root access? A flash exploit that worked on the version that shipped with the phone!  You may have heard about the HackingTeam leaks recently (a notable 'hacker' firm which was hacked itself). Guess which mobile OS could not be exploited remotely by their hacks? Non-jailbroken iOS.  Apple has taken this same approach to Java, by not including it nor Flash with OS X, starting with Mavericks. If you want it (and the security implications that come with), install the latest version yourself. It's the same issue with Java versions, developers just don't give a fuck about using Java 7 (meanwhile 6 is in shambles).. so the cycle continues until someone major finally drops support.  There are times when the cord has to be cut, when enough is enough. Apple often takes this approach (to much chagrin) before other companies do.

technology,3d98uz,Captain_Jack_Daniels,4,Wed Jul 15 03:55:54 2015 UTC,"The solution to this is easy.  Allow member and subreddit filtering.  Hide subreddits you dislike, and filter any comments from those subscribed to them.  This way reddit doesn't lose anything diversity wise, while making the experience pretty and safe for those that get uptight over whatever they chose to be uptight about.  I personally want an age filter.  Under 22?  Filter.  This way what's seen is what one prefers to see, without sacrificing the diversity of the user base.  I am not racist, but I personally am interested in what communities like that are like.  A lot of what I take from reddit IS being able to witness fringe communities to get a better understanding of what their hot topics and arguments are, and disprove them.  If you want a win win win solution implement this easy change, and the whole community will benefit in more ways than trying to keep hate away, while simultaneously supporting that purpose.  Do it.  The majority love unfiltered, and this is a site to learn what other corporate entities shouldn't allow.  So the community moves on.  People want to express ideas and argue, and the moment you start to police the conversations, the Internet will find an alternative.  The users provide the content, and you provide a message board for discussion.  It will not be hard to reproduce, and when the community leaves, reddit dies, just like digg.  Setup filtering.  It's the only, and realistically best way, that will have more benefits than the problem you're trying to solve - and solve this problem as a side effect.  Cheers."

You can't go after individuals in such situations as a subreddit could be left without mods (exasperating anarchy). There would also be so many individual brigading its hard and just a waste of time to try and go after them individually, best to cut them off at the source."

If the majority  of users  had engaged in that behavior, it would have been evident across most of Reddit. Think about it... over 50,000 users trolling other subs would  have been quite evident... but all the proof  I saw was limited to the mods and a limited number of jackasses.      It wasn't 50,000 users. I haven't  even seen  evidence of 50 users doing it, yet over 100,000 users paid the price.        I'm not saying there wasn't  jackassery going on in FPH, but the number of people  leaving the sub  to harass other elsewhere  is nowhere  near 50k, nor even 500. Let's  see a tally of all reported incidents. I'd be happy  to be proven wrong... but I'm  pretty sure I won't be once an objective  count is given. Reddit does have a way of tracking that, right?"

It's whatever the mods or admins decide, and it can change without warning. In the real world outside reddit, free speech only refers to the government being forbidden from censoring/favoring/punishing speech. But there are still consequences: yell ""fire!"" in a crowded area when there's no fire and you can get arrested; incite people to violence and you can get arrested; tell someone you'll kick their ass and you can get arrested. Even with protected speech--like a bigot espousing his views without inciting violence--the right to free speech goes both ways, and everyone nearby could freely come and ridicule and mock the bigot. Free speech can always come with consequences."

If shit is on Reddit just because some company paid it to be, the user experience is watered down. Users submitting information is why Reddit has become popular. Why not focus on monetizing user generated content? Reddit has millions of creative writers/media producers at its fingertips, far more than any news/media organization, why not provide users incentives to create higher quality media and then act as a publisher or production company? People use reddit to inform/be informed and to entertain/be entertained. If part of Reddit functioned like a news organization or media producer, the business model would fit more with its userbase. Users are its workforce. Without users, Reddit is a blank slate. If users and mods were making money for the contributions they make to the site, the quality will increase. It might take five people from the New York Times a month to research and write a high quality article about gun control... but it literally might take Reddit only a few hours to generate the same content of that article in a thread. The thread would need to be edited and fact checked since people say and upvote a lot of bullshit but it's going to have way more perspectives than anything the NYT could write."

The gay marriage discrimination in Tennessee/Kentucky is the first example that comes to mind as a real life community doing more than rolling their faces on a keyboard.

technology,3d98uz,hittingkidsisbad,7,Tue Jul 14 16:06:09 2015 UTC,"nothing makes it to the front page without a hell of a lot of support.   This is the thing that seems to be forgotten. The voting scores here are logarithmic (a vote score of 1000 results from much more than an actual net 1000 votes, and 5000 requires way way more than an actual 5000 votes).  FPH apparently had around 150 000 subscribers, /r/science has over 8.7 million. The racist subs have much less than 150 000. If stuff from FPH or other ""bad"" places was getting to the front page, it was because it had wider support across the regular reddit user base, a user base for the most part drives the content creation and moderation of subreddits, and who tends to hate censorship, as the article noted.  Turning reddit into a ""safe space"" by way of mass censorship could very well destroy a lot of the good will and volunteer work (mods and content creators) that makes reddit as popular as it is.  As for ""problematic"" views getting to the front page, or upvoted in comments, it seems to me that many people are probably attracted to reddit so they can discuss ideas that are effectively censored by the mainstream media and other online forums. Insofar as reddit users represent an exodus from PC policing, censoring groups that hold these ideas might actually have a much more widespread and negative impact than would otherwise be expected."

You allow the legal yet unpalatable communities to exist, but you keep them from oozing filth into the rest of the site.  I think it's fair to say that moderators of controversial subs should be asked to uphold some standards, and if the mods won't do it, you close down the sub until new mods can be found.  Hell, put in an algorithm that invites top posters to become mods in that case.    To me it's a practical matter, and political b.s. just gets in the way."

technology,3d8st4,k0uch,6,Tue Jul 14 21:04:20 2015 UTC,"I may have an other explanation than sale price. I don't have sources to show you because it's all come from talking to high managers responsible of inventory and buying device for the Telcom company I work for.   When companies buy cellphones to sell them to customers with contracts, the more they buy, the more the price by device is cheaper. Well, it seems it is false when we talk about Apple. For a regular customer, an iPhone 6 16 Gb is 839$CAN. The Telcom company buy them 769$CAN each. In Canada, when US dollar grew and value of Canadian dollar hits 1.25$ US, Apple take the opportunity to inflate their prices to both customers and company. They were the only manufacturer to do this. That's how an iPhone 6 16Gb sold 250$ with 2 years plan on first day was 350$ seven months later.   Where I work, we refuse to sell iPhone full price. Customers must go to Apple Store for that. If the phone is paid with a stolen credit card or whatever other illegal way, the company lost almost full price of the phone.   Briefly : when an iPhone is sold, no matter who sold it, Apple gets the profits on the phone. When any other smartphone is sold, seller and manufacturer make profits.    Of course, Telcom companies make profits on your monthly plan. When they sell an iPhone + 2 years contract, they get profits on the contract. Any other smartphones give them profits on the monthly plan and the smartphone.    Tl;Dr : Apple know it shit with money & marketing.   Edit : added tl;dr and corrected some words"

Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is $550.  Add in a 128gb sd card for $60 comes out to $610 total.  How much is a comparable iPhone 6 plus? $1020.   Even if you're not paying off-contract, you're still going to have to pay a huge premium. Now whether this huge premium is worth it is up to the individual of course, but you shouldn't pretend that iPhones aren't significantly more expensive than their competition. How do they make all that profit after all? We're talking about 90+% of all cell phone profits... that doesn't just come from slightly higher margins."

You cherry picked a 50% off Note 4 sale (which never would have applied near the release date), and an SD card is not the same as internal storage. Also, not sure what is up with the price on that iPhone 6+, every major carrier has it for $949 at 128gb.  Here's a comparison, 64gb option (where available) because the iPhone does not have a 32gb option. All prices from AT&T, no contract. http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/devices/smartphones.html  iPhone 6 (64GB) - $750  iPhone 6+ (64GB) - $850  Note 4 (32GB, expandable) - $846  Note Edge (32GB, expandable) - $966  S6 (64GB) - $785  S6 Edge (64GB) - $915  LG G4 (32GB, expandable) - $630  BB Passport (32GB, expandable) - $670  Nexus 6 (32GB) - $700  Edit: I will concede that you can save money on some Android flagships if you wait 6-12 months after launch, because they do allow sales.

And apple's look great. The customer service (it would be foolish for anyone to claim apple has bad customer service) The overall customer experience. Things such as the fingerprint reader actually having a good practical use and working well on the iphone... or their laptops having sublime trackpads with great gestures that you can't get on windows laptops   There are other things to mention to and obviously they are great at marketing. But lets not make out that they just sell shitty products with poor hardware at high prices because they're good at marketing. They do totally excel in other areas...

A lot of this is due to their limited selection coupled with high demand, they are big enough that their orders keep factories running, and they place the largest orders, that means they get the best bulk discounts from factories. Coupled with some good engineering (like not including the latest/greatest things), an iPhone is significantly cheaper to produce than a high end Samsung. They charge what they charge mostly because they can, not because it's close to the total cost of the device.  Simply put, Apple's phones are overpriced, because the profit margin on them is so high that many would consider it price gouging.

Apple knows which version of iOS each app requires, but doesn't filter out incompatible ones, and there's no indication until you try to install one when a dialog pops up telling you it isn't compatible.   the cynical part of me feels like this is a deliberate method of making older hardware seem more dated. they could filter those apps up front and you would have no idea how many apps you weren't seeing and everything you chose to install would work  to be clear, im not saying that the iPad1 isn't actually dated - it is. ..But if the app store only displayed software that worked with it, it would still give users a good experience and plenty of app selection - just without 20 extra minutes of clicking on other apps to find out if they can be installed or not."

Their sales and market share have increased in the face of shrinking growth from their competitors since then.  The loud minority of people who actually care what other people use AND argue about it online is tiny compared to the real world.  Most people just buy and use what they like and never really talk about it, let alone to create an account on a website just to say a stranger ""NUH UH!!!!"".  These auto-haters herd to every Apple story and aggressively do their best to make sure everyone who chooses their products knows exactly how coerced and manipulted they were to spend a couple hundred more on a computer.  Nobody cares if one person buys a Merc for 80k and someone buys a used Hyundai for 8k.  Caring if someone spends 1000 on an iMac all ine one vs $700 for an HP all in one is caring WAY too much about something pretty damn trivial.  Going from house to business to house, the number of MacBooks and iMacs these days compared to just a few years ago is staggering.

technology,3d8st4,spanglefoosh,24,Tue Jul 14 18:29:27 2015 UTC,"There's a big point here that gets lost in the Apple vs Android circlejerk.  Yes, the top phones are similarly priced, but it's the extras that make Apple their fortune.  Flagship Androids generally have 32GB internal storage and SD slots.  For the phones that don't take SD (notably the Droid Turbo and Samsung Galaxy S6) there are virtually free cloud services, most of which come with your subscription to any major carrier.  With octa-core processors and 16+ MP cameras standard, it could be that these big fat Android flagships are more expensive to produce than their apple counterparts and have a longer service life.   Meanwhile, customers feel rather insecure buying a 16GB iPhone 6, which the conspiracy theorist in me says is by design.  The alternative, which many take, is to shell out $100 to get the 64GB model.  I'm conjecturing here, but that's got to be at least $80 in Apple's pocket.  How much of the increase between the 6 and 6 plus is pure profit margin as well?  You get a bigger screen and bigger battery, the hardware is pretty much exactly the same.  Another $80 in Apple's pocket.  I'm not sure from reading the article if these numbers take into account the crushing disparity in sales of paid apps and extras.  Better devs flock to the Apple market because there are more people willing to pay.  Apple users truly believe that they need Apple chargers and accessories.    It's kind of a weird cycle in that there's more money in Apple, therefore Apple brings in more money.  100% of the kids who have parents dumb/rich enough to throw away money on gems in freemium games have iPhones because their friends do and they want to facetime.  Then there's the junk phone market.  If you replace the battery and root the dang thing you can make 3 and 4 year androids perform at a level that the iPhone 4 and 4s just won't.   With replaceable batteries and gigantic processors, expect the S5 and G3 to be around and kicking long after the iPhone 5 thru 5s have become unusable.  Virtually all iPhone users will want a new phone after 2 years, and they're becoming wary of buying the already obsolete version for ""free"" on a 2yr contract.  Old iPhones get recycled or donated.  Old androids are still in service, which means android (once again) is competing with itself.  tl;dr Apple is going to be seen as the ""premium"" for years to come, regardless of how much of it is smoke and mirrors.  As such, they will get more money out of their customers, most of it on the back end and through semi-planned obsolescence."

Yes, if you constantly update the OS to the newest version, it'll run slower. But using the software it was shipped with, you will have the same user experience the whole time.

Are you really expecting end users to peer host potentially terrabytes of data?  Inevitably there are always more leeches than seeds, and that's not even accounting for ISP protocol. When your ISP determines you're hosting it, they will likely either block it, or block you. Especially once unmoderated and likely illegal content begins appearing, since nobody has control of the system.  Imagine a system where suddenly you're hosting snuff videos and child porn, because nobody is administrating and all content is peer hosted. How would you even know it was there for that matter?  A single bittorrent swarm is much smaller scale than reddit's entire database content. A single torrent magnet is easy to host, all you're hosting a a tracker. Even hundreds of trackers might amount to kilobytes of data at most. Reddit is more likely in the multi-terrabyte range for its database and content archives.

Reddit is a platform, not a media outlet.  They are as big as their users and content creators allow them to be.  They want all the benefit of free content to leverage for adspace - all the benefit of free press - without any of the other ramifications.  All Reddit does is provide a place for people to interact with one another and produce content that like-minded people find interesting or entertaining.  Once they seek to monetize that model in such a way that alienates the very people creating Reddit's value, the users have a right to be upset, and they have a prerogative to take their conversation to an equally easy to create forum.  Reddit is biting the hand that feeds it.  They think they're too big to fail, but if these sort of shenanigans continue, they'll go the way of Digg."

I've not once seen /r/coontown before today, nor have I ever seen it on the frontpage.  Same with the dead girl pics reddit.  People forget they are allowed, even encouraged, to customize their reddit experience.  I didn't want to hate on fat people, I didn't subscribe to /r/fatpeoplehate - problem solved.  I could easily spin this into a discussion on Reddit's prerogative to police people's interaction, or how we devalue individual responsibility in favor of governance, but that's not really the issue.  The issue is that Reddit wants to monetize user created content - that they deem appropriate.  They were more than fine letting content spring forward organically for the better part of a decade because the website - although not extremely profitable - was doing just fine.  Once Reddit hit a critical mass (due in no small part to the freedom of speech that it once harbored) they figured they could cash in.  Before they could though, they needed to clean out the gutters.  I suppose some people are fine with that, after all it's not their experience that's being publicly lambasted, but it's downright morally disgusting to claim Reddit's intent had never been freedom of speech, while they sit back and reap the rewards of having created nothing and benefiting quite handsomely from the very thing they're lobbying against now.

Advance could give a flying fuck about freedom of speech or anything else other than profit. They clearly decided that having their property used in this manner did not maximize their return.

Reddit's value is in user generated content that only exists because of the freedom Reddit provided for it.  Without more incentive why would alienated and betrayed (either real or imagined) users continue to use Reddit as a distribution for their content?  Without the users, and the content they produce, Reddit is dead.  The leaderships knows this, they have to.  But ultimately it seems they don't mind, either losing a small(ish) portion of their userbase, or their entire platform, so long as they strike when the iron's hot and they make that dollar while they can.

If a user is running on hardware that limits them to IE 6 likely means they will hit serious performance problems, though Flash has been around since the 90's and a lot of Flash games will still run on those older systems.    Some newer games might actually run pretty decently since there has been a strong movement away from vector based graphics in Flash games, so they are less processor intensive (but they do use more memory)."

I can't find any source that indicates HTML5 (which uses javascript) is any better than Flash in security.  Flash just happens to be the most used, so of course hackers are going to make it their primary target.  IF Flash is gone... Javascript will most likely become the most used, and hackers will just switch to that.  It's the same reason Apple claimed their Macs didn't get any viruses in their advertisements.  When in all actuality, they did... they were just rare and not heard of that often simply because not many people used Macs at the time.  Windows was the most commonly used OS and so hackers made that their primary target.  It's called safety through obscurity... and Apple knows this.  They have been criticizing Windows and Flash for being 'vulnerable', to scare people into switching to their products.  From a business perspective, it's actually a good strategy.  But the truth is, Apple products and HTML5 aren't any more secure... they're just not a primary target (for now)."

technology,3d8nxt,gtechIII,2,Tue Jul 14 16:08:06 2015 UTC,"At the risk of being pedantic, the term is Security Through Obscurity. Your use of the term in this context is ironic. While you are right that Apple relies of security through obscurity, you're using the term incorrectly. The term refers to the case where one, instead of fixing the deep flaws in an implementation, attempts to keep them hidden in the hopes no one will find them. A good example is a Caeser Cipher vs AES. You're right, this is terrible security practice.  Apple's past existence with little market share is an example of security through minority, their hidden proprietary code is an example of security through obscurity.  Flash is a platform which is secure through obscurity, its code is hidden instead of being designed with a strict emphasis on security by design.  HTML5 is an open platform made with the general purpose language Javascript, with emphasis on secure design and laid bare for auditing by anyone."
technology,3d8nxt,gtechIII,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"Flash is a proprietary programable application embedded into the browser. Users and programmers do not have the ability to customize every part of Flash. As a result, auditing of Flash's proprietary code is done by far less people than might if it were visible to all. It adds an extra layer of insecurity on top of whatever mistakes the external developer might make in a general purpose language.  When people say there is a vulnerability in Flash, they mean there's a vulnerability which can be exploited reguardless of how safe the developer external to Adobe tries to make his application."

technology,3d8s14,Dr_professional,9,Wed Jul 15 03:21:57 2015 UTC,"One of the primary purposes of an operating system, especially a modern operating system, is to be able to hand over control of the CPU (or other hardware) over to a program then ""come back"" and resume executing so the user can run other programs or do other things.  In a modern operating system this is accomplished using two basic principles. Firstly the CPU has two operating modes: a privileged mode and an unprivileged mode. While in privileged mode a program executing on the CPU can perform any operation, interact with anything in any way, do anything, in unprivileged mode a set of restrictions are applied, the CPU will ignore anything disallowed or can even be made to do something else in the place of the forbidden action. Secondly there is something called an interrupt timer. This can be set to count down a specific length of time then trigger a set action to occur, interrupting whatever is currently happening.  The way these are used is the operating system will set the interrupt timer to trigger a switch into privileged mode and operating system execution. Then the operating system will switch into unprivileged mode and tell the CPU to start executing application code. After awhile the timer finishes its countdown and fires, the operating system resumes executing and decides either to go right back to executing the application code or to 'save the place' that the application was executing at (so it can be resumed later) and do other things. Modern multitasking operating systems can run multiple programs on a single CPU core ""at the same time"" by doing this extraordinarily quickly, switching back and forth between two (or more) programs very quickly, giving each program small interlaced slices of time, like a film projectionist splicing frames together.  Now then, a virtual machine manager has to act as an operating system of operating systems. It has to run multiple operating systems that each think they're the only thing controlling the computer. Do you remember what I said about being able to set the CPU to do some other thing when it is asked to perform a forbidden task? This is what a virtual machine manager has to do, it has to set the CPU up in such a way that whenever a guest operating system tries to set the CPU up to its own liking what actually happens is that the manager records everything, then when the operating system tries to do something dependent on that set up the manager has to step in and put on a show, acting as if the hardware responded the way the operating system expects. Virtualbox is expected to do time-slicing multitasking, while doing this for multiple operating systems, while it itself is running inside an operating system (I actually don't know how this last part works... I should read up on it).  Needless to say this gets really complicated, modern CPUs have thousands of different permission settings. Virtualization being really complicated makes it computationally costly which slows down virtual machines. Paravirtualization comes in when the guest operating system can be made in such a way as to detect that it is running in a virtual machine, and start doing things using an interface provided by the virtual machine manager, I.E not trying to set up hardware the way it wants it, instead asking the manager to do things. This avoids the song and dance of having to have the manager pretend to be a CPU and the many complex interactions associated with this.  TL;DR: Imagine that you have to build a log cabin but you're not allowed to touch any sharp things, but you don't know this so you're given fake plastic tools and someone with a real ones stands behind you looks over your shoulder. Whenever you chop a log they actually swing their axe and chop it for you. Whenever you hammer a nail they do the same with their real one. They work carefully around your hands so as to not interfere with your work while making sure that the same things you'd expect to happen when you swing a real axe or a hammer, really do happen. Now, what would be faster and less energy consuming, doing that, or just asking the man to please build a log cabin according to your specifications?"

You can issue a certificate yourself (it doesn't need to be validated by a higher authority), add it to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities and to the Trusted Publishers lists (in certmgr.msc).

technology,3d8s14,Fibonacci35813,5,Tue Jul 14 17:32:43 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of reasons I use them, though some of those use cases will be moving to container based solutions--like docker and LXD.   High-Availability; Since my company operates mission-critical, real-time systems, we have certain services that can not go down with out causing serious expense. To minimize downtime, we install our services (in parallel where possible) on virtual machines. These can actually be migrated between hosts (underlying hardware) without any disruption whatsoever. This means we can reboot all the hardware servers as needed, without ever shutting down the virtual servers. Staging; our staging environment is exactly like our production environment, except that it is scaled down, and the specific addresses/locations of services is different. Running everything in virtual machines means that we can spin up new instances of a server, test/reconfigure it, and have it dialed in before uploading the perfect image to the production environment. Snapshotting; this is less of a case for us now, since our storage is all virtualized as well, but can still come in handy. You can get an image (virtual machine) running exactly as you want it, and then save the state. You can then continue, clone, and/or fork that state all at once. Really handy for testing new combinations of software--and rewinding/deleting the current state when it doesn't work as expected."

Found the performance to be lacking particularly when dealing with database. Databases that were not even that large.  We just changed over to esxi which is also free and the performance is multiple times better but the learning curve is much steeper.  I have yet to fully master it unlike virtual box which is windows based.  Esxi is a bare metal hypervisor which basically means it is its own OS.   To give a good example, we operated routers and could only get speeds of 150 to 200 mbps on virtual box. Same on esxi increased speeds to near gigabyte and seemed to be limited only by the network card. Not sure why the preformed issue as we never notice high CPU usage or resource bottle necks.

VirtualBox and VMWare are like PC emulators, only they don't emulate, they work differently, but in the same sense you can play Mario or Zelda on your PC, you can use a virtual machine to play other versions of Windows.  Like, my wife really doesn't like Windows 10, and I've already upgraded us. If I can still use Windows 7 after 10 goes live for everybody, I'm not sure how that will work (nobody is yet), but if it works out that I can still install 7, I'll put it in a virtual machine, so if she wants to run 7, she can.  Or, if you have the right hardware, supposedly you can run Apple's OS X, though it's in a legal grey area if not outright illegal to do so. Now that I have an Intel machine, I think I'm technically able to run it... It won't run on AMD. Heh. I should look into that..."

""XP Mode"" in Windows 7 is just a Windows XP virtual machine (running on VirtualPC, Microsoft's version of VirtualBox). So if you have older software that only runs under XP, or need to run a 16-bit application on an x64 computer, you can use XP Mode to do so. Some people also use virtual machines to test software or to try out ""sketchy"" programs. Most virtual machine apps come with some sort of ""snapshot"" feature which allows you to ignore any changes on this boot... kind of like going back in time. And, of course, many Mac users have a Windows virtual machine on their computer so they can run Windows-only software on their Macs.  On the IT end, virtual machines have many uses. I have a client that has a remote office, and (for many reasons) they wanted to keep all the data in their main office. So I created several virtual machines for the remote users to log into via Remote Desktop. That way. it's just like they have an actual desktop computer at the main office, complete with Outlook, the POS app, etc.  Another thing IT folks do is virtualize servers. A company might have a several servers where the software runs and does its intended job quite well. But the servers might be 7, 8+ years old and could be concerns about hardware failure. Instead of buying a bunch of new servers (that may or may not run the same software, or require all new licenses), you can simply buy one beefy server and ""virtualize"" those servers onto it. Because a nice 2015 server shouldn't have any problem running several instances of Server 2003 or Server 2008, etc."

technology,3d8s14,tjandearl,5,Tue Jul 14 13:52:29 2015 UTC,"Unless you have two graphics cards this wouldn't be possible anyways.  Not in the strict ""direct access to the GPU"" sense.  VMware and Nvidia have a joint platform with VMware Horizon View with Nvidia Grid vGPU - where a single graphics card on an ESXi host (with multiple GPUs) such as a Grid K1 or K2 can be shared amongst VMs running on the ESXi hypervisor.  The Nvidia drivers are installed on the guest VM and they have time-shared access directly to the GPU.  This is a specialized case for a specific purpose, and requires drivers both on the hypervisor and within the guest VM specifically designed to make it work, and even then it isn't true ""direct"" access, but shared low level access.  You wouldn't be able to dedicate your graphics card to the VM running in virtualbox or any other type 2 hypervisor if it's already claimed by the host OS.    I don't know if there are other solutions that allow for PCI passthrough in a type 2 hypervisor, but if there are, you could potentially dedicate a second graphics card to a VM.  Not sure why you'd want to, though.  Typically the 3d support in virtualbox and others is good enough for what most people would do with a VM."

technology,3d8s14,ben_uk,3,Tue Jul 14 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"There's nothing quite like that for graphics cards yet.  Intel's Iris Pro has hardware GPU virtualization, which accomplishes basically what you're talking about, but the driver support seems to be rather limited so far.  I don't too many specifics about it, but it seems to be rather niche at this time.    Virtualization is a trickle down area in technology it seems.  New technology is released for the enterprise level and then trickles down to workstation/desktop grade hardware and software.  Iris Pro exists in Xeons but I'm not aware of any major appliances or ""players"" in the enterprise virtualization arena that support it yet.  That's how it works though, the hardware vendors come out with something and then there's software support later.  In my lab at home I was able to set up Horizon View (5.2) with an nvidia Quadro 4000 graphics card and use VMware's vSGA (shared graphics acceleration, the precursor to their joint-vGPU venture).  The VM I set up was powerful enough to run 3dMark (albeit, 2006 only, since it only supported dx9).  In my experience (I manage VDI at a community college), typically the software 3d support (which is good enough for Aero in Windows) is ""good enough"", but we have the vSGA set up with nvidia Grid K1 cards to offload some of that work to the GPUs from the CPUs.

technology,3ddzcj,omnicons,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"Speed.  Graphics cards need a very high speed connection to communicate with the CPU quickly enough to coordinate with it without bottlenecks. GPUs use PCI to communicate with the CPU which gives the GPU a very direct connection at a pretty high speed. PCI-e 3.0 x16 gets up to 8Ghz and a max bandwidth of 16GB/s.  That's fast, that's plenty of speed to keep up with the fastest processors, and enough bandwidth to crunch and output a ton of pixels for 4k and beyond.  Most laptops (particularly the lightweight one you want) only have USB to communicate. USB 3.1 ""only"" does 10 GB/s and caps out around 1Mhz. Obviously that won't do.  But some laptops have mini PCI-e ports that should provide a faster connection to the CPU. But still they're not fast enough. Mini PCI-e only exposes 1 link (PCI-e 3.0 x1) whereas modern graphics cards need 16 links (PCI-e 3.0 x16).  The problem is that there is no port standard in the form factor needed to support the speeds and bandwidth that GPUs need for fully communicating with the CPU, and there's not enough demand to get that standard made.  You could get a super underpowered graphics card that runs on PCI-e x1, and use a converter that way. I don't know if there are any extra compatibility layers to get that to work. It'd be interesting to see if it could work with a vanilla converter though. Some of the other solutions posted here do use x16 cards, but I'm not sure how they convince the GPUs to work on x1 or if they're just designed to be flexible enough to run on it. I'm not sure how much technical finagling is required.  But, anyways, it is possible! And the other posters have shown solutions for this. The only thing is there probably isn't a laptop out there that exposes a x16 PCI-e port as its form factor is incredibly inconvenient, and mini PCI only gets a fraction of the bandwidth, so you'd never be able to get a laptop to perform on par with a desktop even if it had a comparable CPU because the port is a bottleneck.  Also, modern ultrabooks rarely expose mini PCI-e anymore so for a super light laptop you can't do this period. You'd be limited in which laptops you can use because of this.  FYI, it was hard to find good sources on a lot of these specs so I might have made a few mistakes in my research.  tl;dr You can. But it'll cap out at a fraction of its power and leave most of the graphics card unutilized.  EDIT: All that said, the future is looking very bright in terms of powerful ports! Thunderbolt is a port that actually provides PCI-e support in a small form factor, but it never really took off that much as USB just became ubiquitous. The really good news is that Thunderbolt 3 will use the same port as USB-C! This is amazing news for forward compatibility, and for the first time EVER, the entire industry is banding together around a single standard! Finally! Thunderbolt 3 still doesn't provide x16 support, but it does get up to x4. The important thing is that this port will have great compatibility and adoption making it much easier for niche manufacturers to be able products like the one you want."

The company is valued at, last I checked, $500 million.  So you'd control a tiny piece of the $500 million and it would be worth something if you sold your share to someone else.    It's like how you can buy a house and then you own that house's value.  So say you own a $150,000 house.  Your equity in that house is $150,000.  But the house can make or lose money depending on how the market changes.  Regardless of that change, you still own the house, but the house might change in value.  Furthermore, you can't cut pieces of your house off and use them to buy things; that value is locked up in the property as a whole and requires a buyer to liquidate.    Reddit is like a big house that also takes lots of money to keep intact and has a bunch of servants.  So like how even if you own a house outright, you still pay for water and electric every month to keep it usable, Reddit has to pay for server uptake, employees, etc. to keep itself usable.

technology,3d97fs,freestyling,7,Tue Jul 14 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, I'm actually surprised how much hate Mozilla is getting here.  Adobe has been dragging their heels with Flash. It has been a massive exploit-factory, simply because it is effectively running arbitrary code. Browsers now sandbox plugins into a separate process almost entirely because Adobe Flash is so buggy and crash-prone and they prefer not to have flash take the entire process with it. This doesn't do anything for security, because you have to rely on Adobe to keep ActionScript inside it's own sandbox. Given they cannot seem to make it more reliable I'm not going to go out on a limb and suggest it has anything approaching security within it.  Adobe Flash still doesn't run in 64-bit, which speaks volumes about how awful the codebase must be. Their entire update process is a clusterfuck. It boggles my mind how a company that has been around as long as Adobe could fuck up something so simple. I love how they also use that as a platform to advertise their other shit, too. ""You like Flash, you'll love Photoshop Elements!""   personally I've had Flash set to require me to activate it manually so realistically this change is going to result in zero change for me.  That IT businesses and such rely on flash is a shame, but they've had years to move to something more secure. Few businesses are going to move to another technology if they have a choice to keep using what they have. Insecure shit should be dumped and the Adobe Flash Plugin has proven itself as a massive liability, And Adobe themselves have shown they have zero commitment to actually improving it.  Realistically, I think of flash as a product of the 90's. I put it in the exact same domain as Netscape ""Plugins"", Java Applets, and ActiveX Controls. insecure shit that we should have stopped using years ago. The main reason it's managed to hang on, In my opinion, is because Flash was pretty much the easiest and fastest way to have embedded video cross-platform, so sites like youtube becoming huge meant that Flash got a massive boost in terms of utility.  Now that we are starting to get alternatives for video playback with technologies in HTML5, It is nice that we can finally start to shed the zombie remains of an insecure and unreliable 90's technology and move towards a more secure and open web."
technology,3d97fs,BCProgramming,4,Tue Jul 14 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"Alternatives yes, but there are still a lot of IT businesses that rely heavily on flash, advertisement and online gambling to name two. Not saying it should be like this but it's the reality of things.  Also, HTML5 will definitely take over after flash (and has done so very much already) but there are still areas in which it falls very short. Support for games on mobile platforms for instance is still sketchy (people do like to use old and outdated hardware/software).  In short, to disable flash in one of the major browsers is a controversial step, regardless if you like it or not."

I constantly hear the argument that millennials have no work ethic and are just a bunch of overprivileged sloths. Older generations consistently throw this around to tout their superior work ethics. The problem with all these arguments is that the contemporary workplace has CHANGED. I'd love to see the older generations cope with things like a 24/7 email tether and late night support calls where responses are expected at 3am. In most professions the concept of a work/life balance has been utterly destroyed in contemporary life. It is for this reason that I think employers should recognize the stress/toll this takes on developing families and individuals and compensate appropriately with things like flexible work environments, telecommuting and letting employees set their own hours.  I would further extend this rant to those companies who aggressively block services on their corporate networks (eg. Facebook, YouTube) for the sake of ""productivity enhancements"". The internet is ubiquitous. If it's blocked in the office for the sake of productivity, it can just as easily be accessed on a smartphone or a hotspot tethered to a corporate laptop. I can understand the need for blocking services such as bittorrent or anything illegal but some companies really need to shape up and get with the times.

You walk by your employees briefly scanning the situation.  You see 4 guys clicking on their computer and 1 guy playing Clash of Clans on his phone, complete with Clash of Clans sound effects and volume up. At first glance, and at first annoyance, as you ignorantly walk into your office to go huff and puff about whatever bosses need to huff and puff at... which of the 5 looked to be screwing around the most to you? You don't know what they were clicking on their computer, might have been work, might have been porn, who knows. But what the hell did that 1 employee need to be doing on his personal cell phone?  Make sense?  I even told him to do his crap on his workstation instead and nobody will say anything to him. What does he do? Plays on his phone anyway."

The only thing I do mind is he doesn't take the warnings seriously and kind of gives management a middle finger about it. Of course he could use his free time to take initiative and get some more things done on top of his assigned workload.   I don't want to fire him, it took me a long time to train him and he gets along with the others well. He could give a damn about company policy though so the owner says he's finished.  I actually put my neck out when he was being written up the last time and just said ""put the phone away man, even if you use your computer for Facebook or whatever I don't care - the owner is just tired of walking by and seeing you on your phone""."

Browse FB on your work given PC if you have down time, just not on your god damn phone. It makes it too obvious, and it looks like we're all sitting twiddling our thumbs (even if we are).

If you let people simply pick and choose which rules they can follow, then those rules no longer have any meaning. I have some bullshit rules for my job as well, which I don't agree with, but you know what? I still follow them, because it's part of my job to do so, and I'd rather have my job than to rebel against such simple rules as not to sit on your phone, especially when you've even been given permission to use your computer for such activities instead.

Scheduling them as you would jobs/threads/mechanics - concurrency engineering with redundancies for malfunctions.   Behavioral problem? Troubleshoot it, debug them - albeit you need to step through backwards not forwards. If they can't be fixed, consider it a flaw in the hardware. Can you get around it by apply a patch/process that'll work for that circumstance? If not, consider it a hardware glitch with no vendor support, switch the hardware. It's not your job to engineer individual parts fixes, but just like any hardware you'd find out the problem and see if it's viable to work with or replace. It's your job to engineer task management. Assuming you know, it is your job. If you're not titled or compensated as a management position and the benefits that comes with especially since management usually has legal/liability issues standard employees don't have and they're asking you to handle managing - then maybe you need to talk with upper management about that. Because that's bad management on their part - it does a disservice to you and it's potentially liability for them as well. Make sure your accountability matches your authority and training.  By doing it that way you'll always end up on the justified end of the argument since you'll have sound reasoning for requesting change due to problems or hiring/firing and if someone tries to guilt trip you can point out you tried helping them work it out and getting them to work and it's not issue of emotions, they simply weren't a good fit. Make sure you highlight that it is a problem when it is a problem so they don't assume that they're being blindsided.

Sometimes banging at work and applying more stress is less productive than relaxing for a bit and coming back with a solution to a problem. Not thinking consciously thinking about something can let your mind wander and put things together or give you fresh eyes on it by making you recheck everything piece by piece properly without biasing yourself by thinking you already checked it. Or putting him in a comfortable thinking zone. Besides, mixing things up often spurs inspiration and alternative thinking. What looks like playing a game... well yeah is playing a game still, but beneficially so. Point is, sometimes fucking around is not fucking around.   It's not unlike say being a weight lifter where you wouldn't lift weights for twelve hours a day with crunch time - you're doing your job weight lifting by not lifting any weights and letting your body rest and heal.

Some employees were constantly on their phones, despite being chastised and even with notes right in front of them.  Those employees are all either working there or working in a similar job. Many of the employees who didn't have smartphones or didn't use them constantly, have moved on to greener pastures. This is not a result of anything to do with ""Times are changing"" but rather just an observation that like any generation millenials do have useless people and, at least anecdotally, it seems there is a strong overlap between useless people and people who decide they constantly need to check facebook to see of somebody liked their status update or whatever."

The article should mention that this only applies to millennials who are even able to find jobs.   Entitlement is the ""hard working class"" of Baby Boomers tripling the national debt since the 1980's to fund their own tax cuts and short term economic gains while REFUSING to raise the age of social security or reducing those benefits so that the generation of ""little shits"" might have a small share of what they pay into.  Entitlement is allowing an entire successor generation to languish is suffocating student debt while unable to find jobs that can even put a dent in that debt, let alone provide for a family.   Entitlement is not allowing a reasonable minimum wage that baby boomers enjoyed when they were the age of the ""little shits"", while opting to cut taxes on capital gains from stocks and creating an economy where wage earners at all income levels receive a smaller portion of economic output at any time since 1929.   Entitlement is for decades, enjoying the benefits of the LOWEST ENERGY COSTS in the world while refusing to price in the external costs of carbon emissions, exacerbating climate change to a planet that the ""little shits"" will inherit.

technology,3d6asv,JonnyHall,383,Tue Jul 14 03:06:14 2015 UTC,"Who knows, maybe there was a personal conflict, maybe she flipped out, we can only speculate, the issue here though is that he let Ellen Pao take the brunt of the attack and he admitted that only in a (buried) comment in a thread after she publicly apologized and after she left, meaning, a little too late and a little too little to be a honorable assumption of responsibility in my view (and Yishan's apparently).  But that's OK, now that Ellen is a moderator of an SRS sub and Spez is back in charge everybody seems to be where they deserve and fit better."

technology,3d6asv,shark2pus,29,Tue Jul 14 03:22:58 2015 UTC,"I think what is becoming apparent is that Alexis, while a chairman of the board, wanted to work as a normal employee and let Pao run the daily operations.   Just like all employees, you sometimes end up in disagreements or conflicts with the people you work with. Instead of solving it like an adult or like the normal employee he wanted to be, he decided he wouldn't stand for someone disagreeing with him and pulled his power card. Telling Pao to fire her.  It likely caused quite the conflict for Pao, if she was a stronger leader, she should have told him no. He was her boss in many ways but still, if he didn't have confidence in her ability to make decisions he should have fired Pao, not try to get her to fire people who disagree with him in the company.  It undermines her as well as makes everyone afraid of the 'ordinary employee' Alexis. Who while pretending not to lead the company and just be an ordinary buddy, fires people at will behind the scenes."

The both seem like really great dudes, and if i every encounter them again, i'd be delighted to buy them beers.

technology,3d6asv,Mr_Strangelove_MSc,192,Tue Jul 14 10:03:19 2015 UTC,"She was always pretty clearly a scapegoat for whatever it is you hate.  Pretty much every reason to hate her has nothing to with the issue at hand.    I think it is safe to say that she as a CEO probably had fuck all to do with how mod and admin tools work or how they are treated.    You can say the buck has to stop with her, but it is like getting pissed at the president because the DMV customer service blows.  It isn't even on the presidents radar, much like how the complaints about admins and mods probably were not on Pao's.  Ditto for firing specific low level employees.  She might have called for some head chopping in particular departments, but it is pretty doubtful she mandated that they go fire specific people and handle the transfer shittily.  The rest of the vitriol came from two places.  First, she is the figure head for the move to start making Reddit a wee bit less ugly.  Again, I kind of doubt she was micromanaging it, though in this case she might actually be at least partially the correct target.  She might actually have told someone ""go clean up the real shit holes so we don't look like assholes"" to investors.  Second, she had a lot of her personal life torn open for all to see in her (failed) lawsuit against a former employer for sexual discrimination.  The tl;dr version of that is that everyone who works at venture capital firms are complete assholes with Pao herself not coming out smelling like roses herself.  How you interpret those disclosures is a basically a Rorschach test.  If you accuse people of being ""social justice warriors"", it probably leaves you hating Pao as the worst example of women SJW feminism.  If you fall on the other side, you see someone who had to navigate through a bunch of old boy assholes and who got screwed.  Personally, I have no feels on Pao one way or the other.  I have a feeling she is probably kind of a dick to work with, but I think basically all CEOs doing her particular job of consolidating a wild startup are probably assholes.  Your job is to crush the worst excesses of startup culture and you kind of need to be an asshole to do that.  I think the lynch mob was just dumb group think and the vaguely racist overtones (""Chairmen Pao"") to the entire thing icky.    That said, lynching someone, even the wrong someone might have gained a little attention for people's pet causes, so who am I to judge?  Whatever hurt feels she has she can probably soothed over with her large bags of money."

Alexis wasn't some employee reporting to Pao, he was the Executive Chairman of the Board, i.e. Pao's boss. He had different ideas for AMAs, he didn't like Victoria's role, and decided to fire her. Pao wasn't able to do anything about it. In this case it shouldn't have traveled upstream to her, it came from above her.  Then when the hate-train started up against Pao, Alexis should have been out front and center saying very clearly ""Ellen Pao did not make this decision, I did.""

There's a definite tension with free speech, which is why the safe space gets contained in a certain space.

Reddit is not ""directly under AP's control"". AP is a shareholder in reddit.    The direction Conde or AP would want Reddit to move towards would literally be the exact same.   That doesn't make any sense. Conde Nast has a particular brand image that has a completely different focus than, say, all the newspapers that AP owns, which in turn have a very different focus from many other AP properties, like Nascar World, Inside Lacrosse, or Religion News Service.  If you think you can perceive a single direction that all those properties are ""directly controlled"" to move, I'd love to hear it.  AP is the 44th biggest private company in the US, and Conde Nast is just one of its properties.  In fact, part of the reason that reddit was moved from Conde Nast ownership to AP was probably precisely because reddit wasn't consistent with Conde Nast's brand focus.   Pretty much a pointless, hairsplitting distinction.   I'm surprised you can say that with a straight face when you wrote both ""Ideologically I agree with you however Conde Nast does not"" and then ""I did not state that Conde Nast owned or had shares in Reddit.""

Specifically, we want to make sure that we're focusing on the right things first, so it's important that we start having conversations directly with mods to find out what that is, instead of being committed to working on the two things Alexis mentioned. They're both definitely important issues, but I don't know if they're the most important ones. That's why we've been trying to step back from those promises a bit, not because we think they're impossible but because we're not sure if they're even the right promises.  Steve coming back as CEO is also a really big step here. Even in the announcement post, he listed improving moderator tools as one of his top priorities. From talking with him so far, it's been very clear that this is something he wants to make sure we make some major improvements to soon, and I'm confident that he's going to make sure that we get a lot of updates made in the fairly near future.  Overall, things are definitely still not settled, and I expect they probably still won't be for a little while yet. The last couple of weeks have been rough for everyone, but I think we're making some good steps now, and things are going to get better."

Honestly, I completely understand why you're doing so because trying to fullfil impulsive decisions is never a good idea. But slowly stepping back will give a horrible impression if it's not done in the open since subs like askreddit installed a timer waiting for these specific changes to happen.  Finding out the actual requirements to improve the site is a fantastic idea, but please be transparant about it cause I've had enough of the reddit team witch-hunts really.  Either way thanks a lot for your honesty, and if you're saying the ""we'll improve stuff"" is not just PR-speak then I believe you."

There are so many questions I have on the business side of Reddit.   First of all, Reddit is valued at $500mm at last round. It seems low for such a popular side, especially for a site with the most desirable age group. Quora is recently valued at nearly twice that price.  Secondly, I have not seen anybody challenged /r/spez during his AMA on how/why he thinks it is possible for him to run two growth companies at the same time,  however physically close they are?   Thirdly, has anyone called out the board for the recent hiring/firing mishaps (to put it mildly)? It is the board's fiduciary duty to find the best agents/managers available on the market. Yet it appears the board has constantly clashed with its hand picked managers. Are the board CAPABLE of finding good candidates? Are the board members connected enough in the industry, or have they spent enough time/energy on screening candidates?  It is bewildering to see such a valuable asset being tossed around like this with no end in sight.  (Edit: grammer)"
technology,3d7vtr,Patranus,64,Tue Jul 14 06:16:04 2015 UTC,"There is the issue.  Why is a member of the BoD even firing a low level employee?  That is the job of the CEO/COO/senior management regardless of if the board member is a co-founder.  The entire thing is comical and something you would never see at any 'real' company that had a competent management structure.  The BoD picks the management team and then goes.  If the management team is taking the company in the wrong direction then it is replaced.  It doesn't micromanage day to day operations of low level employees and if they do, they put that burden on the CEO.  The entire thing reeks of amateur hour and incompetence."

As someone who works in the industry, specifically with many ""experienced tech and business leaders"" I can assure you that it is exceedingly difficult. The dirty little secret about many tech companies is that failure abounds. The only thing that keeps most tech companies alive is income. They can afford to pay workers who get nothing done. They can afford to pay and promote managers who run their projects into the ground. All this because they have one project, or product, just one, that makes money. And NO ONE KNOWS HOW OR WHY IT MAKES MONEY. It's just a golden goose. Since it's a mystery as to how success happened in the first place no one knows how to replicate it or maintain it. It's very difficult to get anyone VP level or higher to admit to such a thing. It's actually very difficult to get anyone VP level or higher to admit responsibility for anything. Most live behind a wall of metrics and spreadsheets that always seem to tell them everything is fine. This creates an ecosystem of failure and a lot of times this turns into a culture of failure. Important 'A' level people tend to flee when failure is overlooked or even rewarded. A VP, or even a Director, probably can't even tell you who is their 'A' level talent is. Sure they will throw out names, but they are probably wrong.   So people who don't know how to make money have a lot of meetings and try to tell people who may or may not have technical skills what to do and when it should be done.   This is why software sucks. This is why things are buggy or slow. This is why software is expensive."

Lots of people get hired for situations where they have a difficult task ahead of them. People on reddit discuss all the time how some CEO get golden parachutes after running company in the ground vs others who are hired while the company was already facing troubles and who get big bonuses despite the company preforming poorly for their job of turning everything around.  I can see why some malicious person might hire someone who they don't like to oversee a project that they have determined is already destined to fail, but Reddit wasn't exactly in dire straights when Pao took over and the board who gave/let her keep the job had a lot more to loose by her performing badly than they had to win by her performing well."

The board sets the direction of the company and then tasks its senior management with carrying it out, which includes the CEO.

Whether you work at McDonald's or JPMorgan Chase, if you don't have the resources and/or authority to do your job, it's the most frustrating thing ever. I get the feeling she needed to get some programmers or new software maybe, and was told flat out no. Plus, she probably saw that once everything went down the drain, it would be all on her, so she bounced before her rep could be ruined. Toxic work environments are toxic. I left a job for a prominent brand that I loved because I literally had to fight, beg, borrow, and steal supplies & equipment from my coworkers, and they all did the same. I left another job at a big bank because the management was full of egomaniacal jerks who cared more about who smiled at them than who got work done (not to mention the gossip about who did what in the bathroom... yes, from management). People shouldn't dread going to work every day. Again, not sure that's how she felt, but it seems like it."

My theory, just to get people more riled up, is that Kn0thing knew a community crapstorm was happening, and decided to not say anything while Pao took the brunt of it.

I didn't much care for Pao, and would rather Yishan be the brunt of silly reddit jokes, but I kinda think kn0thing already saw that siding with Pao wasn't gonna give him any community karma, and opted to do damage control afterwords.  tl;dr I SUPPORT /u/REDDITCEO FOR A BETTER REDDIT EXPERIENCE, ALL THE OTHER CEO'S OWN SHARKS WITH LASERS"

We simple took what the 3rd party tools/plugins were doing, and incorporated them into our software directly. That was about 7 years ago. We haven't had people making similar 3rd party plugins, because it does what our users and volunteer moderators wanted it to do in the first place (exactly what the plugins did)  Sometimes doing exactly what the plugin does is exactly what needs to be done.

Did Victoria grow a penis while I wasn't looking or something? How can we be sexist when we are up in arms about the termination of a high profile female from the company?    Pao was judged by the community based on the social contract of the site and found wanting. It really is that simple. The vindictive comments aimed at her were guided by her sex; yes, but it was her actions that triggered the response. A male doing the same things would see a similar response, but they would be called ""gay"", ""neckbeard"", ""faggot"" and have people threatening to beat them or anally rape them on the streets if they see them or even accusing them of pedophilia. Neither of those responses are acceptable or even palatable, however that is the price of free and open dialog.

Electrical equipment do the best they can with power supplies(and batteries) to smooth out power like they need it, your phone assumes power is coming from a standard house, so it has a low amount of precautions.  But you have devices like APC's which assume power can be coming from somewhere bad, they are often used on servers to smooth out the power from ICE generators when power shuts off, or anything from the grid nasty happens, which protects the server.  Now consider a moving train, power stability doesn't exists on a moving train unless it is being smoothed out on purpose, you can have massive spikes due to the train stopping or going, or difficulty with the moving connection connecting in and disconnecting. If the train is generating power with it's engine it's possible the power is only meant for special equipment that do have the electronics necessary to protect them selves. Normally in a town power is smoothed out before getting to your house, you don't just simply directly plug into a nuclear or coal generator, that would completely kill your electronics."

Those radios require professional installation as stated in both the datasheet and the manual and they stress that you could be in violation of the law if you misuse them.  and to be clear, you are not doing a 2.5 mile link with any speed unless you are violating rule 15. your talking 8, 10dB difference in loss over distance under FSPL rules. which is the range doubled twice. wifi works about 100m. so you are talking 400 meters while being legal; further than that you are either in a great RF environment or you are breaking the rules.   The fine is 10k a day plus 100k if found in violation if not more.    my bet? FCC showed up at their door having df-ed to find them and they realized that   1) it is pretty easy to track a powerful transmitter   and   2) pretty damn expensive to violate fcc rule 15.  from a hardware perspective the entirety of the stuff they did was put a small computer with a wifi card and the ubquiti into a box.  they basically created a long distance wifi relay."

To get out to 2.5miles without LOS, were basically talking about a cellular tower and at least 20W on a fixed link.    Either way, those ubiquiti bullets are pretty fantastic.

But. 900mhz is around the 33cm band for ham operators. I know that the FCC probably would not allow these to be sold in the United States due to the distance the signal travels. Because of that, my only assumption due to how a 33cm radio wave acts, these things have a not a lot but more than normal amount of energy being used for something that transmits around 33cm. So thus it would cause a decent amount of interference to other people using radio signals around that frequency. Thankfully, cell phones use to run on the 33cm band but they were upped to somewhere about 1000mhz. But back on track, the FCC would not like this at all. I promise."

After having him use IP chicken.com I was able to find out he was using a directional wireless antenna, a very high powered one to go almost a whole mile to where one of the parks were. After looking at the old schematics apparently the last company used one of the wireless back-haul directional antennas pointed towards his house by mistake and he was able to login in to the system because all of it was using the same SSID and no passwords.  Basically in short, if you really want to ""hide"" the best way is to get your self a good directional antenna and login to wireless networks that are with in range of your device, Yes I know that not all of them will be able to send the packets back as far as your antenna will send them, but if you can manage to get almost a mile away no one would be able to find you.

If you wanted to pick one of the most short sighted moves Sony made in the history of it's company - removing the Other OS option is a great contender for the winning action."
technology,3d810x,formesse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"GeoHot was already on the brink of cracking the signing key for the PS3, and his work (which he had been working on for months if not years) was becoming more and more well known.    It was at that point that Sony removed the other OS in what ultimately was a futile attempt at holding off the inevitable.   While a lot of people were pissed about the removal of OtherOS, they were mostly pissed that it set a precedent of removing features in general, and not specifically about OtherOS (Most real Linux enthusiasts long since knew that Linux ran like absolute dog shit on the PS3 even under the best of conditions).    While some people used the removal of OtherOS as justification for their actions, the reality of the situation was that the keys were going to be released anyway."
technology,3d810x,NightwingDragon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:53:36 2015 UTC,"From wikipidia:  Relevant info on the intention to breach the sony PS3:   In December 2009, Hotz announced his initial intentions to breach security on the Sony PlayStation 3. Five weeks later, on January 22, 2010, he announced that he had performed...   Info on the removal of the other OS.   When Sony announced the upcoming release of the PS3 Slim in September 2009, they stated that it would not be supporting the OtherOS feature   This is not a years long project to hack the system. It was weeks from the point of anouncement, and likely not more then months - Up till the removal of the Other OS, the white hat / grey hat hacking community was happy: They could run their own code on the device.  Announcement to remove other OS => ~4 months => Initial intention anounced => 5 weeks => Breach.  I don't recall a single thread discussing any amount of success in hacking the system prior to OtherOS being removed. This would seem odd - except there was little incentive to hack the system prior to this point."
technology,3d810x,formesse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"From the source article you're quoting from:   Mr Hotz said that he had begun the hack last summer when he had spent three weeks analysing the hardware.  After a long break, he spent a further two weeks cracking the console, which he described as a ""very secure system"".    The article was posted in January of 2010.  Assuming ""last summer"" refers to the summer of 2009, this would mean that he actually started his work several months before Sony announced the removal of OtherOS.   GeoHot was not exactly well known for keeping quiet, which means that it's very likely that Sony got wind of his work and hastily removed OtherOS in what would be a futile attempt to either stop his work before he could finish, or at the very least attempt to stop others from picking up where he left off.    Given the fact that the article mentions a ""long break"" (which was already well known, as GeoHot did take some time off and at one point felt that he would not be able to get full access to the system), it's also possible that ""last summer"" refers to as far back as the summer of 2008.    Regarding incentive.....the incentive is and always has been piracy.   Linux has a 1-2% userbase.  How many of those people who have enough expertise to even use Linux in the first place would actually want to run Linux on a PS3 where it would run like absolute dogshit at best?  How many people do you know that gave the first shit about OtherOS or running Linux on the PS3 before this debacle?  How many people are just using the whole thing as an excuse to justify piracy?  Nobody cared about Linux on the PS3.    Every console before this generation has been hacked for the purposes of piracy.  I guarantee you right now that there are people trying to crack open the PS4, X-Box One, Wii-U, and every other system out there.  They may take several years to actually come up with something that works (if they come up with one at all), but that doesn't mean the work hasn't already started."
technology,3d810x,NightwingDragon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"First up - thanks for pointing that out, I missed reading the date of the article. And yes, reading it over again, the work was likely started sooner.  Something else I came across in reviewing this - is the fact that the OtherOS hardware access was crippled from the beginning - an easy justification to hack the system and gain full access to the hardware you purchased.   Regarding incentive.....the incentive is and always has been piracy.   For some yes. For others no. But I suppose the results funnel in both legitimate use and illegitimate use directions. Once you can bypass the checks, running your own code or pirated copies of software becomes far more trivial."
technology,3d810x,formesse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"Of course OtherOS hardware access was crippled.  Consoles aren't open-source.   Sony (nor any other developer) isn't going to just hand out an instruction manual on how to gain hardware access, install custom firmware, and play pirated games.   Heck, hardware access to just about every device out there is intentionally crippled to prevent tampering.    And I heavily question how many people wanted to crack the PS3 for legitimate purposes.    I'm sure there are a few hobbyists out there, but I very seriously doubt the vast majority of people who use custom firmware do so because they like the idea of buying a console for (at the time) $500 or so, intentionally crippling it by installing custom firmware, voiding their warranty and ensuring it can never connect to PSN, and run a bunch of homebrew apps and emulators that were little more than glorified platformers.  I very seriously doubt many people would want to go through all that effort just to do something that a PC could handle better and cheaper.    As for running Linux itself....again, only a few distros even ran on ps3 in the first place, and even those ran like shit.   Linux had a 1-2% userbase, and the ones who are actual linux enthusiasts aren't going to want to intentionally cripple their experience by running it badly on subpar hardware (when compared to a PC). You'd be talking about a miniscule fraction of a miniscule fraction of the overall gaming userbase -- hardly enough to even qualify as a rounding error.    My personal knowledge of Linux is limited.  I have a handful of friends with varying levels of expertise with the system, and every single one of them balked at the idea of running it on a PS3.  That being said, I'd be willing to bet that the number of true linux enthusiasts who cared about running the OS and/or hobbyists who wanted to run legitimate homebrew applications and had no intentions of piracy probably number in the single to double digits at best."

Even though engineers/programmers are terrible at time estimation, they (we) put up with this bullshit because there is at least some say in the process (I.e. I can theoretically game the system and get more time for a project).  If I had to bet, /r/askreddit's deadline is scaring the shit out of them because it leaves no room for working out the scheduling. The middle managers allocated themselves comfortable 40 hour weeks and are going to push the engineers into 60+ weeks with product design deliverables placed way too late in the lifecycle for the engineers to finish in time.

There are certainly some miserable assholes on Reddit who are racist and gynophobic, and who focused their inadequacy-driven hatred on Pao.   But there are also people who simply weren't convinced that Pao was doing a good job. Her role as CEO was to be in charge. She wasn't, as was illustrated by the AMA firing. It was to communicate effectively to all the stakeholders. She didn't-- her messaging seemed largely to be based on MBA word-salad and defensiveness. It was to plan strategically and execute effectively. No joy there either. The cleanup of some of the shit-hole subreddits was probably necessary, but was done inconsistently and with very little explanation. Then there was the generally inept and reactive handling of personnel and compensation issues. OK, in Bay Area terms, Reddit's small in terms of revenue and headcount. But even by the standards of comparably-sized firms, it still seemed that Pao was making one after another rookie mistake, and never standing up to say ""It happened on my watch: I'm responsible, the buck stops here.""

Definitely scapegoating with hints of misogyny from a subset of users. On the other hand, Pao couldn't figure out a way to handle the community. The whole sub-reddit thing was a good example. By all accounts, it wasn't her fault (Alexis is the one who fired Victoria), but she and reddit management could have been on top if by releasing some kind of a statement early. She seemed like a competent executive in other aspects, but since community relations is such a big part of the job, if you can't do that right, it's not a good fit."

Why does she follow exactly the same line of explanation for Pao's failure as is given by Pao in the media? Why does she say little except that it wasn't Pao's fault and it's all misogyny, hatred, neckbeards... and generally the same causes which Pao tried and failed to employ the last time she got fired for incompetence.  ""Glass cliffs"" are an unfortunate stereotype.  Women who abuse positive discrimination and anti-discrimination laws to excuse their own incompetence and blame someone else are an unfortunate reality.  Pao was one such example of that reality. Was she an example of a glass cliff? Perhaps - but it would be well deserved. If you are a lawsuit-happy abuser of anti-discrimination law (let alone a partner of a well known fraud perpetrator)  framing you for something which would destroy your professional reputation at a company is incidentally a safe move.  If Pao was hired to take a fall for someone else's bad decisions the it still is well deserved. People who are abusers and pose as victims deserve no support. They are the most vicious, most malicious psychopaths - a whole level beyond ordinary evil masterminds like Ohanian.  Pao was hated for who she was and rightfully so because people like her should be despised and criticized. It is however sad that most people don't pay attention to moves behind the curtain - where it really matters - because those people definitely deserve attention. I am not sure if they deserve the same amount of hate as Pao- she got it for being an ordinary **** on a personal, human level - but they definitely deserve attention.  How does this biased, narrative-pandering article help the cause....? I have no idea. Mrs Blount go do something useful with your life.

It's not as simple as coming to the house and hooking up an existing copper drop. Fiber must be built back from the nearest access point (usually a splice) and built to your home. This requires permits from city/county/state for underground and pole owners for aerial. This must be done before construction, then you have the actual time it takes to do the construction.   Source: I'm a fiber project manager who does this every day. We typically give a 90 day window for service to be installed, but we build much farther than 1/3 mile if needed."

Smaller splitters ie 2-way and 4-way are used where light losses become an issue for example when the customer is a long way from the OLT.  There are still huge build costs however in getting setup from the nearest fibre node to the splitter.  And of course from splitter to DP.

The problem is that the government was bright enough to fund the buildout and then hand the keys over to the biggest monopoly ISP in Alaska.  GCI is like Alaska's Comcast with more market control and less scrutiny.  They charge what they want because they can.

technology,3d447i,healydorf,272,Mon Jul 13 16:09:56 2015 UTC,Were you around when everyone migrated from Digg to Reddit? Reddit was getting hammered and it was unusable as well. Voat is growing and the stability is improving. Even during the DDOS attack they got things figured out and the site has been very responsive since.    The thing people fail to realize is that Voat wasn't started in order to take over Reddit. It was done as a student project and that was all it was going to be until recently. It's the redditors that have changed the status from student project to Reddit competitor.   What I find really odd is how both voaters and redditors are becoming so consumed over taking sides. I personally enjoy both sites and plan to continue to go to both sites. I also thoroughly enjoy the new Digg. You people do know it's okay to visit multiple sites right? There is nobody holding a gun to your head saying you can't go to one site over another.
technology,3d447i,joshiness,6,Mon Jul 13 15:43:03 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is, Digg had a very drastic and unpleasant change that caused migration , because it really destroyed the spirit of the community and how content was shared. Reddit is really the same place it's always been, which has been very successful. Voat really doesn't do anything differently or really offer a clear reason to switch. Digg had become a completely shit interface, and reddit was amazing."
technology,3d447i,PrimeIntellect,5,Mon Jul 13 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"I think the way voat can differentiate itself is by being more supportive to the community and work on improving the site. It's almost like a balance between reddit and digg, not being afraid to make changes but being sure that the changes you do make are vetted by the community.   However, I think everything depends on how reddit tries to monetize the website. If they repeat the mistakes that digg made when trying to monetize, than it doesn't matter how similar voat looks to reddit, there will be a mass migration."
technology,3d447i,joshiness,29,Mon Jul 13 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly I hope voat becomes the new reddit so reddit goes back to not being the new digg..

technology,3d447i,taosk8r,40,Mon Jul 13 20:31:22 2015 UTC,I hope they both become viable competitors to each other. The reason reddit gets away with its bullshit is because it has a monopoly on the Internet forum business.

VB.NET, to someone who had learned VB6, but wasn't particularly familiar with other programming languages, was ridiculously annoying and the experience was godawful.   Not only was programming in it very different, but it had all sorts of dependencies that VB6 never needed, and meant that it got rid of the major benefit that VB6 had, which was that I could whip up a simple program in 5 minutes to solve somebody's problem and send it to them and expect it to work without any fiddling or instructions to install run-times.  I'm sure .NET is great, and if I looked into it, I'd see its many virtues, but it's ingrained in my memory as being ""That annoying bullshit that took away the thing I knew how to do."" So now the second I see "".NET"" on anything, I go ""lolnope"" and find something else. I decided that if I was going to learn to program again with something else, it may as well be in something that offered me a meaningful difference in capability from what I already knew how to do.

technology,3d5pmj,Cykecjbdrjs,27,Mon Jul 13 23:10:12 2015 UTC,Yishan has a history of being very unprofessional in contentious situations. The admin staff has always seemed like a bunch of 20 year olds put in charge of a company worth 8-figures trying to figure out what's expected and appropriate in that situation. Ellen Pao was actually probably the best executive Reddit has ever had in terms of professional conduct.   Nothing new about it.
technology,3d5pmj,ajayisfour,19,Mon Jul 13 23:04:14 2015 UTC,"Sure. But the thing is, there were two outcries against Ellen. One was the firing of Victoria, the other was the lack of communication between admins and mods and the general direction reddit was going. The latter is what was important, the former was the easy target for most common users.   If it's true that she wasn't responsible for firing Victoria, then it was up to knothing to own up to that and stop her from getting flack she didn't deserve.   He didn't.   Now, that could mean it wasn't just him that fired Victoria (maybe Ellen could have prevented it somehow and chose not to), but it seems like it was his decision to fire her (based on his comment about it).   As a professional and an executive, he should have actively tried to redirect the talk about firing Victoria away from Ellen to himself. That is what yishan is not happy about, and I agree."
technology,3d5pmj,IrrelevantLeprechaun,6,Mon Jul 13 23:43:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying she was a good CEO. There were a few serious mistakes she made, all linked to not fully understanding the intricacies of the company she was running while most likely facing demands that are/were unattainable. None of these faults are unique to her. None of the admin staff have ever understood those intricacies and many have probably faced the same demands.  I was saying that she conducted herself more professionally than any other executive for Reddit.  Being CEO of Reddit is literally an impossible situation. To move the company forward, you have to monetize. Any attempt to monetize drives away the user-base and makes Reddit worthless. There's literally no way to be successful. Only ways to not fail as badly."

That popular section of Reddit was organized by Ms. Taylor and ran in conjunction with the volunteer moderators who govern the site.  “He had different ideas for AMAs, he didn’t like Victoria’s role, and decided to fire her,” Mr. Wong wrote.   Anyone know how much reddit controls r/iama now?"

technology,3d5pmj,adeveloper2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:06:29 2015 UTC,"CEO's are never the final bosses of an organization. They almost always report to the board and the shareholders ultimately. So whenever a CEO fails it is always the fault of the board or the shareholders.  The management is always guilty and those are the ""management"" levels for CEOs and other top exec positions.  But that doesn't change the fact that Pao personally represented everything that people could justifiably hate. She didn't get so much hate for being a bad CEO. She got the hate for who she is and what she does  and how she does it. And arguably it is a well deserved hate that doesn't have anything to do with her as a ceo but everything with her as a person.  Leadership style is a real thing.  When your ""style"" is based on inciting conflict and manipulation before you join a position and immediately afterwards... How on earth is it not natural to criticize such person? Ellen Pao came to reddit with some truly serious ethical breaches - not lack of competence, not inefficiency but the business equivalent of a false rape accusation.   How is that not deserving of at least being hostile to someone like that being in charge of your beloved community website?  And how it is not justified to continue this hostility when the person in question does almost anything to enforce those fears?  That reddit is filled with idiots doesn't matter. Every sufficiently population is always filled with idiots - that's pure statistics.  Why some idiots are more equal than others and why ""internet misogyny"" is somehow a great sin while blackmail, false accusations and supporting fraud are not...  That's something that the media should focus on before they start witchhunts.  Or is it that the media and Pao have the same sort of cynical, calculated, dishonest agenda like some people in reddit management?"

technology,3d9dmv,takeitapart4x,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:25:22 2015 UTC,Carbon fibre is stronger than steel. There are supercars where the structure of the vehicle is made from carbon fibre. F1 cars extend this to steering and suspension arms which take a massive pounding when they go over the kerbs on corners.

But once carbon fiber composite stuff gets a small nick it tends to go bad fast.  Steel is very tolerant of dings and such.  Alu accepts dings as well.   I do not know about your wheels but mine get assaulted by potholes, crappy tire techs and assorted road debris.  May not be an issue for garage queens."

Educators love them because these educators see uni students walking across campus with tablets. What the educators can't seem to comprehend is the risk profile in a prison is entirely different to a university.  What's the battery life of these tablets? Note that the inmates are often in lock-down for 18hrs per day so either the tablet will be mostly useless or the inmate will need some way to recharge it. A power brick, you say? Well, now you've given them a conch.  If the staff are expected to recharge the tablet batteries then that's an unnecessary burden on an already overworked officer.  If the inmates are able to create content (documents etc) then there's the risk of electronic contraband and clandestine communication as the inmates share tablets.  And the list goes on..... and on .....  edit: btw, I work in the industry, deploying secure in-cell interactive technology."
