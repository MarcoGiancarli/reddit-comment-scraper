BuyItForLife,3e289s,Gioware,23,Tue Jul 21 11:51:24 2015 UTC,"I just check to see how recent recommendations are vs Amazon reviews. There are some products that were recommended here two years ago that drastically fell off in quality, and are now getting poor Amazon reviews."

BuyItForLife,3e289s,Rebeleleven,10,Tue Jul 21 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"I check both. I use recommendations as a starting point and then check the reviews.  Since there are often several recommendations, the reviews allow me to compare specific points of the products (especially in depth reviews.)  Lastly I check the dates, if all the 5 star (or equivalent) reviews are from 2011, and everything in 2014-15 has been 1-2 stars or the same complaints over and over then I will probably not buy the product. unless the complaint is something I don't care about (like maybe it no longer comes in the most popular color, that I didn't want anyway.)  Don't forget that you can always ask the recommending individual here when they last purchased the item and how long they have lasted. Most people exagerrate the shit out of products that have done even reasonably well for them so just take it with a grain of salt. (Like the people who say they wear X footwear every day for 10 years and it has been perfect, but they don't go outside besides to walk across a parking lot, never when it's raining, sit still at work all day, and where they live snow/salted roads dont' exist.)"

BuyItForLife,3e289s,Wanhope,6,Tue Jul 21 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"It is a difficult issue, and the only real answer is you have to play it by ear and use reviews as ""advisory"", not gospel truth. At least you're aware of the problem - many people simply blindly trust reviews, which is actually a bigger problem.   Some of the things I consider when reading reviews: 1) How many reviews are there? If a product has 500 reviews avg 2.5 stars it means more than if there are 10. 2) The type of product affects the type of review. Many people are inspired to post reviews of movies they love but won't bother posting reviews of ""meh"" movies. The reverse is true of, say, a kitchen small appliance - people will post negative reviews if it fails because they're PO'd, but rarely bother posting reviews of something that works as expected. These examples skew the averages in opposite directions. 3) The cost. Many people are reluctant to denigrate something they've just spent a lot of money on. I also believe there's a similar effect for effort. As an example I think for many people reading an entire book is a lot of work and something they rarely accomplish; those people are more likely to give a book a positive review, sort of as a way of congratulating themselves (""Look at me! I just read an entire book!"") than someone who reads books all the time. 4) I put more emphasis on more recent reviews, since products change over time. 5) I read individual reviews and don't rely a lot on the average. There are many reasons the average is misleading. Sometimes you find a trend of negative reviews that doesn't apply to you - for example, lots of complaints about a widget being incompatible with various models of a smartphone, none of which are the model you own. Sometimes you have personal expertise in the product's environment and the negative reviews are from people who don't. Often you'll find a reviewer who is in the exact same situation as you and who clearly knows what he's talking about, those are real useful to find. 6) I look for consistent trends, for example a large number of people reporting the exact same problem with a product. 7) And, finally, I keep an awareness that (usually) no product is going to have 100% glowing reviews. So I won't be scared off by a few people reporting a huge problem when there are hundreds of others who love the product. This is really important for things like hotel and restaurant reviews."
BuyItForLife,3e289s,joeomar,4,Tue Jul 21 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"You have summarized my strategy.  A couple of elaborations:   8) I try to evaluate myself in reading the review.  If it's a product that I really want (especially on impulse), I have a tendency to skim poor reviews that are valid, and overemphasize reviews that are good.  If I catch myself doing that I go back and read again.  9) This is an elaboration on the cost, but people tend to only know what they've tried.  So if you buy one vacuum every ten years, you don't have a large sample to compare to.  Of course it's the best (or worst) vacuum you've tried because it's the only one you've had direct experience with.    10) The credibility of the reviewer and relevance to my experience.  Especially if it's a negative one.  ""Ugh lid was on too tight I couldn't open it.  Olives were orgasmic though."" would likely not affect my purchase of olives.  If I have to drill into the container for the what would otherwise be the worlds best condiment, it might be worth it.  I bought an extension piece for a tool that half the reviewed consensus was that it broke immediately.  It was the only option so I bought it anyway.  Now, when I use the tool I don't bang it around like I'm a sleepwalking gorilla and it works great."

BuyItForLife,3e289s,cogreva,3,Tue Jul 21 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"I would take all relevant available sources of information into account and factor it into my decision.  For the scenario you proposed I would trust the Amazon reviews even though people had good recommendations. Reason being is even though a product has the same name and appearance the materials, or manufacturer could have changed after the product became popular as an example.   So read into it, and base your decision off all the relevant information you find"
BuyItForLife,3e289s,Stopitleo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:06 2015 UTC,Also keep in mind the possibility of reporting bias in reviews. Someone who thinks a product is terrible is often more likely to write a review than someone who is satisfied with the product.  I like reviews and recommendations where the person compares the product to others they tried. Then at least you have some reference point.

BuyItForLife,3e289s,threeclaws,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:34 2015 UTC,I take the recc. as a starting point and then look at reviews (along with distribution since sometimes it has a ton of 4/5 star reviews and then a handful of 1 star.)
BuyItForLife,3e289s,Three-Culture,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"My strategy is to scan the 1 star reviews for what kinds of catastrophic experiences people have had. If there are too many - say 20% per cent of buyers who get a DOA product, I pass on it. Ideally, quality control should keep DOA products to less than 1%.  Then, I go to 3-start reviews, which I find are often more balanced, and scan to see if there is a pattern of a certain type of defect. If there is, I see if it would apply to me. For example, complaints that otherwise good headphones fall out of your ears while you are running don't apply to my use scenario, so I can ignore those.  Finally, I see if the good reviews mention the factors I look for or give any type of advice on use, mounting, etc. For example, I bought a foam license plate bracket for the front of my car to provide a bit of cushion in case anyone backs into me while parking. Unfortunately, the manufacturer and the reviewers didn't mention that your bumper has to have a certain height to actually mount it using the provided holes. After I found it wouldn't fit on mine without fabricating some sort of backing plate, I made sure to review it and mention this info."
BuyItForLife,3e289s,NASTY_the_villian,0,Tue Jul 21 20:21:50 2015 UTC,"I try to look for consensus about legitimate problems. A lot of bad reviews are bullshit. When you look at the array of 1 to 5 star reviews and there's a split to either end (i.e. lots of 1s and lots of 5s) I've often found that the 1s are full of it. People leave a product a 1 star review because of shipping time, because they had unrealistic expectations, etc. And often if the product they received was indeed subpar/faulty they don't bother to return it.   All this is to say that reviews can be incredibly misleading and that if you get a good recommendation and you are buying from a company with a good return policy there is often little to worry about. And of course the best thing you can do with any product is to educate yourself. Look carefully through the specs of a product and research the important qualities. It's time consuming but it is so worthwhile when you buy something you love that's going to last."

I had the exact same bag (notice the use of the past tense). Here's how bad the smell was....my wife opened the box, tore open the plastic that enclosed the bag, then went running out of the room to get away from the smell. It honestly smells like they had a camel drop a deuce in it before shipping the damn thing. Theres a bunch of suggestions online about different way to get rid of the smell. I tried the baking soda for a week, I tried stuffing it full of dryer sheets (theres not enough dryer sheets at Costco to de-smell this stinker). Tried the grape seed oil and the leather conditioner. I hung it in the garage for a week to just let it air out thinking that would solve the problem....nope. All that did was stink up my wifes shoes that are stored in the garage....unhappy wife, unhappy life. As a last resort, I hung it on a nail outside the house. After a month, it seemed to have worked so I put my stuff in it and went to work. Alas, it wasn't to be....my shirt smelled like camel shit, my car, my jeans, my laptop....all camel shit. Turns out the smell never really went away..I just got used to it. Buy the Saddleback. I got the large leather satchel for myself in dark coffee brown for $309. I know the company has its very real issues, but honestly, I've never gotten as many compliments in my life as that bag has in the last few months. Its not for everybody, but it suits ME perfectly.

In contrast to those with problems, I've had my 12x16 half flap from them for about a year and I couldn't be happier. The leather smell is really strong at first, but I never felt it smelled like camel shit or whatever else people in this thread are saying. Plus it went away after a day or two and now it just has a nice and subtle leather smell.  In terms of quality, the leather probably isn't as thick as more expensive bags,  but the price/quality ratio is superb, particularly with the 40% off blemished inventory. In my case, the ""blemish"" was a small patch of discoloration on the inside of the flap, and completely unnoticeable. Since getting the bag it's taken somewhat of a beating, with near-daily use biking around my college campus. It still looks great, and I still get plenty of compliments on it. The only noticeable problem for me has been some bunching up on the shoulder strap where it connects to the brass hardware. There's been some indigo transfer between my jeans and the bag where it rubs against my leg, but it's not really a problem nor is it exclusive to this bag.  So I guess I can't really say whether or not FHT bags are BIFL, but mine will certainly last me a few more years with proper care. And with the cost is factored in, I really couldn't ask for more."

I haven't used it a lot in the last year, since I've had to carry a laptop as well. Some of the stichings have had to be fixed, and a bit of the leather in the bottom has weakened -- it is pretty thin stuff compared to cowhide or other leather.   With that said, it's the best bag I've had. This is the bag 18 months in. It smells fabulous  of camel hide (and not too strong). I'm always looking forward to using it."

If your item had those qualities they'd say so -- right?  Since they don't mention this, what do you think that means?    The JB item is twice the cost of your linked item.

I have had my first for 6 years and loved it so much I have bought 3 others since then. They are still soft and comfortable it's a first world problem for me -- makes it extra harder to get up in the mornings!! I would not waste time looking for any other sheets ever again as I really love these.  And bonus: Macy's would always have them on sale at one point or another so don't pay full price for it. :)

The biggest discount i got for the sheets is when i bought them on black friday and used a coupon on top of the sale. My last purchase just last May, i got 40% off. Also, i believe macy's makes a price adjustment, one time, if the item suddenly goes lower in price. So keep checking the price even after you bought the item."

Many years ago I bought a set of sheets at an estate sale. They were serious sheets, thick cotton and well made. They will probably outlast the bed. I found out that an executive from the ""golden days"" of American fabric mills had opened his own company, attempting to replicate the quality of the olden days. This is his company. I'm sure the sheets are excellent. They're expensive, though, so I haven't taken the plunge. If you're the kind of person who is picky enough to iron sheets, this is where you should go.

Website is currently down for maintenance, but their catalogue is about 300 pages full of german quality products. It's a pleasure to shop there. ""Es gibt sie noch, die guten Dinge"" is their slogan.  But concerning other BIFL brands from Europe:  Fjaellraven for bags, jackets and any other outdoor stuff. I really like the look too.  Fiskars for everything sharp (knifes, scissors, gardening tools, also aluminium boats) Finnish quality, the best kitchen knifes I've ever used, incredibly sharp and they will stay that way.  Ortlieb - if you need to pack something  waterproof and durable, Ortlieb is for you.  WMF for cutlery, pots & pans.  Le Creuset even better pots & pans.  AGA an oven that will probably survive a nuclear war. Costly though.  Iittala cutlery and tableware.  Artek and ISKU -  furniture. Could be difficult to get your hands on that outside of Finland.  Osram for bulbs and everything concerning light.  Wesco - wastebins  Tiger of Sweden - clothing.   Makia - clothing, highly practical stuff (like pullovers you can turn inside out and have different patterns for different occasions)  If you not only want products that last long, but also have an eye for design, I recommend you to check out ""Tools for Living: A sourcebook of Iconic Designs for the Home"" by Charlotte & Peter Fiell. 800 Pages of the best looking and highest quality products.

I would say light modifiers and lenses are your best bets when considering BIFL worthy gear.   The mounting systems are going to be around for a long time, and the technology behind them ages slowly.  Your standard reflectors, gridspots, C-stands, and tripods will all stay with you forever if you take good care of them.  Cameras will come and go, lights may come and go as well depending on your needs.  My Einsteins and studio lighting gear are with me for the long haul, my camera hardware less so."
BuyItForLife,3e0xfb,Timmythetiny,2,Tue Jul 21 05:27:27 2015 UTC,"I used to shoot Pentax. Almost every piece of glass they ever made worked on their DSLRs. Even DSLRs have reached a point where the ability to shoot is much more important than the equipment. We have a few Marks at the office as old as 6-7 years and they are still as amazing as ever.  with Pentax every piece of glass they made was a K lens.  KA was automatic focus, FA + A was more refined, and finally DA for digital.  All mounted naively.  M and 42mm and 39mm worked fine via a cheap adapter. I had pieces that I sold for a lot of money when my office bought the Canons.  Also I found that our Kata packs were BIFL. Still have one that I camp with, made from same material required by Israeli military, the good stuff is well worth it. Although they have a large consumer line now, and I never tested it.  Manfrotto tripods are great. Many falls, being thrown by field staff into the road into cars, vans, always held up.  The new cameras have no moving mirror so shutters will last longer.  Unless you are a gadget freak, a modern full-frame high end camera  will easily go 10 years.  There will be new features but sensors are already way past film in testing so it is more about how good of a shot a person is. Usable ISO is insane, macro is amazing.  This is a great time to be a photog.  Digital 645 and medium format is blowing up but expensive and built BIFL, although IMO sensors still need to catch up a little.  New cameras have magnesium bodies, weatherproofed lenses, and can take much more abuse.  It is almost as if we are back in the 60's and everything is metal and rubber.   The new Metz flashes are thick plastic and the bulb doesn't die quick, the batteries are great.   If you still shoot film, the world is yours, glass is BIFL, and bodies are cheap."

They are quite thick and heavy, so I'm not sure it would work well for travelling. They're super soft and feel quite luxurious, and lots of different designers (Snøhetta are probably the most well-known) have designed patterns for them. The price is fairly high, they're around 1500NOK/$180 in Norway, while I found them online in this American store for $295.  For travelling, I would probably look for something in a similarly woven wool because they are super warm, but thinner (= lighter) and maybe with less of a focus on the design aspect, as that might affect the price a bit."

BuyItForLife,3dwcga,TheTacomaGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 06:58:54 2015 UTC,The mpg of Toyota trucks is the deal breaker. Toyota arguably may be more reliable but it's probably because they use the same engines and transmissions for 10 years. My 2013 f150 5.0L V8 uses less gas than my V6 Tacoma did.

First designed in 1891 in Czarist Russia, the Mosin Nagant was used (with very minor updates in 1930) up until the 1980s by the Chinese militia, with the T-53 Chinese variant.  Two anecdotes:   (1) The Chinese government rounded up many of the militia issued T-53s, wrapped them in barbed wire, and buried them. More recently they've been unearthed, dusted off, and still fire. (2) A Redditor recently had their house burn down, among the smoldering rubble was the charred remains of their Mosin-Nagant. . . it still functioned and fired properly.

BuyItForLife,3dwcga,Spaghetti-A-Plenty,4,Mon Jul 20 16:46:20 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. The AR-15 is a better gun, period. As are many others. There is nothing to be argued here. It's just a simple fact. It's far more accurate, more practical, more adaptable, and outpaced all around by a century of advancements in firearm technology and design.  Where the Mosin-Nagant has its own advantage, is in its absolutely stultifying design. It is a gun that can be used, abused, forgotten about for a decade or two, and used again by pretty much anyone. I could take a Mosin's firing mechanism apart, hand it to someone who has never held a gun before, and they'd be able to hammer a nail in with the bolt and have it back together again in under a minute.  The AK-47, as you rightly pointed, also fits this mold (it was made to be assembled by the most unskilled of labor after all). However, you're not likely to find an AK (and certainly not an AR) for the stupid cheap $125 price that a quality Mosin-Nagant runs."

Whenever it needs something, I can get it for about $40 at Pep Boys and install it myself. Sinn 656. Henckels Twin Four Star knives. 1953-1956 Dunhill Rollagas lighter.  Got it for $50 on eBay, spent $15 to buy replacement seals and another $20 for a new valve.  Installed all that myself.  Works perfectly. Chris Reeve left handed Mnandi. Parker 51 fountain pen, aerometric. Pils stainless double-edged razor. Sig Sauer P6.  It's a version of the P225 used by West German police.  A bunch of retired ones were shipped to the US.  I initially bought it to use with cheap 9mm ammo, but it turned into my favorite. Emerson 73648 brass bladed fan, made in 1930.  The original paint is OK and I replaced the headwire and power cord.  It needs to be oiled every three months or so, but I've had it for 15 years and it just runs and runs and runs.  Only pulls about 40W of electricity, too. Quad ESL-63 electrostatic speakers.  They need periodic upkeep, but few speakers match their performance.  New Quads are a very similar design, as well.  It's not so much what they do right as how much they don't do wrong.  They almost never put a foot out of place."

Two problems with ice, one is that it freezes at 0C, you can do better in the freezer, so impurities will help that out. Second problem is that water turns to a liquid that circulates easily, some kind of starch helps to thicken it and let the temperature dissipate slower into the block of ice. So if I was to try to reconstruct one of those containers, I would keep adding impurities until the liquid will not freeze and add just enough water to allow it to freeze again.  Iff you want to do things the hard way. Unfortunately I have no idea what to contain it in other than other than vacuum bags with some kind of sterilizing agent."

BuyItForLife,3dqr43,sirhorsechoker,100,Sat Jul 18 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"I hear you! Refrigerators are for some reason the exception to the /r/BIFL talk because people don't understand them.   Yes - there are inefficient fridges, and many of them are old.   But what people fail to realize is that there wasn't some major breakthrough that increased efficiency one day, making them amazingly more energy efficient.   They are still insulated with the same/similar foam and rubber. They're still built with metal. And up to a certain date, they're made with the same refrigerant.   The thermostats aren't ""smarter."" They're still turn knobs for many, and digital readouts for others. THEY PERFORM THE SAME ACTION!  The compressors operate by the same principles, and similar wattages.   The downsides of older fridges are:   The gasket or whatever it's called that keeps the cold in and the warm out can get old/worn and degrade. 20 years seems like a good amount of time to replace these.  They're ugly.  They don't store enough food. Some old fridges have some pretty big walls and bad design inside. They don't hold much food. The upside is that they insulate quite well, and provided you're not opening/closing all the time, that compressor will stay quiet And yes - if it's VERY old, it's not efficient. Poor compression, lousy refrigerant. All that. But something made in the late 80s/90s is not going to be vastly different than something today.  No anti-frost measures. Preventative measures can help this anyway, but there's nothing automated that can mitigate frost buildup. With that said, newer freezers with this built-in aren't always that effective...     New fridges today suffer from a number of issues.    My friend had an expensive Samsung Fridge with french doors. There is a mechanism that seals the gap between the doors. That mechanism stopped working after a year. That's time/money/labor to fix, otherwise you leak a lot of cold air and run that compressor constantly. Ice makers are not always made with strong plastic. One day you'll reach for ice, break a piece of plastic on the arm, and then you realize that it was part of the sensor that determined if the ice bucket was full. Now you're overflowing with ice.  Speaking of ice makers, those equipped with augers to dispense cubes use cheap plastic augers instead of metal ones. After enough use, part of the auger might snap and you might drink it. They're not easy to replace. Older and high quality new freezers tended to use metal augers (the downside here is that if the temperature drops or humidity gets in the fridge, ice can stick to it, but generally comes off within a cycle or two, but they're a bit prone to ice damming because of this).     Really what people need to be aware of if they want to determine if their fridge is good is listening to the compressor. If it kicks in a few times a day (or you never notice it), then you're good. If it kicks in every 20 minutes even with you keeping the door closed and not accessing the fridge, then you have a fridge that should be serviced or replaced.     I wish the people who automatically go to ""old fridges are bad"" on this sub considered these things."
BuyItForLife,3dqr43,nobody2000,49,Sat Jul 18 17:23:36 2015 UTC,"But what people fail to realize is that there wasn't some major breakthrough that increased efficiency one day, making them amazingly more energy efficient.   Interesting post but you are sort of wrong about a few things. But I guess the soul of your post is still right.   They are still insulated with the same/similar foam and rubber. They're still built with metal. And up to a certain date, they're made with the same refrigerant.   The foam that they use seem to be better. And they seem to be able to fill the entire fridge body up with it. Unlike in prior generations, which is part of the reason new fridge are usually quieter than the older ones. I think this is part of the reason new fridges are lighter than old ones.   The thermostats aren't ""smarter."" They're still turn knobs for many, and digital readouts for others. THEY PERFORM THE SAME ACTION!   This is really wrong. If you have a fridge with a digital read out that fridge usually uses thermistors (electronic sensors). Which unlike the ones that are usually associated with dials are in multiple locations in and outside the fridge.   For instance some Samsungs have thermistor on the outside, in the ice maker on the back of the fridge, side wall of the fridge, in the evap, in the freezer.   Dial thermostats almost always only have one bulb and that is locate near the damper door.  Also Samsungs, LG, and now Kitchenaids have totally separated their fridge sections from their freezer. Where the older models use to have the controlling thermostats in the fridge that control the compressor and a tunnel with a door connecting the 2.  The newer models now have two evaps and the compressor is controlled by both the freezer and fridge.    The compressors operate by the same principles, and similar wattages.   Compressors have advanced a lot. Lots of the advancements have not made it to the  domestic market yet. But the biggest differences I have seen is that they are smaller, run quieter and instead of having them run for short periods of time, they run longer than the old ones. But the biggest different right now is that there are two speed compressors out there that Samsung and Kitchenaid uses.  As far as icemakers go they are the weakest spot. And are most like to break before the fridge. The best thing to do is dump the ice out of the bucket once a week so the auger doesn't get iced up. And if you desire your ice maker to work throughout the life of the fridge get a extended warrrenty.  But really your overall sentiment is correct, but I feel for different reasons. You should think twice before replacing a working old fridge with a new one. While you will save money on the electric bill. There are so many new things on fridges that will just break out of no were. You and your friend can buy the exact same fridge at the same time, and you can have a great experience with it over 10 years and your friend could end up going through hell."

I think I conditionally disagree with what you said about thermostats. I jumped ahead of myself when I said that digital = knob. What I should have said is ""do your research."" Some digital readouts are no different than the knob ones (much like you'd expect out of a $15 programmable digital thermostat vs. a knobby one). It's a cost-cutting measure.

And it's just a little clock with gears and sprockets basicly. If it does fail, it's way cheaper than a control board.   That's just one example. I work on lots of things that make me think ""I'll never want to buy a new frige"" or ""the old units never have this problem""   The new ones are certainly more efficient though.

Here's a site where you can see just how quickly a modern fridge pays for its self over one from 1985. http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/refrigerators.html  I had a 30 year old HVAC unit that I had to get repaired every season. It was costing me 2-3 times as much as my new one to run in electricity alone. ...but, hey, I could say it was still running (& looking) perfect (as long as it was repaired).  But, anyway, the claim was ""...breaks every 2 months..."" and I have no doubt that if you're buying the used, dented, lowest priced, bargain shopper fridge out there that it breaks all the time. If you actually put some money down on your significant purchases they tend to last."

BuyItForLife,3dqr43,Ikarus3426,3,Sun Jul 19 01:17:32 2015 UTC,I feel the more advanced the fridge is the likelier it will break.

If you're recommending GE, for the love of God stop. I used to sell appliances and GE was easily the least reliable main brand we sold. Hotpoint was terrible too, but it was made by GE. They just don't have the same reliability as other brands, they're typically bulkier, and the better models a ton more expensive and not that much better.   Congratulations on owning the very last thing GE made well."
BuyItForLife,3dqr43,856,4,Sat Jul 18 18:15:01 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair if you're like I was a few years ago and want a coil top (as in non-glass top) electric stove, GE was the only one making a decent one anymore. All the rest were really cheap and very badly made. Now I have the ability to buy a gas stove and back when I was buying a house induction cooktops weren't that affordable. So that's the only time I would recommend them."

This is fairly common knowledge and getting into details is unnecessary, as most people would know what I mean.  Edit: And no, sorry, they're not whatever they could get cheap. Kenmore isn't a cheap crappy brand. It gets well reviewed frequently like lots of other leading brands.   Kenmore had a decent coil stove manufactured by another company, but that company didn't typically push thier version because they didn't want to. But Kenmore pushed thier version, so that's why I mentioned it instead of the other manufacturer."

I repair appliances for a living and getting clients to read off Kenmore model numbers to me over the phone or waiting for them to get off work or whatever so I can tell what sort of repair I'm about to get roped into is one of the most frustrating parts of the job."

BuyItForLife,3dqr43,856,5,Sat Jul 18 15:43:40 2015 UTC,"super quiet   Sigh... How can I shop for a quiet fridge? Noise ratings or the type of compressor (I don't know whether that would help or not) are never in the spec sheets for some reason I cannot understand, showrooms are noisy, and nothing in the more expensive friges tells me that they're going to be better than the cheapest low end.  So, any suggestion? I don't care a bit about features. A big ugly white box with racks and no light that drinks electricity like there's no tomorrow, but runs super quiet, would be my ideal purchase.  Maybe a fridge with a thermoelectric cooler to support the compressor, like the one used in many wine cellars (but not powerful enough for a fridge alone)."

According to my parents, their old fridge died on the same day they brought my newly-born sister back from the hospital in July of 1985, and my dad went to buy a new one - this GE side-by-side door refrigerator - a light almond color with wood paneling on the handles & around the water dispenser/ice maker.  On the inside it had 4 clear shelves, a low and wide drawer (lunch meats & cheeses), with a low & wide shelf underneath (for water bottles & cans laid on their sides), with 4 produce drawers underneath that. Also, lots of door storage. It really resembled a modern fridge & I can't think of anything that could have been improved upon it 30 years later.  We have replaced some small parts (mostly due to the water dispenser) throughout the years, but it has never broken down on us or had any major problems.  This past week my mom let me know our house had accepted a full offer from a buyer, and this fridge will probably be moved on & out to the dump by them...but it has had a great journey and has powered through the decades like a champ!"

The warranty covers parts only after one year and cost $500 for the compressor labor. The repair folks are giving my money back and giving up on fixing this thing since they are now losing money trying to fix it. LG has giving me two alternate repair centers, both don't service my area... Just ordered a GE yesterday.

It's largely internet hype imo. Their newer work is not as good as 17 years ago.   The warranty is legit. But have you seen the prices of the knives? You pay for the warranty work upfront, as you purchase the knife.   Benchmade is the apple of the knife world. They make nice things but are crazy overrated and you can actually buy something just as good and better for less money if you do the research.   In my opinion, as somebody who has spent several thousand dollars on cutlery, benchmade is resting on their laurels, and is taking advantage of their momentum. They just aren't what they used to be. Kinda like whirlpool.   ... lol I always get downvotes when I say unsupportive stuff about benchmade. If I really wanna get the knife nerds riled up I could compare benchmade to spyderco. But it's in poor taste really. It's like starting a big ol classic Apple vs Samsung fight on reddit then walking off... It's a fun subculture to be part of.   ... I still own some benchmades and they are very nice knives. If you fall in love in a benchmade design, get it for sure. It will hold its value forever and is always a brisk resale online.   ...

BuyItForLife,3dmcyb,Broken_Toys,2,Fri Jul 17 21:40:36 2015 UTC,"no one does it as well for less money.   Benchmade knives are sort of the pinnacle of ""affordable knives"".   From benchmade you go up considerably in price.    Benchmade knives are all designed by very well known knife makers, all who make their own versions of the designs and all who charge far more than a Benchmade runs you.   Mel Purdue, Shane Siebert, Warren Osborne, Allen Elishiwitz, Ernest Emerson, and on and on.   A shane Siebert knife will run you about 2000 dollars, Allen Elishiwitz, 600 minimum, Custom Emerson? 1500.  Is the Benchmade the same thing? No way, but you are getting expert designs by makers in the industry that set standards.    As far as Spyderco -- their higher end stuff is good, but they go too thin on most of their tips, and if it's not a higher end model, under hard use they turn into flat head screwdrivers.  So, no you can't get higher quality at a lower price, and no they are not overrated, at least their higher end stuff isn't.  Are they the best for most people?  I would say it's hard to beat it at that price.   Some of their designs are gems, and really shine -- Osborne 940 is outstanding, and well respected, and the Emerson CQC-7 by benchmade in many ways launched ""Tactical tanto knives"" in the industry (20 years ago).     Go to knifeworks.com and get a Griptillian Ritter.  For many, it will be the last knife they ever buy.      I had lightning strike carbon fiber scales put on my ritter....  I have lots of knives that are far more expensive, but the ritter griptillian is really a shining star."

BuyItForLife,3dmcyb,sirhorsechoker,3,Sat Jul 18 16:44:03 2015 UTC,"So because you hated it no one else that bought liked it?   It's a super popular knife. As far as the tango you're not quite right. The emerson cqc was a modified tanto, and made that blade shape popular, and as I said launched the concept of tactical knives. It was so popular that emerson pulled it from benchmade so that he alone could make it. You need to brush up on your history.   Cold steel did a mor traditional blade style on their tantos and they did some great production fixed blade tantos, like the San mai 3, but modified tanto in a titanium framed liner lock with g10 scales?   That wasn't really a thing until the cqc7.   I'm not fanatical about benchmade, in fact I only own 1 right now as I've moved on in my knives, but I recognize their quality. I'm now into custom stuff like the designers I mentioned, but you can't deny history and benchmade was very important in the knife world and still is today.

BuyItForLife,3dmcyb,Capolan,2,Sat Jul 18 17:21:59 2015 UTC,"I just got back from blade show last month in Atlanta, the biggest knife expo on earth. Benchmade does not stand out there even a little bit. They have huge booths of course, but inside that same price range there are literally hundreds of options I would consider first. I don't want name specific brands and look like a shill. I just feel like people are doing themselves a disservice by getting on google or a forum and typing in ""what's the best knife"" then staying in the benchmade cult for decades. People miss out on a lot by doing that. You don't have to own the same stuff as the internets.   Furthermore it'd be impossible to recommend anything because I don't know you or your need in a knife. . .If you genuinely need to work with a knife, you'd probably just buy a boxcutter or a leatherman. But people usually spend this kinda money on knives simply because they like them. So it's really just what you like is all that matters. I just never saw what was so good about benchmade that isn't also good of most American knife companies."

Furthermore it'd be impossible to recommend anything because I don't know you or your need in a knife. . .If you genuinely need to work with a knife, you'd probably just buy a boxcutter or a leatherman.   Hmmm.... I work outdoors more days than not.  Cutting needs vary.  Sometimes it's as simple as opening a box.  Sometimes I find myself cutting rope.  On other strange days I find myself cutting rocket propellant (yes, seriously).  I have several different multi-tools (Leatherman, Gerber, ??).  I don't like any of them as I value quick one handed deployment (note: sometimes I'm working in a climbing harness); something that multi-tools fail miserably at.  Box cutters are too flimsy for anything more than...well, boxes.  I've got probably a dozen one-handed pocket folders right now although I do not consider myself a collector.  I'm just a guy who uses knives on a daily basis and is willing to buy yet another knife if that other knife looks to be better for the job than the current knife.  Right now my go-to knives are a Benchmade Barrage and a Mini-Barrage.  Which one I carry depends on what I anticipate doing that day.  Past knives of note that I've carried are Gerber Fasts (several flavors) and a Kershaw Speedsafe.  The Gerbers are poorly made and flimsy.  Sure, the blade will hold an edge but the belt clips break and the blades don't lock up solidly.  The Kershaw's belt clip sucks ass (I took it off!), the thumb stud catches on my pocket (it's kinda sharp...who thought that was a good idea?), and I'm not a fan of frame locks.  I also tend to be forgetful and lose things often.  Thus, the Benchmades are at my choke point for cost because I don't want to buy some (say) $500 knife and then lose it.  With all that as background... Thoughts?"
BuyItForLife,3dmcyb,Inigo93,2,Sat Jul 18 18:27:12 2015 UTC,"I think the market is a bit crazy with the beefy factor lately. Every other end user swears their lifestyle is simply too rugged for a knife that isn't so fat that it hurts.   it seemed ironic somehow, you mention box cutters being too flimsy for you. Then list three needs that boxcutter are totally awesome at. I think that propellant actually recommends a razor, as some of it is friction sensitive and beefy blades are high drag even when razor sharp.   ... But boxcutters just aren't as fun and interesting to a lot of people. That's totally understandable.   The multitools you own must not be one handed models. But the ones I own are. Leatherman and vnox both make very nice one handed multitool models now. For sheer practically, and how much pocket real estate that barrage takes up, you could have a one handed knife that is also several other things as well. I use the pliers more than the knife. A tii Leatherman charge is nice. Or the aluminum version for less coin.   But I too tend to loose things. Once I lost an alpha beast I had over $600 in.   The emershaw lineup are nice for cheap as hell. Not premium steel but legit heat treat, very good value if you really loose knives... Also cold steel has finally gotten away from aus8 and now offers some very practical models in a better metal. I once lost a tuff lite that was perfect for almost everything.   I've handled some fixed blades and balisongs from benchmade that are damn impressive. I'm just not seeing the same level of work in their thumber models."

As for propellant recommending a razor... Depends on how thick you're cutting.  If it's a sliver, yes, a razor will do a fine job of it.  If it's a slab, not so much as you don't want the blade breaking.  Friction sensitivity?  Sure, 30 years ago.  Not so much anymore.  Propellant formulation has come a long ways.  These days you have to try pretty damned hard to get stuff to light (and some of it won't sustain combustion unless contained!).  A one-handed multi-tool?  Cool.  Honestly, I've never heard of such before.  Granted, I've not done much homework on multi-tools.

The multitool thing, if you have to buy it, you could just get a wingman or sidekick. They're usually 30 bucks or so at Home Depot. It's not quite as impressive as the charge tii, but it's really handy still - one handed. I think you can buy clips separately for the wave and some of their other models that have outboard blades."

Sure you can get benchmade's cheapest knife for around $70-90 but their average product is around $130-$200, the exact same range as ZT, and with ZT you are getting a pretty much objectively better product. For example, you can buy a Zero Tolerance 0450 which has materials and quality levels closer to a $400 CRK knife for $160, compared to the Benchmade 710 which has cheaper handle materials, cheaper blade steel, and worse fit and finish for the same price."

BuyItForLife,3dmcyb,Capolan,0,Sat Jul 18 08:45:27 2015 UTC,"IDK, I thought we were about long lasting quality first, value second.   If we're talking absolute quality, I think ZT wins. Their knives are generally more more heavy duty scales/liners/hardware, use thicker blade stock, and use more simple locking solutions.   As handy and strong as the axis lock system is, it uses very fragile ohm springs in an awkward orientation, making reassembly difficult. A stout frame/liner lock is comparable in strength, more difficult to break, and easier to disassemble for cleaning.     equal knives out there for a lot less money.   I'll agree that there are great knives out there for less, but something equal to ZT quality for less? Maybe in a few of the chinese fakes, but that's a stretch, and ethical water most won't wade into.   If I'm looking for an heirloom quality knife, ZT is where I'm going to look. If I need the best value in a quality knife, I'm probably going to go with a spyderco endura."
BuyItForLife,3dmcyb,Kuwait_Drive_Yards,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"ZT is a division of Kershaw, and it's been found that regardless of the materials used - their lock geometry fails under duress.   Check out Andrew Demko's videos (Andrew is the head of design for Cold Steel and his custom knives are considered the strongest folding knives in existance - check out Demko AD-10).   Andrew makes multiple ZTs fail under tests that cold steel and others pass.     ZT's materials are great, their actual lock designs are flawed."
BuyItForLife,3dmcyb,Capolan,4,Sat Jul 18 08:43:45 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you are looking for in a knife.  I prefer their axis-lock.  I also like the thin profile of many of their knives because they are comfortable and discreet.  The security and ease of operation of the axis lock is worth a few more dollars.  I really love their axis lock.  It smoothly engages and releases and keeps the blade firm (not wobbly) even after considerable use.    They make some nice custom products at very high prices but a lot of their production pieces are quite reasonable.  You can buy good quality pocket knives at lower prices that perform well.  Steel is steel.  There is no question about that.  It all comes down to how a knife feels and handles in your hand.  In that regard, I will pay extra for a Benchmade (at least for their axis lock).  Edited to add:  There is one thing that their blades do have that is superior to other knife blades, the ones with a low friction coating.  I had one of those and used it to cut through the rubber coating on so cables.  It worked wonderfully and stayed on with minimal wear after extended use."

Ive owned mine for somewhere between 8-10 years its been so long I forget.  The handle of mine has all kinds of nicks and scratches on it from using it to open beers and if I had to chance to go back and buy it over again I'd probably get the 940 because of the different style blade.

BuyItForLife,3dmcyb,Remsquared,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:56:16 2015 UTC,"Yes!  Glass breaker does not need to ever be sharpened.  To break safety glass, you need a precise point to focus the impact.  It doesn't matter if it's sharp or dull (Reference #1 and Reference #2)  For the seatbelt cutter, the best way I have seen is to use a high grain sandpaper wrapped around a pencil (Best source).  NEVER USE THE SEATBELT CUTTER ON ANYTHING BESIDES WHAT YOU WANT TO CUT IN AN EMERGENCY!  To rapidly clean through clothing/seatbelts, you need to make sure your blade is super sharp and tested on the material.  Personally, just testing your blade on paper and seeing it shear can potentially leave you to think it is adequate to cut through something you need to in an emergency."

They use stock shears that the service gives out, and mount a ""5"" hook on with riggers tape.   That way, when the shears start to suck, or if they get too gummed up with gore, they can just grab a new set of shears from the warehouse and remount the hook. Some of them have been doing it for years and it seems to work well for them.   I was carrying throwaway shears in addition to my hook for awhile, but I ended up always using the hook, so I ditched the shears.   It ultimately boils down to preference."

The only issue I have with them is that they are considerably marked up. There used to be certain dealers where you could get them new for considerable discounts which made them reasonable, but a year or so ago benchmade started preventing retailers from doing that. It was frustrating since it's a pricing issue basically only to keep up the exclusivity of the brand. Because if that, I'm more likely to go spyderco with my next purchase as they use similar materials and quality for a slightly better price.  However, they are still a great company. Top notch products with great customer service.  Edit: Also, getting your first benchmade makes you realize that assisted knives are so unnecessary. I let a friend use my Triage and when he opened it he remarked how great assisted openers are. He was floored when I told him it wasn't an assisted opener. Just tight smooth tolerances and great opening ergonomics.  Also axis locks are the best thing ever."

After over a year I gave up and traded in the Wallet to Saddleback for a large wallet which does not stack, so no cards to break. The damn thing is huge, but eventually I got used to it. Then I ran into a different problem, the wallet was so large and stiff it was basically tenting in one corner of my back pocket when I sat down, this caused a wear point and I was wearing holes in my pants.  At that point  I said screw it and switched to a gorgeous Allen Edmonds wallet and couldn't be happier. Much softer to sit on, holds my 8 or so cards nicely, plus it has a divider in the cash area which is handy to keep receipts for when I travel on business.  Is it BIFL? No, it's looking like a 10yr wallet or so. The leather is delicate, and will eventually give out. But I won't care. The BS with dealing with the cracked cards, damaged clothing, and thickness of the saddleback wallets makes their BIFL proposition not attractive."
BuyItForLife,3dnpim,Razorwyre,10,Fri Jul 17 23:14:08 2015 UTC,"I break cards like nobody's business. I started carrying one of these about 4 years ago and haven't broken a card since. I keep it in the larger pocket behind the card slits. I also take my wallet out if I'm going to be driving a long way (I'm in and out of a vehicle a lot every day, or I'd always drive with my wallet in the center console), and I take my wallet out when I'm home. That still leaves a lot of room for abuse, and that on top of the fact that I'm a pretty big guy.  I went through a lot of wallets of a lot of different designs. Bifold, trifold, even a big cowboy billfold. Same problem.  Tl;dr: it's not just the wallet, it's your weight, shape, and where the wallet sits on your ass. Stick a plate of metal in that bitch and party on."

I mean, I'm sure sitting on my wallet didn't do my cards any favors, but I wouldn't think it would be the sole cause?

Then stick your cards in the wallet as you would for every day use. Keep it from folding together to Make sure the surface of the wet leather does not touch another surface as that can adhere and strip the top off when it dries. Leave it to dry at room temperature for a night or so.  This should help stretch and mould the card slots so they apply less tension on the cards."

She wanted a color so she could print photos. Laser doesn't get the best photo prints unless you spend huge money so I made a deal with her to get a B&W and for photos print them at Sam's Club.  Saved us quite a bit and this arrangement gives us best of both worlds.   So, if OP is looking for occasional/photo printing in color, I'd recommend doing the color at a shop and having B&W at home. If they print out normal business quality color prints often, that might push them to get a color, but for that OP needs to give a budget."

Drums are replaceable, it's compatible with Linux (basing it off my own HL-2280DW, the former's predecessor), and generic versions make toner replacement cheap. I recommend multifunctions since they're good at copying.  A color laser HL3170CDW (I recommend duplex for any new printer to save time and paper) starts at $200 street. It's not multifunction. It's actually about the same price to have a multifunction laser with duplex and a color laser duplex (it's $365 for the MFC9330CDW street). The benefit is that the laser only will have a greater toner capacity. I'm guessing you don't need photos since ""office"" printer...those are better done at Costco or Adorama online. Any review of the aforementioned models should have that trick outlined.  Downside is how you need to press buttons to encourage the printer to keep printing since it'll read toner low prematurely."

I was hoping it's the last one I'd ever buy, so just got one that would probably meet all my needs.  The electrics did fail in the first one I bought, but it was replaced immediately without trouble or cost. Great customer service. Only a 1-year warranty on the product itself but 25-year warranty on the motor. Replacement going strong after 2+ years."

I have a epson home cinema 2d/3d w/2000 lumen output and we always have a lamp on for when my wife knits. I might add if you use a vinyl or a show cloth that theaters use paired with a high lumen projector you shouldn't  have a problem.That being said use with a room having direct sunlight light isn't ideal; but there is options what I'm trying to say. Plus my lamp is good for 3000 hrs? (have to check)  and they're 100 from epson.

I just project onto my (white) wall so I don't have to deal with a screen. That being said, a projector is not a good choice for someone who watches TV during the day, so it depends on what your habits are (or if you have good curtains). If you are like me and mostly just watch at night via netflix etc, then a projector would be a great choice.   If you go with a regular TV, get a sony."

Ignore this advice.  Track down a very reliable, featureless, ""dumb"" television with no apps or gadgetry built-in and look into the details specifically for which model numbers mean which panels from which companies, etc. Google a forum called ""AVS"" for detailed information on given HDTV models. Go for a solid 1080p display and turn off all the silly extra processing and frame interpolation. Also look for ""game mode"" as a feature since you're gonna notice any extra lag in most modern videogames.  You will be really happy having a TV that's just a TV, that shows content in its native resolution, with all your apps and other software running on a replaceable little set top box like a Roku or an Apple TV which you can replace from time to time for under $100 to have the latest and greatest capabilities."

Is the up-scaling on 4k sets up to snuff? I remember when I first saw a 1080p set it was showing It's A Wonderful Life (1946) and I was blown away by how good it looked. The one time so far that I've seen a 4k set outside of a store display, Rain Man (1988) was playing and it looked like shit. I've been wondering if maybe that was just a bum unit, or if 4k is just too big of a jump for pre-HD media.

Maybe if you had a projector in your house and were projecting the image onto a very large surface it would be worth it.   I feel tv companies ran out of ways to sell their sets long ago and now resort to complicated and gimmicky feature to push the numbers back up. Stuff I'm interested in isn't even on the radar. How about a quality line doubler built in that will process low resolution sources so I can play my old consoles? Built-in htpc?

If you have good vision, you can start to see artifacts resulting from it at 6-7 feet or so, which is what I would consider a normal viewing distance for a TV of that size. I'd shy away from OLED for now; it's not better enough than LCD to justify the price difference."

Anecdotal but my LG 32LE5300 has a bizarre bug where the various menu options start firing rapidly. Menus appearing and disappearing, options being selected, and sometimes even going so far down the tree that the language would change. Manifests itself mostly in the audio setting flipping around wildly, usually up, all the way to max volume. Removing batteries from the remote, covering the IR sensor, factory reset, unplugging it for 24 hours, etc., haven't helped, and it's happened in two totally different houses, so it's probably not some weird local IR source. Sometimes it disappears for months, then comes violently back.  Anyway, that's not why I wouldn't buy another LG. Duds happen. The problem is that LG wants to charge me around $200 just to show up to take a look at it, and no promises they can fix or replace it. The technician scheduling tool is crummy, too: you can only schedule a couple days in the immediate future, so if all the slots are taken, come back tomorrow to see if any are open 2 days from now."

BuyItForLife,3dhs8r,ColdStoryBro,5,Thu Jul 16 13:01:44 2015 UTC,"Bigger is not always better. In fact I would not get anything more than 12. It starts to get too heavy with the denser leathers and a bigger pocket will lower your catching accuracy. Here are a few go to series I know of:  Rawlings Heart of the Hide Rawlings Pro Prefered Wilson A2000 Wilson A2K  It won't be cheap but the leather will break in well and feel great for years. If you don't have a set position, try to get a trapeze web or H-web pocket glove. Stick to 10.5 - 11.5 ideally, if you have big hands you can push it a bit. Here's  a good example."
BuyItForLife,3dhs8r,ColdStoryBro,2,Thu Jul 16 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  How much breaking in would be required for something like the Rawlings or Wilson?  Shouldn't those be pretty ""good to go"" out of the box?  I'm planning to also get lanolin oil.  The general consensus is that it's the best when breaking in/maintaining a mitt."
BuyItForLife,3dhs8r,Stopitleo,3,Thu Jul 16 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"I haven't personally used oils so I cannot comment on that. The break in time is longer for sturdier top quality leathers. Most of the cheap sub 100 stuff is considered game ready or nearly game ready because  its flimsy stuff. Now the way I break stuff in is just by playing catch. I flare out and build the pocket into the way I naturally catch the ball, you can imagine why. It can take hundreds of catches to get it ""feeling right"" (without oil) and from there on it will feel better the more you play over the course of a season or two as it adjust to your hand.Also, leave a ball in the glove when you transport it so it doesn't get crushed out of shape in your game bag."

Still a beautiful glove.   Also, purchased a 12 inch Heart of the Hide for third base. This glove was used less (I could pick a ball at first with the pro preferred and couldn't throw for shit; my third base days were shortened considerably). Frankly, the glove was uncomfortable due to the large size of my hand. This isn't a bust on heart of the hide, just a reiteration of needing to try it on.   TL;DR: Rawlings above are very, very good gloves. Also, try on your glove before purchasing."

BuyItForLife,3dhs8r,efitz11,2,Thu Jul 16 12:33:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion.  Is 11.25"" a standard size?"
BuyItForLife,3dhs8r,iNeedScissorsSixty1,9,Thu Jul 16 12:36:35 2015 UTC,"11.25"" is pretty standard for infielders. Some would say it's on the smaller side for infielders, but for short and 2nd it should be fine. Corners have less reaction time and harder hits so they may like slightly larger gloves (>11.5"") with closed pockets. First basemen probably want something closer to an outfielder's glove (>12""), if they're not using a first basemen's mitt, because everyone will be throwing to them all the time.  For an all-purpose glove, here are my size recommendations:   Baseball - Mostly infielding (2B, SS, 3B, P): 11.5"" Baseball - Mostly outfielding (1B, OF): 12.5"" Softball - Mostly infielding: 12"" Softball - Mostly outfielding: 12.5"" - 13""   As this would be an all-purpose glove, I would get a closed pocket glove, though it's not critical (especially for rec league play).  edit: thanks /u/otterom"

BuyItForLife,3dhs8r,TurtleBird,2,Thu Jul 16 13:31:30 2015 UTC,10-4. In that case I'd go with about 11.5. If I wanted smaller I'd go with the 11.25 or 11. You should be good anywhere on the field with those.

They control about 40 - 45% of the Zip market and for good reason.  Make sure you get the original ones, because there are a lot of fakes. 90% of the time, originals will have the ykk stamp on one or both sides of the zip and the size of the zipper head also stamped on the middle. for the plastic coil zips they will have 5 stamps on the zip head. heard from the YKK agent that they started doing this because they want to differentiate from the fakes. I particularly like their moulded nylon vislon range because its their smoothest and most customizable range, and zips up really quietly.  Other brands that are also good but not as famous are RiRi, Talon, Ideal Koh-i-noor, coats and Lampo.   RiRi is used by a couple of the fashion brands like Rick Owens but i think they are not as hardy as YKK. You have to pull harder to pull open RiRi zips which i think stresses the zipper tape, i dont really recommend this brand. I think people think its better than ykk because its rare.  Talon and Ideal are classic American brands that have been around since the world war. i dont know how well they perform but they are usually found on bomber jackets and other military stuff. you wont really find Talon or Ideal zips nowadays unless its vintage. Finding cloths or bags with Talon zips is especially special because they were the biggest zip brand before the rise of YKK, and their zipper pulls are always badass. They also once produced metal coil zips... which if you are a zip geek like me, is pretty insane.   Koh-i-noor and opti are more used in europe. Cant really comment on Koh-i-noor which is a czech company with a pretty cool logo. Opti, the german brand, on the other hand, is quietly doing a lot of R&D and was the creator of the modern nylon zip. they hold about 10 percent of the zip industry which is alot considering 12 billion zips are sold a year. They are slightly more expensive than YKK and i think they are worth it.  If there was a brand that i would recommend over YKK it would be Lampo. Their zips are even more finely made and smoother than YKKs top of the line excella range which is why they are used by brands like Tom Ford and chanel. I dont know if Lampo is hardier than YKK but its definitely more classy.  source : I make bags, and hate shitty zips."

Wife actually got me a cover for it this year, but it's just sitting on the ground since I never remember to put it on after the grill has cooled down.

Not to mention that piezo-electric click starters seem to last about 4 clicks before they give up the ghost.  Until a maker has the balls to start selling read deal holyfield stainless or cast iron guts, the internals will always be the failure/frustration point.  Proof:  1 year of use Guts  This drip tray was DONE in one season  With burner plates installed  These plates might have lasted another year but were still terrible  My BIFL fix which cost $100 through local metal fab shop  I will have to replace the underside tubes one day I'm sure, but they at least appear to be made of sterner metal and have been going on 3 years now.

BuyItForLife,3daayf,ChipotleProphet,3,Tue Jul 14 18:52:38 2015 UTC,"I'll agree for the most past as I've also been using mine daily for many years (5+) and love em. However, the band that sits on top of your head has started decaying so it flakes all over the place and the padding is completely flattened making them pretty uncomfortable when wearing hours on end. So, not really a BIFL in my opinion."
BuyItForLife,3daayf,justinsnow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:26:44 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I haven't had any decaying with the band on my head. We're talking about the same series with the meshy/woven material covering as a band on top?  I ask cause I don't really see that material ""flaking"" the way the ear-pads flaked.  But yes, I can see how the ear-pads would make it technically not BIFL as a whole, but the way I see it, 15$ for ear-pads for a 120$ set is BIFL to me because it's such a low cost ratio to keep them great and if I have to do that every 5 years, then it will last me 40 years before the cost catches up to buying a new headset completely. 40 years is BIFL, so that was my rationale. :P"

They may not be small enough for what you are looking for but since the cable is the part that goes these have a replaceable cable.  I have an inner ear problem that makes IEMs painful so I just picked up some headphones hence the 'had'.
BuyItForLife,3d5kfs,cerberus1234,3,Mon Jul 13 18:30:24 2015 UTC,"Second that. They are great IEMs. Great sound and comfort. It takes some time to get used to the fact that the cable is worn over the ears. I got mine for 3 years now, use them daily, mostly for jogging and had to replace the cable twice.

The earphone thing. In order for the bud to get deep enough the earphone has to get into your ear. I'm not sure what the right term is.

Quality knives usually fall into two groups and really is based on your philosophy on usage. A knife can either be very hard and this holds in edge for a very long time but hard to touch up in between sessions or a knife can be ""soft"" which wont last as long in-between sessions but much easier to touch up. If your a home cook and I assume you are, ask yourself what do you want to do. Do you care to always have your knife at the very top performance every single use or do you just want to pick up and have it good enough for as long as possible ? If you don't mind basic upkeep, a stamped knife like the vnox is ideal, its cheap , its easy to maintain , its comfortable , and it is the house knife of almost every restaurant out there. Now of you want long term usage then look into forged knives from Japan or Germany depending on your cutting style , that's a whole another beast to over though."

That said, no knife is really  BIFL however  some are better crafted, balanced differently, made of different steel than others.  What's most important is to keep your knives sharp at all times. Depending on use & hardness, in a typical residential kitchen knives should be sharpened every three to six months.

They tend to be on the softer side - as mentioned in a previous comment this means a bit more maintenance to keep them super sharp.

That being said, Merino is a very soft wool, but it has a short fiber staple, so it will get fuzzy and pill. A wool with a longer fiber staple (like Bluefaced Leicester) will wear better, but also won't be quite as soft (but still plenty soft and my favorite wool to knit socks with)."

The leather is nice; it's not super thick, but after a year of hard use it hasn't ripped or torn or pulled stitches. It's large, but it it's going to fit an airplane ticket and a passport, that's what it needs. I've been extremely happy with it and I'd be happy to post pictures of the wear to it if you want.

The credit card slots are big enough to allow the cards to easily slide in and out.  The only (minor) odd thing is that there is a larger slot behind the credit card slots, and accessing the large slot means that you have to reach around the cards (which stick out maybe ~0.6"")."

The kindness is saccharine and as phoney as the marketing stories.   There was a thread about this a few weeks ago.  The customer service follows a template:  Hi, my name is Bob and I'm (doing something zany).  Here is a list of reasons we can't help you, but use the extra strap as a belt (or some equally useless suggestion).   I wouldn't be a ""rare"" exception, there are plenty that have received subpar products.   More to the point, for ""value"" it is overpriced.  You can take the same amount and get something bespoke of higher quality and that's a fact.  You'd get better leather, even with a ""story"" or whatever nonsense is spoon fed about scars and such.  In fact, if you wanted that you could still get it and it be similar in costs and much better value.   As far as your snide remark as to what type of person I am is rather rich coming from a fanboy that is painting all critics as critics purely because the owner is Christian, which is rather moronic.   That be like me saying all people who obsess over saddleback leather only do so because they know nothing about leather nor quality.  I would say that only applies the majority of the time."

They're comfortable to hold, they're lightweight, they fit neatly into a drawer with other stuff, and they're as good at lifting heavy steaks and chops as they are more delicate foods.  I bought mine on a restaurant supply site.  I know you don't need one now, but if you set your sights on a sturdy metal spatula, Dexter Basics is where it's at. It scratches my tri-ply and aluminum stuff pretty bad, though, and I wouldn't even try it on enamel or Teflon.  Edit: Wait, this dude mentioned my spatula already. Sorry!

Many won't last a year.  I love my redwings worx.  they are slip resistant, steel toe, non marking, electric dissipative, have excellent arch support, but they're also heavy and non breathing.  they were used when I got them, so I'm not sure how old they are, but I've worn them for a year and they're still in great shape.  couple scuffs, nothing missing.  I bought a pair of New Balance 627s, and I really liked them, but they only lasted 9 months before the soles wore through on the bottom and tore in ways that directly interfered with my safety - unable to switch from gas to brake pedal.  So I bought a pair of Timberlands Pro Powertrain, and they are occasionally uncomfortable, especially while crouched.  I've had them for a month, and it's too late to return them, so I guess I'll see how long they last.  The sole is fantastic, the colors are awesome, and best of all, I can feel a breeze through the tongue.  The arch support is mediocre, and the fit is narrower than I expected.  I've always ordered regular M width shoes, but I'd like to compare a wide with what I already have.   I still have an old pair of Wolverines boots I wore for 2.5 years.  They need new soles, but are otherwise in good shape.  I bought a pair of John Deere (I love the tractors) branded boots made by Dan Post.  Lots of features, good looking.  Uncomfortable for the first month, nice once broken in... but literally fell apart at 3 months.  Not wearable.  Inoperative.  Money down the drain.  Have yet to try Keen or Danner.  Good luck!"

My first pair almost a decade ago took a lot of abuse.  The sole lasted about 5 years of heavy wear, and by the time I needed a new sole, the leather was so messed up that I just bought a new pair.  The leather and stitching is still great as always, but the sole is softer and has only lasted about 2 years on my current boot.  I still recommend them though, as there aren't many other boots to compare in the same category."

There are a number of Zojirushi branded cookers being sold on amazon for ~$100.  They are Chinese made and cook very poorly.  Ours died.  It was past 30 days.  I called Amazon and they gave me the credit and I bought a Japanese made one for about $250.  It is night and day.

I use the Sauteuse / Saucier a lot. It's actually really good for making popcorn. I use a lid off one of my ancient RevereWare pans.  Try and break their ice cream scoop. Under normal use I see this lasting forever. Heck, most of their kitchen items outside of the really cheap items are definitely BIFL. The BEKVÄM step stool is very well made. If you stain it beforehand and use wood glue when assembling it, it's a solid piece of furniture for $15.  Also, the Ikea shopping bags are actually really well made.

Hemnes line is cheaper than your average furniture store but probably the more/most expensive stuff they sell.

They sell crappy pans that will warp and flake off with regular use.   Like any retailer, they sell a very wide range of stuff. They sell cheap cardboard box tables which you won't be handing down to your kids (though I have one supporting my stereo in the basement) but they also sell very nice, solid wood items as well.

BuyItForLife,3csgwo,CRCasper,9,Fri Jul 10 14:28:51 2015 UTC,That entirely depends on how often you use a tool.
BuyItForLife,3csgwo,AndyH13,3,Fri Jul 10 14:23:43 2015 UTC,"It depends on a lot of factors. Obviously you could divide the lifespan by the price that would be a useful metric. It's also worth considering the opportunity cost (not sure that's the right word here) of broken tools (lost income, time spent reordering).  Also while I don't think BIFL is entirely divorced from frugality, I also don't think they're exactly the same thing."
BuyItForLife,3csgwo,andpassword,3,Fri Jul 10 15:30:36 2015 UTC,A cheap tool that will break after ~20 uses is more frugal than an expensive one that will only break after ~200 uses if you only need to use it 10 times.

Seriously, this is the only clothing company I actually like to support after buying stuff ranging from overpriced and underperforming Arc'Teryx to cheap ass Czech brand Hannah. Had the Insulated Powder Bowl jacket for years and it just got me through it's 7th+ winter. The better sweater 1/4"" zippers are comfortable enough to live in and dry in two hours tops after washing.  Brother printers - bought one of their MFCs at the start of college and printed tens of thousands of pages on it since. Plus, at the time at least, it was about the only multifunction networked printer that actually worked with just about any OS I could throw at it. Nowadays, I have it set up so that the scanner uploads to the server via FTP, there a Cron job moves it to a Dropbox folder, which syncs it to all my devices. The paper rarely gets jammed (Only when I try weird formats or something is crumpled too much), but it's really easy to get it out. Plus it has an autofeeder, which works pretty well for stuff up to about 50 pages. I just wish there was an easy way to set the copier to go duplex by default. The menu is sort of confusing as far as that goes.  As a honorable mention: Bosch pro line power tools (the blue ones), these are actually not made in USA. Most seem to be fairly cheap, very good quality, and very easy to repair with replacement parts available for most of them.  Edit: Also, even though they were recently bought by Festool (Which I consider pretty nice quality as well) - Protool power tools. Czech made, pretty great stuff. Especially their angle cutters.  Edit 2: And of course Miele for vacuums. Didn't have a chance to buy one of the new ones after the EU capped the maximum vacuum wattage, but I think they wouldn't really put out something bad.

So before you make your coffee you should warm the french press (basically fill it with really hot water). Otherwise it'll cool the water that you put in it. Coffee snobs will be annoyed by this.  Also for as expensive as it is, I don't feel that it gives the seal that it should. It's a very good looking french press though. My girlfriend still only uses the original $20 bodum I got her. She says it's because the Frieling sucks, but I think she's just emotionally attached to the Bodum."

When you open a freezer door and feel all the cold air fall on you, the fridge has to consume more energy to refreeze the air. However, if you get a freezer drawer, then much of the cold air (which falls because hot air rises) will stay in the freezer, and therefore save energy.  Also, I would recommend not getting a water/ice dispenser. Although it is convenient, it is one of the first things to break in a fridge. Also, there is more space in the freezer. Just use some ice cube trays, and a small Brita filter.  Edit: based on the data from /u/RugerRedhawk, getting a top freezer drawer is more energy efficient.

BuyItForLife,3ckexk,ABearWearingATophat,11,Wed Jul 8 22:41:35 2015 UTC,"They said I'd have to come back in when the regional manager was going to be in the store because only she would be able to help me. On top of that they were giving me talk about how it's normal wear and tear and kind of had a confused attitude about my complaint. If I recall correctly, they said the regional manager would probably have them fixed for a price. My response was I'm never shopping at Aldo again. They were clearly defective considering how little I had worn them and I was shocked at how they didn't stand by their products.  They've definitely fallen in quality in the past few years. The first pair I bought lasted me 6-7 years. The last two I bought lasted less than a year each and I don't wear my shoes heavily."

They still have good products, but they're spread along the cheap stuff in the same store."

I also tend to walk between 6,000 to 10,000 steps in them every day I wear them. I've had them for almost two years now and they're still in great shape. They have stitching around the edges and they haven't frayed at all.  My black pair doesn't have the stitching on the edges (looks like it was just glued together) and I wear them about once a week. They started falling apart about two or three months in. I had to use shoe goo to fix them up a bit.  I think how the shoe is made matters more than the brand."

I looked up the model number, and it was made in either 1995 or 1997. It's used almost daily, with store-brand powder detergent. No rinse aid, no dishwasher-cleaning stuff; we've never even cleaned out the filter.

[Floor model--we didn't completely lose our minds.] It's got a regular door and a bottom freezer. We couldn't avoid the ice maker, so we just didn't hook it up. Two complaints: 1) it's kinda loud, and 2) you have to REALLY make sure the freezer door is shut--I often go behind my kids and find that they haven't really closed it.

I know a family that has gotten a lot of replacement parts for free without questions, they have a large house, kids, pets - the kind of place where they have to use the vacuum daily.  I have a Dyson myself, 5 years old now. No problems so far, I'm sure it will last a long time. I waited for a good offer when I bought it, expensive but worth the money in my case.  Edit: I must add that their products performance is, in my experience, pretty good so I'm ok with the high price tag.

BuyItForLife,3cq6cv,Geldtron,2,Thu Jul 9 21:58:01 2015 UTC,"Either boot can be resoled. Any cobbler can do the Goodyear Welt, but the SuperSole will need to be sent back to Red Wing. The Vibram on the 917 is a more durable sole, but it's also harder. The 4217s have a nicer footbed and softer sole with an extra gel cushion under the heel and the ball of your foot.  If you need that lug sole, get the 917, otherwise I would recommend the 4217. The soles won't last as long, but especially if they seemed like a better fit, you'll probably get more comfort.   Also, if it's important to you, the 4217s are made in your home state. The 917s are made in China."
BuyItForLife,3cq6cv,Jedecon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:57:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  You may have missed it...but I actually already bought the 4217's. Their style and just all around fit on my foot was better than the 917's. Honestly I think a decent chunk was the sole, that deep tread wasn't the smoothest thing to walk on. However I know it would come in handy for snowy situations.  Perhaps I wasn't clear. I'm curious IF the Goodyear Welt style sole (from the 917) can be put on the 4217's when I have then resoled??? (I'm sure I could easily ask a rep, and I will eventually - I just totally spaced it when I was there today.)  If not I'll buy a more suitable pair come winter time, perhaps even the 917's. But I honestly do not like the metal lace system on them. They were very course and it made lacing (tightening) the boot difficult. I much prefer eye holes.  This is why I'm open to any other suggestions for boots, ones that would be good in winter... on a roof or ladder.   Water Proof / Gortex / Similar - Insulation of some sort wouldn't be bad either, but I can always wear wool socks. Black 90degree heel, 3/4"" sole    Also, if it's important to you, the 4217s are made in your home state. The 917s are made in China.   This was not a deciding factor. The sales person mentioned this AFTER I made my decision of, ""Ya I'm gonna go with these ones."" He said something like, ""Now this may either cement your decision or you may not really care, but what you said almost word for word"""
BuyItForLife,3cq6cv,Jedecon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:31:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry. I misunderstood. A cobbler might be able to put a different sole on the 4217s, but it isn't ideal. The store could probably send them back to Red Wing. I have seen Red Wing put Vibram Soles on Super Sole boots, but in the past I have seen them refuse.

It's comfy, durable and was only $50.  Plus I think Jansport has a lifetime guarantee.  Not sure what model I have, or if it's made anymore, but build-wise I'm happy with Jansport.

I know according to consumer reports the Tacoma is the highest rated mid-size truck on the market. If you are buying used look for vehicles with less than 60,000 - 70,000 miles if you can afford it, typically a lot of service has to be done when it gets closer to the 90,000 or 100,000 miles. Also look up the service guides on the vehicles to see what is recommended for the age/mileage."
BuyItForLife,3cke3v,slapstik007,3,Wed Jul 8 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. From what I have found so far, both the Tacoma and Frontier are the best buys for a mid size. Few reviews put the Chevy Colorado or Dodge Dakota as favorites. The Avalanche seems to fall into more of a SUV category, which makes it a little hard to compare. Definitely shooting for under 75k if I buy used,"
BuyItForLife,3cke3v,mcthiel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"I've driven all those trucks (besides the Avalanche) a fair amount and I would rank the Frontier dead last in terms of capability and comfort. Tacoma wins, but the Colorado wasn't bad and would probably be dirt cheap on the resale market.  Can't speak to long term reliability of any of them."
BuyItForLife,3cke3v,dt911,9,Sat Jul 11 00:51:14 2015 UTC,"As a used car dealer I can share my own experiences with all 3.  -Nissan Frontier: Would be the last choice I would ever make. Historically there have been big problems with the timing set in the 4.0L engines. Also, most of the people I know (Nissan dealers included) will avoid Frontiers with automatic transmissions like the plague. In addition to the recent beating that Nissan took from consumer reports, I have noticed that their quality is steadily declining in the last 10 years or so. They also have a habit of making things difficult for independent shops to repair. Many things require proprietary tools or for programming to be done at the dealer after the repair is made.  -Toyota Tacoma: Is a great choice if you have the money. The name will command a premium, but will also generally pay off in resale value. If resale value is a concern, I really recommend going for a TRD or fully loaded SR5 model with alloy wheels, etc. They sell circles around the base models in the used car market.  -Chevy Avalanche: Great choice if it's not too big to get into the places you want to go. There will be more luxury features available to you and the price will be comparable to the Tacoma if you're looking for something 2-3 years old. GM powertrains are incredibly tough and often top 300,000 miles. Some would argue that 02-06 were made with thicker steel and offer better corrosion resistance. The 07-13 ""bankruptcy years"" still have the great drivetrain, but use noticeably cheaper interior materials. Even still, it probably represents the best value for your money in this group of vehicles. They have a HUGE cult following and, since it was discontinued in 2013, resale values have strengthened as the nicer examples are getting scooped up."

BuyItForLife,3cke3v,Taco_co,3,Wed Jul 8 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"Tacoma is going to be the most dependable.  With that said, you may want to consider a full size truck for the following reasons.  MPG is not much better with these midsize trucks. My sister had a Tacoma V6 and got the same MPG that I got out of a 400hp V8 Ram (8sp and cylinder deactivation).  These mid size trucks don't sell well compared to the full sized market. This makes them rare on the used market and they bring a premium when it comes to resale. I'd be willing to bet you could pay less for a similarly equipped full size.  I looked at all the mid size and was planning on buying one but after comparing them to the full size, they just didn't stack up. Nice ride, nicer interior, more power, more room, more options, etc.  This is just what I saw when I was looking at a truck. I thought the Ram provided a lot of bang for the buck but I quickly realized that I just wasn't a truck person and got rid of it. The good thing is that you've had an SUV so you know what they are like.  I think you owe it to yourself to at least drive a few."

I think it's interesting that the rise of the tablet has made it acceptable for an American man to carry what is, in effect, a purse.  You can't pretend it's a backpack or a type of briefcase: it's undeniably a sort of purse, because that's what a small ""every day carry"" bag is, isn't it?  A man can carry such a bag now and other guys won't rag him about it.  In fact, they might complement him and discuss what type of ""EDC bag"" they intend to buy soon.  But it's still a purse.  I doubt guys will start calling them that, though."

I hate box springs and have never really even understood their purpose. Futons and mattresses are not exaclty a “buy it for life” kind of thing as they will need to be replaced every decade or so.   I’ve never understood why people say they want a firm mattress and then put a pad on top of it to soften it up a bit. Why not just get a mattress or futon that has the feel you are looking for.  If you are looking for a more “authentic” thin Asian mattress then that could be foldeed up and put out of the way, as others have said, your city may have a local Asian store that has something you like.  I got my last futon from webfuton.com. The “Gemini” model. It is about 15 years old and still is very comfortable. I’ll probably give it another 5 years befire I even think of replacing it even though they rate it life span as just 15 years. You may want something thinner and firmer though.  I don’t use a pad on top but I do have a sheepskin just to keep years of sweat from being absorbed into the mattress itself.  Good luck finding what you want."

BuyItForLife,3cg1pg,DerekMLarson,8,Tue Jul 7 22:20:11 2015 UTC,"In the strictest terms of BIFL, yes a Saddleback will last you a very long time. However, I've had 2 of their wallets and didn't really prefer them as an EDC item. They're very thick (almost unnecessarily so) and not designed well (IMO) to hold the contents intelligently. The card slots were not wide enough for cards and I had to slice the slots very slightly on each edge to make normal cards fit. Once I had a few cards in the wallet, they would overlap with the leather layers in such a way that my wallet was very thick in the middle and much thinner on the edges.  My current recommendation is Flowfold. Sure, they aren't leather, but they are made from sailboat sail material and are extremely durable. Comes in a few different styles/colors though I just opted for a basic black/clear one. The stitching seems to be high enough quality to last a long time. My trifold Flowfold wallet is thinner full than my Saddleback wallet was empty. and it is much more intelligently designed for holding cards than the Saddleback.  I have nothing negative to say about my Flowfold and expect it to last me at least 10 years. So unless you need leather to feel like a man, I'd strongly recommend it.  edit: and you can buy them on amazon if you want"
BuyItForLife,3cg1pg,MangyCanine,5,Tue Jul 7 23:06:21 2015 UTC,"I'll second this comment about the Saddleback medium bifold wallet (I don't think this applies to the large or the small, though).  Credit cards can be difficult to pull out of some slots in my medium wallet.  Anyone considering a Saddleback wallet should also take a look at Ashland Leather wallets.  The prices are higher, though (in some cases, a lot higher, if you get something with Horween shell cordovan leather)."
BuyItForLife,3cg1pg,legoman666,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"To support this point, I own both medium and small bi-fold saddleback wallets. I had the medium first and it had all the problems being pointed out.   The small on the other hand is something I like very much. If you dont mind the thickness, you will be getting amazing quality and amazing function with a small.  I cant vouch for the large because I've never even held one, but I can only assume it is better than the medium because it doesn't have the overlapping card layout."
BuyItForLife,3cg1pg,elislider,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:27:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Saddleback leather and construction are excellent; it's the designs that I don't like.  I think their ID card wallet suffers from a similar problem: I think it's too small, especially the ID card slot.  If they made the wallet maybe 3mm longer/wider, they'd have a winner."
BuyItForLife,3cg1pg,legoman666,2,Wed Jul 8 05:03:05 2015 UTC,"Second. My saddleback wallet eats my credit cards due to the design of the card pockets. I complained to saddleback and to their credit they offered me a new one, but didn't take them up on it because it would have been identical."

BuyItForLife,3cfzko,Circusmidget,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:48:01 2015 UTC,"I've tested and relied on a variety of vacuum sealers.  The Foodsaver midrange variety that you find at Costco is OK, but not known for their longevity or motor strength. They're reasonably priced, in part, because the special bag rolls are costly, and they have you on the hook.  Cost-is-no-issue: get a small budget vacuum chamber unit. Bulky, costly (probably $1500), but the best method.  The Vac-u-pack units have good motors and cost around $350.  Best vacuum power and frugality: the Pump-n-Seal hand pump for about $40. Use it with re-used jars (glass is better than plastic for airtightness and your health IMHO) and get an amazing vacuum seal, be careful you don't implode the lid. Given it's size and ease of use, it's more reliable and faster than other methods. Glass jars are not earthquake-stable, however, and are heavy to carry. You can use the pump-n-seal on bags, but it doesn't shine there.   price is not an option   This is nonsensical (it implies 'no negotiating'), so I presumed you meant price is no barrier."

Buy professional model hair clippers, and they'll last many times longer.   tl If you're buying any hair clippers it doesn't matter so much the brand as the market the model is made for.  Consumer targeted Wahl models are mostly shit, same as the Philips consumer models, and every other clipper brand. They're all built from cheap parts and made to not last. The batteries will age quickly, the blades will become blunt, and they might start falling apart. If your Wahl consumer grade clippers last more than a year or two, you got lucky. Same as any other brand.  But if you buy a professional model, then that's a whole different story. Professional hair clippers are made to very different standards. Wahl's pro models are excellent quality. Ditto a whole bunch of other pro clipper brands.  Edit: Moser, who make pro clippers, are owned by Wahl, so some of their pro clipper models are also sold under the Wahl brand. For example the Moser Li+Pro is also sold as the Wahl Li+Pro in some countries. I recommend the Li+Pro. It's rock solid. The battery lasts for months without recharging (unless you're using it all day in a salon, of course), and it has excellent build quality and blade."

Luckily there are a lot out in the wild, but apple won't make you new ones Their forced OS upgrades cripple people with older iphones   They make good hardware.

BuyItForLife,3caxlq,Grazfather,4,Tue Jul 7 01:55:57 2015 UTC,Apple have changed their adapters once in the near 15 year lifetime of the iPod/iPhone/iPad.   The other two points are valid.

BuyItForLife,3caxlq,Grazfather,6,Tue Jul 7 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"On the change to the lightning connector:  They stuck with the old 30-pin for ten years. Technology moved on, and eventually they updated to a design that offers significant improvements over the old one (reversibility, smaller plug that takes up less real estate in the phone,  etc)  One change in ten years is not bad at all as technology goes. Sorry your old docks and stuff don't work, but sometimes progress just has to be made.   If you want longevity in a speaker, a device-specific dock is not the way to go. A device that uses a standard 3.5mm jack or Bluetooth is going to be a lot more compatible in the future."
BuyItForLife,3caxlq,ch00f,2,Mon Jul 6 21:21:27 2015 UTC,"Bluetooth is kind of my point: If Apple used Standard connectors there wouldn't be this problem. They decide instead to make their own proprietary connectors and charge licensing fees instead of using something open. They are going to use usb3 in the future, though, so that might change."
BuyItForLife,3caxlq,Uncle_Erik,5,Mon Jul 6 23:19:56 2015 UTC,"I hope I can offer some unbiased clarification.  Apple's desktop/laptop hardware is very hit or miss.  When they make a good machine, it works well.  I've got a Mac Mini from 2004 that still works (needed a new hard drive at one point) an iMac from 2012 that works fine (upgraded the hard drive to SSD and upgraded the ram to 16 gig), and a macbook pro laptop from 2009 that works great (though you have to push a little harder than usual on the trackpad.  That being said, my Macbook Pro from 2007 had to get sent back for repairs 4 times in the first year I owned it until they just gave me a new one.  This is because of a faulty video card from Nvidia with soldering issues that would break due to thermal stresses.  While Apple did eventually comp me a new laptop, they took their darn time doing so and never issued much of a public statement regarding the problem which affected a lot of hardware.  You're right that their phones and mobile devices do get substantially slower with future OS updates.  I have an iPad2 running the latest OS and it's almost unusably slow.  Loading a video up from a webpage will often crash the browser and take maybe 5-10 seconds when it does actually work.  I kind of wish I never upgraded.  That being said, they do support their devices for a pretty long time.  iOS9 will have support for the iPhone 4S which came out in 2011.  A lot of Android phones have substantial power but fail to get updates when new versions of the OS comes out because it's up to the actual carrier to support the older devices.  So it's a toss up between performance and features.  The 19 pin lightning connector was the only change to their phone connector since the 30 pin connector which was in use for over a decade.  I've never broken a micro USB cable, but I can say that the lightning connector does feel more durable as it's a much simpler construction and can be inserted either way."

Currently, I run a 2006 white MacBook.  Still works fine.  I intend to get a retina MacBook sooner or later.  I also run a 2011 Mac Mini.  I expect it to last until 2020.

BuyItForLife,3caxlq,pipechap,5,Mon Jul 6 23:18:38 2015 UTC,You missed some of their shitty g models. Steve jobs in his ultimate wisdom decided his power supplies would not have fans. In order to achive this they had to use nonstandard voltages for the motherboard. Then the power supplies started failing because they need fans unfortunately they were $300 - $400 to replace with ones with fans because they are nonstandard. That was when I decided I was done with apple.
BuyItForLife,3caxlq,Robots_In_Disguise,4,Mon Jul 6 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"Steve was also the one who demanded the products be very closed box, IIRC some of the early mac models had a switch that was depressed by one of the case halves, and if you attempted to run the case open, it would not boot.

I get a lot of crap whenever I mention Ryobi, but they've really stepped up their game in the last few years.    Their saw blades, driver bits, and other accessories are, ok, but not great. I can't speak for their plug in tools at all because I've never owned any.   Even so, their 18v ""One +"" line of tools are a pretty good deal. They are relatively inexpensive, and the batteries are all backwards compatible, which means you don't have to buy new tools every time the battery technology improves.    Also with the newer chargers, you can store the batteries in them, without risk of overcharging. Since mine live in the back of a truck, that really doesn't mean anything to me, but for a home user it's one less thing to worry about.   I use mine at work every day, and they've held up better than most of my coworkers newer Dewalt, and Bosch tools.  I used to take a bit of ribbing, over them, but as the years have passed and my tools just keep going, the ribbing has stopped.  Especially since when I show up on a job with a few helpers, I bring enough so that nobody has to wait for a tool.  Also since they are less expensive, I can afford the cool toys that most of the guys using more expensive stuff almost never buy.    The warranty is pretty decent too, especially on the batteries.   I doubt any battery powered tool is truly BIFL, but I've had extremely good service out of mine.  My tools get used a lot.  I run a lot of screws, and my impacts get used far more in a week than most casual users will put them through in years. I drill a lot of holes in aluminum and steel ranging from 1/8"" up to 3"" pretty regularly. I also use a lot of tapcons so my hammer drill gets a workout as well.  I admit the miter saw and nail gun sit quite a bit, but they've both earned their keep.   I have multiples of many tools for helpers to use on big jobs.  Out of the list below, I've had one trigger fail, and one impact that died under warranty. Also the hammer drill is getting a bit sloppy, but it's drilled thousands of 1/4"" and 3/8"" hole in concrete, and at least ten times that many in metal.   All these are the 18v model.  4  1/4"" impacts  4 drills  1 hammer drill  1 miter saw (a bit small, but plenty accurate. I mostly cut aluminum with mine)    1 multi tool  1 electric caulk gun  1 3/4"" impact   3 sawzalls   2 grinders   1 DA sander  1 jigsaw  12 Lithium batteries.

These shirts are also handy if, like me, you find most shirts too short in the torso and never wide enough in the shoulders. http://www.amazon.com/Blackhawk-Sleeve-Lightweight-Tactical-X-Large/dp/B002Q0ZZFW/ref=sr_1_3?&ie=UTF8&qid=1437022637&sr=8-3&keywords=blackhawk+tactical+shirt  I also reccomend Dickies Men's  Heavyweight Cushion Compression Work Crew Socks.   They are very cheap, and I originally bought a 3 pack just because I needed brown socks, but I liked them so much I thought I would get nothing but them when my quadrannual sock replacement came about.  Skip ahead 3 years, and I bought nothing but these, and I can't tell which ones were 3 years old, and which wre brand new. That is a borderline miracle, because I have some large calf muscles, and no sock before has ever held up to them.    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KLMEPXU?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00"

If a boot is resistant it will be marked with a specific white tag. This white tag means that the boot has soles that are electric shock resistant.   Now of course every work environment is different and a boot can only provide a certain amount of resistance. But in Canada, these boots are required on many jobs sites, including electrical work.

To be specific, its a top of the line wildland firefighting boot. Which, does in fact entail a lot of hiking. Whites are some of the most comfortable and durable boots ever made, but these boots are made to be worn in the woods. They would be uncomfortable and much too over engineered for a construction site. It would be like buying a world class racing bicycle to ride to the grocery store once a week.  Honestly op, your boots are gonna get ruined on a construction site regardless. There's so much debris and nasty chemicals everywhere. You'd be more comfortable and better protected in boots designed for that function. Personally, I recommend something like these. Big heels are for digging into soft dirt for traction on hills and will just make you trip on a building site. (Or for gaffs)  Edit: meant to reply to /u/splurch.

While it could be welded, welding is not what you want to do with a bike. To repair it properly, they would have had to unbraze the whole bottom bracket (the BB is cast and the part joining the seat tube is the part that broke) and then re-seat and re-braze all of the connecting tubes. The time and labour required to strip the bike down, repair it, repaint it, and build it back up was many more times the value of the bike. It was a great bike, but I got my money's worth thousands of times over, and there are other frames and other bikes out there to ride.

This will keep your knives sharp like a year.... without wearing them down any.  7-Learn proper knife skills  8-Never buy directly from a knife manufacturer, online knife retail shops will have huge discounts rather than sell for MSRP.  9-Never put nice knives in the dishwasher, especially if they have wood handles  I don't have any experience with those particular knives but they don't seem bad.   The steel is german, CR15MOV, not uncommon for kitchen knives.   If you want a great alternative, Shun.  I think they use vg10 for a lot, which i'd say is slightly better, but doubt you'd really care or notice much.

A Brother branded high-yield toner cartridge is $50 for ~2600 pages, or about two cents per page.  If you're OK with a slight hit to greyscale print quality, you can get a knock-off cartridge for $15, or about half a cent per page.  If you're even more industrious, you can just buy a bottle of toner for $8 and refill the cartridge yourself, or about a quarter of a cent per page."

There's a bigger model DC44 for floor vacuuming, and a newer model with more suction.

BuyItForLife,3c9k5a,Eat_sleep_poop,4,Mon Jul 6 08:38:37 2015 UTC,"All cars are consumables. If you want to keep a car forever, you need to either buy it brand new and be meticulous about it, or find one used from an owner who had this mentality when he/she bought it new. Doing either of these, the car can still be a shitbox. Sometimes you get one built on a Monday morning after a long holiday weekend or a on Friday afternoon; and sometimes you'll get one built on Wednesday after lunch when the assemblers were listening to their favorite radio station. Don't fall into the BIFL trap of Toyotas being this amazing forever car... They were, but aren't anymore. Sure, they're great cars but they are just riding out that legendary 80s/90s Japanese build quality. U.S. Spec Camrys aren't even made in Japan. Tacomas suffer from frame rot. If you want to experience true quality from Toyota, buy a Land Cruiser. Jeep Cherokees XJs are great, but they are far from comfortable and the newest is 14 years old (I have had two). It doesn't matter if you buy a Corolla or a Yugo, if maintenance wasn't done on it and it was never washed/waxed it's going to be a piece of shit. I'm daily driving a 20 year old Land Rover Discovery and it is in great shape mechanically... I keep up on it and bought it from the original owner who had it regularly serviced at the dealer.   TL;DR... Service records are everything. But sometimes it doesn't matter."

By the time the engine needs a rebuild or something you should easily be able to pick up a salvage engine for basically nothing and drop that in.  If you're buying for life the value of a vehicle should not really bother you, you should pretty much be planning on keeping it for a few decades by which point many vehicles are worthless.  But if you're looking to BIFL Honda and BMWs latest offerings are extremely good designs, the engine and running gear tests they've done on them are ridiculous, I wouldn't be at all suprised to see them topping a million miles without breaking a sweat."

Particulate traps, urea injection, egr systems, ultra high pressure fuel rails. Lots of sketchy things done to meet the new emissions.  I have seen some expensive repairs. And if you need a major part, holy crap! A new head and block was $9200 (part only) for my friend's TDI Jetta. A complete 4.3 v6 for my van is $2000. That is a lot of fuel. And don my forget those expensive oil changes.  Gasoline engines on the other hand are having a major mileage boost using high compression and direct injection. The same reason diesels are efficient (even if gasoline has a lower BTU content). By injecting during the combustion event, we as back to the old super high compression engines that make great power and are efficient. Not quite diesel efficient, but close. If You do the math of gas vs diesel and the extra several grand purchasing the car, the lower maintenance costs on a gasoline engine (especially if you break something), often the tipping point for being cheaper means owning the car over a quarter million kilometres. And that is assuming no major breakdowns.   Another friend just put $4000 into his cummins dodge for new injectors. Truck has 80,000km and is just out of warranty."

I'm more scared of these new fuel systems. 1500 psi (103 bar) was one thing, but 15,000 psi (1034 bar) is something else entirely. There is going to be a huge learning curve from the manufacturers. And no way is a system with those kind of pressures going to last the rest of time. Because physics and metallurgy."

Currently in my 2nd semester so not much about fuel injection yet, mostly material-science.  Yep we have cats/particulate filters now too, but only for newer cars. I guess you're better off with refined, older generation injection systems then, but the very old-ones were faulty, too. The first direct inject Diesels were notorious, that's why I bought one from 2005, right before the BLUETEC line.  God what would I give to be able to drive a RAM with a cummins diesel, but there are exactly 0 of them here, we have small roads and literally nobody drives a big car / pickup truck.

Will you religiously adhere to a preventative maintenance schedule, or are you more of a ""change the oil every 5k, and drive it until something breaks and then take it to the shop"" sort of driver?  Do you live in a part of the country where roads are salted in the winter?"
BuyItForLife,3c9k5a,semyorka7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:19:01 2015 UTC,"I do work on my own car. I'd be comfortable doing major maintenance on a vehicle that was an ease to work on. I'm alright on preventative maintenance now, but I'd probably be more diligent if I adored my vehicle and viewed it as an investment. I don't want a vehicle that needs a full weekend of attention every month. I know I'd love working on a vehicle full of clean, high precision, high quality components, but such is out of my budget. I'd be considering a motorcycle for this reason, but it's not practical.  The roads are salted where I drive, but the snowy season is only a month long and I only drive a couple days per week. Still, it would be an issue.  I am interested in taking the vehicle on very long coast-to-coast trips every couple years."
BuyItForLife,3c9k5a,semyorka7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:03:12 2015 UTC,"Alright.  Out of curiosity, what's wrong with your '01 Camry?  How many miles on it, and did you get it new or used?"
BuyItForLife,3c9k5a,motel08,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:39:05 2015 UTC,"The Camry came used in 2008. It has 190,000 miles on it now. I replaced the engine at 140,000 miles. But right now it needs a lot of maintenance and I'm concerned about putting >$1000 into it and being on the other side with a car worth about as much and having something else fail soon.   Needs new tires Needs new radiator (bad leak) Seized brake caliper slide pin (needs replacement, probably all four) (1) broken lug nut stud Broken driver's side door handle Failing vehicle emissions inspection (possible dead solenoid) Possible oil leak (I can't tell due to all of the coolant on the ground) I'm probably killing the battery by not running the car   The interior and body are in good condition, but the CV axles don't look good and the exhaust heat shield is falling off. I had to repair the flex pipe at the same time as the engine.  I probably shouldn't have replaced the engine, and moved on at that point. It's a mistake I'm trying not to repeat."
BuyItForLife,3c9k5a,Eat_sleep_poop,5,Mon Jul 6 07:25:51 2015 UTC,"So... tires are consumables.  Radiators will wear out after nearly 200k miles, especially if maintenance is deferred and contaminants are allowed into the coolant loop for 10s of thousands of miles.  Brake calipers should be treated as consumables when we're talking in terms of decades and 100s of thousands of miles, especially in a locations with road salt.  A car is a complicated piece of industrial machinery, and things will wear out periodically.  It's important to stay on top of maintenance tasks and not ignore broken stuff.  All cars are going to need regular maintenance, especially once the odo start climbing well past 150k. No car can withstand neglect.  I have a '90 Camry with 300k on it that's going to keep running until it cracks in half from rust.  Sure, in the last 100k I've had to swap out the AC compressor, distributor, wiper washer fluid pump, all the struts, clutch, exhaust flex joint, rear brake lines and drums, etc... but it runs like a champ, it's easy to work on, and gets great milage.  Yearly maintenance costs are peanuts compared to car payments on a new car.  It might be cheaper to buy a ~10 year old used car every five years, but I like my Camry.  So, here are some vehicles to look for and vehicles to avoid:   Anything older than the late 80s will be a bear to maintain.  Partly just because of age, and partly because modern fuel injection hadn't really been perfected yet.  Anything newer than the mid 00's is going to be chock full of electric do-dads waiting to fail, and the engines are harder to work on as well.  Not a problem for most people, but a big problem if you're looking for a car that you can cheaply maintain in your own garage, or one to hold onto for 20-30 years.  The early 90s to mid 00s are a sweet spot of good, simple engines and relatively modern engine technology.   I would not recommend a Jeep.  Yes, there's a large aftermarket and hobbyist following.  It's because they're great offroaders, not because they are good cars.  They're actually pretty terrible.  Other than the 4.0 I6 engine (incredibly reliable), everything breaks.  The suspension has great articulation for off-road, but is otherwise an awful design.  Look up ""Jeep death wobble"".  Possible exception: 1997-2001 Cherokee, WITH the 4.0 I6 engine but WITHOUT 4wd.  The RWD models have different, less shitty front suspension, lose all the complexity of the transfer case, and get better fuel milage to boot.  Win-win-win, unless you plan to go rock crawling.  The '91-96 models may be acceptable as well, although they're more prone to rust and the interiors aren't as nice. Pretty much any Honda Civic or Accord from the early 90s through mid 2000s is a good bet.  Avoid models with the V6 and the automatic transmission together - the transmission is notoriously weak.  The cars are also thief magnets, in part due to how interchangeable the parts are between various models. The Camry and Corolla from late 80s and early 2000s are great cars, and really the entire Toyota and Lexus lineups from that period as well.  2nd gen Camry (88-91) was extremely well built but has rust issues in places with road salt.  The 92-96 Camry is the best of the bunch (particularly 92-94, the interiors got a little cheaper in 95-96) and much less prone to rust than the earlier ones.  The 4th gen Camry (97-01) is also generally highly regarded, which is why I'm a little confused about the trouble you seem to be having with yours.  The only real issue with them is they don't deal particularly well with neglected oil changes, but otherwise they generally last quite well. Ford Ranger or Mazda B2300 with the 2.3-2.5L, 4Cyl engine.  Made in some form from the mid-80s up through 2012 or so.  1997 and newer are particularly nice.  You don't need 4wd, and the RWD ones aren't ""manly"" so you can usually get them at a steep discount compared to the ones with 4wd.  Great little trucks. GM trucks and SUVs build from ~1999 onward with LS-based V8 engines.  Probably the most bulletproof engine available in passenger cars in the last decade. Diesel Mercedes, basically any model or year."
BuyItForLife,3c9k5a,FriedhelmBecker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:16:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the broad overview. You've made me feel better about possibly letting my Camry have another chance, but I'm still not sure I want to. It might be more affordable over time to get another used car that's a decade newer, like what you mentioned. (You might be interested to know my Camry has been stolen once!)  I'm driving a '09 Ford Ranger XLT right now. It's not pleasant to drive and it's too unsafe in foul weather. Regardless, it's being loaned to me so I don't have the option of sticking with this one.  I've owned a '90 Honda Accord and a '91 Acura Integra. I drove the Integra until I got the Camry. I'd like a '00s Integra/RSX or Civic. I'd be better off with a hatchback than a sedan. I'm also scoping a '10s Fit.  I knew the Jeep was a rough ride and bad on highways, but I'm drawn to the barebones, utilitarian design. It's something I get. Floor mats? Don't need those. Power windows? Don't need those. Cup holders? Don't need those. But I don't need 4WD either. I'd look into the Cherokee, but that's a very narrow sweet spot to find one from.  Thank you for the suggestion of the GM LS-based V8 engine vehicles."

BuyItForLife,3c9k5a,Dodobo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:21:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, new full synthetic oils last a long time, but I'm definitely in favor of following the auto manufacturer recommended oil change interval, plus maybe 50% max if I'm using a fancy oil or doing a lot of easy highway milage.  I take ""extended life oil"" claims with a grain of salt.  The auto manufacturer wants their car to keep working properly, whereas the oil company's marketing team wants you to buy their oil instead of the other guy's.  An oil change is, what, 40 minutes of my time, max? And even a full synthetic oil change costs less than a full tank's worth of fuel in supplies.  Older engines with worn parts allow the oil to get dirtier faster than new engines, so when my engine has 300K+ on the clock, I try to be pretty scrupulous about changing the oil regularly."

It has slots that a laptop and books slide into so it's awkward for carrying much else.   The laptop compartment is padded with thin foam that seems to be fairly protective.

If anything breaks on the motherboard you are pretty much fucked, because fixing it means replacing the whole board (about the same price as a new laptop).  The new models have fewer parts that are likely to break, but if they break it will be much more expensive to repair. The old models were much easier to fix.

Any other computer, and I could do something about it, but since it's a macbook,  I have to sit and twiddle my thumbs while she waits till she can afford the repair, and hopes it doesn't get worse before then.   I don't say this to bash apple. I say this as why I do not think of computers in general as worth ""paying homage"" to. Much like cars, there is a great deal of personal care  needed to keep a computer working properly, and there is an aspect of the quality ratings that is more down to blind luck than actual machining quality. I have an old dell computer, which because of my field (CS/Math), I had to upgrade. It's still a working computer, even the HDD works in it, without upgrade, but it was probably bought around 2007. It's a piece of junk computer and every other person who had that computer has probably replaced it by now, but I take care of my stuff, and I know quite a bit about computers to begin with, so there's mine, sitting in storage at my house, when everyone else's has failed.

Wigwam is a little cheaper and also decent. The jury seems to be out on People Socks. They are like 4 for $25, but have great reviews on Amazon.   I personally like Merino wool the best. There are also a lot of synthetic blends though.   Any of those brands are going to totally blow cotton Hanes, Fruit of the Loom, etc cotton socks out of the water though. After using good socks, I can't ever go back to cheap ones. It seems like a small thing, but it makes a big difference. Especially if you are on your feet a lot, or you sweat a lot.

Looking at the current version it appears to the same as what I have just cosmetically updated with colors and a different front/back pocket. I'm not a fan of the new look, but the bag I have I've used as a suitcase many times in the last sixteen years. Mine is dirty from all the times it has been in the luggage compartment on flights, but when it isn't full works as a carry-on if needed.   I have a Large Rolling Duffle I've used on many trips. I love it as much as my other Filson bags. I have an older model than this one, and this looks like it might address my one gripe with the bag. My version has smaller wheels that are inset to the base of the bag which make it hard to put the bag across gravel or cobblestones and not want to tip a bit. The larger wheels on this look like they'd offer more stability.   If you are not interested in canvas, a co-worker pointed me towards Red Oxx a few years back. I picked up a Flying Boxcar from them and it has held up as an over-the-shoulder duffle. I've checked it in many times for international travel around the globe and it seems new.

They're the fucking best at cutting through anything. They're pretty heavy, and the handles have worn off black paint. We've only had to sharpen and tighten them occasionally. They don't dull much at all to be honest. Have another pair that aren't as old, but still work just as well.   I think we have some newer pairs that work really well too. By newer, I realize I mean 50-60 years old. They're still shiny and new looking actually. Except for the ones with the orange handle. They're really thin and light, not really mean for anything heavy duty.  I don't have pictures cause they're packed up at my mom's place, but I googled some cause I was interested in it. Awesome album of speculation. Didn't think about how old some of our scissors were til now. Crazy.  I think most antique steel scissors would be a good buy.

My LG android is going on five years because it still does all the things I need it to do.

I'll get some more tomorrow if I think about it.  http://i.imgur.com/0UyJGxB.jpg  It's roughly a large classic briefcase in tobacco, 2007 era bag via certain characteristics.  The leather is so loose, broken in, relaxed, call it what you want, that it's like a giant puddle of leather.  The only way it can stand like that is because I store 2 towels in it while not using it.  Otherwise it just collapses on itself.  The handle, and slightly the shoulder straps and rear have a more darkish color simply from oils in your hands from using it.  Only their tobacco changes this much.  I reversed the two outer straps so the buckles wouldn't be on bottom and make noise every time I set it down on a hard surface."
BuyItForLife,3bkzeg,somedude456,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:45:07 2015 UTC,It looks awesome. It's a little disappointing that it's not holding its rigidity though.

BuyItForLife,3bkzeg,somedude456,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:47:23 2015 UTC,"Well it can sort of stand up.  The stitching holds certain creases but then again, it's leather.  No offense, but at least I wouldn't want it staying rock hard and firm.  I would say it has the characteristics of a canvas bag now.  Plenty of people pay good money for these older bags because they want them nicely broken in like this.  ....however, I'm only speaking for tobacco.  Their other colors will react different, and I can't say how loose and floppy they will/could get.  In terms of condition, I'm really holding off on that.  Their old tobacco, from what I'm told, is like the most raw version of leather.  It's like a sponge and soaks up any liquids.  Any conditioner on this light tobacco will darken it, and I like it nice and light."

Unfortunately that bag was lost / stolen.   SB didn't have much sympathy, basically told me to buy a new one, which I did (5/2014). I must say while it is still a good bag, the quality just isn't the same. Cheaper liner, wrinkles in the leather around the rivets, completely lacking any burnishing of the edges, and the outer leather is prone to cracking. It's obvious they significantly cut their production costs while keeping the price the same.  They don't really do anything extraordinary for their customers. Their support staff has an annoying schtick of:  Hi (Person),  (Employee name) here (insert mundane activity, such as sipping coffee) in (random Southwest State). (Lightheartedly acknowledge issue, and lightheartedly inform customer they are SOL).  I basically wanted them to give me a slight discount on my 2nd $600+ briefcase because I didn't need a new shoulder strap, since that wasn't lost.  Answer was no, you get to order a whole new strap, and you may use the old one as a fancy dog leash! I don't own a dog.  I understand that you can't cater to every little request, but if a customer has spent over $2,000.00 on items for themselves and gifts to others, perhaps you should throw them a bone every once in a while.  Edit: it's worth mentioning that I am very particular, and my current briefcase is by all accounts still a great bag that I still receive compliments on where ever I take it."

He's clearly doing well, and doesn't care if him being him makes him lose one sale.  He will still get by.  One of the more recent things I remember was a status he put up for the company on FB.  It was him telling the story of when he thought he saw someone with one of his bags at the airport.  He walked up and said ""Nice bag, is that a Saddleback?  The dude seemed confused about a stranger talking to him.  Something about he said no or didn't answer but Dave quickly mentioned that he designed the bag, and the guy quickly walked away.  It turned into 300 comments of people telling Dave that maybe that guy couldn't afford a real SBL bag, so he did buy a knockoff.  There were also tons of comments about how Dave didn't design the only leather bag ever made.  There were comments about how it was rude for him to insult someone who simply purchased from someone other than SBL.  All in all it was nothing but people complaining, some threatening to never buy another SBL item if this is how the owner looks down upon others, etc.  Overall, drama over nothing in my opinion.  I buy something for it's quality and looks.  I'm not going to change my opinion on a product if the owner comes off ever so slightly as a dick once in a while.

I did have a pair of shoes that were both sandal material and a leather top where the stitching came out. Chacos come with a five year warrenty and after the warrenty ends they can typically be repaired cheaply. The warrenty and repair team was excellent. They notified me that they couldn't be repaired and let me select a new pair of shoes from their online catalogue. It ended up working in my favor because I got to choose as style that I had though about purchasing. I think I'm up to four pairs now and the arch support is great on all of them.

BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,irbian,66,Mon Jun 29 18:17:33 2015 UTC,No nonstick pan is BIFL. The Teflon degrades and will be a health hazard. Every two or three years I get a new t-fal one. The same recommended by Americas test kitchen. If you want bifl pots and pans go for try ply aluminum and stainless steel by either calphalon or all clad. Mauvel makes great sauce pots.

Even if the yolk breaks, it doesn't stick. I just let it cook up for a second to harden and it will break free if I turn the pan upside down.  The major problem I think that people run into is that they use their cast iron for cooking onions or rice or potatoes and it leaves a little residue behind that the eggs can stick to.

BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,hermeslyre,39,Mon Jun 29 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"A cast iron pan is a lazy persons dream. All you do is cook in it and rinse it with warm water, dry it, and rub some vegetable oil on it. It's faster than cleaning any of my other pans. And all you do to ""season"" it is cook in it."
BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,asforus,6,Mon Jun 29 19:19:52 2015 UTC,"You don't even have to rub oil on it after it has a seasoning all round. Oil just acts as a barrier against rust, which is part of the seasoning layers job.  All I do with mine is rinse it out, and put it back on the hot burner to dry.  The worst thing that happens is when I stupidly forget the pan on the burner for too long, which can strip the seasoning in the center of the pan, so It's a good idea to dry the pan on a lower heat."
BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,nope_nic_tesla,2,Mon Jun 29 23:10:54 2015 UTC,Good deal. I'll have to try that cause the whole rubbing oil on it after does get a little annoying. Still better than using a sponge and soap though.

BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,hermeslyre,12,Mon Jun 29 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"People have all sorts of rules for cast iron. Truth is, if you use enough lipids while cooking, a hard metal spatula for scraping anything that needs scraped, and don't soak it, it'll be fine.   You can boil water in it to help clean stuff if you need to, like any other pan. Usually though, I just scrape it with the spatula, rinse it out. If it gets that bad. Paper towels are usually enough.   They're cheap. You can get one used. Try it out.   A lot of times, I don't even clean it with water. Just wipe it out with paper towels. Done.   You don't even really need to season it. Just use more lipids."
BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,tharagz08,3,Mon Jun 29 20:56:35 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything here. A nice flat edge spatula and paper towels are a cast irons best friend.   You don't even really need to season it. Just use more lipids.    True, but it's so easy to do on a raw pan that it doesn't make much sense not to imo. Mostly I'd be concerned with the outside of the pan. It'll season pretty slowly if you don't get that initial coat on, and raw iron rusts in minutes when exposed to water."

BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,composingsara,10,Tue Jun 30 11:38:43 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that it's really not that easy, especially at first.  Simply washing with water is not going to get that burn on food off the pan.  Then, you scrub the pan to get all burn on gunk off and then you have to re-season it.  Plus, many people have issue with only washing it in water, if it isn't scrubbed with soap it's not clean.  These are the things I hear when I talk to people about using cast iron."

It's just a pan."
BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,hermeslyre,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:28:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know why that happens. It's just a pan.   It happens because it has a completely different care procedure than the rest of the modern kitchenware. When you mess up cleaning any other cookware, you end up with greasy cookware.   With cast iron, you end up with either a rusty pan or partially oily gunk mess.   It's easy to care for, but it's not very forgiving once you mess it up."
BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,zoobox,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:08:14 2015 UTC,"But you can clean cast iron in any way you clean another type of pan. Soap and scrubbing works, but there's misinformation that some mild dawn dish soap is bad, let alone scrubbing. You can soak it in water if it has a full seasoning layer, but again misinformation that you should never soak cast iron. Or you can just wipe it out with pt. That's the easy part.  All differences in the care and upkeep stem from the pan needing a seasoning layer on it to be fully functional and practical. Like carbon steel.  But short of leaving the pan on a hot burner (or oven) for too long, or soaking it in vinegar for a couple hours, the seasoning layer is hardier than people think. And restoring most any damage is as easy as further cooking on it.  The differences to other common cookware seem too small to account for the fervency over cast iron maintenance. Maybe that's all it takes though."

Nonstick saves me a bit of time in the kitchen while the pan is good, but then it's frustrating during the last half of it's life when it's rubbish, then I have to spend more money replacing the damn thing.  Bought a DeBuyer carbon steel pan six months ago (modern cast iron is rubbish compared to carbon steel, and more expensive - look at chefs on TV, they all use DeBuyer carbon pans) and haven't been happier since. It's no more hassle than washing a non-stick pan, and it cooks way, way better - plus the nonstickiness is only getting better with time. Motherfucker is heavy though.

BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,zoobox,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:25:07 2015 UTC,"I realize you are asking for non-stick pans, but in my experience, even the top-tier Teflon pans start peeling within a few years. Cast iron is great, but there's also stainless steel.  It turns out that stainless steel pans work great if you dry them well and bring them up to temperature before adding ANYTHING to the pan. This allows the micro-fissures in the metal surface to close as the metal heats and expands. If anything gets in the little cracks and imperfections, they won't close up all the way, and then your eggs will be ruined. When preheated and well-oiled, a stainless steel omelette pan can give Teflon a run for its money.  I used to hate stainless, but after learning how to use it properly, I've ditched all my Teflon. I have no doubt that my s.s. omelette pan will outlive me -- definitely a lifetime purchase.   I just give it a good scrub and run it through the dishwasher when I'm done -- nothing fancy.  I've been consistently cranking out superb over-easy eggs for years on the same stainless steel pan. This is the same pan I used to curse before I knew how to use it."

My grandparents used bacon fat.  If you want to keep building up layers, season it a few more times, but you don't have to. Just cook bacon in it.   After the initial seasoning layers, you just cook in it. Cleaning is a snap too. If something is caked on to the pan, put water in it and simmer it. Once the water starts to bubble a bit, everything scrapes off super easy.  Contrary to popular belief, it's almost impossible to wreck a pan beyond repair. If you get rust, no big deal. Steel wool and season it. If you want to give it some more love, give it a very light oil after you cook."

So I could probably, with a lot of searching/luck, get a case of 50 or 100 pans for a few grand. Post-liquidation stuff tends to end up on eBay at slightly under normal retail prices, but eBay.. you never quite know what you're buying until it shows up..  Most of my cookware I buy in the January sales (roughly equivalent to Black Friday, but runs a bit longer - 26th december is the UK's biggest shopping day) where I've got some huge bargains - 40-50% reductions are common, sometimes more if you're quick.

BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,imperial_fuckton,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:39:09 2015 UTC,"Sure. They are, as the name suggests, a French company who have been in the cookware business for Some Time (oh. I just checked their webpage and it's only since 1830.. still)  They have a number of carbon steel ranges: Lyonnaise, Force Blue, Carbone Plus and Mineral B. These range in thickness from 1, 2, 2.5 and 3mm (I think). The Mineral B has some sort of coating which everyone washes off and seasons normally. I have a 30cm Carbone Plus and it weighs a shade over 2Kg.  The advantages over CI is that the steel pans are forged/machined rather than cast. That means the interior surface is dead flat, not a bit bobbly like a cast metal would be. That makes seasoning easier and quicker. Old iron pans used to be polished smooth before sale but they're often not these days. Personally I much prefer DeBuyer's handles to the little ones you get on most CI pans, but that's just my preference.  I'm told that, for the same area of pan, carbon steel is lighter than CI, but I don't have anything of the same size to compare. 2.5mm steel is thinner than the CI pans I do have, so it would make sense it's less weighty. It still retains heat like crazy, so that's OK, and I can just toss a 2Kg pan full of food, I'm not sure I could do that with anything much heavier. Again, could just be me.

BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,Suppafly,5,Wed Jul 1 11:21:31 2015 UTC,"In my experience, there is no nonstick but teflon and there is no bifl teflon.   When I'm at Ikea, i buy two of their nonstick saute pans for 5 bucks a pop. Years of use per dollar, i don't think anyone can beat it.  http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60139320/  Teflon's only dangerous when it's being made and when you overheat it. Forgetting a pan on the range is a good way to kill your birds."

BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,Samsonerd,10,Wed Jul 1 11:47:47 2015 UTC,"No such thing unless you are going to go down the cast iron rabbit hole. Just buy a new cheap one once a year or so. The green ceramic ones seem to work longer than the tfal type teflon coated pans, but I don't think they last forever either."
BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,Suppafly,3,Mon Jun 29 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"Shit, every year?! I got 9 out of my last set of t-fals, but admittedly they were pretty rough by then. I expect at least 5 years of solid non-stick performance out of my calphalons I just got. Hopefully more if I treat them well."
BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,yourmom46,3,Mon Jun 29 19:28:40 2015 UTC,i guess it depends on how much you care about health concernce if a non sticking pan looks pretty rough it definitly long has past the point of healthy use.
BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,38wizard47,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:30:31 2015 UTC,"Granted, we don't treat ours the best, but we get a couple of years at best of good non-stick performance and then a couple of more at an acceptable level, eventually they start getting a small area of burnt on stuff that won't remove at all or they start getting sticky from built up grease that won't wash off. Once they get to that point, the end is near. My wife always swore by t-fal, but we've had better luck with other brands. T-fal, in my mind at least, are the best of the worst, kind of a bare minimum for non-stick. Cheaper ones tend to have the coating scrape off, even if you baby them."
BuyItForLife,3bjbs2,3rd_Shift_Tech_Man,3,Mon Jun 29 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Had one of those green ceramic ones, name brand one.  It lasted a couple of years but then lost its ability to nonstick.  The coating didn't get scratched off, it just stopped working.  Now I""m back to my good stainless pans and they will last a life time and I don't have to worry about what utensils I use on them or cleaning methods.  They even go in the oven!"

The pros will expose any design or manufacturing weakness that would take you years to find, in weeks. They also will most likely have a local dealer they deal with for parts and service. The dealership network can be as important as the product itself when looking to keep power equipment for the long haul. You could have the best mower in the world, but when you need a belt or other wear item the people you have to deal with to get that part can make or break the whole experience."
BuyItForLife,3bjwi2,tjsean0308,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:10:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like I can offer some advice.  Almost any brand mower of a decent quality, such as what you will find in the $350 and up range will last for life with proper maintenance. Think about it, these engines are very basic. Filters, plugs, and winterizing is all that's really required.  There there are drive motors but most of those are closed systems requiring no maintence.  In short, the issue in a situation is more of a maintenance thing, than who's the best thing."
BuyItForLife,3bjwi2,Imalandscaper,0,Sun Jul 5 01:35:29 2015 UTC,"I would avoid buying name brand items from big box stores. One reason is the manufacturer likely will not warrant claims when purchased through them and will divert you to them. This is true for Husqvarna and John Deere. Honda is likely to be the same. I'd advise going to an authorized dealer. I would also advise staying away from their 3 speed transmissions, but I think they finally stopped making them. I do believe they make excellent power equipment but they are not flawless. I think their plastic decks and quad cut blade design is excellent. The metal bendy bits and lever plastics could use some extra material for extra robustness as I've broken a couple only to replace them with another that'll break again in a few years time. When my transmission died, er, failed to engage, I couldn't rationalize 120 for a replacement for a 600 dollar machine that ran for 6 years. This is in addition to replacing the carb (they didn't sell carb parts at all!) And the folding arm screw/knob wears down. As BIFL is concerned, consider a reel mower if self propelled isn't necessary. Else, just about any mower on the market will be fine as long as you take care of it: oil change, mid grade fuel, drain gas and run dry for winterizing, sharpen blades, adding fuel filter andreplace fuel lines every few years (ethanol deteriorates rubber). I'd buy something used if i was in the market for one but that's just me. Good luck and I hope this helps."

BuyItForLife,3bggeg,seanazul,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:12:58 2015 UTC,Agree on the sizing. Every so often I need just a tad bigger. I am surprised at just how much I can cram into it though.

BuyItForLife,3bggeg,kindredflame,2,Mon Jun 29 00:50:17 2015 UTC,"Seconded with the following caveats:    All of their stuff is gougingly expensive. My bag (classic briefcase) was $560+ dollars- you should only buy it if you've looked around and decided that this is the bag you will want forever.   READ THEIR WARRENTY. It covers less than you would think- they've changed some stuff about 'natural defects' in the leather, so you should be careful about that.  They will put this in your bag. >:-|   That said, they are gorgeous bags."
BuyItForLife,3bggeg,mavk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:23:28 2015 UTC,"I ordered one of those bags for my brother, because he's notoriously brutal on his stuff and I wanted it to last as long as possible. You're right, it's very expensive. But considering that he was going through lesser priced bags every couple years, and this one has lasted close to 5 now, it's been worth the price. I love the bag, and would love to have one for myself, but considering that the much lower priced bag I bought myself 10 years ago is still going strong, I can't justify it.  We found out the hard way about the special gift. I figure a lot of companies include ads for other products that may or may not be of interest to you. It didn't interest us, so we recycled it."

BuyItForLife,3bgixs,Gamerboss123,14,Mon Jun 29 00:55:36 2015 UTC,"It would help to know just how much into coffee you are. Blind, I'd say an electric kettle and a Hario V60 or aeropress."
BuyItForLife,3bgixs,boofnitizer,7,Mon Jun 29 01:40:44 2015 UTC,+1 on an electric tea kettle and aeropress. I've been using this setup for about a year and a half and it's been awesome. One thing that I did buy last year was a fine mesh metal filter(a few manufacturers make this accessory for the aerppress) as this helps with clean up.
BuyItForLife,3bgixs,Slb2525,2,Mon Jun 29 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"Another recommendation for this setup.  The Aeropress isn't entirely BIFL, but we got 3 years of heavy use out of ours before the plunger seal started to go.  For the price and size it's perfect for a dorm room and you can make individual cups."
BuyItForLife,3bgixs,j_j_b,3,Mon Jun 29 17:01:09 2015 UTC,I drink two or three cups a day. I'm not to picky about the type if coffee I drink. I just drink a lot if it.

BuyItForLife,3bgixs,bmzink,2,Mon Jun 29 02:15:48 2015 UTC,"Aeropress is so good. I also recommend Chemex glass (with wood handle). Aero press is fun because you really get involved in the process. Grinding beans, pouring, pressing, etc.; it gives you appreciation."
BuyItForLife,3bgixs,PriceZombie,11,Tue Jun 30 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd buy an electric kettle and a pour over. You'll spend $30 and have something far more durable than you'd get for 3x the price. You can make a great cup of coffee with a pour over.   Consumer grade drip coffee makers are generally pretty junky. The $30 ones have about the same life expectancy of a $120 one. 2-3 years.   There's a Bonavita that's supposed to be pretty good for about $150. It's an imitation (a well done one) of the Moka Master which you'd spend about $300 on. The Moka Master is the BIFL consumer drip coffee maker.  If you still want a drip machine, I'd just forget about going BIFL and get something that fits your budget and size constraints. They're all about the same quality unless you spend the money for the Bona Vita or the Moka Master."

BuyItForLife,3bgixs,LabRatsAteMyHomework,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:54:02 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just started getting into pour over coffee and saw this post. Listen, if you're going to do pour over with a V60, you will not get a good result with a normal electric kettle. Normal spouts pour too fast and end up swamping the coffee and possibly even knocking the filter out of place, and then you get grounds in the coffee and it's a mess.   So if you get V60 you can really control your cup and get really creative and that's AWESOME, but you'll need a gooseneck kettle. I recommend this adjustable Bonavita:   http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YR0F40?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01  It lets you set your temp exactly where you want it, which is awesome, but it's pretty expensive. You can also get other gooseneck kettles for less, but they are usually stovetop and not electric. That's fine, too, but you have to boil the water, then take it off the boil. Anyway, choice is yours, there.   If you get a Chemex or Clever Dripper or some other pour over method, word is that you don't need a gooseneck kettle and can get away with anything, and you'll get a more consistent cup of coffee with less effort. I didn't learn all of that before I ordered though, and just with the V60 that my local coffee roaster uses, not realizing how hard it actually was. It's fun once you get used to it, though.  All that said, definitely do some reading over at /r/coffee. Specifically read about a Moka Pot (which I want to try next) and the Aeropress. Both are good options.  If you just want a standard drip coffee machine that you can throw your ground coffee in and program to start up in the morning, get this:   http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EI7DPTY?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00  That's a killer machine for a cheap price. Best part about it is it uses a cone-shaped filter so your water hits the coffee and filters through all of it, versus a flat bottomed Bunn-style machine where some of the coffee never contacts the water. It also uses a really nice thermal carafe that keeps the coffee drinkably hot for 5-6 hours without using a hot plate and cooking the coffee like a glass carafe would."

BuyItForLife,3bgixs,PrototypeNM1,3,Fri Jul 3 23:01:47 2015 UTC,I'd suggest an electric kettle and a high quality french press. I bought a good quality one at Starbucks for about 25 bucks and it makes almost a liter of coffee. Delicious brew and quick to make. No need to buy filters either.

BuyItForLife,3bgixs,Central_Incisor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:20:27 2015 UTC,Yeah. Still much more work than wiping out my drip cone. The paper filters also make it easier to dump the grounds into the compost.   My French press is now used for infusing beer.

I bought my first french press to use in my college dorm room and discovered it was an easy way to make great coffee. And you'll find many other uses for an electric kettle. The french press's I've bought from Starbucks/etc. were not BIFL items. The glass breaks readily and I found they lasted an average of 14 months around me and my friends. The Frieling is solidly built and absolutely the kind of item that will last you a lifetime. Add a burr grinder (this Hario Skerton is a rock-solid BIFL-quality option that is very affordable), and you'll be set."
BuyItForLife,3bgixs,fishater,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:54:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think any electric drip coffee makers are truly BIFL, but I've used this Melitta coffee to make 1-2 pots a day every day for the past 3 years. Link    There's a spring mechanism to stop the flow of coffee if you remove the pot. If the pot isn't seated properly under the spring and left to run it will overflow. I don't think people realize this and think it's clogged or something, because there are always refurbished ones available."

I can say for a fact that the espressomaker is BIFIL, I got mine used and it's worked for four years for me. You can use it with standard coffee, but that leaves a lot of grit. If you plan on having people over for coffee, then I'd recommend a stainless steel french press or something like that."
BuyItForLife,3bgixs,Anustart15,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:06:36 2015 UTC,"This probably isn't the answer you're looking for but I think coffee makers are one spot where there's a diminishing point of return in buying a BIFL one. As in, you might just be better off with the fifteen dollar one. Use it like hell for five or six years and go spend fifteen bucks on another one. If you really want to invest in any kind of coffee making system beyond the simplest you're signing up for cleaning that the simple ones don't require, a lifetime of buying little flavor pods, or over spending on something that's got a popular or classy name on the front and doesn't do the job any better than the cheaper versions.

The replaced mouse is a 'Microsoft Comfort Mouse 3000 version 1a'. There's a picture here. That mouse is not the same as OP's.   All the replacements I tried (and I tried a few) had one or more of the following problems: buttons or wheel too noisy; physical wheel movement not smooth enough. Also, many mice feel too flimsy.  An exception - another mouse that did work well - was an old PS/2 mouse by Chic; but its lead was a bit too short and I didn't want to mess around with extension cables; also, ideally, I'd like the new mouse to work with Microsoft's 'Mouse and Keyboard Center' (because of the customisations which that software allows; as you can tell, the mouse is for use on a Windows PC).  In the end, I've managed to obtain a new instance of the original mouse, and I've ordered that (and it was quite expensive). Still, I'd like to know, anyway, BuyItForLife's mice recommendations.

BuyItForLife,3bcgak,Kyokenshin,3,Sun Jun 28 04:47:28 2015 UTC,Depends on what you use your mouse for. They have higher DPI mice nowadays but I think you'd be hard pressed to find one with a reporting speed higher than 1ms. These things are 9x faster. There's a reason people pay $100 for them still. Plenty of people who play games that rely on ridiculous reaction times use them.

BuyItForLife,3bcgak,Kyokenshin,2,Sun Jun 28 18:14:12 2015 UTC,Oh I agree. I use the next step up from this(intellimouse 1.1a?) with the thumb buttons and I bought a stockpile of them just because I really like the form factor.  From what I understand the only gamers that obsess over these things are ones that want quick reaction times and even then 1ms vs .01ms in humans is indiscernible. I think it's more of a placebo effect I just wanted to point out that there is something unique about these that you can't get with the newer mice.

While some shoes continue to look newish on the outside, once you wear the cushioning/support to the point where the shoe geometry throws your gait off, you start making yourself increasingly susceptible to overuse/repetitive motion injuries, which I guarantee you will cost more to fix than to prevent.   I'm cheap, and I struggle with tossing shoes that are not visibly worn, but after battling with IT band issues and plantar fasciitis from wearing worn shoes, I've changed my behavior.

Personally I have  Tbag (sissy bag) I leave on all the time, locked, and fill it up when I need to. And you can find those for under $100.

It is quite large (33 L) for the price, and the exact size I prefer to have, which is as large as possible without generating noticeable drag.  It has straps which can be put around the stomach and the torso, which reduces wobble. I use them only out of the city on the open road.  It has a rain cover folded in the top compartment, and a snow collar (double drawstrings for the main opening).  It has foam pads which minimize back sweating and make it more comfortable to wear.  It has one huge compartment where I can put all my gear (no space for full face helmet though). Great for groceries because you can just throw everything inside as fast as the cashier scans stuff.  Two side pockets - fits 0,5 l water bottle and candy bar in each  Bunch of loops, rings and what not, which I don't use, but have come in handy a few times.  It's made of a very heavy duty fabric, like a motorcycle jacket.  It has lifetime warranty, and in 2,5 years of very frequent use (and abuse), has stayed in the same shape as when I bought it.

At the moment I use a Vaude splash as my 25 liter (picked up on clearance 10 or more years ago) and a now discontinued chrome backpack as my 40 liter which I've had for a few years as well.

BuyItForLife,3b2glx,wee0x1b,3,Thu Jun 25 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"Well it's not just a cup, it is almost like a thermos you can drink out of. At home I have my Libby tumblers much like you would get served in a pub. It would be worthless on my commute which thanks to road construction and other issues, is 30 minutes. For camping weight and durability are factors, and stainless is just 1/2 oz over the weight of the plastic mug it replaced. Coffee goes cold fast in 50F weather with wind and I like to have more than a 3 minute span to drink a cup of joe. At work, the standard glass will have let ice water melt and glass sweat and last maybe 30 minutes, with isolation, I'll get at least 1/2 day and a refill of water or two. In the winter tea gets brewed.  I own a Kleen kanteen for these reasons.   As for cost, stainless has some unique properties, but it is also expensive and a pain to manufacture with, A plastic cup will cost less than glass which are both less than stainless. Vacuum isolation adds to that cost and there are no plastic mugs that employ this.   Your specific needs may not have any use for these properties, but if you want something that does, you are not likely to find a sub $20 container that will not chip/flake/loose its seal etc.   For me it is one of the best ways to make tea on the road (most gas stations provide free hot water), keep ice water handy, and over all keeps me buying from vending machines, which has probably saved me cash in the long run."

BuyItForLife,3aw3jr,someoneyay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:33:23 2015 UTC,Presonally I would suggest a Gillette Tech razor for travel. They are cheap and plentiful vintage razors. The three piece design allows they to be packed really small will very little chance of damage. They are fairly mild which I mind means a wider range of blades work acceptably in them and fewer ingrown hairs in exchange for a slightly less smooth finish.

Merkur Travel Razor would also be the about the same, but neither of these are the butterfly design.   Since most Safety razors are about the same build size, you may just want to buy a case, and upgrade to another three piece or butterfly design when you get a chance.   Personally, I use a Feather AS-D2 razor at home and the Parker for travel, but it is hard to justify spending the cash for a Feather when there are great razors for less than $50."

I don't know if I would say it is totally BIFL, but it is close. The downside is cleaning them. I ended up using canned air to clean them out as taking them apart is not a simple procedure. But at ~$15 it is hard to beat.  The one thing is that these can't push the volume of air that a larger fan can, and they don't pivot, and they aren't silent.

I have found that reasonably priced air mattresses get the job done (and yes, hold air) if you treat them nicely (don't drag them through the dirt and such) and close the fill points tightly.  They really are the Gold Standard in sleeping on flat ground comfortably.  That said, if flat ground isn't guaranteed, the suggestion of /u/emiliomuzz, is good as well.  A cot with a sleeping pad.  However, I wouldn't go with a mil-surplus model.  They're adequate, but they're narrow and short.  Cabela's sells an oversized cot that really is much nicer than mil-surplus.  Couple it with an oversized pad and life is good.    However, since I presume you're going to be indoors, I'd still go with an air mattress.  Just get an air pump to go with it, treat it nicely, and close the fill points tight!  For bonus points, buy a mattress protector to go over the air bed, this will eliminate the ""slippery"" feel of plastic under the sheets and make it feel more like a normal mattress."

I have worked at the store for almost 8 years and have seen the chassis designs change a lot, but the cookbox designs have changed very little aside from burner orientation changing from side to side to front to back(a good improvement imo). The spirit line are very solid grills, the only ""issue"" I've had in The past is that The studs that hold the side tables on can break if you lift The grill from the outside(side furthest from toolbox) rather than The inside. This has only happened a few times in several years, so I wouldn't say it's a big deal. The cookboxes have a 20 or 25 year warranty which I think says a lot about their product.

For 100 bucks LESS I got the Broil King and it included stainless steel grates and a dedicated rotisserie burner (plus motor and accessories) which the Weber didn't have.

BuyItForLife,3aqm0u,AnimeJ,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:46:12 2015 UTC,"I'd avoid anything Clarks if you're going to be in this kind of environment. They're just not designed to handle any sort of daily abuse. Great shoes, and if you can resole them they're absolutely bifl.  What I'd look into would be a pair of quality, comfortable boots that you can have resoled. The reason why that's what you want to be after is because the upper isn't a wear item; the sole/insole is. I've sold shoes to people who have worn the same pairs of dress shoes longer than I'd been alive when I was doing that by a decade. They'd wear them until the soles were worn out, then resole and press on.  So for what you're after, I'd look into lightweight boots aimed at people who work in maintenance fields, fixing jets/autos etc."

Not bifl, but about as much as any small electronics can be. The cable is replaceable.

I had them for 3 years for the exact same purpose as your friend - drumming. For the price, they're a great build and pack really solid, balanced sound. Noise isolation (instead of cancelling) keeps them cheap and simple. The different sized earbuds that came in the package were great, too.  Took me a day to find the best way to actually put them in the ear, but once I did, I haven't looked back."
BuyItForLife,3am0re,nottheprimeminister,16,Sun Jun 21 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"Sound-wise (if you guys are interested):  Bassy. Quite quite bassy. But in a good way. It's not the muffled Beats/SOL Republic $20 plastic mid-bass bloat but clean and juicy. Definitely among the best bass responses out there. The highs and the mids aren't very pronounced or detailed, but they do their job very well.  If you long for a more analytical sound with the exact same build and looks, it is worth investing a bit more for their SE315 cousin. They have balanced armature drivers, which give a faster, drier, more detailed response. You won't get the juicy bass that good dynamic drivers can offer, but the details will be more pronounced."

I am not the only one either, if you look up reviews of the 215 then you will see plenty of negative reviews, citing the lack of punchy bass as their main problem. Edit - should probably mention that the bass is there and very clear, but its missing the punch which most people are used to from consumer headphones.   I'm not knocking the 215's I have a pair which I constantly use in summer when I don't want to lug around my cans, but if you tell the average consumer that these are bass heavy earplugs they are going to feel a bit cheated when they actually try them out."

The riskiest motorcyclist has also changed from the 16-24 year old to the 55-70 year old riders in the last 15 years or so. The majority of accidents are no longer young kids on sport bikes, but rather retiring baby boomers on heavy harleys riding from bar to bar.

As they're ""just"" custom silicon tips, they're pretty robust to more traditional earbud usage too, like the gym/running, as they don't have as much weight outside the ear canal to bounce the housing out of place.  The custom tips (IIRC) that fit the HF5 also fit the ER4, where the latter has removable cables and a price uptick.  I wouldn't say the cables are as robust as some gym-oriented choices, but I haven't killed a pair of the HF5 yet, though one of the strain relievers is starting to fray...after 4 years. The tips are just as good as Day 1 though.  Can always do the tips on the lower-cost MC5, but no upgrade path there (which may be perfectly fine for OP's usage plans)."

The only issue I see with them is that the rubber will wear out over the course of about 6-8 months of regular use, to the point where they will fall off the headphones easily and pretty much just need to be replaced.

BuyItForLife,3am0re,WholeWideWorld,3,Mon Jun 22 05:59:36 2015 UTC,"Shure se215 and RHA ma750 are both significantly better sounding than anything Bose makes and cost between $100 and $130. They are also around ear so they do not fall out easily. However, if you find that Bose's tips fit you really well, you may find them to be more comfortable (not for me)."

BuyItForLife,3am0re,peteftw,3,Mon Jun 22 12:32:01 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with this.  I'm really, really rough on my headphones. I've had pairs that lasted less than a month, and the longest they ever made it was maybe five months.  My Bose last no less than a year, and they've never fallen out, even with intense working out. I know a year still isn't what some would call a great lifespan, but compared to everything else, it's a massive improvement. And like I said, I tend to be really rough on all my gear.  Not to mention how comfortable they are, they're real nice. They sound great too. I'm sure the audio nerds would say that they're terrible, but to the layman, they're excellent. You can try all you want to convince me that Klipsch is better, but they hurt my ears after thirty minutes or so."

BuyItForLife,3am0re,barbadosslim,13,Sun Jun 21 19:05:33 2015 UTC,You mean they didn't fit your ears.
BuyItForLife,3am0re,peteftw,-5,Sun Jun 21 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"Not only that, they can't fit in any ears.  Some earbuds are designed to be crammed into the ear.  Those earbuds are a soft plastic or rubber that can be jammed into the ear.  These earbuds do have a soft plastic bit, but it isn't a shape that can be jammed into an ear, regardless of the ear's shape.  The piece that fits around the back of the outer ear is also not shaped in a way that can force the speaker into the ear.  They are poorly designed earbuds.  Good earbuds (e.g. Klipsch) are designed to fit in the ears and form a good seal.  If they don't fit my ears, that's cool, because they come with multiple sizes.  Bose earbuds on the other hand are shit."

BuyItForLife,3am0re,rsunds,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:47:37 2015 UTC,"Look for oval shaped and angled tips. If you don't know what I'm talking about, buy a Panasonic Ergo Fit earbud, or look at the Apple Earpods. The part where the rubber thing that goes into your ear connects to the actual bud is both an oval and angled in the direction of your ear hole.  I'm surprised that the oval shape is so uncommon, because if you look at your ear them it's definitely not a perfect circle. The Panasonic Ergo Fit is the first pair to actually fit me. The Earpods are comfortable, but don't seal because they're just earbuds and not an IEM (they don't have the rubber seal). I'm not sure if this will solve all your problems but finding the right shape makes a big improvement, and this is a way of finding a more fitting shape without spending the money on custom tips."

Step one: Find any in ear headphones that suit you based on specs/price/looks etc.  Step two: Buy a cheap leather punch set with different diameters.  Step three: Get some 3M ear plugs. In my experience the yellow foam cylindrical ones work best.  Step four: Remove rubber ear bud tips and measure the diameter of the fixture.   Step five: Use the closes punch size (always choose the smaller if in between) and punch a hole through the ear plugs.  Step six: Attach the ear plugs to the ear buds.   Now you have earbuds that wont fall out and also cancel some background noise, which has the added benefit of allowing you to listen to music at a lower volume, saving your ears from long term damage.

That's a combination that just doesn't come cheap. Not to mention all the R&D that goes into designing the things.  They're worth every penny though, if you spend a lot of time sitting at a desk/computer.

They are easily the most comfortable and configurable office chairs we've used.  But... I'm not going to go as far as saying that you are 100% guaranteed to love a Leap without trying it out.  High end office chairs tend to be polarizing.  As an example, one of the chairs that we tried prior to the Leap was a set of Aerons.  I used Aeron back in the ""dot-com"" boom days in 2000 and loved it.  Well, that was then and this is now.  Our bodies have essentially changed enough that sitting on the Aerons for extended periods of time was painful.  I had honest to goodness numb arms and legs at one point.  We returned those and got a set of Leap chairs and they have been nothing less than perfect since day one.  My point, though, is that both of those chair models have a large fan base who think that their preferred brand is nigh perfect... yet there is a significant subset of people who would consider that chair to be torturous.

This is much better for my back in the long run especially for how much I use it, but it's been a very difficult habit to break.    The steelcase has a flat seat pan and in all honesty I probably would have purchased one if I found a V3 at a reasonable price (could only find V2s)."

Straight up cast iron is great but the coating for le creuset makes rust/soap/seasoning something you don't have to think about and you don't have to think about acidic foods reacting with the metal over time (like tomato sauce for example).  My understanding is that they last for about 20-30 years or regular use before the enamel starts to chip or wear off on the bottom. It has happened a little on one of mine but I don't care I still use it.  also, the handles are officially rated safe/not melty up to 450 but I have had them in the oven for extended periods over 500 because that's how I roll motherfucker."

However, and I'll probably get downvoted for this because of reddit's near fanatical love affair with cast iron pans, but they are high maintenance.  First, it seems that a lot of people believe that cast irons are easy to clean because they simply don't clean them. They scrap off any left over food (maybe with some kosher salt) and call it a day. I'm not saying it is wrong to do this, but it isn't cleaning the pan. Cast iron isn't some magical element that is immune to getting dirty.  Second, it isn't ""insanely easy to clean."" You are thinking of a non-stick pan. As long as you haven't damaged the surface of a non-stick pan, it is really hard to get anything to stick to it in a way that doesn't come of ""insanely easy"" with some soap and a sponge. It is much easier to get food stuck with a cast iron. Plus my non-stick requires zero maintenance.  Third, my stainless steel pan, while significantly harder to clean than my cast iron, requires absolutely zero maintenance.  There is no doubt that I spend more time on my cast iron pan not cooking than I do with any of my other pans. They occasionally need to be reasoned, which while not labor intensive, takes a long time, and they are orders of magnitude harder to actually clean than non-stick.  Cast iron is great, I love it. But the pans take far more work than any other pan. That's not to say it is hard work, just more work."

If you have someone in the family burn a bunch of sticky crap to your skillet, leave it in the sink, or who regularly leaves wet pans / lids on top of it, then you are probably better off just using some enameled ceramic or stainless pans / skillets instead.

The trick I learned (I'm sure this is probably written all over the internet and a ton of books) is to flip it as soon as you pour in the batter.  The hottest side up, so that side cooks while the other heats up and browns and then flip back to brown the other side (the original hot side).

I find that it penetrates the soil better and is especially useful for removing pecan and oak seedlings. You really can't go wrong with either one I just wanted to state my preference.

BuyItForLife,3amh02,speedzombie,5,Sun Jun 21 17:52:46 2015 UTC,You don't know where or what the chair off craigslist has been through.  Why are they selling it? How many times did the last guy jerk off in it?  With the new one you know and you can return it if you don't like it.

BuyItForLife,3amh02,Janununuh,2,Sun Jun 21 18:42:41 2015 UTC,"The only reason to purchase from Craigslist would be to save money. Since it will be a gift anyway, it might be worth it to buy new and get a warranty/peace of mind.  It's up to you at which point the savings outweigh the risks, $400 is still a lot of cash. I've been shopping for a new office chair as well, and just bought a Herman Miller Mirra chair for $30 at a thrift store and couldn't be happier. But if it were $300, I don't think I would have gone for it, even though that is a ~70% savings."
BuyItForLife,3amh02,nuovo_donna,2,Sun Jun 21 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"I bought a used one 8 years ago off Ebay for 400 and it's held up perfect.  If you want to go that way, you might want to look for someone that is selling out an office full of them.  If you luck out and get one that was in a conference room or something it might only have been sat on for a couple hours a day and hardly used at all.  Mine looked new when I got it.  It still looks really good The seat mesh isn't hard to clean.  They do tend to collect a lot of dust in all the nooks and crannies though."
BuyItForLife,3amh02,tango_41,2,Mon Jun 22 14:57:14 2015 UTC,"Totally worth it for the warrantee support alone. I bought an embody chair and two monitor arms about a year ago and one of the monitor arms arrived missing an adjustment screw. I emailed them and asked for a replacement screw and they sent me a whole new monitor arm, which retails for about 350 bucks.  Can't say enough about the level of customer service.  Also, I'd recommend one of the newer chairs by Herman Miller like the sail or the embody; the Aeron is very chic in terms of name recognition but the design is over a decade old.  There are newer, more comfortable chairs by Herman miller for around the same price point.  If cost isn't a consideration, pull the trigger on an embody; you won't be disappointed."

BuyItForLife,3aixww,geeeffwhy,7,Sat Jun 20 17:18:22 2015 UTC,"I've had a beard more or less constantly for about half my 30 year life. It is (currently) the sort of beard that seems to force people on the street to comment, request to touch it, and puppies to chew upon it. I've worn it in a number of styles and lengths, groomed with a range of tools and methods, and even briefly produced my own line of beard product.   So there are a few issues. One, if he's going full natural, he may really be in it for the lack of grooming required. On the other hand, if he's fond of attending to it, the most important items are a brush/comb, and a pair of barber's scissors.   For the brush, note what sort of whiskers he's sporting. For a kinky, 'froish beard, a wide toothed pick is wanted. Badger or other stiff bristle, natural fiber is pleasant for those with straighter face-hair. For the last 8 or nine years I've been using a cheapo con-air flexi-brush-comb thing I got at CVS. It feels great.   For product, I can recommend pure argan oil, perhaps with some additional essential oils for scent, if you're into that. The argan though, is lovely and Iight, makes the whiskers manageable and soft. Mm.   Others will be able to recommend trimmers if he's going for the short beard, but I always recommend scissors, especially to new beardos. It's not much slower, and works great for any length, gives you far more control."
BuyItForLife,3aixww,ASordidMind,5,Sat Jun 20 19:19:41 2015 UTC,"A good trimmer is pretty essential, I've seen/heard good things on Wahl, something along these lines maybe (you could definitely look into a more premium model though) this guy.  A good beard oil/conditioner is lovely, keeps the beard healthy, soft, and smellin' great, e.g. this, find one that has an aroma that you/he both would enjoy and hit that up.  A small pair of scissors might be a good idea too, just for little touch ups of rogue hairs and such.   You could also look into a quality dopp kit (seems like a BIFL staple), something with leather and canvas, if he is into such things. Would be a great way to bundle everything together"
BuyItForLife,3aixww,razor3210,3,Sat Jun 20 17:54:30 2015 UTC,I own that trimmer (or did) and I reallllly didn't like it. The guard was a pain and it pulled hairs as much as cut them. I have this one Phillips. Might be a bit better and its not too expensive :)

BuyItForLife,3aixww,ASordidMind,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:17:35 2015 UTC,"From just the length standpoint, maybe not worth it... BUT overall, I love my beard ritual. You find one that smells great, putting it on isn't a chore, it is part of a therapeutic grooming process. Takes maybe a minute to apply some, and then you are left with a great aroma right under your nose.   My lady bought me a beard oil a while ago that was largely composed of jojoba oil, and some sage and vetiver essential oils. This one ran out for me, so I just bought some jojoba and added some essential oils of my own choosing, now I have this great custom lightly musky/woodsy scent.  I say give it a shot, it might even encourage you to get a more robust beard on ;)"

Good shears are deffinatly BIFL.  A good beard comb, many are made of wood so they resist static found on etsy,amazon. beard oil/balm/conditioner for sure. There are a million brands out there now of this stuff. It really boils down to personal preference. I would start with beard butter and beard wash from maestro's. It is relativly cheap and available at CVS. You may also be able to find clubman brand beard products at the beauty supply or rite aid. For higher end stuff check out bronson soap company.

Battery powered trimmers tend to be hit or miss, and I hate that finding one I love immediately men's facing the fact that it will only last a few years.  He also needs a small, sharp pair of scissors for rogue hairs and shaping. A good mustache os surprisingly hard to maintain, and God help you if you want a clean point without daily maintenance.  As for beard oil, I don't use it. I do shampoo my beard daily and ha e recently taken to using a baling soda/apple cider vinegar wash routine. Dissolve baking soda in water, wet beard with warm/hot water, worm in baking/soda and water, gently massaging. Allow to sit for a few seconds. Rinse with warm water. Shampoo as usual- a moisturizing shampoo is good. Personally, I use my regular shampoo plus a few drops of vitamin e oil. Then massage apple cider vinegar in, let it sit for a few seconds, rinse with cold water.  To be clear, I don't do that whole routine every day. I do it a few times a month, and I do it to my hair at the same time. Once a month I also do a mask of equal parts olive oil and raw honey with a few drops of vitamin e oil (baking soda, rinse, apply mask, let sit for 30 minutes, shampoo until mask is gone, rinse with apple cider vinegar and cold water, massage follicles for 5-10 minutes). My hair is thicker, softer and stronger. My beard has zero problems with flakes, oily buildup and is far more manageable, and always feels insanely soft now.  A lot of people think that beards need to be treated like beards, as if they're something unique. Not true. Beards are hair. Guys need to learn to pamper their hair as much as they pamper their beards, and quit needlessly wasting money in doing so. Most of the money needed for a beard is in a good pair of corded clippers, a good pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and of course whatever is needed for routine maintenance of the clippers."
