My diagnoses gave me some insight into what I had been suffering through all along. Death came knocking. Even a year being into my diagnoses, I had not clear sight of reality. It's a rough road to recovery. Im finally able to figure out how to manage my symptoms. It is still all patch work. I take it a day at a time, trying to figure how what works and what doesnt. Everyone is different, they must find their own way to manage symptoms."
schizophrenia,3e5a2b,joesavu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:37:12 2015 UTC,"I think every time in my life where symptoms got the better of me came with it  the end of one period and the beginning of a new period. With every episode came a mind altering change in perception or some new insight. Things are never the same way as they were before when things were normal. Then normal becomes the periods of stability in between episodes. For many it's seemingly life long and doomed to repeat over and over again. Or not.   This is what's going to happen, little by little enough time will pass where you will be able to comfortably say ""I'm glad that's over"". You might always get symptoms here or there but on meds and  treatment  you shouldn't derail again ever really.   One thing you should keep in mind about accepting yourself is this, you we're probably like this since all of your life. Being given a diagnosis just puts a name on something you were long before you knew it ought to have a name."

Delusions are like having bottom up faith. I feel lucky to be part of the few who can actually claim to have faith aka the believing in the unknown because if you read the book the Autistic mind you will probably be able to catch the metaphors and be able to associate them to help build your foundation.

I haven't really had any treatment + no medication and I'm doing pretty good and my life is slowly getting itself back on track...   I just have to accept it now. I just have to get on with it because it is very, very likely I will never accept medication or treatment (too paranoid + untrusting of health professionals) and hope that what needs to happen for me to live well sort of falls into place.

schizophrenia,3e3tim,cantremedythis,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can necessarily say they are an extension of yourself. If you entertained yourself with conspiracy theories or politics for years and then started hearing voices you might think it was a conspiracy or related to the government. Those conspiracy theories came from another persons mind, possibly someone with a mental illness as well. I don't see my voices as an extension of myself, they misrepresent who I truly am, they bring up garbage I've never believed in but have been exposed to throughout my life and on the web.  It's like muffled vowels, consonants, and syllables. Not enough information to clearly hear what the word is for sure, but enough information for the brain to make a guess at what the word is. I theorize that trying to understand the voices exercises a part of the brain that is guessing at what they're saying, making the voices more clear and complex. Mine started as single words and tormenting gibberish, I kept trying to understand, then it turned into phrases, sentences, and reoccurring themes. The word schizophrenia tends to repeat a lot, I think due to the syllables and unique qualities of the word, other words have similar qualities. I notice the voices also tend repeat ambiguous phrases as well or weasel words which can create new delusions with whatever is on my mind at the time. I'm much more critical of media and entertainment due to possible influence, but I am a bit of an information addict which doesn't help with delusions and loose associations."

They're obviously not like shower conversations. I've never heard the assumption that they have to be clear. If you hear something at the very edge of your perceptions, you sometimes listen ""harder"", and this can be one of the ways that people get into cycles of paying attention to ""what is being whispered about them"".

Docters can only observe and use their textbooks which are still not adapted to the current knowledge that psychotic symptoms are more fluid than previously thought.  That being said you have shown to be vulnerable for experiencing psychotic symptoms and you should set up your life accordingly meaning no drugs, getting enough sleep and setting up a treatment plan if shtf.

schizophrenia,3e1ifn,Reddon666,2,Tue Jul 21 11:00:59 2015 UTC,"I was very similar. Not quite the same, but similar.  I experienced low-level schizotypal traits throughout my life, then suddenly had a sharp onset of negative symptoms, a slowly developing exegesis that looked in many ways like a persecutory delusion and sometimes caused very strange behaviour (""I can't walk on sidewalks! That's conformism, and the Cabal will eat my soul!""), and eventually several short but painful spurts of full-blown delusional psychosis (no hallucinations ever). I made a few posts here, some of which were very scattered.  None of this was ever actually recognized or diagnosed as being schizophrenia or any related disorders. Some of it was aggressively covered up and what leaked through was assumed to just be me being weird (see that my default mental state could be diagnosed as schizotypal personality disorder if not for the situation described below, and also that I was diagnosed as autistic in childhood, so bizarre behaviour is expected to a greater or lesser degree). I was never prescribed any antipsychotics and I would not have taken them if I was.  Slowly, my crisis burned itself out. I then cut contact with an ex who was diagnosed as schizotypal and had a very hard belief in a medical model of mental illness and believed I had full-blown schizophrenia. I looked back about a month after doing so and realized I was totally out of crisis mode. Both my positive and negative symptoms were shadows of their former selves.  I am not psychologically normal, not by any stretch of the imagination. The aforementioned exegesis that I call the Cabal is still very important to me -- but in a totally different way. I don't believe in absolutely ridiculous ways because of it. I couldn't even be called mentally ill by a reasonable psych these days, because all the dangerous and negative behaviours and thoughts left as soon as my living situation improved. I went from a rapid descent into schizophrenia to a stable person with many eccentric yet benign views.  Evading medical notice differentiates my situation from yours -- but having much more serious symptoms also did. I will try to keep my personal (negative) views of psychiatric drugs from clouding my response, but it's indisputable that the current guidelines are to keep people on them for longer than they may need and the view of mental illness as inherently chronic is inaccurate. I think stopping them in your current situation is your best possible option.  For any support on the topic, check Mad in America and the Icarus Project. You may not agree with everything either group has to say -- they are indisputably against much of the psychiatric institute as it stands today, and though their criticisms are oft legitimate there are also very understandable reasons to oppose them. What is definite truth, however, is that both groups are made of many people who have stopped heavy psychiatric drugs and can relate to the idea of mental illness being temporary at least some of the time."

I think intelligent psychotics can have a certain level of self-reflection while those that are below average IQ are less likely to respond to CBT. There is a stigma about psychotics in how we are supposed to be low functioning, mental vegetables:   A great many psychotics could have learned some basics about critical thinking and experienced a growth in intelligence/learning, but perhaps institutions wanted to keep them in a dependent state.  I do not escape myself: I am what I am and I be what I be. I stopped apologizing or acting like a male of my social status in regards to my upbringing: ""nice white people who grew up in homes where protocol was everything"".   I cope well because I practice exercises learned through formal meditation as well as habitual mindfulness practice. CBT exercises are now ingrained in my moment to moment experience.   I do what I have to do. I know my duties. I know what people think of me. I know my history. I accept what I have done and not done. Still, resentments exist, and paranoia bubbles up; I check myself and see how I am feeding on my own memories, chewing the bone when there is no meat left on it.   I am unique in how my brain has influenced my actions and basically produced a middle aged social pariah. I tell my Pdoc that nobody likes me, and that is just how things are. Human beings are noise, and so I tolerate people as business associates.  I have sociopathic traits which fold into a paranoid personality disorder, further folded into ""schizophrenia"" as a container (diagnosis from 5 years ago).

The voices were so clear and the way they talked was just disturbing. When they started commenting on commands they were giving me I willingly checked myself in and was so disorganized I couldn't remember the name of the president."
schizophrenia,3e0l5n,shesgonegilligan,3,Tue Jul 21 01:51:52 2015 UTC,I hear two. Very dark and groaning like something over a radio mixed in with a vocoder of some sort.
schizophrenia,3e0l5n,donkey_supreme,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"Mine differ. Usually mine are in my head, sometimes it's one voice, sometimes it's 3 ( I'm sometimes one of them, except I'll say things that I don't mean or want to say. It's almost like my ""dark side"" I suppose. It used to just be one voice (a girl) and it would just be commentary on what I was doing. Recently a new voice developed (a man) and my own voice. It's hard to explain, but since it's in my head, I can hear what they sound like without actually knowing what they sound like because they are thoughts. (I know that sounds crazy) Recently they've gotten mean and critical, telling me im stupid and to kill myself and I'd only feel better if I put myself out of my misery and I'd be happier if I did so. They also warn me when I'm ""entering a dangerous situation"" ( I'm paranoid type with bad delusions of persecution) and theyll say things like ""don't go in there"" ""someone's in there"" ""don't do it"" ect. I'll hear outside voices too occasionally, but they're very mild. Like shouts (usually a man) or music playing vividly, or a woman's voice saying a word or two that I usually can't make out.  I'm 21 now, and just recently got diagnosed (onset) but I've had the little girls voice in my head since i was very young and never knew it was something bad until I was hospitalized this year, I always thought everyone had someone in their heads that will talk to them.  Sorry I rambled a bit, but hopefully some of my information will help you."
schizophrenia,3e0l5n,ndestinym,3,Tue Jul 21 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"Mine are new music, random sounds, words, singing, random people's voices. Sometimes I get to see them too. Mine arent audible 24/7, most of the time is when I sleep. My voices havent gotten strong yet, they may become more audible as I fall deeper in the rabbit hole. They dont hinder me in anyway. I find it pretty fascinating."

I have another I call the confuser he yells out my name or insults from a distance. the third one I call effects it makes strange sounds and likes to spook me like creeks and groans. the only way to tell they are hallucinations is no one is around, I have searched sometimes in afraid when I look for them, like what if I find a hallucination casting hallucinations  but thank god I that hasnt happened."
schizophrenia,3e0l5n,moonhalo74,2,Tue Jul 21 07:46:35 2015 UTC,"It's like a group of people sitting in a small echoing office conversing. One of them does 80% of the talking in an annoying tone. They comment and criticize everything I'm doing or thinking trying to aggravate me. I have my own voice or thoughts (that don't vocalize in my head) which counter them or I use to focus on other tasks. I can ignore them most of the time, but sometimes they get to me and make me emotional. I wonder sometimes that maybe I get emotional and then get fixated on the voices instead of the voices causing the emotions. I once started hearing voices in a dream, it was so frustrating waking from that."

There are angry voices, horny voices, mean voices, lean voices and killing machine voices. Name it, there is a voice of it.   It's usually like my inner monologue which I can not control but sometimes they have conversations with each other. They most often than not speak to me, tell me I'm being followed, spied on, tell me I'm shit, full of shit, that I'm just faking it, they berate me, tell me I have no friends, that I can't trust my family, that my thoughts are being broadcasted or that others can read them, And so on.

Anyway, I once was asking my friend if he had something similar, he said , ""yeah, the Harsh whispers, is what I call them"". I found it the perfect name.

schizophrenia,3dzfxp,Kristouph,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:39 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of symptoms that are shared by tons of mental illnesses. And the diagnoses change every ten years or so. Don't get too hung up on labels (easier said than done, right! Hehe).  I would say you are probably diagnosed well. If you moved to another town and got a new doctor and therapist and script doctor etc,-- you may get a different diagnosis.  The first step is to be honest with your shrink. You may get another label, whoopie. You may also get better drugs for you. Drugs vary person to person, and for schizophrenics, the thing they do best is generally reduce the level of anxiety that causes psychosis, and reduce the level of random anxiety and intrusiveness that stops a schizo from dealing with their symptoms well. Whatever that means. Neurotransmitter inhibitors, for the win. Etc.  It's entirely possible that your diagnosis has been given to you because the suitability of meds (in your doctor's opinion) fit that diagnosis best. Some straight-up schizo drugs may totally not work well with some of the drugs that you're being prescribed.   The first step is to be honest with your shrink. The reason everyone here says ""Talk to a doctor"" and ""We don't know what you have"" is because there's a bit of expertise involved in setting someone up with meds and dosages. We could not possibly do the job of a good doctor. We could only do the job of maybe a crappy doctor. So, be honest with your doctor. Definitely don't be afraid to go to your doctor about any of this. Best to you. Coping is hard."

One of my clients after mentioning my condition blurted out, ""OMG AND YOU ARE DRIVING ME?"" At the end of the trip she mentioned that I was the best driver she had while taking an Uber. I think I got rated down for trying to sling my business/website, but I don't give a fuck because they were mentioning charity events and donating large amounts of money to people with autism. I suppose since I am feed up with the education system, I don't qualify to study stuff even though I am producing educational content for peoples or kids with autism.    Have you read the Autistic Brain: thinking across the spectrum? Temple Grandin has a 20% smaller part that controls movement, so I guess she'll never be an Olympic Skier expect in this book you will experience a tidal wave of positive vibes. Like, ""Ok, so what if that part of my brain is 20% smaller. Who cares because other parts are 50%-200% bigger than neurotypical people."" nature and nurture ya know? so why try to make a weakness into a strength because it will probably never be worth honing it because society thinks it is important for your development.

This is a great example of an incorrect possibility that could result from applying half the possible data to a logic problem. I think basically that every schizo has thoughts like this, but generally the logic is usually faulty when you end up with a faulty conclusion.  I am not sure I am actually delusional, after 35 years. However, it has nothing to do with the fact that stopping mind drugs will generally cause your mind to freak out and start fucking up.

It is still more, however, than being on medication. These are just statistics. Doctors really don't know if you'll do fine off medication as some can do well and some don't do well.

Here is what you do:   Back up your data that you want to keep. Wipe the drive and reinstall the OS. Create a USER account for you to use. Use the ADMIN account never, and only elevate privileges when necessary in the USER account. Enable AppLocker (Parental Controls). You may have to read the documentation on it to use it effectively, but it is essentially a whitelist of what programs are allowed to run. Encrypt things which are important.

It just upsets me when she says that because when she got the car for me, she made a big show about how it was my first car, how I'm growing up, and then started talking about all the sentimental value my first car was going to hold for me... So I guess when I first got it I chalked it up to being able to use it a lot more. I.e., I'm not allowed to have non-family members in my car, which is one of the main things I was excited about when I got it. Blah blah. I'm sorry, I sound whiney.

Again, it is probably a reflection of her concern for you. The Internet is full of things and she has a duty to protect you.  Of course, her method seems to be ineffective.

Other than that I've been in situations where others- even people who were ostensibly friends, would do things to deliberately mess with my head for the sake of getting their shits and giggles.   Beyond that I'm done with drugs, but the year before I lost it I was on a lot of them; I'm pretty sure a combination of drugs and creeps were what pushed me over the edge- that the combined stress triggered the latent schizophrenia. I generally assume drugs are a type of major stressor for the body, which is part of why they cause problems.  As for school, I've had tons of trouble with it; the meds I'm on make it really hard to focus and concentrate, not to mention they make me tired, but I've found a few cheap herbal remedies that fix that and don't interact with the meds.

The right medication can reduce this and maybe even eliminate the problem. However, the opposite is true. Without treatment these symptoms may get worse.  Whatever is happening in your life, whatever the consequences you think may occur, none is more important than telling a medical professional and seeking treatment. Even if it turns out to be too much stress, not enough sleep, etc. It's not worth not checking out."

Most of them do seem to focus on stuff also common to anxiety disorders. I guess it's easy to confuse things like dissociative states, over analysing, quasi-paranoia or whatever with low level psychotic symptoms and assume the worst. Especially with the way some of those symptoms overlap.  I just watched the first 4 episodes of Mr Robot the other night. That definitely paints a murky border between anxiety and borderline psychotic states. I wonder if that's gonna produce a sudden burst of people fearing sz?"

I know that most of mental disorders are treated with medication   Most symptoms are ""treated"" with medication. It is important to recognize this. Psychiatrists do not prescribe drugs the same way other doctors do. They focus only on symptoms. There is no etiology understood and how the drugs work are often misunderstood or ignored.   if you guys think a psychologist can help through some sort of therapy   I think the first thing is to realize there are no easy answers with schizophrenia. The drugs are very unsatisfactory and the disorder is not understood at all.   Also, people with schizophrenia are real people going through something most people cannot imagine.   The typical experience is to have a doctor ignore all this, write a prescription, and then ignore the person's feedback on how the drug is affecting their life.   I know it's very hard on the patient and the family so I am very eager to help any way I can.   Just remember there are no easy answers and it can be a very stressful and isolating disorder."

I know that I will never fully understand what the person is going through, but again that happens I guess with any type of disorder, also I know that this one is a severe one. My biggest concern through this whole experience was how effective is the treatment through words, and by that I meant therapy because what I see is that most patients just cope with their symptoms and anguish though medication. I know that words won't make the voices or the visions go away as the medication can, but I was wondering what good can it bring in the life of the patients and that's where I would like to contribute."

She also brings in my wife from time to time to make sure everyone understands important things and to make sure we're all on the same page.

This info was great, it really gives me an idea of how to work or how to approach patients going through the same. Also, it's very helpful for me to read this because I thought that maybe therapy for this kind of disorder wasn't helpful enough or even at all, it was all medicine. I know that the medication is quite strong so sometimes it's difficult to introduce therapy when the person is all sleepy or cannot function well, not trying to generalize just saying what I've seen so far. Sometimes I think that with the right therapist wonders can be accomplished and what you just told me corroborates that so I cannot thank you enough. You will become a survivor but in order to achieve that you must keep fighting! Stay strong."
schizophrenia,3dvgxk,mostslowest,2,Tue Jul 21 02:04:55 2015 UTC,"Echoing other comments, psychiatrists treat symptoms with medications.  Other factors of mental health disorders can be managed with therapeutic intervention.  The decision to use any type of therapy (e.g., the aforementioned CBT and DBT, or even ACT, MET, REBT, etc) depends on a number of factors, including the patient/client themselves... for instance, insight-based therapy would not be good for someone with poor insight.  That being said, individuals suffering from schizophrenia for a long time can experience a number of psychological complications that can impact the delivery of some therapies.  Individuals with more severe presentations who are experiencing problems with ADLs, severe negative symptoms, or concerns with prosocial interactions can benefit from structured social skills training.  The therapist can assess their abilities therein and determine a more long-term treatment plan and modality from there."

I think that perhaps this illness (which is genetic) is some sort of spiritual test or gift. I am a spiritual person and it helps me get by.   I think we are special and not to be shamed, ridiculed, or persecuted like we are. You also, like me, have a gift for writing, perhaps you can journal and document some of your thoughts and feelings. You never know... A loved one or someone else in the future could want to read it...   Also try reading fiction. Reading science fiction really helps get me through.

I also believe that her visual hallucinations slightly decreased during this time but I'm not sure because at this point we didn't know she was having them. We then went to Risperidone 3 mg per day with no success at all.  Her doctor then switched her to Invega (Paliperidone) 1.5 mg per day. It works wonderfully for her.  No voices or visual hallucinations at all after 3 days and has continued for 4 months now.  She did still have periods of depression though and that has been corrected with Lamictal and Wellbutrin.

As for emotions, it's a bit more tricky. I have to be alone to sort them out, and I have to constantly pay attention to my state of mind. I just ask why I'm angry or scared and try to defuse it or distance myself from the emotion. No one did anything wrong, nor am I affected so I shouldn't feel this way. As a result I've grown a bit detached from my feelings. I may still feel those emotions, but I just don't react to them. Try not to anyway. It's kind of hard to do.

It's sad that your parents don't acknowledge that you're struggling with mental illness. Is there anyone besides your twin brother who you can reach out to for support?   You might feel powerless that your psychiatrists told me that meds won't help. Not everyone dies without meds, but people with schizophrenia do have an increased suicide rate. I would say that it's difficult to live with psychotic symptoms, but there are people with varying degrees of schizophrenia who can cope. What do you think about finding another psychiatrist to help you look for a balance that treats your symptoms without side effects that wreak havoc on your body?  And, it's not okay for a psychologist to tell you that you should kill yourself to spare you your suffering. You deserve to be treated with respect and to be treated right. Do you have suicidal thoughts currently?  You must have been very angry to attack your roommate. But, violence won't make the situation better. It's okay to be disappointed that you weren't able to control yourself better. I think next time you'll be able to express your feelings instead of lashing out. Can you think of some ways to avoid using violence next time you're angry?  It's great that you're so open about your sexuality and shared that here.

It's a purely negative thing.  As for being suicidal, I have to fight the thoughts to kill myself every second of every day. I've been like that since roughly 9 years old. Couldn't really attempt a lot because of physical limitations.  When I get so psychotic I attack people, I'm not really in control of what I do, I usually don't even remember them as I kind of get overwhelmed and my brain just kind of blanks.

When you have suicidal thoughts can you write them down or draw a picture? Sometimes having an outlet helps.  I understand that you're not really in control of what you do when you're psychotic. It's hard to say when this is appropriate, but maybe you could check in to a hospital if you feel you're in danger of hurting someone.  It's good that you know what you want out of a partner.

You have faced so many challenges and yet you've survived to this point in your life. That you reach out after everything you've been through is a sign of real courage.   The reason I recommend meditation is that it can be a great way to calm the mind and focus on the moment. It takes time and practice to learn, but it can be really useful to take a break from the stress.  Maybe it's better to draw than write. Baking, reading, and learning, might be better.

I have a couple different mental diagnosis, but the one I struggle with the most is probably my depression.  I have met people who are happy only lonely where I live.  I was in a program with a man that had schizophrenia and he was happy with himself and mostly everyone, but he had depression.  I think that if you had to look for something to deal with the depression that would be a good thing, since I think depression effects everything else in life.  Another thing is maybe to look into natural remedies from a source that deals in alternative medicine.  I have heard that there are holistic treatments to depression out there, it's just a matter of where to find them and what is legal.  If you have a computer, you should do a basic search on your own.  The pills aren't very effective for me either, that's why I need to take higher doses of everything.  There are certain kinds of fungus and plants that can really help a person dealing with some of what you have, and that might make it easier to meet people when you are feeling better.  Your country may prevent you from doing any of this.  I have seen an article from Time Magazine that said that a certain chemical in marijuana may now help a person with schizophrenia, without the side effects.  It wasn't the THC or the cannabis, it was a completely separate chemical.  The article was in this group on a different thread.  All I can say for you is hold out hope because one day they will understand what you have enough to cure you of what you have think about that, because it helps me too.  I live in a very triggering environment, but when I think about the cures that will be available in the future thanks to science, I can't hope but one day to be given that treatment."

I learned how, and it means that I can live as a shut-in; I have very little social contact, and this means I cannot enjoy the ""energy exchanges"" which come from having lot's of good friends and/or work relationships."

schizophrenia,3dkv7z,sikfoq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:47:48 2015 UTC,"So, I don't believe in ""a god"". No way. To me, that is a random supposition, like ""a great raccoon in the sky"", or ""the universe rests on twelve turtles"". Why is there only one? Any reason? Just a guess on someone's part? Any reason at all? There's not one sun and one planet. What the hell.  I am someone who has lived most of my life by the scientific method, and I am someone who believes that ALL of us ~really~ actually live our lives by the scientific method, for the most part, whether we admit it or not. In other words, I don't put my hand on the hot radiator because it burns me. So, if you're going to pull baseless random facts out of your ass, or someone else's ass, to believe (i.e., there is only ONE master mind consciousness in this universe), I'm not going to just jump on board.  However, as far as ""gods""-- Hmmm. I would rather characterize myself as agnostic, than athiest, because I think it is a HUGE prideful fuckup to ASSUME that I actually KNOW there is nothing out there with mind that makes our own look tiny tiny tiny. My worldview ""allows"" for other things to be out there, and I don't really know about everything out there. If I had absolute knowledge, I'd be godlike myself, for having that absolute knowledge.  Once you just allow for the ~possibility~ of gods, then human history can take a very different spin. Why be in a lab with ~possible~ results, when you are going to randomly invalidate part of your sample set before you begin?  Belief in possible gods:  I am at the edge of a thousand miles of woods, and someone may live in these woods, and I have no idea to what level they are educated.  Belief in god:  I've never been in those woods, but someone named The Great Spanking Frank lives there, and I know he lives there and he is important to me because he has given ""us"" messages about what to do.  Agnostic: It is improbably that something in these woods is named The Great Spanking Frank (or ""God"") and is giving messages to humanity, and ALSO claiming rightly that it is the greatest mind in the universe, the nature of which none surpasses. As to whether there are any thinking things in that forest, I dunno.  Pure Athiest: I've never been in that forest but no one lives there. I know for sure. There are no aliens who can read minds and affect reality non-causally. No one has a bigger model of mind than my type of mind. I am positive.  ""Athiest"" as commonly used: God doesn't exist. Who knows about aliens.  I think if the things in our heads are sometimes self-aware, or sometimes ""not-us"", as all the data for hundreds of years would indicate-- then we've got a long road ahead, because humans aren't going to easily admit that anything exists beyond their glorious version of consciousness. A significant portion of us are still trying to pray to ""The Great Spanking Frank"" who left us messages. Another significant portion says Gods cannot be real because either we are the only thing in the universe, or we are the greatest thing in the universe. We are fucked. Particularly as schizos. Completely."

A minute later I heard another patient saying out loud what I was thinking earlier. It freaked me out like he was reading my mind, or I was subconsciously picking out his thoughts. I wasn't entirely there, delusional, in a constant confused waking state, laying in bed. Maybe I unknowingly said out loud what I was thinking and he started repeating it. Maybe he was saying it out loud the whole time and I unknowingly heard it and started thinking about it. There's a more rational explanation besides mind reading, which isn't possible.   The other patient was probably laughing at their own predicament, I do that once in a while. The staff were laughing about an episode of Seinfeld or something."

schizophrenia,3dljka,joesavu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:45:10 2015 UTC,There have been evidence that it helps with both positive and negative symptoms. Let me find the research.

I pretty open to options when it comes to possible drug treatments. Ive been through a slew and found some success. With mementine, Im hesitant to even consider it as an option due to too much uncertainty as far as Im concerned.

schizophrenia,3dlirt,-Renton-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:10:52 2015 UTC,"yeah, it is a neurodegenerative disorder that progress faster than normal over time. Psychosis will make it progress faster if left untreated or if one does not manage symptoms well. I think their is less activation during a brain scan than normal brains. Plus, schizophrenic brain development looks differently.  It could be in its own category as it may be reversible with with proper treatment. I remember suffering big time at the beginning of my disorder. Now I think I have a handle on it and management. I still have much to learn to further improve my overall well being."
schizophrenia,3dlirt,joesavu,2,Sun Jul 19 00:18:00 2015 UTC,"This says that there is definitely brain abnormalaties. But it doesn't say it's specifically neurodegenerative because the neurons aren't dying and they aren't deciding not to function. Schizophrenia may actually be a new category of illness, IMO.

schizophrenia,3dlirt,joesavu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"These ones are the basic for everyday:  Definitely want to stock up on Fish Oil 4-6g a day. 600mg NAC daily. Magnesium&zinc, 1 multi vitamin daily. 120mg lithium oratate with exercise +inositol. allegra (fexofenadine 60mg) for inflammation. CoQ10 300mg maximum absorption kind + Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer.  These are most effective for my negative symptoms. Just make sure to be well aware of how your body responds. Dosage may vary.  I take other supplements but it really depends on each individual if they are effective or not. Examine.com is a great place to learn about supplements.  Probiotics, L-theanine, Bacopa, curcumin, milk thistle are beneficial as well. 20mg of noopept really helps to get my morning started.

I had symptoms very similar to yours. After I took it I was bed ridden and miserable. It was like I had the flu, but with anxiety and chest pain and even worse restlessness than I usually have.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's bad news, or at least it was. If you think it's helping you and you have talked to your doctor about this they may prescribe cogentin to fight the side effects. Though this may create a drug cocktail and cause even more side effects."

schizophrenia,3dha19,shesgonegilligan,2,Thu Jul 16 13:55:33 2015 UTC,Yup. I had a small argument with a med nurse who said I should take cogentin. There was no way I was doing that for the same etc. etc. feedback cycle you described.
schizophrenia,3dha19,shesgonegilligan,2,Thu Jul 16 14:01:25 2015 UTC,Definitely. It's gonna be hard convincing my mother to switch. She thinks Latuda has me cured. But I just can't stand it! The side effects are just too bad.
schizophrenia,3dha19,solipsisticish,2,Thu Jul 16 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"Mothers can be really tough nuts to crack. My mother thinks Lithium cured me when they gave it to me by mistake 6 years ago. She is, of course, ignoring the 4 subsequent hospitalizations and flagrant psychosis and the fact that I'm on 10x the recommended dosage for someone with schizophrenia. I have been presenting evidence to her from articles I've read, posts I've made on here, testimony from my therapist, etc. She doesn't believe me and gets super pissed when I tell her I'm going to have my doctor take me off of it.   You have to remember, like I so often forgot: You can't control the way others act, you can only strive to be a better you. If that involves getting off of Latuda so you're not riddled with side effects then that's what needs to be done.   Best of luck to you."
schizophrenia,3dha19,jajajajim,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:17:07 2015 UTC,I took it for about six months in 2012; the side effects were so atrocious I wound up switching to something else.

schizophrenia,3dha19,Hydrogen_Ion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:52:09 2015 UTC,I agree it sounds like akathisia. Tell your doc about it. He/she might switch you off of latuda or might prescribe a blood pressure medication called propranolol to lessen the akathisia
schizophrenia,3dha19,nitelyechos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:10:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, well, I'm on a lot of meds, but here's the short list:  Anti-psychotic: Abilify (200mg/month, it's a once monthly injection, probably in the range of 6.7mg/day) Anti-depressants: Welbutrin (150mg/day) Viitrude (10mg/day, just started it, going up to 40mg/day)  Abilify has way less side effects for me, but the chief one's been fatigue that's gotten worse and worse.   That said, you just have to try stuff til you find one that's not awful for you; you can try abilify if your doctor will let you. If you get it i'd say go with the injections if your insurance covers it (I'm on disability, so I don't pay a dime for the $1700 monthly injection, but your mileage may vary).  Apart from that I've offset the fatigue with herbal supplements and vitamin pills, but most doctors don't like it if you do things like that. Today I'm feeling normal for once in terms of fatigue thanks to the herbs and vitamins- but again, interactions are a risk I basically was willing to take after two-three years of doctors refusing to take me off the anti-psychotics. I'd mention the supplements I'm taking apart from the vitamin D and B, but they might be dangerous."

schizophrenia,3dfdlu,BlankUsername42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:01:55 2015 UTC,"I tried taking it in the morning when I was first diagnosed. I stopped after a couple weeks because while it worked flawlessly, it made me feel like a zombie and completely unable to connect with the outside world. It was weird. Recently I have started it up again but now I take it at a much lower dose (was 300 before, now it's 100) and I take it in the evenings. I don't feel sluggish like I used to when taking it in the mornings and it is still seemingly just as effective as it had been in the past. The Risperidone (generic for Risperdal) has the bonus effect for me of making me tired when I take it at night, helping ease my insomnia a great deal. This is also nice because any auditory hallucinations that remain for me are primarily encountered when I'm laying in bed going to sleep and even then they are very rarely encountered. Also please note that most prescribers are very well aware of fatigue and drowsiness being one of the major side effects for Risperidone. To my knowledge there aren't many people who take it and don't feel drowsy."

One, I am a highly functioning schizo for several decades because I can say, ""ok that isn't real, I'm just experiencing familiar psychoses"". It wasn't always that way, but it has been for many many many years, now for me, and every day, I see comments in this subreddit where people are aware of what they are going through, and are controlling it because of their awareness.  Two,-- One of my good friends at MIT did a bunch of acid and ~apparently~ sat calmly in his room for quite some time, smiling. It turns out that the ceiling had come down to talk to him, and happened to mention that he should remember to breath-- and he'd spent quite a long time, having a practical panic attack, sitting there, consciously breathing, in out, in out,  because he was convinced that if he forgot for a moment to breath, he was going to die. It was like something out of one of the ""Saw"" movies for him.  Good trips are just that. They're good. A few days ago, someone posted (I think, in this sub) that they take shrooms for depression because it's like walking into another room (a better room, maybe with clean air and bright light, that sort of thing). But bad trips are just that. They're bad. I've had similar experiences to almost all the nasty stuff I've read here from other schizos, and I'll tell you that most of it isn't as bad as a bad acid trip. Bad acid trips are not ""deal-able"", they can easily put you into the hospital. They're as bad as any psychotic episode that puts you in the hospital. Being tied to a bed shot up with drugs because you were screaming, is the same whether it's schizophrenia or shrooms. But with shrooms you may also have the added discomfort that you can't really hear yourself screaming because your mouth is sliding down your face (friend of mine, not me).  So, what you imagine about severity isn't necessarily correct in this case.  However, I agree than it's strange to hear that tripping and schizophrenia are alike. Thousands of people (tens of thousands of people??) recreationally trip every year, and I doubt that thousands of people would say, ""hey, hold my beer, I'm going to go be schizophrenic for a few hours"". No, they're not really similar. The only time tripping was ever like schizophrenia for me, was when I was tripping AFTER knowing what schizophrenia was like. I think schizophrenics who compare the experiences, must have been schizophrenic already when they were tripping, personally. Best to you."

schizophrenia,3dgkyx,Nerow1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:38:42 2015 UTC,"First off. If someone with sz does shrooms and has a bad trip, it's really bad. Most people when they have a bad trip just kind of freak out. Lol the spirits and voices i normally hear came close to me and fucking raped me. That's some heavy shit that i actually had to go through and felt. It was as real to me as anything i've ever experienced. It was worse than anything i've ever experienced from of my illness. What part of ""the illness got amplified"" didn't you understand? If it wasnt for my friend who talked me down, i wouldn't be here writing this i'd be in a mental hospital. Seriously, don't be critical of me for saying something thay i didn't say. Don't assume i was saying they are the same because they're not. If sz was a 24 hour trip out i'd have fun with it...

At the time he seemed receptive to this news - I know it must be difficult to hear.   I have no idea but I worry that me telling him that is what triggered all the subsequent attention and focus on me. Maybe it's selfish and insensitive but after that all I want to do is distance myself from him. The police also told me not to contact him anymore. It makes sense if they told him not to contact me it could send mixed messages if I reach out to him.   I don't have anything against him and do want the best for him but I don't want to put my own safety at risk. The whole situation was very scary and I just want to feel safe again.

The more depressed I got, the worse my symptoms got.  As for coping now, keeping a positive attitude about things and trying to return to a normal life seems to be working. Not being able to vaporize cannabis is hitting me hard, but I have to resist the negative feelings and thoughts about my family because while they may not be smart enough to allow me to consume cannabis, they are trying to help me because they see it as another street drug. Gotta stay positive no matter what, even when you're taking loses. Speaking of cannabis, avoid smoking it because smoke is bad for your health in general.

After a while I tried hallucinogens, like at least 15 different kinds. Personally I love them, would do them every three months to be a better person.   I would never give drugs to someone who can't control or understand their halucinations. I never became delusional from heavy drugs use. My ex gave me the drugs and made me emotionally dependant on him. Environment is everything.  They helped me realize halucinations are only real and meaningful inside my head. I don't think it is possible for me to have a bad trip, shit trips yes, I am well aware of what is real.   This has changed my abity to watch horror films. A trailer preview can keep me up with visual halucinations. I had to learn how to be comfortable with disturbing presences. I used to love horror movies as a kid.  I don't do drugs anymore.

schizophrenia,3ddx8w,krp5150,2,Wed Jul 15 22:05:22 2015 UTC,I tried LSD after I was diagnosed at a music festival. It mainly affected my nervous system (made me jittery/had tension in the head). I did see a light in the sky while under it's influence but that was it as far as visuals/hallucinations. I wouldn't say it was a bad experience. I guess it could of been a lot worse than what it was considering the amount I took.

I was able to breakthrough twice because I took the properly prescribed dosage, and the other two trips I had done by accident because I accidentally hit a waterbong and a bowl with DMT residue, but those trips were not breakthroughs. Anyhow, the voices did not subdue in the first breakthrough trip and I still heard them and had several horrofying hallucinations and elements within the trip. In the second one, I don't recall much but it was less horrifying and I recall having more fun. The other two mild ones were scary because they were unexpected but I don't recall any voices or other symptoms.  I've recently done 'lean' and DXM which put my mind at ease.

schizophrenia,3ddx8w,Djinn04,2,Thu Jul 16 01:52:30 2015 UTC,Why would you mix mind altering drugs with a mind altering illness? That's just asking for disaster.   It's bad enough dealing with psychosis on it's own. Adding psychedelics would undoubtedly magnify his symptoms.
schizophrenia,3ddx8w,Cedrichendrix92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:59:45 2015 UTC,Depends entirely on environment and state of mind at the time. You can have schizophrenia and still do psychedelics and be safe. I wouldn't recommend it. Would i do them now? Yes because i know how they effect my mind and know the proper environment. The one bad trip i had (worse than a normal bad trip for most) it was at a studio warehouse with a bunch of noise and shitty music and shitty people. Baaaaad trip. The spirits came too close and started violating me pretty badly....so yes psychosis can be magnified but i also have to take into consideration that i was not in a good state of mind at the time. I was being conned by someone and that was influencing my delusional thinking already and i was around people i really didn't know very well.
schizophrenia,3ddx8w,Djinn04,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:16:29 2015 UTC,"Those things are important I wouldn't argue that. But I don't really see the point of pushing such an extreme state of mind even further with psychedelics. It just seems....dangerous. When I don't take medication I'm so sensitive to everything. It's hard to stay calm. I can't imagine how worse I'd get if I took something like a psychedelic. I'm quite sure I would never get back to normal again. It's fortunate that you can handle that sort of thing, but for people like me it's like throwing gasoline on a flame."

I have to wear sunglasses when i go outside, i hear every sound outside. It gets very amplified on psychedelics but the only time the voices got worse was during my bad trip. Instead of blending into the background like they normally do, they took over my body and mindfucked me (quite literally. I felt like i was being raped....and i'm a man damn it!). ""I"" died that day. I literally was convinced that i had died. If it wasn't for my friend who talked me down, i may not be here writing this right now and would probably be stuck in that state. Every time i revisit that place it happened, i get a worsening of symptoms every time so i stay away. That is why i'm weary of taking mushrooms again. Maybe LSD because it doesn't alter my thoughts just makes pretty visuals happen. Do i regret taking them? No because they haven't had much of an effect on my illness. The thing that happens when i revisit that place could very well be just PTSD and anxiety amplifying my symptoms. I'm reminded of it. But the insight i have gained about myself through tripping is unlearnable and definitely helpful. I was able to see exactly how and why i had schizophrenia rather than just acknowledging i have it."

I don't know of any way to stop these things, but I do know coping mechanisms such as reality checking, deep breathing, visualization, grounding, etc. can all help in dealing with these situations if you become distressed.   Also, don't worry so much (easier said than done, I know) about whether or not something is your schizophrenia or isn't. You'll drive yourself up a wall of you keep doing that.

If it is distressing you to the point where you plan on harming yourself or others, then you qualify for crisis intervention.  Otherwise, your brain is just doing what it does. By default, I assume that ""songs in my head"" are some type of warning which my brain produces as commentary about a current situation or set of memories related to the situation.

Not that the voices themselves are shouting, but when they happen it becomes very difficult to remain focused on what I was doing; everything else is second priority and stands out less when it happens. Sometimes when I hear a particular fan in my house, it sounds just like someone is playing 8bit music from something like Mario or pacman.  I also hear people calling my name, as if from the other room or from behind me, which is the only thing I've ever heard from outside my head that I'm aware came from no one (not all auditory hallucinations are outside?)  When I was younger (around 6 y/o) I thought I saw a clown in a terrifying mask peek his head in my room one night and just watched me sleep. He wouldn't go away, and when I asked my parents about where they bought that mask the next morning they told me I must have dreamt it.  Years later, I slept in a different room at my house and would feel 3 different beings watching me go to sleep, and these ones were almost nightly for a long time. One stood right next to the edge of my bed and had made me feel protected, the second stood by the wall on the other side of my bed and was indifferent towards me, not there to hurt me but wouldn't care if something did. The third was something like a rat/bat thing, and would cling to the upper left corner of my room, sometimes screaming, it was aggressive towards me. I believed that the only thing keeping me safe from it was the one next to my bed, as long as it stayed there the bat wouldn't move from that spot. Thankfully they didn't follow me when I changed bedrooms again, or when I moved away from home. I've had only few experiences with things watching me sleep or coming into my room during the night since.  I haven't been diagnosed officially yet, but I'm also supposed to be looking for a doctor of psychology to determine if that's what this is. The thing is though the thought of confirming anything stresses me out too much to look, the paranoia takes over and I fear what would happen to me if my family doctor was right to send me there. If I don't confirm it, it's still not real, which is in itself an incredibly important reason to go in the first place."

My therapist doesn't even know what i'm talking about when i mention them. Don't confuse them with illusions. If they were illusions, you wouldn't actually hear the stimulus other than the fan.

I've also read that there's a 13% chance for developing schizophrenia if one of your family members has it, which could mean I have a higher chance since 3/8 are diagnosed?    Do not worry about it.  Stay healthy. Make an Advanced Directive for Mental Health."

schizophrenia,3d9if1,Kiljeaden,2,Tue Jul 14 16:11:17 2015 UTC,"The only thing you can really do is stay away from mind altering drugs and staying healthy. As long as you are not showing clear symptoms you should try to not worry about it. You did say you smoke weed, if I were you I'd stay away from any psychedelic drugs. Im not an expert and I'm not schizophrenic (I just browse here because schizophrenia fascinates me) but I've heard that psychedelic drugs can bring out symptoms."
schizophrenia,3d9if1,Kiljeaden,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"I've heard different things about weed and alcohol if one are prone to schizophrenia. For you say psychedelic drugs, you're thinking about LSD, mushrooms, Ectasy, MDMA, right? That I do agree it could be dangerous using, because of the extreme effects and psychic alternation you get.  But weed and alcohol? I think both are just as bad if you're dealing with schizophrenia. Either you have to be very drunk, or very high, so you expose yourself to a situation that could change your thoughts thereafter (trauma).  Or both alcohol and weed cause damage and prematurely bring forth the illness."
schizophrenia,3d9if1,one-peromyscus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:29:26 2015 UTC,"Well I'm mainly an /r/drugs browser, mdma I can imagine being quite harmless actually. Its seems completely impossible to me to get negative vibes on mdma. Weed however does effect your dopamine receptors, especially with heavy usage. The definition of a psychadelic drug is a drug that alters your perception as the main focus of the drug, this seems broad because it is. But I would never reccomend something like LSD or mushrooms to someone with schizophrenia (or to anyone with an unstable emotional state). These drugs seem to magnify emotional states rather than change them for better or worse. Weed every now and then is probably not a bad idea, it can be calming for the mental state. As long as it isn't a frequent habit because that will in turn cause dopamime problems. Id reccomend just cutting down on weed use at least, maybe once or twice a week at most."

Scholarly consensus can be wrong as well, but in this particular case, Sitchin has been rightly debunked.  I shared many of the same interests, but I learned to interpret my thought patterns, fantasy constructs, alternative realities etc., in a way which was more valid in regards to the laws of physics. That worldview is still ""delusional"", but nothing produced by my faulty perception processing needs to be acted upon in the same way an extremist will think ""...I am on a mission from my deity of choice...""  By all means: do what you do, and think what you think, but it is best to constantly challenge how you interpret the material specific to your post.

The important thing is what impact does this have on your daily life and your ability to function.   I have been sent here to save humanity   I felt the same way when i was in my delusional state and to tell you the truth, it's alot of responsibility. Living your own day to day life is hard enough without the pressure that you;ve got to save the world. It is also dangerous because it can inflate your ego, and make you think less of other people, which it seems is something you're also struggling with. Having your mind focused on these things makes you miss out on the day to day things that can connect you to other people, which can be lonely and only tends to reinforce unshared beliefs."

But I do need to avoid having it inflate my ego, which I never noticed until now it has been pointed out by you guys. I'll try to work on that, rather than having it inflate my ego I'll try to use it to better myself. I do have a really hard time connecting with others, I can barely reply to people with a few words, and I often find myself replying to them in my head rather than out loud.

schizophrenia,3d8u94,munkomanko,2,Tue Jul 14 17:17:20 2015 UTC,"I am not normal but I don't really have schizophrenia either. I pretty much get what you are talking about, but what I don't understand is why you can't just see the stuff for what it is? It are emotional crutches. Feelings not knowledge. Everyone has it, but they don't say ""I know this to be true"" they just feel it to be true. While being aware where that truth ends, or rather: where they have to make it end. Belief and emotions are tools that you immediately work with. You are somewhat just using it wrong.  Often I feel that I perfectly understand people here in this subreddit, that no one is actually insane, but that people just fail to accept (or fail to perceive) certain limits. Try to understand things too hard. E.g. you just do not talk about things that no one else can realistically make sense of. Or you acknowledge the limits of predicting future outcomes without errors. And then you eat something and go to sleep. This acceptance is very much within the very immediate mental powers of a regular person. Just somehow the question ""does this also work for other people?"" is not sought after, strangely is answered wrong, or something like this. Just a strange impression that is bugging me.  I also ""believe"" (in emotions) that I am saving the world, and what not. But I just believe in that future, not in Syrius 10000. My feelings come from the stories of anime series, music, drug experiences, events in my life. And they are consciously designed (by myself) such that they help me to function and to make critical decisions in a rational manner. I am very aware that I have the responsibility to avoid at all cost to mess up this design. There are safeguards, etc. It is really critical. If I believe in BS on a lower level, the outcomes will be BS as well. I am not sure what you are doing in your head with Annunaki and Venus, but certainly you should just try to fix this stuff if it causes problems. Who cares what other people wrote about this shit.

There are thousands of schizos who think they are the special one. The truth is that I am here to save myself and your presence doesn't mean diddly to me or the holy archangels or Copernicus's cat. (Edit: Actually I personally am here to find my wife, to whom I am now married. It took me 45 years and schizophrenia. That's the only thing I personally am really sure of, aside from some overwhelming sense of having traveled distances to get here, that simply don't fit in the human mind.)  How come you have to be more superior than other humans? What if on a scale of 1 to 10 of souls that frequent this forum, your soul's age/wisdom/experience/whatever is just average? What if it's a 2 because you place yourself above other humans? What if it's an 8 but you're just a misguided savior?   Let's say your annu-whatever (I'm on mobile) home culture is like a thrilling, voluptuous leafy plant at the base of a tree in a giant forest spanning millions of miles. And Earth culture is a small plant two feet to the right. What were you supposed to be saving here, again? On this plant? And what's that about our plant processes looking so foreign or simple or robotic to you? Man I would say you're a long way from home, but you're only 2 feet from home. Maybe every one who comes here from your plant is hoping to make this one grow. Ok. But growth processes come from love and respect. They don't come from ""this plant SUCKS, it's not as leafy as my old plant."" How you gonna grow anything, two whole feet from your precious old leafy turf?  Generally, self-importance in both delusion, AND spirituality, is radically misplaced and leads to a host of problems including self-obsession. That really the best you got? Otherwise, you should feel free to embrace your own spirituality. Best to you, friend from two-foot-away-leafy-place. Maybe the only thing your schizo is doing is holding your nose up in the air.

For me, it's not about self-importance, or being superior to humans, which I'm not. It's that I don't feel human, I don't feel like I'm from here, and I can't accept the fact that I was sent here for any other reason than to save the planet and humanity. I guess that seems that I would be putting myself above others, but if anything it makes me feel below them. (Edit: I guess I just feel I was sent here for whatever 'they' want me to do. So in a metaphorical sencs; they'd be the leader of a drug cartel and I'd be the mule. So that's where I don't feel the self importance)  I mean, looking at it from my perspective, if I felt superior to humans, and if I thought this planet sucked, would I save it? Hell no.   As for humans being so simple and robotic, it's that when I speak to people I know what they will say before they say it, and if I think of something hard enough, for some reason they begin speaking about it.   And I know how crazy it all sounds, but all I'm trying to put across is that I can not convince myself to think otherwise.

I feel I should have done more but my little brother would not have listened.   I have recently seen my older brother acting oddly so i asked my therapist if she would call him and try to get him to see a therapist.  she told me she could not do that.  that it was up to me.  so my advice. do what you want, do enough that you have no or few regrets.  but remember professionals will not help you unless your friend wants to get help for herself by herself.   edit :  here is a quick googling of nursing delusion patients.scroll down the page to find the management section.   http://nursingplanet.com/pn/nursing_management_delusions_hallucinations.html important parts to remember:   If left alone, it will overwhelm coping resources.

schizophrenia,3d9fbq,random4names,2,Tue Jul 14 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"It is simple.  You must have made a statement about your medical condition to SSA.  They may have received medical records from your doctor, but they either did not receive any, or they want more information about a specific claim you made.  For example, if you say you are disabled because you have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, depression, and have severe memory problems, and the doctor supports the diagnosis, but does not say anything about the memory problems or mood disruption, they will want to get that supported.  The examination is by a third party doctor, but they get paid by the SSA to do these exams. They do not get paid based on results, so most of the time, they just have a form of what to examine and they do it as fast as possible and send their results to the SSA.  It is typically very short.   A few tips:   Tell the absolute truth! If you lie or try to ""lead"" them, they will know and you could be rejected even if you were completely qualified to receive benefits.  Try to relax. It will be short, so do not be afraid to be yourself.  They are usually only looking at one or a few symptoms, so do not think their examination is meant to be complete. They could very well do a single test measuring your memory, or ask you a few questions about your mood."
schizophrenia,3d8uh0,Calathia117,3,Tue Jul 14 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"Sounds a lot like scientology (no offense or anything, just a perception). I personally find it interesting that the latest major religion-thing that humans came up with, is based on the idea that something is infesting humans like bugs, thusly limiting their consciousness.  Can I just add one thing? Competition between taxonomies is a part of nature-- natural selection and all that. Eaten a chicken lately? Or a cow? But natural competition is predicated on the reality that the act of infringing upon another life form, is somehow ~functional~ to the infringing taxonomy (I say taxonomy because obviously ""species"" wouldn't be correct. Technically, all species are Earth life forms.) In other words, if the violence we are experiencing is functional to the other taxonomy, then it may be sociopathic or psychotic or simply stupidly violent TO US, but it's no different than the red ants versus the black ants. However, if the infringing taxonomy were to be acting in manner which is non-functional to them-- for instance, shooting us up like heroin, or using us like a self-cutter uses a knife, or just exploring us like an idiot drinking gasoline-- then there is no taxonomic competition, and there is no derived function for any greater mind, and there is just stupidity and violence.  I notice that you credit ""them"" with self-function, but that's what they would tell you. Maybe the truth is that they are NOT serving any function to themselves, and are just ""more-ons"", true morons, just stomping over things because they're so much ""better"" than other life forms, and because we've invented peanut butter and have cars.  Maybe they are just serving some super-retarded sense of self-glory-- like a drugged-up, learning-disabled, 20-IQ brute who shoves its way onto a stage at a nightclub and starts belting out a painful, out-of-tune song with the wrong slurred words, drooling on itself and smashing nearby people in the face. How do YOU know it's functional for them, that their life forms override ours? You have a human form, and your actions have to serve it. You have to eat and shit and not get limbs cut off. Why do you assume that this life form has similar restrictions on function? What if they continue to propagate in their own mind-cloud, regardless of how stupid are the things that they do? What if they have all become vain-glorious self-centered idiots who have lost the idea of ""self"" function, in their violence?  Talking to many schizos over the years, the ""voices"" definitely share traits, and some of the glaring traits are transparency, stupidity, shallow-ness, lack of contexts, narrow-ness of perceptions, close-mindedness, etc. So, why would you assume they are being functional? What if they are just truly morons? A swarming cloud of idiotic ""look what I can do, I'm great, try the peanut butter!"" That's all. Thanks back."

schizophrenia,3d7vjh,Cedrichendrix92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:29:07 2015 UTC,Yes and no. It's like trying to think through a fog while 6 televisions are on. Thinking fast is ok but it gets hard when you add the noises and lights and the amplified external stimuli. Like right now I can think pretty clearly but that will only last so long.
schizophrenia,3d65uq,kruemelmonstah,11,Mon Jul 13 20:50:10 2015 UTC,"Your ""what if"" questions are, uh...crazy enough (and I mean that in a nice way) to qualify as paranoia. Also, being able to control paranoia or delusion still means you are having it. A ""normal"" mind doesn't have to stay on top of things that way. You're putting in a lot of good, hard work, managing ""something"". And that ""something"" as well as that hard work you're doing, probably qualifies as symptoms of mental illness. On the plus side, it sounds like you're controlling it really well, for the most part. Congrats on that part and hang in there! No worries.  Also, if it did COMPLETELY go away, all your doctors and professionals and insurers would be happy for you, not mad at you in ANY way. Some types of psychoses go away. Generally, not schizophrenia tho. Hang in there!"

schizophrenia,3d65uq,Borrillz,3,Mon Jul 13 21:36:29 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I felt the same way.  I found my hallucinations were easy to ignore most of the time, and my main positive symptoms were cognitive decline and disorganized speech.  I look at schizophrenia like it's just a group of symptoms that psychiatrists decided to clump into one disease because they tend to appear together in quite a few people.  If meds and treatment for schizophrenia help you live a better life, why would you want to stop?  An important thing to keep in mind is that your symptoms could get worse.  Much worse.  I was handling it pretty well until a life event prompted me to start listening to my hallucinations and believing them.  From quite a few experiences I've read about, people are also sucked in by hallucinations refrencing their thoughts and insecurities.  You don't wanna trivialize hallucinations because they can seriously pull you away from living the life you want to lead.  Stay on top of your treatment, even if you have to tell yourself ""Better safe than sorry""."

I thought about starting a dating a schizophrenic dating website. My vision would have it totally different than every other dating website/app. Wish I had more money to fuel all my projects. Hitting a wall due to funding has really branched my thoughts/projects just like how people describe our mind: Split.   I think passing it to the children might evolve them... I hate the negative stigma from how the majority of these ""research studies"" frame the picture to make use always seem like a piece of shit... Sorry, I mean less or worthless compared to the nerotypical.   I literally see bipolar people get turned on or have a change in their mental state. I was chatting it up with the front door lady at a night club, and someone asked why she was shaking. After explaining she was bipoloar the lady walked away after saying sorry; That hurts being treated like that. A few minutes she stops her boss walking by and says, ""I'm not usually mentally able to do a double, and I would like to do one today.""  She got my snap chat. I pass my snap chat out to cute girls or whoever is interested no matter what their disposition is. Blondes usually rub me the right way, and I usually rub them the right way. Older woman adore me.  I got a few girls flirting with me directly and indirectly just because of my snapchat stories.  Kinda like one of requirements of being on my dating website. Metaphors not dicks."

schizophrenia,3d5mbi,0n3tw0,2,Tue Jul 14 19:01:05 2015 UTC,"When I get paranoid about surveillance, I think about how I would approach it with the most advanced technology. They wouldn't have to hide microphones or cameras, they could probably do it from a distance. They could probably tell where you are in your home due to the fluctuations of energy when you turn on the TV or toaster. Devices could be leaking information through the power grid or on secret frequencies. I even theorize that you could gently modulate the AC power in a home to make electronics emit faint voices. Often the voices are the loudest in my bathroom with the fan running or in my room during the summer with the fans on.  It would be so boring to surveil me, it'd be easier to track my internet usage since I'm on the net all the time. I read a book about the Edward Snowden leaks, there's some scary stuff that's allegedly going on. Apparently they surveilled anti-war protesters and related activity, possibly occupy. These are subjects that piqued my interest and they would know with a record of my internet history, not that I necessarily agree with everything I read on the internet. How many steps does it take to label someone a terrorist? Then it's off to Guantanamo or a black site for some enhanced interrogation techniques, torture. That is my worst fear, the voices once repeatedly told me, ""by the authority of ... we declare you an enemy combatant of the United States of America"".  Do you realize the absurdity that your ""constructive investigation"" online can be recorded in a database and investigated itself. That profiles of us could exist based on our reddit browsing history and comments. Just today a CNN host labeled reddit ""the man-cave of the internet"". I've been lurking on reddit from the start due to its geeky origins, previously a visitor of digg and before that slashdot. I feel that Ellen Pao is engaged in a psychological operation and much of what we are told about her is a lie. Where does it end, has pandora's box been opened?  I want it all to unravel, I want the world to know, but ignorance is bliss and I'm a delusional schizophrenic, so nothing that I think or say can be trusted.

I was also sexually abused by my mother's boyfriend. I can't really remember anything else about being a child. Just ridicule and abuse.   As a teen I was severely picked on and had very little friends. I had an extremely overactive imagination and my head was filled with false memories.   I'm 28 now and my memory is even worse. I don't know what that says about my life with schizophrenia, but that's the gist of my life."
schizophrenia,3d2pnb,shesgonegilligan,10,Mon Jul 13 01:55:43 2015 UTC,"As a child I was bullied, so much so I got depressed which never stopped, ever. I only had one friend from pre-school to age 12. I remember negative, hallucinations, delusions and cognitive symptoms ever since I was a small child. When I was 12 years old I met a new friend which I put all my trust in but as I turned around he accused me of physical abuse. That event was traumatizing, he took all my trust and shat all over it. I have since blocked out most of my childhood because of what happened and the depression and bullying.  My teens were violent and depressive. The voices told me to kill myself and everyone around me. I would act out, punch walls, myself and yell at teachers and peers. I actually met a girl when I was 13, which made everything worse. We never got together but I got insanely jealous when she would talk or show interest in other boys and I would act out as if she was cheating on me. I loved her and I had the feeling that she felt the same way, was it a delusion? Perhaps, perhaps not. My classmates were always hinting that she felt the same way but I never dared to get to gather with her, I was so afraid of rejection. At age 13 we went to another school and then another at age 14. We met new people and got new friends. I was also bullied in my teens and had countless violent and emotional outbursts. I also went to countless therapists which I never spoke a word to and if anything I just had a violent outburst and would make them afraid of me. I was a big kid and today I'm a big man, measuring at 6'6(196cm) when I was the tallest. I was put on Prozac at the end of 10th grade.   Then as I was 16 I moved in with my aunt and went to collage, I didn't have many friends. One or two maybe, but only one who hadn't found himself new friends. I ditched the Prozac and as I settled in to the new school I met new people and new friends, but also new rivals and new bullies. At first I was just on a general direction, math, English, sports etc. But a year after that I started studying to become a blacksmith. During the iron crafting and making classes I was bullied, hard. I contemplated suicide and finally after one and a half semester of bullying I decided to drop out of school, much to my parents dismay. I went back home and got even more depressed than usual. Then in the fall the same year I got a job at a slaughterhouse and moved out yet again. This time I lived alone. I met a new friend who I suspected was only my friend because he had gotten a DUI sometime before we met and didn't have a drivers licence. I used to drive him all over town, pick him and his friend up at the bar and basically lick is testicles. That got tired quick and I, even though there was no more bullying, fell into deep depression and contemplated suicide daily. I turned to my mother for help and admitted, finally, that there was something wrong with me. She called my family doctor and he put me on Prozac yet again. He then got in touch with a psychiatrist which I then went to and have been going to to this day.   At age 20 I had my first psychotic breakdown after being put on Xanax for the anxiety and I started to hear the voices more clearly. I started self harming and almost committed suicide. I went to the ER and got an interview with a doctor. After that I told my psychiatrist about the voices and the delusions I had been experiencing since I was a child and he prescribed me Risperidone(Risperdal), initially for paranoia but increased the dosage when I told him about the voices. This was a year ago and today I'm trying to find out as much as I can about what's wrong with me. My psychiatrist hasn't diagnosed me with schizophrenia, only psychosis but I highly suspect it's either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  It feels good to share and I hope more follow in our steps."

At 11 I started getting very bad anxiety. I got drunk for the first time. I was the class clown never did work still passed the tests.   At 13 was a co-captain of the wrestling team. At 13 though it's as if though a switch literally flipped one night. I had a visual hallucination of a red hue coming down my field of vision suddenly and then doom. It felt like a panic attack but panic attacks don't last for weeks, half an hour at that. Then I did not have enough knowledge to describe it, I do now though. Racing thoughts and very disorganized thinking. Was a dysfunctional wreck at 13. I was put in a psychiatric hospital. Turned 14 there.  The stay gave me real PTSD. Most the children there were abused and neglected and had nothing close to what I called a family. I was given a new drug risperdone which my little body couldn't handle. Once they tied me down in restraints while my back and neck muscles were spazzing out from akathisia. That was painful torture.   14  -16 were a mix of being a kid and being a fuck up. First sex at 14. 14-15 were very depressed anxious years (Damn near a goth). I smoked pot before that first bad episode but I really went balls to the wall with getting fucked up with friends from 16-21. 16- 21 were care free days where I really didn't feel ill, might have been the best times of my life however I was ill and my symptoms/ delusions were chalked up to being an eccentric kid.   As a child I was a rebellious ADD having student. As a preteen a class clown with really bad anxiety problems. As a teen I grew into friendships which helped me get by. Major pot smoker, drinker. Friends would come to me to ask me what x pill did or what to expect from Y drug. I was a psychonaut.   Turned 32 on the 10th, Been in and out of hospital 8 times since 13 with the most recent being this year.  As a child, under 18 I had no major responsibilities so it wasn't until adulthood that it became clear that the way my mind was working wasn't going to work as an adult. It would take years of growing and learning how to manage my life and still feel like it's all worth it. I hope that helped."

My parents had some trouble getting me to finish my dinner and clean my room but apart from that I stayed out of trouble and got good grades.  Not much to tell.  I had a couple of friends and I didn't like being around loads of people so a couple good friends was all I needed.  I listened to Scorpions and watched Pokemon.    I was a few different people during my teenage years.  Started off as a mild-mannered goth kid and got bullied quite often.  I eventually had enough of it and started going to a gym and got into boxing and got into a few fights and although I didn't win a single fight it was enough to make people not want to fuck with me any more.  I had an abusive stepfather occasionally beat my ass but I was scrappy enough that I dished it out almost as often.  I wasn't big enough to actually hurt him but we developed an interesting relationship because of it.  I had very few friends because I was an asshole and no one liked being around me.  I started neglecting my studies and developed a general disrespect for authority and spent quite a bit of time in the principal's office giving him a hard time.  It got pretty bad, I was suspended pretty often, got kicked off the bus multiple times, and I eventually got expelled and had to repeat a year of school.  Being held back scared the shit out of me because I never liked the idea of letting people think I was simple and more importantly I was terrified of disappointing my father.  I turned my shit around and started doing well in school and I started hanging out with the right kids and eventually became somewhat popular.  It wasn't as glorious as the movies made it seem.  I had a lot of friends but it was all very shallow and superficial and this was around the time that I was starting to experience symptoms and I suspect that most of them actually just hated my guts."

Apparently, even back then I could not accurately judge situations or even my ability to control myself.  All I could do is hide in fantasy, and boy, I really had a huge fantasy world all for myself (I still do!). But for others, I was just the ""troublemaker"", and I was supposed to be locked away in an institution because I was apparently uncontrollable to teachers.

I had a huge imagination and I loved to draw and play pretend games that were so epic I still think back on them today. My mom told me she wanted to kill herself a lot when I acted bad. She was a single teen mom raising difficult me and autistic brother so it was hard but we were all basically happy.  As a teenager I was really conflicted with my identity. I never quite figured out who I was or where I fit in. I was always on the outskirts of these random social groups but never being a complete part of them. I tried new styles and mirrored personalities really bad just to make friends so I was often accused of being ""fake"" or making things up to fit in. Which was true but I didn't understand that as a kid. I struggled with eating disorders and self harm and that whole plethora of teenage issues. It got better fora few years when I turned 18 and on to 22 but when I turned 23 is when I really went downhill and when I voices started and I was being hospitalized a lot."

My relationships revolved around drugs for the most part for the next 5 years. I don't have much insight as to how I was as a person.   I think my parents didn't know that I was having feelings that drove me to drugs and alcohol. My academics were pretty good ~3.8 GPA. I probably had an eating disorder in high school.   I think I was a sweet child. I was concerned about the experiences of others. I often think that I am a paler version of my adolescent self. But, I am much more clearer minded now that I have reduced my drug and alcohol use to responsible levels."
schizophrenia,3d2pnb,callmestranger,2,Tue Jul 14 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"As a child, very sociable and quite well-adjusted although like many others here, I did not have very caring home. No siblings, my parents fought a lot, there was sometimes domestic violence which scared me. I had some friends from down the street and each time I'd visit their homes, I felt like I wanted to be one of them... their homes seemed safe and loving, I felt I was all alone.  At school I got bullied for being overweight which made me really timid and isolated. By 13, I had gotten into the whole black metal thing and explored religions. Eventually I found satanism which honestly helped me cope through those years. I often struggled with loneliness, suicidal ideation and self-injury; in retrospect my thought processes were already quite odd at this time. I didn't drink or do drugs, I wasn't interested in girls, all I cared about was growing intellectually and spiritually.  At high school the same continued, I just got into budfhism and eventually had a psychosis."

I'm proud of you for this. You're far braver than I am.   The first time I heard voices it was in a hallway in a building at my old university. There was an office in the hallway on the right hand side as you walked towards the back of the building. There wasn't anyone anywhere. As I was walking down the hall I heard laughing and my name being said. So I walked into the office and it was empty. I freaked out and checked all the doors and doorways. Nothing. Then I heard music. Not like a song in my head, more like the same three of four seconds. It was just behind my head on the left side playing over and over and over.   That's mostly what I hear now, the music off and on and off and on. I lovingly call it ""the radio"" so I don't get super annoyed or freaked out. It will change and change and change and get louder and softer and louder and softer. Sometimes it goes away for days only to come back stronger. Sometimes there's singing.   Other times I hear voices without the music. They usually just say my name or narrate what I'm doing for a little bit. One time they just talked about me like I wasn't there.   Again, thank you very much.  Edit: You can hear some of the noises I hear if you want. I listened to them and wrote music that is pretty close to what I was experiencing at the time.

I get all of a sudden these images of me crashing straight into an oncoming car and get mutilated or something. Vivid images or small clips of all the blood. And when I'm having an episode while driving it gets even worse, I'll see myself deliberately crashing into a wall or into an oncoming car, sometimes I see myself taking of the seat belt before I go hurdling into something. Visions of me killing myself only happen when I'm alone in the car but I get the occasional accidental ones when I've got someone in the car with me.  I wonder if a man in my position should be driving.  I of course get those even though I'm not driving, For example when I was on a school trip(and this happened twice) we were looking over a tall cliff and I saw one of my classmates pushing me off the cliff and onto the ground below.

So what lithium does for me is that it mitigates some of the negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia such as depersonalization or delusion. Im on a low dose of 120mg of lithium oratate or 150mg of lithium carbonate. I pretty much stumbled upon it while trying to find something to help maintain my white matter which was one of my problems at the time. Lithium is very potent in combination of exercise, it promotes neuroplasticity. Ive been taking it for 2-3 months now, I can tell you I am much better off than before. However, I still have some more issues I need to address for my negative symptoms. I know it isnt a cure all for schizophrenia.

Then when I went to my current shrink he didn't even give me a psych eval and upped my lithium to 1050mg. When it was determined I was schizophrenic and had never had an affect issue he backpedaled and said the lithium would help me think clearer. If you're only taking 120-150mg, and I'm taking 10 times as much, something is very wrong here. The research I've been doing talks about low doses if there are no other antipsychotics present.

It's possible I never had a ""real friends"" in my entire life because of how fugged up my brain was from the very beginning, as well as 20 years or so of active substance abuse, malignant narcissism, sociopathic behaviors and ""inappropriate conduct"".  My parents tried to cover everything up -essentially acting as public relations- but everybody knows about me, what I am, and what I am capable of.   So it is no wonder that I am currently friendless: when I began ""livng sober"", my party peepz all dropped away -or I dropped them.

I'm not as into it as I used to be though; it used to be bad.  I think I was abused but I can't classify it as that.  We had done a lot of weird things together...I don't know what my friends thought of me before I was diagnosed with any mental illness, maybe they just thought I was a ""bad ass,"" whatever that can mean.  I find the term really cliche.  I'm more of the quiet type.  I don't go out like I used to and I have high social anxiety since I was a kid.  My older brother used to treat me terribly too, which explains some of the social anxiety that I have.  The funny thing is that I have a couple of friends who work in health care and used to work at places like the group homes and nursing facilities I used to live at.  I never got a clear perception of what it was like from their angle; what they thought of people who have funny thoughts or ideas; do they think that they are obnoxious.  Has it become intolerable for them?  I think that part of the reason they never want to talk any more is that they think of it as a job.  I have gone off of my medications too many times, though, I will own up to that..."

Since then I've slowly opened up about it to a few people who have all been friendly and said things like ""What! But you're so friendly,"" etc.  It's good to know they have faith in me, but I can't really believe them when they say that. Everyone I was friends with who saw me deteriorate into schizophrenia was scared, and doesn't want to be around me anymore. All the friends I have now who know but haven't seen me get sick are just naive, and have no prior experience with schizophrenia.

LOL we are the only people who can experience this spiritual awakening on a more complete level. I stand up for myself by saying I think differently, not less kinda like Steve Jobs or Einstein. We are treated like pieces of shit though because service animals get more respect than us. If any one in Washington state discriminates on someone with a service animal because they had bad experiences with service animals in the past, they are in a legal world of dismay. Like everyone expect Amazon employees judge us based on their past experiences and not what's going on in the moment. I am thankful for the few who positively enforce me and not just act like they don't want to talk about. WE carry the most negative stigma. WE experienced and still experience the most hate. WE are the only hope for humans to evolve. I will sell my mutant seed later in life if I do poses the 12 keys of the priesthood in my brain.

I had intelligence, but learning in a classroom setting was almost impossible. My parents lie to this day about various past events/situations; my high school diploma is founded on remedial classes. 4 years of art school? Just hanging out, messing with stuff in the studio, pretending to be a painter or musician.   Childhood was so traumatic that my perception of reality fused with my interior perceptions/imagination.

schizophrenia,3cuh3i,Meandmystudy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:40:42 2015 UTC,"In the US there are programs that go by the name ""partial hospitalization"", ""outpatient"", ""intensive outpatient"" or other names. They aren't much like being hospitalized at all. You aren't staying in the hospital and most of the the focus is more on coping skills and on making plans for your life.   Some areas also have supportive employment services, where a trained mental health professional will work with a prospective employer to establish work conditions that meet your needs.  There are also ACT teams (Assertive Community Treatment) that bring social workers and therapists into your home, but they can be hard to qualify for. Like I know our local ACT team, you have to have had something 3 hospitalizations or arrests in the 12 preceding months.  tl;dr if you are stuck with hallucinations, you deserve support from trained professionals on how to improve your quality of life while living with hallucinations."

Intake workers will encourage you to seek outpatient care if you are not a danger to anyone or yourself.   I spent 5.5 days in a psych unit within a major urban hospital (7 years ago). Since alcohol will severely amplify my symptoms/behaviors, the head doctor for that unit basically told me ""...you are a dead man walking...alcohol abuse will kill you very soon...stop or die..."" Since then I have only had one incident of relapse, as well as built up long term clean time in regards to other substances.   My experience in the psych unit was a confused mess (I thought I had died and was in Purgatory), but in the long run, it was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I signed myself in, but only after being told by the emergency room doctor ""...we will get a court order...sign yourself in...or be escorted upstairs by police..""  Psych units all feature common attributes like food, bed, TV, activities, conversation and therapy sessions with staff doctors and interns. Depending on your conditions, some tests will be done as well to determine body chemistry and such.  Put all the bullcrap regarding ""loonybins"" from TV shows out of your mind:  If there is an abusive ""Nurse Ratchett"" type on the unit, tell your doctor that she is a mean person, you are afraid of her, and her behavior will then change; no worker in a modern unit can get away with abuse if the patient has good reason to complain."

I've known for almost 2 years that something was very wrong.. my medications weren't helping, I was slowly developing worse symptoms, ect. While I was there, my doctor tried a few different medications on me to see which was best to keep my on when I went home. I have a bad attack where I thought ""they"" had found me and were in the vents and on the roof, I thought that every CA there who was on the phone was telling them that I was there, and I'd see people talking and assumed they were talking about me. I was given Haldol and a chair to rock back and forth in. The one in my area has mandatory group sessions on things to help you outside of there, which was nice. I learned alot both times I was there. It's also nice to have people around you who struggle with the same or similar issues because they understand what you're going through and there's a ton of support at psych wards (9/10 times)   Sorry for rambling, but if you have to question the need to check yourself in to a psych ward, I think it means you need to.

Many people refuse or resist treatment for a lot of different reasons, but if you think about it in very simple terms, the things that are upsetting you will just continue to upset you if you don't do anything about it. so I commend you for doing something about it! Remember you have support when you're going through an especially hard time. and also remember that having symptoms does not mean you need to be in a psych ward. There are lots of other options and the fact that you're seeking help actually probably means you're LESS likely to end up in a ward"

To make up for not working I follow a strict routine. I try to do the same things each day of the week and, every once and awhile, I throw in something ""fun"" that I force myself to do. It's all about forcing yourself to do things from time to time."

I can not work or go to school or clean or cook very well/for myself and I cannot shower without prompting or anything, so in this sense it is a bad thing.

Plain and simple, he needs to at this point be evaluated by a physician or other professional. He's probably not going to want to do this. So as a friend visit your local mental health organization and track someone down who does intakes, crisis or community services. Bring a copy of your post here. They will give you specific advice. They might even send someone out to do an assessment.   If things get really rough...or none of the above are working...you can call 911 and explain to them what's going on. Do this immediately if he ever becomes very bizarre (and isn't taking care of himself) or dangerous or suicidal.

He also pleaded me to tell him that everything was going to be alright. He sounded really worried, and it seemed like it helped him when I told him ""don't worry, everything will be fine.""   This is a good sign. He may rely on social contacts such as yourself to keep his sanity.   What he describes, if he truly believes it, would be very distressing. So while aliens are probably not getting involved in politics, his experiences are entirely real.   I have no experience dealing with this. How should I approach this? Any sort of communication techniques I should be using when I talk to him?   Assure him that he is safe and that he should talk to someone about this to make sure his health is alright.

My best advice if you have insomnia is to lie still and tell yourself your sleeping. It should only last 3-4 days unless you start freaking out about sleep and give yourself anxiety related insomnia. If it lasts longer than that, buy a book called desperately seeking snoozing and do sleep reduction therapy.  Best of luck, be safe. Tell yourself while your miserable that this too will pass."

I say that as someone who's on meds btw, it's not the end of the world to end up on antixylotics, antidepressants or antipsychotics but they all have serious side effects that may cause hurdles in your life.

Let's say you start having kundalini but you are not really down with selflessness because of your family's hard-won social status and the lower aspect of your 4th heart chakra is bound to gut energy instead of spinal energy but your mental strength is now mighty and so is your lust and hunger and you become a powerful private equity investor who rolls companies for millions and destroys them even though they filled a purpose and employed people and empowered poor regions.

schizophrenia,3cn9uk,valleyspirit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:59:09 2015 UTC,"It is just one study of the way that human energies can lead to enlightenment. If schizo brains are processing (or trying to process) some sort of transpersonal reality,-- some greater reality, some larger awareness space-- then all I am saying is that this doesn't necessarily make a schizophrenic any closer to enlightenment than an investment banker who ""intuits"" deals out of thin air, or a politician who subconsciously reads and manipulates people's energies without hardly even trying. In other words, if there even is such a thing as enlightenment, then the entire human condition is kinda by definition struggling toward it, of its own nature, and if that's the case, we have to judge the process by its function-- by how functional it is, either for the person on the enlightenment path, or how functional their process is for others, and for society. I'm not sure schizophrenia is a particularly functional state in this world, for many of us, so I would hesitate to qualify it as ""further along the path"" toward enlightenment. Something would have to be functional and gainful for either an individual or for some culture, to qualify as ""more enlightened"". And that could be almost anything.   I believe there are enlightened people out there, but I think they have kinda ""stepped over"" the schizo rocks, and walked around the teetering psychosis paths. Why not? Could you climb up the mountain the hard way? Yes, sure, absolutely. You could probably get there, through the muddy fog of delusion and impulse interpretations. You can play with madness, as Iron Maiden says, but you'll probably get burned in the fires of it. (Not you personally, I mean humans in general.) Many gurus have said in the 20th century, that ""the world is on fire"" and no one is doing anything about it, that we are consumed in the fires of will and compulsion. Perhaps because no one ~can~ do anything about it. Sure, I think humans can probably get to the top of the mountain along almost any path. Best to you, blessings."

Than some delusions creeped in and I felt bad again.  At this time i didn't know I was sz.

It was exciting but very scary, not knowing what exactly was going on and being taunted by my delusions because of it. But always that promise of something mystical and important. It escalated over time as I learned more about what I thought was really going on.  Most people with delusions or psychosis aren't dangerous to anyone but themselves, but we all know stories of people who do take a violent turn.  What led me to getting the police called on me was holding my mother down in a chair and drawing cat whiskers on her face with a sharpie then chasing down the hall as she ran from me. I thought she was a witch and that marking her as I did removed her power over me. So, disturbing and fear inducing to her, but not really dangerous.  The thing is, in our society before a person can be committed against their will they need to show that they are a danger to themselves or others. This can be frustrating in these situations where someone obviously needs help but can't see it."

Developing mental strength should be a set of exercises which is intuitive; it just takes as bit of quiet time to make it habitual. I don't know what that is for you.

It's considered to heighten a spiritual experience, or be the pinnacle of the spirit taking over the body. Not everyone experiences them, so some people say that people who do have divine powers.

Maybe someone told the scruffy guy on the city streets preaching, that they are blessed and he now feels like he's on a mission.   I remember my first psychotic break I thought I was some sort of time travelling prophet and had to go on a mission. Images of walking through a jungle flooded my head and I was reminded of missionaries of the past trying to convert the native peoples of the Americas. I thought to myself ""no way I'm doing that, that's futile, I don't want to change people"". It's been an inward journey for me and I see the reflections of it in society.

Quite often though the society is also more accepting and supporting of people with mental illness, though also likely viewed in a religious context. I don't know exactly what you're reading or where it came from, but this may be part of the explanation for what you're hearing.

Co-morbidity is innate to mental health conditions, as well as physical conditions. Mental and physical are really just one descriptor in terms of how the brain is integrated with the central nervous system; we like to think of the brain as ""separate"", but the brain is the body, and the body is the brain.  Part of my stability is recognizing that I ""disintegrated"" at some point in childhood, and the pre-conditions were already there in terms of genetic traits and/or ancestral behaviors (moody, manic Scotch/Irish drunks). Most likely, I was never ""integrated"" to begin with, and therefore, schizophrenia ( 'split mind') is my default template.

From what I noticed it helps to suppress the inflammation response post psychosis which is can be overactive. I wouldn't take it during psychosis. I take it when I feel like my brain is being compressed to alleviate some of the stress and anxiety it can bring. Too much inflammation can cause neuron degradation. It is something to manage symptoms with. With negative symptoms, you will need to find something that promotes neuron cell growth and to prevent them from dying.

However, living with symptoms can be very difficult and it can be very risky to live for that long with psychotic symptoms.   If I refuse this medication, and I am schizophrenic, will I get worse?    Symptoms generally do not continue to get worse after you have had them for a while, but the circumstances and situation can deteriorate because of the symptoms."

It's not fun to experience, especially when you are stabilized and don't really have hallucinations anymore. I'm not sure I've gotten to the point where I believe this delusion though, as the memory of past hallucinations and delusions are still present in my mind. This is also one of many different delusional thoughts I encounter on a regular basis, so those other delusions help keep me in check with my relative level of sanity.  Keep your head up man. Make sure you are talking with your support people, be they family or professionals (doctors, psychologists, therapists, etc). I've found the best way to cope with my delusional thought is to check my reality against another's. Knowing what someone else who has been around me thinks helps to keep me grounded. You might also want to check out cognative behavioral therapy for coping with delusional thought.

Psychosis is the operative word for me, and I am clinically psychotic. I am f*cked in the head, many people -including one mental health professional- have told me that outright, or indirectly implied it.   Psychosis and schizophrenia are analogous to each other in how they both refer to a condition of the mind/brain which presents through behaviors and persistent mental activity to the point where the patient is unable to exist normally.   ""Schizophrenia"" is not my current diagnosis, but last time I looked at the 4-5 diagnoses on my paperwork, it all adds up to ""schizophrenia"" in terms of co-morbidity, analogs, and/or cross-pollination of spectral traits/attributes. I know I am ""red flagged"" as ""undifferentiated schizophrenic"" in state/federal databases because of an earlier diagnosis.  I agree about TV signals: my TV got put out on the curb last month as a ""freebie"" to a lucky pedestrian; no biggie, it is 4 years old and has low resale value. The TV noise was just to damn much!

Ideally, he could tell you when he is not having an episode. But generally advice is to keep in mind:   Psychosis can make one easily overwhelmed and hypersensitive.  Psychotic symptoms can make one perceive things which are not ""real"", but they are entirely real experiences and the brain does not distinguish reality based on other people's perspectives.  You cannot influence delusions much, as they are generally fixed by definition."

It shows that atypical antipsychotics help correct a chemical deficiency in neurons that was previously over looked. This chemical deficiency is also shown in the study to be correlated with cognative defects in mice. This means that while yes, mice don't experience schizophrenia many of the other associated effects were mitigated by helping to correct this deficiency. Assuming this maps correctly to the human brain it means that new treatment methods for schizophrenia can be developed targeting this deficiency instead of targeting dopamine receptors. However, more research is required before this can be confirmed. There will also be the need for initial human trials to determine the efficacy of such proposed treatment methods.  Edit: also, it appears most of this research is being done at the University level and isn't tied in with big pharma sponsorship.

Longer TL;DR Our synapses don't fire as strongly as those without atypical psychiatric behavior. This is the result of a deficiency of a specific molecule complex found in neurons. Furthermore, atypical antipsychotics are demonstrated to help correct this deficiency. This is interesting because this deficiency is tied to more than one genetic marker, allowing potential treatments for schizophrenia to focus on one root cause instead of focusing on all the different things that many different genetic markers associated with schizophrenia cause. This is also interesting because this chemical deficiency is not what atypical antipsychotics have traditionally been used for correcting.  Edit: Also, more research is required to prove the correlation of all these things before they start to go forward with developing drugs focused on this one neurochemical function."

However, I have had it since early childhood, and it is certainly possible for other people to miss it if one does not actively talk and react to hallucinations or delusions intensely on a daily basis that other people can recognize, because schizophrenia in children seems normal to the child, and it can be indistinguishable from normal childhood imagination and quirks.   Is it possible I've had this shit since I was a small child? I haven't had the courage to tell my psychiatrist until now because of that whole malingering thing.   Yes. Another consideration is that long term symptoms of schizophrenia generally get better when it comes to hallucinations and delusions, however, negative symptoms or cognitive deficits may get worse over time.  If you notice your memory fading or you are unable to properly perceive time or any other cognitive deficits, be sure to note them. They can sneak up on you, but they can be a major problem.  For your psychiatrist, talk about your experiences or make a list, and let him make his own conclusion.  Writing a list or timeline can help clear up the situation."

They can sneak up on you, but they can be a major problem.   I've had a problem with attention, working memory, verbal learning and memory, and executive functions ever since I was little. It was fine when I was 6 and I actually enjoyed learning and going to school then sometime after my 8th or 9th year I felt everything come crashing down. I had trouble learning, my danish, which is a requirement where I live, sucks ass. Problem solving, language, learning, working memory, long term memory,  reasoning, everything is just terrible."

schizophrenia,3c8i5k,yellowcake0,4,Sun Jul 5 22:52:42 2015 UTC,"I'll just write down things I think are important for family to know and you can condense it as you wish. I'm paranoid type so I'm writing this based off of paranoid schizophrenia.   Sometimes we are going to act irrationally. It may upset you. It's not personal, we are not rationalizing properly when we are having a delusion. Be understanding, don't get angry. Same goes for hallucinations.  Medicine is VITAL and it is for the best if the family makes sure it is taken regularly. If it's geared at people who don't understand schizophrenia, maybe write a concise explanation of hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, etc. My family had the hardest time understanding when I was being paranoid. They thought they could just rationalize it to me, but like I said before, the nature of the disease means that when I am experiencing symptoms, I can't entirely ""think"" my way out of it.  Once the person is properly medicated, both the patient and the family should keep an eye out for symptoms to ensure they are getting the best treatment possible.  Don't be scared of us. Be kind, patient, and listen."
schizophrenia,3c8i5k,bklove1,3,Sun Jul 5 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you'd word it but family members of people with mental illness should recognize when they need help too. It's not enough for the person who is diagnosed to be the only one seeing a therapist in the family. Furthermore, family members need to have their needs met and questions answered too."
schizophrenia,3c8i5k,CCarrotTwo,3,Mon Jul 6 00:24:50 2015 UTC,"Do lots of research. Be extremely patient. Don't take things personally (i.e. Delusions, hallucinations, lack of motivation, ahnedonia, etc.), remember that schizophrenia affects people differently."

If your loved one struggling with something you find easy for example, going grocery shopping or being social, appreciate the fact that they are trying their hardest. Its ok to push, but also temper that with acknowledgment of their hardships even if you dont understand it. Tell them you understand its hard, let them know its ok.

schizophrenia,3c9kxd,Pyid,2,Mon Jul 6 04:06:14 2015 UTC,"I fell through the cracks in a different way. 6 years ago when I was first symptomatic things got so bad that I broke and was forcibly hospitalized. While being seen by the shrink she told me that she didn't want to ""ruin my life"" by diagnosing me schizophrenic so she gave me the more ""acceptable"" bipolar diagnosis. She prescribed some meds and began treating me for bipolar. I didn't respond.   Add 4 years and 3 more hospitalizations, all perpetuated by psychotic breaks, and not a single shrink interviewed me or asked me what I thought was going on. One of them even feel asleep during a check-up. They all went off the initial diagnosis and never asked me anything. They continued to treat me for bipolar and I continued to not respond to their treatment.   Add 2 more years and 1 more hospitalization. This time I had done my research and was not going to stay quiet. The temp shrinks that I saw over the weekend all said schizoaffective. I told all of them that I had never had an affect issue. I was never bipolar. And that no one had listened to me. They, surprise surprise, didn't listen to me.  When the full time shrink came in on Monday he saw that I was responding to treatment for schizophrenia but that there were no mood disturbances. He looked through my charts and saw a horrible lack of notes taken during my past hospitalizations. When he asked me about this I told him that no one had ever asked me questions, one shrink told me that she didn't want to ""ruin my life,"" and one shrink even fell asleep during my check-up. He looked at me very intently and started asking me a ton of questions. I responded no to all of them and he said he believed me. Then he asked me about my delusions, disorganized thinking, my hallucinations, my intrusive thoughts, etc. It was incredible to have someone listen to me. He shook his head and I asked him what he was thinking. He said there was not doubt in his mind that I had never had an affect issue.   After he left he upped my dose of my new antipsychotic and came up to me in the common area as he was leaving. He informed me that the group of mental health workers in the ward would meet tomorrow and discuss my diagnosis. He told me that he would make sure they listened and didn't just read my chart.   The following morning they met for 4 hours! It set everything in the ward back and messed up so many peoples schedules. It even affected the required therapy sessions. When they finally came out the shrink that advocated for me came right over to me and said that the reason they had taken so long was because of debate over my diagnosis. Eventually they came to a single decision and, eventually, all agreed that I was schizophrenic.   With the new label they had a new approach towards my treatment. And, as would be expected, I improved dramatically. It's amazing what happens when you're finally treated for the issue you have. Now, 6 months later, I have never been better. I have more good days than bad ones. Yes, I have my breakthrough symptoms, my delusions that I can mostly see through. My auditory hallucinations. But they aren't anything I can't handle. Without Dr. K i wouldn't be a survivor. He made sure I didn't fall through the cracks."

I know this is a fact because it's happened to me. My last hospitalization was perpetuated by excess stress. It was terrible. It was insidious how everything creeped in and presented itself. I was hospitalized for a week and had my meds tweaked. If you feel like you need help don't be afraid to get it. As long as you're not a threat to yourself or others they won't bother wasting a bed in the hospital on you."

schizophrenia,3c918c,shesgonegilligan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:48:51 2015 UTC,"This hospital stay happened in February. The stress had built up over a year and made everything beyond horrible. When I got to the hospital I couldn't name the president or name a single current event. I just sat there and was super disorganized and confused. I came in on a Friday and on Saturday I saw a temporary shrink who prescribed me a new antipsychotic and by the time the full-time shrink came in on Monday I was already feeling better. By the following Friday I was well enough to go home. Now, six months later I have more good days than bad ones."
schizophrenia,3c918c,patternboy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:26:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, professional help is the way to go, but failing that I would recommend you find a good friend who you can report your paranoid thoughts and moods to, who can 'reality check' you and calm you down. Failing all options like therapy or meds (which I would entirely recommend), the only real option is to reduce stress and increase your support network as much as possible. Try to do reality checks on yourself if possible, or confide in good friends or family members.   Also find any ways you can to reduce stress in your life, i.e. identify stressors and try to cut them out if possible. Anything to help regain control and a sense of peace.   Also, if you're drinking a lot of alcohol or taking any stimulants, i.e. coffee, any others, reduce your intake. The stimulants, and withdrawal from alcohol or painkillers, can make psychoses more likely especially under stress."
schizophrenia,3c92fk,ndestinym,3,Mon Jul 6 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"No, there is no ""ramp-up"" or gradual increase, that I know of. It's not like dropping acid and then expecting the next four hours to get stranger and stranger until it magically ""levels off"". It's not like late-stage cancer where it's expected to ""spread"". It's more like being diagnosed with high blood sugar, or high blood pressure-- Oh look, there is something going on. We'll treat it the best we can! For high blood sugar, or high blood pressure-- some people can fix their problems with mild pills, some will need to take stronger meds more regularly. It's not like dementia from aging, or Alzheimer's, where it's expected at all to get worse.  In fact, psychosis gets better SO OFTEN, that they have alternate diagnoses for psychoses that get typically get better-- stress-induced, or drug-induced, for instance.  Believe me, you don't want to have bugs crawling all over your body, and most people here don't have that. You also don't want a permanent belief that you are Jesus Christ or whatever, and again, most people who post here don't have that. There's a huge percentage of schizophrenics who are permanently hospitalized, but that in NO WAY means that any of us here are going to have our conditions escalate to the point where we will end up permanently hospitalized, for God's sake.  There is NO reason to assume in any way, for any reason, that things are going to ""get worse"", especially if you are being diagnosed and therefore getting professional attention. No reason what. so. ever. It is what it is.  There are ultra-high-functioning schizos. There is no reason to believe that you don't have the ""whole treatment"" yet, just because you are not cowering in the corner of your room wearing a tinfoil hat. That's a huge one right there-- government mind control! The government is controlling your mind and monitoring your thoughts, and you are the special one, the great experiment, and maybe they'll have to pay you millions or billions of dollars. That is so common it's actually funny how many people I've met who have believed that (my mom included). That's like,-- mainstream schizo. But are any of us sitting around waiting for the government to control our minds, with a few extra boxes of tinfoil tucked away? Well, maybe hehehe but no, not generally, none of us are sitting around expecting anything to get any worse.  The terrain is what it is. If you find yourself climbing a jagged mountain, then you can say, hey, there are jagged mountains on my path. But until then, you can't just take every corner of the trail you're on, expecting to see cliffs like in the RoadRunner cartoons, or volcanos, or black-sand south sea beaches. It's just the path you're on, and it is what it is. Best of luck."

schizophrenia,3c92fk,0n3tw0,3,Mon Jul 6 02:35:17 2015 UTC,An early diagnosis is good because it catches things before they get out of hand. If things get out of hand you'll know it. Full blown psychosis sucks and you'll know it if it ever happens but you must remember that schizophrenia manifests itself differently in individuals. I'm a paranoid schizophrenic and yes I have break through symptoms but my symptoms are seasoned to me. Your's will be different. Don't worry so much. You're handling this really well.

I was on seroquel before I was diagnosed schizophrenic, so I don't know how to really compare that one. I still take a low dose at night for sleep for the moment but I'd like to stay on it if my psychiatrist permits it because I don't have negative side effects with it. Geodon knocked me out cold everyday, I couldn't even function. I had a terrifying reaction with Haldol where my body contorted into a strange position and my muscles locked up (very, very painful) and my face was doing weird things (muscles tensing and having spasms, and my jaw would go all the way to one side and it felt like it was going to break off the hinges, which of course was also extremely painful (I had to bite a towel to prevent that)  So I'm kind of jaded when it comes to anti-psychotics.

It's also not that anything happens while you're high--while it may aid in short term symptoms, if he would stop smoking (even just start smoking less),  he would almost immediately have an episode. It got to where we just thought, oh, ok, he just needs to keep smoking every day like any other medicine...except the past few years made it clear that episodes were going to happen no matter what, and weed wasn't helping. In fact, it started to amplify the episodes when they did happen. It's not weed as a whole, but the THC. Also, I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that schizophrenia doesn't really manifest fully until your mid 20s. He's 29 now, and the last few years have been progressively worse. Honestly, in summary, I love cannabis and would love for it to work for you. I just urge caution with THC-containing weed, because it can definitely be a trigger for psychosis in the long run if you are already predisposed to it. I'll recommend CBD-heavy strains all day though because I know them to be beneficial. But yeah, like we said already, everyone's different. I guess I'm just being maternal :p"

In any case, when I came out of the worst of the psychosis, my psychiatrist told me I would experience a sense of expansion while the psychosis lifted. This, at least at the time, felt completely wrong. I falteringly tried explaining to the psychiatrist that, no, the boundaries of my world were actually shrinking. In a curious way, my world was disappearing along with the delusions. (Unfortunately for me, my psychiatrist looked at me uncertainly and was ultimately dismissive of my observation)."

Perhaps, if it was a noisy environment, it was relatively easy to confuse the source and content of the sounds (e.g., in a busy restaurant kitchen there is a mixture of noises that can be misinterpreted).   Are the voices in your head identifiably your own? In other words, can you distinguish them as voices emanating from yourself instead of an outside source?"

schizophrenia,3c5s43,wr8ter,2,Sun Jul 5 11:22:06 2015 UTC,"So were there instances in the salon in which, say, you heard a noise, momentarily thought it was a voice in your head, then realised it was simply someone or something in the salon (perhaps the hiss of a hairdryer layered over the voices of the other hairdressers)?   Sorry, the second question wasn't perhaps so clear; but yes, what I meant to ask was whether you knew you were the creator of those thoughts.   When I suffered a severe case of psychosis in 2013 I found playing Tetris to be useful way of managing the symptoms; the simple act of arranging blocks on a screen gave me a level of focus that terminated certain thoughts. In a way, while I was rearranging and deleting blocks on a screen, I was rearranging and deleting mental blocks."
schizophrenia,3c5s43,wr8ter,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:11:56 2015 UTC,"Well, after a while I started paying closer attention, and I would realize that it was nothing/no one around me which creeped me out, but I never thought it would have escalated this way. And no, I don't create them, they kind of just appear in my head. At first I thought everything was normal because it would just be commentary on what I was doing. Then commentary turned into criticism, which turned into scary commands at times.  Basically it just pops in my head, swirls around and does its thing ( sometimes it'll be a song that will continuously replay in my head in a way that's different than having a song stuck in your head) and it'll pass eventually or sometimes it'll be bad and stay.  Rambling again I'm sorry, it just feels nice to talk to someone who understands. Tetris actually sounds like a great idea that I'm gonna try. I've tried playing mindless games to keep my brain busy, but I think because of the fact that I didn't have to concentrate is why it didn't help."

It may be swarms of astral insects, or some kind of mold in family furniture and artifacts, or whatever-- but the family connection is pretty obvious, as such things go.  I know that one data point has no value in statistics, but consider this: Your family has no history. You represent ONE data point. My family has history, and represents AT LEAST FOUR data points (myself, my mom and her sister, their aunt). So it's pretty easy to see how relatively common ~family~ connections, quickly produce very strong statistical data. My four data points tends to out-weigh your one data point, and then when you multiply that by a million, family connections quickly become obvious. That's all I'm saying."

Assuming this is true, holding such an important role as a part of such a social species would create more opportunities for that person to reproduce and having schizophrenic genes would have a distinct advantage in the process of natural selection.  It's also worth mentioning that many schizophrenic delusions have religious themes and some hallucinations may be perceived as religious visions.  Perhaps there used to be an evolutionary advantage in favor of schizophrenia that isn't as pronounced as it used to be and we just haven't noticed it yet.  These sorts of things tend to take quite a bit of time.  Again, I don't have any source information apart from majoring in evolutionary biology.  When I subscribed to this subreddit I was curious about the ""mystic"" and ""shaman"" flairs and looked up a few different articles about schizophrenia and shamanism.  I don't remember exactly what they said or how credible those sources were."
schizophrenia,3c58ct,TeddyGNOP,2,Sun Jul 5 00:13:47 2015 UTC,"My favorite shaman quote is ""Once the shaman climbs the tree, they cannot come back down.""  It seems to me, that it's been very common for tribal shamanism to be described like ""that guy is in a different place, and is totally useful to the community"". As opposed to, for instance, Vedic or catholic priests, or other ""servants"" of their god(s) in other religions. I think that's part of what makes us choose the word ""shaman"" to describe some holy people in their cultures, rather than other terms. It's like functionaries who are somehow connected to some conscious state that is recognized by their culture as being distinct. That's a pretty specific and unique trait, and I can see how it could fit schizophrenia fairly well, as well as drug-induced psychosis."

I think the problem is partly due to the assumption that there is a single, locatable 'schizophrenia gene' that passes through the population. Instead, it appears more likely that there is a cluster of genes (some known about, others yet to be discovered) associated with Schizophrenia (among other traits) that can manifest in a variety of ways depending on epigenetic processes, childhood circumstances, etc.   These genetic clusters may remain in the gene pool because a). they may confer advantages to people who reproduce (perhaps those who have the genes are more likely to be sceptical, can put their suspiciousness to good use, etc.), or b). the genes exist as baggage with no adaptive value and no manifestation: they are simply carried through successive populations.   In any case, the genetic clusters will vary in the way they manifest and the extent to which they affect reproduction."

If given the choice between her freedom and a facility that will take care of her, she might choose to get her act together and do something about her situation. I know it seems insensitive to say that, but recovery and change/development is possible for anyone.   The difficult thing is creating a drive or ambition in your aunt to make changes. Maybe start off by buying her a pet to take care of, so she has some responsibility in her life. From there, help her into a job, then her own place. I know it's simple to write these things and harder in practise, but I really believe that this is the best possible solution.

schizophrenia,3c3zug,rks404,3,Sat Jul 4 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"I think this is going to be the only answer. Schizophrenics often live where social services meet medical care. I once read that something like 80% of the permanent bed space in the U.S. was dedicated to long-term care for schizophrenia and equivalently severe mental illness. And many of us have enjoyed Long-Term Disability income.  Best of luck. It is the same situation for aging hoarders/caretakers, or aging morbidly obese people/caretakers. And then to be less morbid-- as far as the schizophrenic herself-- it's the same situation for dependent/aging diabetics, dependent/aging people with developmental problems, and really any disabling illness.  On the plus side, that means it's a common enough problem that even the most tiny communities in the U.S. aren't far from a larger city or town that has an agency where people deal with the unpleasant work of, for instance, moving hoarders out of unsafe property into state homes, and the more pleasant work for helping people in medical need, also into facilities, whether they are public or private."

schizophrenia,3c1zm3,kirs1132,7,Sat Jul 4 00:47:09 2015 UTC,"I read this article. You don't want to be like this guy. I almost feel pain regarding the way he goes about things.  Why does he have to tell his romantic prospect within hours of meeting her that he has schizophrenia?  This guy is so wrapped up in the label of ""schizophrenia"" that it's defining his entire existence. Sure, schizophrenia can be a big part of our lives and may even be the scariest/most magnificent thing that has happened to us but you have to remember you are an individual first. You are not just the illness.  I think it is rather unattractive to say you are schizophrenic to a normal person within an hour of meeting them. It's almost like you are asking for some kind of special attention or reaction.   This guy says he has faced rejection after rejection and wonders why.  For me, when I dated, I just acted the way I always act. I never brought up my schizophrenia. My girlfriend liked me for who I was and it wasn't until a few months of dating that she noticed I was taking pills all the time and asked me what was up.  It was only then that I told her I had schizophrenia. But notice here: I only told her after she was attracted to me.  Because she was already attracted to me, she took the time to understand what schizophrenia really is. She also understood after dating me for a few months what I was actually like.   Of course when she told her sister I was schizophrenic, her sister chastised her and told her she was crazy to date me because schizophrenics are violent and ""murderous"" and I might ""injure"" her.   But again, by this time, she was already attracted to me and defended me against her sister.   If she did not already care about me, I do not know if she would have been so strong in telling her sister that she was wrong about schizophrenics.  Needless to say, 6 months later, she's still with me and schizophrenia is not an issue because I never made it one.  The guy in this article almost looks like he wants it to be an issue. Why else would you bring it up as a topic of discussion within an hour of meeting a stranger? How is a normal person of the population supposed to react when you tell them you have schizophrenia?  Furthermore, of all your great traits you could talk about, why in the world would you choose a touchy subject like schizophrenia?  The author of the article even writes, ""Dating when you are a big dude with a serious mental illness is nearly impossible."" It's not impossible. You are making it impossible by inappropriately relating yourself to potential romantic partners and making it uncomfortable for them. Does he ever ask himself why they need to take a ""bathroom break"" every time he tells them he has schizophrenia? He needs to stop.   If you are still reading this, here is my advice: Don't be like this guy.  Dating with schizophrenia is not ""nearly impossible."" Schizophrenia is not your sole defining characteristic. We all have great traits and abilities to offer other human beings.   If you want success dating while having schizophrenia, just be yourself and don't force it into the relationship until it naturally comes up. By that time, your romantic partner can make an informed decision about whether or not you are ""crazy"".  If they care about you, they will look past the schizophrenia and be understanding. If it becomes an issue for them and they drop you, then they probably were not good human beings to begin with.   But whatever you do, don't be like this guy and make schizophrenia your main, defining characteristic and force the issue on an unsuspecting stranger within an hour of meeting them. That is just asking for rejection."

If they care about you, they will look past the schizophrenia and be understanding. If it becomes an issue for them and they drop you, then they probably were not good human beings to begin with.   I think the main issue is that a lot of people end up believing the rhetoric that if you don't tell people far in advance, you're somehow  'misleading' them, and that people are then totally justified to break up with/hate/throw tomatoes at you (instead of looking at their own biases). I don't agree with this, but a lot of people will."

When you tell someone you have schizophrenia before they get to know you this becomes your defining characteristic.  I don't share my schizophrenia diagnostic with people. It is need to know.   I also learned the price of sharing this with my reddit account. A big reason why I joined reddit was /r/schizophrenia and to talk about schizophrenia. Well i also use this account on the rest of reddit and I get a lot of grief from people when they learn I have this illness.

schizophrenia,3c1zm3,shekib82,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:56:48 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. You shouldn't reveal to your date that you have schizophrenia until they get to know you more. It's an illness that is highly stigmatize and most people will not be understanding.  With that said, I think it was a little bit harder for him to hide his mental illness as he made a career on writing about it. His dates usually ask him how did he get started in his career. At that point, he feels like he has to reveal his mental illness. I feel sorry for him.  My advice to him would be to fib a little to go around the issue of a diagnosis. He can say that he's interested in mental illness because people with mental illnesses are often the most marginalized, victimized, and stigmatized group of people. And he can say he's especially interested in schizophrenia because it's the most severe mental illness with probably the most misunderstanding and misconceptions. He could try to come up with other reasons of why he started his career to tell his dates. But I do think he's in especially a hard situation. I'm in a easier position to choose not to reveal my illness as I didn't make a career out of it."

Environmental factors later in life (during early childhood and adolescence) can either damage the brain further and thereby increase the risk of schizophrenia, or lessen the expression of genetic or neurodevelopmental defects and decrease the risk of schizophrenia.

Most importantly, how they are empowered, and how a person can reduce that power to the point where ""demons"" vaporize and/or suffer banishment:   I am no longer actively Christian, but I converted my spiritual warfare practices into ""psychological warfare"" techniques through modification of some other stuff I know about. No spiritual entity, god, deity, demon, angel, or ""evil spirit"" can ever mess with me; I will crush everyone one of them."
schizophrenia,3byvc0,sikfoq,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:55:05 2015 UTC,"Clearly your father has no clue what to do with a mentally ill child.  This is very unfortunate as you need to go see a doctor who will likely put you on an anti psychotic which will help the hallucinations quite a bit.  Anytime a child claims to be sick, they likely are in one way or another.  Mentally healthy people don't just make this stuff up.  Try to push your father to let a qualified psychiatrist see you."
schizophrenia,3by883,Lilly_jen,3,Fri Jul 3 03:32:46 2015 UTC,"I used to get them a lot including sexual ones. (I'd feel like something is touchin' mah dick. Why would a disembodied entity be touchin' mah dick?) I also used to get the feeling like something was growing out of my taint and then trying to ""steal"" my testicles which would make me impulsively grab them. There would also be things playing with my hair. Then I only got tactile hallucinations waking up or falling asleep while on benzodiazepines for sleep. Suddenly it went away after a while and I don't think it was meds. I don't know what to say other than you just have to tolerate it somehow. Hopefully you'll grow out of it like I did. Are you on any meds?"

schizophrenia,3by883,lvl99light,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:06:22 2015 UTC,"Can you be more specific describing the touching like was it a wolf or a spider? was it sharp, soft, energy, pressure, hot, cold.  Let me go first: One night listening to the Mormon Channel a new program started and immediately caught my attention. It was like they were talking in my delusions. I forget the initial feeling, but this is pretty much how it went down.  The energy was already inside me or could feel tiny dots of energy  on my skin.  A few steps away from the bed, the voice said come back and my internal organs seemed to worked for him. It probably was the same feeling of you almost nearly having a heart attack. It was painless and easy to lay back down. There was never a sharp pain. The heart slowed it self after laying back down. The ring leader than proceeded to introduce his six guest. While each guess spoke it was like the energy was engulfing each organ with a different vibration. There was a ball of energy moving up my spine and it took some time to pass the lower part. The ball then dispersed into liquid flowing in my brain. It didn't touch reach one part of my brain. The creeping started to retreat after it started to draw to much of my attention despite how interesting the voice was. Back down the spine. The heart started beating at a different tempo than before as the ring leader explained what he found and what I must do. It was really simple what he wanted me to do: Build a Church. Besides knowing that I have the 12 keys of the priesthood, I later recognized that as a kundalini awakening experience.   I obsess over searching for knowledge. I may not directly recall anything about crawling feelings, but I do have people I can turn to for you. I do have a book for you to check out: John Dies at the end. There is a drug called soy sauce and some can see things out of the corner of their eyes.   wow I feel awful every time I post something because it goes from neatly spaced to clumped.

schizophrenia,3c0bzn,Cedrichendrix92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm not making this clear enough. There's a differnce between someone talking while they are drunk and someone talking jumbled disorganized nonsense. Maybe he was having some sort of episode, I don't know. I came here for something helpful, not for you to just assume alcoholism.   One of my childhood friends developed shizophrenia while I was growing up with him. You know made his symptoms flare? Simply Smoking way too much weed. If his  doctor was to assume that he was only acting irrational with a variety of other paranoid symptoms only because he was a pothead, you'd think he was incompetent."
schizophrenia,3bxq8x,Lilly_jen,9,Fri Jul 3 00:49:04 2015 UTC,"If your doctor didn't explain exactly why she said no, find a new doctor.  Stimulants as general rule aren't good to get started on, but if it drastically improved your quality of life I'd say it's worth pursuing. There are psychiatrists who are more liberal in prescribing stimulants, so shop around to different doctors if this really helps you."

I asked her two days ago about prescribing me it and she said no. She said I would eventually get paranoid and I can't use it long term, but that she would consider giving it to me for tests in the future. As a compromise, she gave me 100 mg Wellbutrin. So far, I like the Wellbutrin. I feel stimulated and sharper.  I'm pretty sure I have ADD or Aspergers or both (was diagnosed with Aspergers but not ADD and not every health care professional agrees with my diagnosis of Aspergers). On top of that, I think I have auditory processing disorder due to (or worsened) by schizo-affective disorder. To ameliorate the side effects of the anti psychotics and possibly ADD, I drink coffee or energy drinks every day. I notice nicotine also helps.   I'm kind of worried that adderall can cause paranoia but I think it's worth trying once because I can't stand the negative symptoms. I want to lose weight, feel sharper, and have energy."

schizophrenia,3bxq8x,cardboardbox92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:27:36 2015 UTC,"I am prescribed Adderall. Just use it responsibly because there is a thing as amphetamine-induced psychosis, but you need to take a lot of them for that. I have noticed that it's not a good idea to take Adderall when I was trying to stop taking my olanzapine, so there's that. I've been on every ADHD medication since I was diagnosed at 5 years old except Vyvanse and Desoxyn though.. so it was probably just an overload of dopamine with the absence of dopamine receptors in the brain due to the olanzapine.  I was off my ADHD medication for 3 years after enlisting in the Marine Corps when my first psychotic episode happened, so the ADHD medication wasn't a direct cause of it. My psychiatrist I was seeing after my hospital trip said Adderall would help my negative symptoms also."

Have you ever considered medical marijuana? Fun topic to research. You'll have to go to a ""Green doctor"" for one of these scripts, if your state allows it. adderall almost ruined my life a few times. However, we're the type of people that likes to test ourselves with STIMS. Adderall will be useful to have but I wouldn't take it daily unless you're eating right, properly exercising, have a creative outlet and your work/school life greatly benefits from it. They don't know the long term effects on it, but do what you got to do. It might be healthier than drinking a pot of coffee a day.  Sorry to hear you're suffering from voices daily. This may be a wild idea but have you considered listening to instrumentals? https://youtu.be/5jvEQAE3uFo  Maybe your voices will appreciate a constant tune throughout the day.  https://youtu.be/O7q6JXkS7Lw  I would try to train them by researching stuff like the Melchizedek Method and the Art of Charm podcast. Maybe feed them some kundalini binaural beats, chakra correction beats and listen to the Mormon channel because they share some very heart felt stories that softened my heart. When I received my laying on the hands from my Mormon church I felt like a demon in my subconscious was dispelled.  youtu.be/t4CMGvb3nIA has helped me be more conformable with interactions with others."

schizophrenia,3bw6j3,lvl99light,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:52:00 2015 UTC,My point is:  Violent people represent the rare extremes of those with psychosis.

schizophrenia,3bw6j3,Cedrichendrix92,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:58:21 2015 UTC,"And people are called ""thugs"" when they're a black person commiting violence. The world is made up of illusions. See past them. The point is, violence is violence. I don't care if you're psychotic or not. At the end of the day, you choose to commit a violent act. Insanity is nothing but a legal term and isn't even applied in psychology. But violence is rarely caused by psychosis. It's usually caused by hate."

Some people are driven by both psychosis and their dark inner selves to commit crimes. Some people are driven by the way they interpret their religions and their dark inner selves and others toward terrorism.

schizophrenia,3bvjef,shesgonegilligan,3,Thu Jul 2 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"Is this just delusional thinking or something else or both?   It is probably not a delusion.   My eyes have to continuously read and reread and then reread some more.    This sounds like cognitive deficits.    All of this has me deeply saddened and I can't make sense of it. Any feedback or knowing I'm not alone would certainly help.    Cognitive deficits are the often overlooked serious outcome of schizophrenia. People focus on delusions and hallucinations and forget that the disorder usually brings an alternation of cognitive functions.  It is essential to recognize any cognitive deficits you have. They can be disabling and confusing.   I find we cannot really do anything to ""treat"" them, but we can strive to keep learning new things and exercising.   I have had terrible short term memory for a long time, and the trick is to get things into long term memory. It does take some repetition, but it can be possible.   It is like the brain is ""slippery"" and new information does not stick immediately.  I have dysgraphia, so my handwriting is always bad and uncomfortable, and I avoid writing with pens now so I do not know how it was affected, but memory and sensation of time can be severely affected in my personal experience."
schizophrenia,3bvjef,JosephFaolan,2,Thu Jul 2 14:38:12 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! It's really disheartening having these things happen. Before I broke it was never this way. I read two or three books a week while rereading my favorite Lovecraft stories.   You're extremely right about the fact that we should keep learning new things and exercising our minds. I've recently rediscovered TED talks and watch them when I'm feeling thirsty for some new things.

Audio books, videos, etc, can help. Reading a novel may be difficult, but I think there are many more options we can use to the same effect.

schizophrenia,3bvjef,BlankUsername42,2,Thu Jul 2 15:15:30 2015 UTC,I've had periods like that. At times it reached the point I could read nothing at all. It when I was most symptomatic and improved greatly when getting on the right meds. Took a long time to happen though.
schizophrenia,3bvjef,BlankUsername42,2,Thu Jul 2 14:57:43 2015 UTC,"My experience has been that my reading comprehension and retention has improved as time has progressed from when I initially started to struggle with schizoaffective disorder. I felt a lot like you do now when I first began to realize that my symptoms weren't just from smoking a lot of pot. It really sucked but it has gotten better with meds and practice. I personally don't really read much fiction, but reading stories and longer articles is something that is possible for me now where as it wasn't really an option several years ago. Honestly part of it is making sure that I am trying to read, if I am not exerting that part of my brain it seems like it atrophies."

schizophrenia,3bvjef,BlankUsername42,3,Thu Jul 2 16:26:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and again I feel that part of it was that I hadn't done much reading for a year or two, only really basic stuff. I honestly couldn't tell you all the factors included and which ones were the most influential, but I can tell you that it really sucked and I could barely form sentences in my mind from text for awhile. It was really interesting because I would think that something or someone was trying to communicate to me through written text, as if the words had no predefined structure relative to each other and that the structure of the sentence was in flux depending on what this outside entity was trying to communicate to me. I might also point out that my schizoaffective was brought out prominently for me as a result of smoking a lot of pot in my late adolesence, and I feel that this also contributed to what it was that I experienced at the onset of my schizoaffective."
schizophrenia,3bvjef,autowikibot,2,Thu Jul 2 16:34:11 2015 UTC,Whoa. I've had some delusions that there was a message meant only for me buried in the combination of words. I know that is a delusion and steered away from a lot of texts because of that. It just seems to be going the way /u/JosephFaolan mentioned with the cognitive defects.
schizophrenia,3bvjef,lvl99light,2,Thu Jul 2 16:52:31 2015 UTC,"I would like to emphasize that cognitive defects are by no means permanent. In some cases there is damage that causes these defects to be permanent but the brain is very plastic and tends to adapt to things fairly well. Here is an article that might give you hope:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity  I feel a bit cruel for linking a text, but its the best I can do right now as I wait in a game lobby for a video game to start. Like you said above, for me things have gotten better by just being too stubborn to accept that I couldn't read and forcing the act of reading on myself. Practice helped and over time I have been able to regain most of my reading and writing capabilities. I honestly feel that I compose with written word better now than I did before the onset of my schizoaffective. There are times where I have a greater comprehension than others (for example right now I'm still a bit tired and spacy, so comprehension isn't exactly the greatest) but I no longer have experiences where reading is not possible at all."

Like when my psychosis stabilizes, my seizures cease or reduce in intensity as well. Depression, a little different for me though. Anyway since everything is so connected, it makes you wish there's one type of med that could work on everything. I wish there's something like that.  Btw so with schizoaffective disorder, you don't have the cognitive or disorganized problems? You're the first person I know who has it, so I'm not that informed, sorry haha."
schizophrenia,3bvsm7,DoctorHorowitz,2,Thu Jul 2 15:40:29 2015 UTC,"I'm just worried that these delusions about me will stick somehow and she won't trust me again.    Delusions do not ""stick"" if the psychotic episode ends (by itself or through drugs). However, recurring episodes will likely involve the same delusions.  People who have had psychotic episodes may be embarrassed or confused by it all.   Her family isn't helpful. I was told to lose her number and I'd never get to speak to her again.   I think this situation is more complicated than your friend's psychotic break."
schizophrenia,3bvsm7,JosephFaolan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:28:51 2015 UTC,Yes the family situation is more complicated than the break.   But thank you.    If that doesn't stick I know I'll hear from her again.    Just don't know when.
schizophrenia,3bvsm7,jkeller4000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:51:21 2015 UTC,"josephFaolan knows more about this than i do. (so my comment may be completely false)  I will say i still have a hard time around nurses because they were the primary focus of my delusions when i was hospitlized, they had turned away someone i really wanted to see.(the person never really was there i was just delusional).     The memories do not suddenly dissappear.  however with a good therapist your friend will learn how to let the memories formed while psychotic not effect the future.    so i am saying if you still want to be your friends friend you can be; it may be difficult but it would make life much easier for your friend.  who told you lo lose the number?  I know there have been several times i have told a friend to never talk to me again.  but she does not listen and calls me anyways a few days or weeks later. and i do tell them i am mad at them for not listening but i am secretly happy they called."

Take some time to collect yourself and try to contact her in a week (most hospital stays are five days). If she's still delusional don't argue with her. Just inform her that you see things differently. My wife uses that line when I'm caught in a delusion.

I get an innocent Idea in my head and just start to think about it and all of a sudden it blows up into this giant thing.  Then it's when the voices give me some idea which they escalate into something bigger.   Then there is also just sensory things that trigger. I taste my medications and they taste sweet or bitter, then they are either sugar pills or poison.   Being around kids also triggers. Then I start believing that everyone thinks I'm a child molester.   Then there was the big one. last month I asked here if my doctor could think I'm lying and someone asked me if I thought he could believe me to be malingering. That escalated into this huge thing that lasted for 3 weeks straight. I was constantly asking my parents if they thought I was lying about my illness.   I've also had a drug induced delusion. Where as a we were 5 smoking weed and I got really sick and was convinced they had poisoned me. To this day I still believe they had done it. On some level I know it to be bullshit but I still cant shake the feeling."

I've somehow convinced myself that I'm subconsciously making all of this up, and that I'm thinking myself into being sick. I was prescribed medication, but I can't bring myself to take it because I legitimately believe I'm subconsciously making it all up and lying to everyone. It's clearly not true to anyone else, but it's so hard to shake. I keep trying to gather facts to convince myself I'm actually sick so I will take the meds. I mean, I'm hallucinating, but I still think I'm subconsciously lying? Ugh."
schizophrenia,3bsmf3,RusselDunbar,3,Thu Jul 2 03:38:50 2015 UTC,"Does feeling like you're constantly lying have a word or description? I like words for things, it makes everything more stable and concrete.   Edit: you have no idea how much better having words and validation would feel. I don't trust myself and my brain basically has no words at the moment that I can use to describe the feeling out loud to others."

I convinced myself I was just making it all up. I was just creating this illness in my head. But I talked with my family doctor and then my psychiatrist and they both said that they didn't believe my delusion and that's all it was, just a delusion. That I was actually sick. That calmed me down a lot but I do still get the idea in my head that I'm just making it all up. I just ask my mom if she thinks so also and she says no, I don't think so and it usually calms me a little. I just sum it up into an episode and try to ignore it the best I can. That doesn't always work but what can you do?  But I'd always take my medication, That and talking about the delusions and hallucinations are the only thing that work with coping with it all.   EDIT: I actually have a little idea how it feels like having a word over things. I basically self-diagnosed myself with schizophrenia in order to feel a little better. Feeling like I belong to a group and having a diagnoses in the form of a word other than psychosis makes this so much more bearable. I was actually diagnosed once with the S-word by a psychologist but I didn't think much of it since they're not doctors but my psychiatrist doesn't want to say the S-word tho."

Seeing that my adult world was constructed in my imagination and psychotic revelations I have responded to various things that I had believed to be true at the time I was asked to answer a question. Often when I'm asked the same question I give a different answer. This goes beyond ambivalence at times and boils down to the fact that when I talked to the person before I had created an alternate mindset where the other answer was true. It's really frustrating because it often makes me look like I'm lying.   I've also had issues with false sensory input making me believe things.
schizophrenia,3bsmf3,cardboardbox92,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"For me it's so far generally started out as implausible fantasies, which then become more and more real.

My entire battalion got reorganized and my new platoon had a lot of attractive females in it. I started to believe they hated me and had a secret plan to sabotage me. Of course then I had no idea what was happening to me, so I hid my feelings and kept my head down.  I finally had a chance to put my top secret clearance to use as my platoon got moved to the G-2 section at the II MEF headquarters building. It was a really cool experience getting to forecast weather all around the world and brief the Colonel every week... but I started to get bad. I started to think that Russians had the place bugged and I had this obsession with shredding all my papers regardless of their classification, along with the previous delusion. It took about a year until people realized I needed to be hospitalized after my mom passed away.  I think I've always been a little mistrustful of women I don't know. I've had a lot of shitty girlfriends, and especially after I lost my mom, these awful thoughts always pop in my head and sometimes I feel like I can't control them.

Perceptual distortions suck, but at least you don't suffer from complete loss of reality like schizophrenics do. I know that I might get some really bad ideas of reference but it just takes the opinion of someone else for me to test reality and realize I was wrong all the time.  I don't understand people either and this is why I spend most of my time alone. I can actually be really productive once I get started on something, since I don't have social media to distract me. If only employers realized that...  You might have a formal diagnosis now, but it's not gonna change the world. If you've managed to survive the troubles of daily routine so far, you will survive in the future.  About your medication issues, have you told your psychiatrist that SSRIs cause bad side effects for you? This is important information that he must know so he can suggest you some other form of medication."

schizophrenia,3bt12v,sikfoq,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"Hi! Thanks for responding.  Yeah, dysthymia is what they're calling it, I've been depressed for a long time.  I've been telling myself I should feel lucky.  I'm not a full on schizophrenic, even if I go through a lot of what they experience and of all the personality disorders, I would choose this one if I had to pick one.  Through my darkest periods, with hallucinations and paranoia, I guess I was afraid that I was schizophrenic and that might be why I avoided treatment for so long.  I'm worried now because my life is so unstable.  A few years ago I owned a house, I had a good job, I had a routine and I felt like an adult.  I had gone a few years with no symptoms other than winter depression, some isolated times, and a few seizures.  And now, with this new phase of great adventure, I feel like I'm just falling apart.  Even good things feel awful.  I got promoted and I now deal with lots of people in a PR setting and I worry that if my bosses found out, they would almost have to fire me.  How do you handle loneliness?  I've always been... I don't know, an outgoing loner?  It takes me about two years to make a friend that I'm reasonably sure can stand spending time with me and any geographical distance between us and I just let the friendship lapse.  Two years of constant movement and that's winnowed my friendships down to almost nothing.    I have told them about my past prescriptions, and I told them I want to wait to take any SSRIs at all.  So far, I've refused any prescriptions.  Previously when I went in for treatment, I was always treated skeptically because I refer to myself as an addict, or a junkie, when I'm feeling particularly ashamed of myself.  This is the first group of doctors to ever disagree with that self assessment.  I just have this fear that as soon as I accept a prescription, they're going to say, ""Ah hah!  We knew it."" and bounce me right out the door, treatment over.  It's almost funny, because they've told me they're fine with my continuing two of the three drugs I abuse, and they just want to replace my ketamine I use to quiet negative and suicidal ideation with Risperdal.  Talking about this seems like it might be against the subs rules, and I do have an appointment tomorrow where I'm planning on agreeing to prescriptions, I'm just scared."
schizophrenia,3bt12v,istillhavenoaccount,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:15:38 2015 UTC,"Dysthymia's not fun.   I know what it's like to be psychotic, I experienced the same when I was in school. When I started to realize I'm hearing voices, I knew something is really, really wrong with me.  I was never really ""functional"", though that was partly due to my awful childhood. School was more or less a catastrophe, I blew up at the smallest things, I was even about to be locked away in an institution for violent children. Though my ability to handle life and people certainly became worse in the last few years/months; people give me panic attacks now. As for the job, I don't think it's legal to fire a person due to a medical diagnosis, but I'm not a lawyer.  I'm mostly fine with being alone. I'm a quite introverted person and need time alone to recover from the day. School (or work, I guess, though I never actually had employment so I can't tell) are so draining that I can do nothing else but sleep and recover for the rest of the day. I can't really make new friendships due to my paranoia and I don't get along with most people anyway since I'm so sensitive. The few people I do get along with are themselves mentally ill in some way, so they know how to handle me.  Hmm... those were certainly not the best terms to use in front of medical people, and you probably managed to give them a negative picture of yourself. Do you realize Risperdal's not an SSRI? It's an atypical antipsychotic which is also used to treat schizophrenia. I can understand why you're scared, but it probably won't be as bad as you're expecting it to be."
schizophrenia,3bt12v,istillhavenoaccount,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:43:55 2015 UTC,"Truth.  I've only heard voices a few times, and for me it's like an angry radio program in another room in the house.  Anxiety inducing.  I guess that's the thing.  In my old job, I never spoke to anyone, I'd never even met my boss.  I just monitored things.  If nothing went wrong, no one needed to know I existed, and I made sure nothing went wrong.  Now, a new regime has come in, and they're realizing I know a lot about the stuff I monitor and I have to talk to people and attend meetings.  When I talk to people, I wonder if they're being intentionally obtuse or treating me like I'm stupid sometimes to goad me.  I know I shouldn't talk like that to doctors, but I feel so awkward and embarrassed and I can't help it.  It's always a problem.  I have to just keep my mouth shut or I'll say the worst things.  I've read up on Risperdal, and I guess my fear is that depression makes it hard enough to get out of bed, and I seem like a lightning rod for the worst side effects."

Often, I can't understand others because they're so vague and don't express what they actually want. As if I'm somehow expected to figure it out myself.  I've gotten myself in trouble a couple of times by saying things without realizing what consequences it would have. How would I know that expressing suicidal tendencies on the Internet means they're actually gonna lock me away for my own safety? As for your medication, you can always try it out and if it's really that bad, you can talk to your psychiatrist to switch to something else."

Voices for me are like a subconscious manifestation when our ability to rationalize breaks down. Voices are like our ability to predict what someone will say next and what emotional state we are in. Just a theory...  Like personality, our brains are a neuro biology system that make us who we are. Sometimes that system isnt completely functioning as it should. Its neurogedenerative disorder. The voices are just one symptom in what appears when our brain system breaks down.  Take this with a grain of salt. Im no neuroscientist."
schizophrenia,3bs59t,joesavu,2,Wed Jul 1 18:56:03 2015 UTC,"Well there is a rather clear distinction between ""hearing"" and ""imagining"".   Whereas hearing is something that you do with your sensory organ and imagining is anything that doesn't come in through the senses but is generated by the mind, or only crudely based on sensory information. If I see some flicker in the corner of my eye for example, that is real. However if I spin my head as far as to conclude it was a ghost, or if I actually visualized this image of a ghost somehow, that is imagination. In schizophrenia it seems to me that there is too much imagination and somehow not enough ability to draw rational conclusions. E.g. if a voice tells you that you need to pass the challenge of becoming an adult, and you then complete this challenge by splitting an egg on an altar (about an actual story I once read), then that is entirely out of place. The cause of the problem wasn't in your perception (i.e. that you were hearing a voice), but in the interpretation of the problem and the then following conclusion. If I was just having this internal dialogue, that tells me I need to become an adult, then maybe I will just consider it somehow and that was that.  Then again, normal people act irrational as well and with most schizophrenic people I have known and read from online, not being able to draw rational conclusions isn't really that much if at all out of range."
schizophrenia,3bs59t,joesavu,2,Wed Jul 1 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"I see where you are getting at. So we have this prefrontal cortex (PFC) thing that is our main decision making center, it is how we rationalize how we see the world to navigate through it. Just like anyone else, everyone has different levels of connectivity to give us our abilities to make good (or bad decisions). This is also the area where if we do not recall the correct scenario from what we learn from growing up, we end up with false rationalization. Because this breaks down in schizophrenics, we end up with delusions and come up with crazy ideas to make sense of what we are processing in our environment. The PFC also filters out excess noise around your environment so you can focus on what is important. However, with schizophrenics, they cannot filter out these things so they process everything together. The occasional imagined provoked fear becomes something like voices. The voices manifest from the other side of the brain so they can pretty much come up with their own ideas based on how you are feeling. The other side of the brain where the PFC is not working properly to filter this noise out.  So other brain systems are affected too because it is a nedegenerative disorder."
schizophrenia,3bs59t,joesavu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"Also psychosis exacerbates the PFC until it completely fails. That is why it is important to maintain neuroplasticity to other areas in the brain with drugs that enable it, like lithium."

Part of what makes it hard for people are voices telling you they are real. They will come up with every excuse. In about 10 years with this disease, there really isn't anything I will fall for. Aliens, Telepathy, God, Ghosts, Demons, there really aren't enough ways to magically think left to trick me.   Another problem with delusions, is your brain will reject all evidence that proves you wrong. Just like the internet is letting people only get news from the perspective they already believe. Your brain can cherry pick a reality that you believe completely. Anyone who tries to tell you different or treat you is an enemy of the voices. It is terrifying when things fall apart and you were so wrong.   It can be addictive, because they make your feel special and important. Anyone in this forum, is less dangerous than someone who will not let let themselves be labeled as sick. There are people who spend their whole lives not trusting doctors and believing the universe revolves around them. They are also given all the evidence to support that."

The word-loop was ""...difficulties...difficulties...difficulties..."", like a signal transmitted into my brain. The experience was odd, distinct, unlike a song lyric looping in my head.   I have heard disembodied voices as well as my own brain emitting gibberish, words unrelated to my current experience of the moment, as well as specific words with definitive associations in response to people, places, things, situations arrayed in a cloud of data points representing memory, perception of memory, and real time sensual feeds.   My brain is able to communicate with ""me""; it is related to how our unconscious asserts itself during sleep, dreams. Psychosis is a hernia like rupture in the dividing line between conscious mind/unconscious mind. Schizophrenia is a 3d spectrum -variable for each person, their day, time periods, general circumstances- plottable as well with a giant data cloud of coordinated points.

But I like the idea of sharing my problems and having some feedback about it.   But I gather it might cost me, so I am not sure about it.   This said, coping is my own method. I have managed well and I don't think a therapist will help.   What I describe in the OP are rare moments of anxiety that the stress of life throws at me. And it is just part of life to deal with them. I don't think I can learn it from someone else. Especially at this point."

schizophrenia,3bqwjm,valleyspirit,2,Wed Jul 1 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"Medication is just one part of my current stability. Most importantly, I am lucky to have a strong aversion to alcohol, the party scene, and various behaviors I was known for during a long time period of substance abuse. Before I took my 1st drink, I was already psychotic/depressive/retarded, so 15-20 years of substance abuse did not help matters much.  I like my medication because it works; I think it suits me because of my general attitude, itself supported by mindfulness, cognitive behavioral exercises, exercise, hatha yoga postures, meditation, fun hobbies, diet, and consistent sleeping patterns.   If a person is not healthy to begin with in how certain factors are deficient, abnormal, or dysfunctional, then meds will have a different effect.   That is my experience; your doctor may say something different."

They can change, but generally over long periods of time, or during somewhat regular episodes.   I know someone who had drug induced psychosis (he had multiple medical conditions, no history of psychosis, and he was prescribed various drugs and they had a reaction). He had a bunch of psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions and thought disorder.  After the drugs were fixed, he went back to normal.  A while later, I guess the same drugs were introduced again, and he had the same psychotic reaction, but the symptoms were continuous from the previous episode! It was very interesting.  I guess our brains have their own set pattern when psychosis starts."
schizophrenia,3borvw,JosephFaolan,2,Wed Jul 1 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard here it is fairly normal. I used to hallucinate conversations with my friends so my voices then weren't exactly a fixed set, but definitely had a specific definition and form. As time has gone on, cognitive behavioral therapy and meds have helped make my auditory hallucinations almost go away completely and they did gradually become less defined and more vague over that period of time. I have been very fortunate in my journey to have been able to mitigate many of the negative aspects of my mental health disgnoses."

schizophrenia,3borvw,Thatinsanity,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:35:23 2015 UTC,"Normal, and not odd at all, for schizos. Most I have met have consistent mental spaces they struggle through. Over months or years or decades these spaces often significantly change or evolve, and then the older versions will still re-appear or sometimes dominate again.  If personX down at the free clinic sometimes has nameless in his head, making him slam his fist into the wall, and then sometimes has Jimi Hendrix in his head, then sometimes primarily sees dead people who aren't trying to control him-- then personX may learn to ""change channels"" between different spaces, in order to control his days and his ability to function.   I would say that sometimes a psychotic space is as consistent as the house and the town you live in-- but for some people it's more like, as consistent as the familiar room you spend most of your time in, but there are other rooms which are consistent as well.  I agree with Joseph that our brains seem to have their own patterns when psychosis starts. However, it doesn't take long in this subreddit to realize that there are statistically, many commonalities in these psychotic spaces, which are shared by countless schizos. For instance,-- Shallow, cruel voices trying to convince us that everyone is reading our mind, and that somehow we are special, or especially tragic. As a random example. Unpleasant intrusive thoughts which happen in an environment of ""other people know they are happening"", as another random example."

schizophrenia,3bn1q5,korbatundra,9,Tue Jun 30 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"Firstly it's better to live with someone than on the streets, even if you don't get along well.  Couch surf until you have a better place (shelters also work if they're available but I wouldn't count on it).  At a minimum this means you have access to running water which makes getting back into your own place a lot easier (being well groomed).  If you're on the streets scope out more than one place to crash for the night.  You'll get booted from several before you find a ""safe"" spot more than likely.  Bridges really are some of the best.  Wooded areas are spectacular if you have some gear.  A small personal shelter is cheap (if you've got any cash) and can be easy to conceal.  Don't count on anything not being stolen.  If you have any valuables leave them in a storage shed/safety deposit or worst case someone you trust (No one is totally trustworthy).  Heat and water are your biggest outdoor issues.  Find some water access before you're homeless.  Parks have some and you may even find public showers near pools or in state parks etc but they'll usually be shut off in winter.  If you've got any income (SSI etc) then bottled water will eat up some of it.  Find hot spots before winter, you'll need to know them.  When you walk around, dress nice and be clean.  People won't even know you're homeless if you dress well and how people treat you is about half (maybe more) of the issue with being homeless...otherwise it's glorified camping.    Emergency rooms will sometimes let you hang out for a few hours and this is made easier if you're clean and presentable (remember access to water!).  Be friendly with police but don't chat them up if they're pissed off and giving you orders to move, just move.  If you go into stores for warmth or A/C buy something, anything, to give them an excuse to leave you alone.  If you can make friends with the labor someplace they'll totally take care of you, but only if you don't regularly abuse their assistance.  Remember, heat and water.  It's either too hot or too cold and you'll always need water.  The rest comes to you.  Shelter is a bitch but you'll find places to hole up and rest and steam tunnels/vents are a godsend in the winter.  Nearly abandoned playgrounds are great if you can avoid being seen.  Your #1 move is to no longer be homeless.  Don't cry over lost/stolen items, it's just going to happen...just get yourself a new home even if it's a group home or w/e.  Luck."

schizophrenia,3blu85,Nerow1,5,Tue Jun 30 07:06:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't attribute them to parts of your personality. I would defer to being as kind to your ""self"" as you can, and just acknowledge the dysfunction without totally owning it.  They are definitely a part of schizophrenia, in my experience. For instance, in the extreme case, imagine someone who is always feeling like bugs are crawling all over their skin, and they are barely able to stop thrashing around on the floor clawing at their skin. If they actually thought the bugs were there, that would be a delusion, correct? What if they knew they weren't there, but still couldn't stop their mind from feeling them crawling all over, and seeing them burrow into their skin, all during the day? At what point does that stop being a delusion, and start being a sensory hallucination? Ok, then temper it down a bit, and what if they have managed to control the ~sensations~ of the crawling and burrowing, but all day long, they can't get the ~images~ and the brief flashes of feelings out of their mind. That is the sort of intrusive thoughts that many many schizos have that I have known, including myself and my mom. For instance, years ago, there was a homeless man at one of the shelters in a town who always talked about ""fluffy buns"", because as much as he HATED the whole thing-- he was always imagining a big, fat naked woman sitting on his shoulders, pressing on him in all kinds of ways, and for years, he couldn't shake it, it wouldn't go away, etc. If people asked him about his state of mind, he'd tell them. Those are not the intrusive thoughts that ""everyone gets"", those are straight-down-the-middle-of-the-road schizo glitch thoughts. Ultra-common.  Here's another one-- What if the first few years you get out of the hospital, you can't go out into public without encountering a baby in someone's arms or in a stroller, and you see knives being jabbed into its eyes. Let's say you are non-violent and pacifist and loving and wholistic and all that-- and let's say that this bothers you SO much that every time it happens, you visibly FLINCH or WINCE, and the people you are with, say-- Hey, are you ok? How you doing? You're not going to tell them, oh I'm doing fine, it's just the knives being jabbed into babies' eyes thing. But that is another schizo intrusive thought I've heard, that I would consider typical.  I don't know if yours are schizo, but they're common to schizos. I also don't think it matters how much you ""own"" the actions you see or imagine, because sometimes, ""owning"" them can be the path in to controlling them. So I have generally never credited such glitch or recurring thoughts to sufferers, regardless of whether they imagine doing them themselves, or are victims of the imagined things, or are third-party to the imagined things, or whatever.  Long explanation. So, part of your personality? Hehe, heaven forbid, no, in most examples I've heard. Best to you."

You can confront him, but if he hasn't addressed other underlying issues like alcohol abuse, and doesn't acknowledge that he has a mental health problem, it's unlikely anything will change. I encourage you to be realistic about what will happen if you confront your father.  Also, if your father is schizophrenic, you should be aware that you have an increased risk of developing it. You may want to tell him that you want him to come with you to a therapy session you scheduled. It could be important for you to know if you have a family history of mental illness.

schizophrenia,3bkxx4,valleyspirit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, OP. One thing happening is that often, schizophrenia is viewed and treated as permanent and no-blame. This allows sufferers to understand they have an illness which isn't their fault, and to prepare to cope with it. Like, for instance, cancer or losing your legs. Other causes of psychosis are deemed recoverable or environmentally induced or even environmentally dependent (get off the bad meds or reduce the stress, and the psychosis goes away). Let's say schizophrenia runs in my family, and I'm a stoner and I become a schizophrenic while under very high stress at a boarding school. Ok, I'm a schizo. And schizos never get better. And I'm a schizo for a decade. But if I get better, they have to change my diagnosis. Maybe drug-induced psychosis, yeah let's use that one, let's ignore ""stress-induced psychosis"" because it's not as mainstream, and let's just say ""poof"", now you never were schizophrenic, you just had drug-induced psychosis. Because you got better, and schizos never get better. That's the current idea. This sort of double-talk is used to justify saying that schizophrenia is blameless (I agree!), and that schizophrenia never gets better (I totally disagree). So, if people are tripping on labeling this psychosis that your Dad is having, it's just is one way of managing self-definition, in familiar terms.  Back to your dad-- he is what he is. If he's not cutting on himself or burning the house down or running naked down the street from demons, he's doing ok, right? He's just being good old him. Or rather, new suck-y him. Fine. That's his condition. Sure, it's sad.  You need to separate yourself from his situation enough that you find happiness and joy in your life, though. Therapy for future schizophrenia-- screw that. Just get some therapy for you, maybe. As for having a discussion with your dad about his condition-- it actually sounds to me like you're challenging him PLENTY about it, even though you're not having the breakthroughs you want, because you love him. Just keep challenging him, and find a way to separate your own well-being. Best of luck.  No one's blaming anything on schizophrenia. OP's dad is probably schizophrenic. Does no one ever bring up the fact that women commonly become schizo at or around menopause (in addition to, early 20's or whatever)? Midlife and late midlife is a perfectly fine time to become schizo. Plenty of statistics are out there, for schizos of all ages. It's clear what is going on, if you throw the label out the window."

schizophrenia,3bikq6,0n3tw0,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:39:19 2015 UTC,"Cesar Chavez:       Cesar Chavez (born César Estrada Chávez, locally: [ˈsesaɾ esˈtɾaða ˈtʃaβes]; March 31, 1927 – April 23, 1993) was an American farm worker, labor leader and civil rights activist, who, with Dolores Huerta, co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (later the United Farm Workers union, UFW).   A Mexican American, Chavez became the best known Latino American civil rights activist, and was strongly promoted by the American labor movement, which was eager to enroll Hispanic members. His public-relations approach to unionism and aggressive but nonviolent tactics made the farm workers' struggle a moral cause with nationwide support. By the late 1970s, his tactics had forced growers to recognize the UFW as the bargaining agent for 50,000 field workers in California and Florida. However, by the mid-1980s membership in the UFW had dwindled to around 15,000.   During his lifetime, Colegio Cesar Chavez was one of the few institutions named in his honor, but after his death he became a major historical icon for the Latino community, with many schools, streets, and parks being named after him. He has since become an icon for organized labor and leftist politics, symbolizing support for workers and for Hispanic empowerment based on grass roots organizing. He is also famous for popularizing the slogan ""Sí, se puede"" (Spanish for ""Yes, one can"" or, roughly, ""Yes, it can be done""), which was adopted as the 2008 campaign slogan of Barack Obama. His supporters say his work led to numerous improvements for union laborers. Although the UFW faltered after a few years, after Chavez died in 1993 he became an iconic ""folk saint"" in the pantheon of Mexican Americans.  His birthday, March 31, has become Cesar Chavez Day, a state holiday in California, Colorado, and Texas.

schizophrenia,3bj427,thedistraughtson,6,Mon Jun 29 17:22:27 2015 UTC,"So, I know this is foremost in your mind, and probably in the minds of all family members, but I'm going to say it anyway, ok? Never underestimate mental illness.  You can go ahead and take that assumption to 100%, from 99.99-whatever.  My mom lived the last many decades of her life with similar delusions. I always opposed involuntary commitment, in her case. She was self-sufficient as long as she didn't call the cops or political figures with her delusions, which she quickly learned to temper, in order to keep her freedom. The ONE time my sister(s) managed to commit her for a 4-day observation, she refused to take any meds or faked taking any drugs, spoke incredibly lucidly and without anxiety, and then returned home to be stuck somehow with a $20k or $30k bill, despite her life-long military-spouse status. She ""refused"" to let family be saddled with this cost, paid for it with the rest of her savings, and was then (conveniently?) financially dependent on the person who committed her, and she then lost her house to other family members. So I know a bit about decisions breaking up families, and removing individual freedoms, in all kinds of strange ways.  Unless he actually fucks up in front of a professional, you probably can't get him committed OR medicated, without breaking the laws which are in place to prevent exploitation of the innocent.  I would not share the tapes to anyone right now. That's a violation of all kinds of rights. I mean, a huge, illegal violation of rights. A HUGE ""sue you all and take everything and screw you all"" sort of violation. It's also probably immoral, unless you're sharing them with his PERSONAL acknowledged doctor, and even then it may be illegal without his consent. What you are so casually proposing is equivalent to sharing sex tapes of you, which he filmed without your knowledge, because he thinks you should cut your hair. In other words, it doesn't matter why you break the law, if you break the law.  He doesn't want to be on drugs, I get that pretty clearly. Don't go violating someone's human rights and the laws of your country, just because you think you're right.   ""Resume his life"" is not going to happen. This can't be about his income any more, because his mental health trumps that so hard that it's off the table for even consideration. It's far from any known viable measurable thing. He's worked hard all his life and now he's working hard on something entirely different-- his ability to keep you all in his life, to maintain love and respect for you all in the middle of hell, and to temper his own illness as best he can. He will place his own idea of survival above anything you throw at him.  ""...if we can’t get this resolved, there are going to be serious issues in our family."" As if your Dad cares?? The only serious issues he's seeing, are DEFINITELY already in place. The statement is simply untrue. It's utter bullshit. Nothing trumps his mental survival. THAT's his side, and it's the only one he can have right now, or SHOULD have right now, and if you think things are in any way going to get worse than they already are, I fear you're not able to get your Father's perspective on this whole thing. Let's say I'm standing here with one arm cut off, and bleeding out, and you say, ""Unless you get your shit together, and stop bleeding on the carpet, there's going to be some problems in your life, young man."" No, the problems are already here. Show some respect to the man who has given so much to this family, apparently. It can't get any worse. If you think it can, I fear you're simply not being on his side, and he's going to be alone, against the family.  Best of luck. Err always on the side of human respect."
schizophrenia,3bj427,valleyspirit,3,Mon Jun 29 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"I've learned of the term ""systematized delusions"" recently and I think I've figured out where most of my delusions originate, despite what theories others may have. I don't think there's a single sure path to reach that understanding. My delusions still persist despite my understanding. For me, accepting that the worst case scenario may come true reveals how absurd the delusions are, the dominoes would have to be aligned perfectly for such a thing to happen. It's not healthy to live in such a way thinking that impending doom is upon us. Most people don't live like that, nobody should live like that."

I'm curious, how did you father ever agree to seeing a psychiatrist? I know mine would have never agreed to it, and if pressured to see one, he would likely believe that the doctor was 'working for someone"" and avoid taking medication out of paranoia.  For me, I think it's just something I'll always have to live with and endure. I find it helps to become detached and not too emotionally invested in my father's life.  It's probably unrealistic to think that he could ever recover and resume is daily life; the mental illness will always be there.

You're taking your medicine, following your routine, nothing is out of the ordinary. Then, suddenly, you have a nagging feeling or you get caught up in a delusion but fall right back out of it. Or you hear a whisper, if you hear voices. It's basically a psychotic symptom that breaks through your healthy maintained life and disappears as quickly disappears. For me, it usually manifests itself as a belief or ""memory"" of being abducted by aliens that I know isn't true. Or I'll suddenly hear repetitive music randomly as I am sitting somewhere. A lot of my breakthrough is command hallucinations that tell me to do inappropriate things. I take my medicine religiously, but it can only do so much.

However, my general advice for situations like this is to keep in mind that we are all at the mercy of our senses and reason.  Our senses receive stimulation from the environment, and present this to our brain, which then presents it to our consciousness. We do not get the ""raw"" data. It is heavily filtered and interpreted by our brain before we perceive it.  Hallucinations are not ""real"", but they are entirely real experiences.   Delusions can be more complicated, but they are the same way. No matter how weird or implausible (or mundane) they can be, they are experienced as much as any aspect of reality.  You cannot argue or debate this. It is real as an experience.   she gets angry or agitated any time I compliment her physical or inner beauty.   Then do not do that.  If you do something, and someone reacts negatively, do not do that something.    but then she'll say that I don't and it's different because of her Schizophrenia.   She is right.  The best advice I have is to try to alleviate the stress which is exacerbating her symptoms.  Also, instead of complimenting her looks, talk about yourself:   I love you. I want you to be happy.

First my mind began to slow down and then i stopped doing all of my work in high school. I was constantly paranoid in class thinking people were talking about me. It got worse my senior year in high school an i started journaling my thoughts. Losing control. Eventually i began questioning life and existence and eventually ended up trying to kill myself. That was when i was hospitalized and i was totally psychotic. That wasn't when i was diagnosed though but they still put me on antipsychotic meds. I don't take them anymore. Now i have mini-episodes, as i describe but my functioning is much better. I actually hear more voices nowadays but since i know what's happening, i can tolerate it unless i'm agitated."

schizophrenia,3bhb9f,Cedrichendrix92,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:02:01 2015 UTC,"Well....since voices weren't my main problem during my first break, i can't really say when they started. Nobody had any idea that i had schizophrenia. They thought it was depression but now it's figured out. As far as the jump, it was very sudden. A very loooong buildup and then one day i broke from reality. This was back when i was 17.  My voices actually started recently about a year and a half ago. First they were simple like whispers in other sounds. Now they are very distinct women's whispers that comment on me. One says good things the other says bad things. They argue with each other. The good one usually tells the bad one not to be so mean lol. One time they were fighting over me hahaa. But they have never been too much of a problem. It's being able to feel my own emotions and think straight that i struggle with the most.  Edit: when i say i wasn't sure when the voices started, i mean i'm not sure if they were always there and i initially thought they were real and i recently began to pick up on the fact tht they're not or if they just started a year and a half ago."

To be honest, i don't remember much right before my break. Days would mash together, i felt everyone was against me etc. My dad said when i was in the emergency room that i was rambling incoherently. I don't remember that very much. When i say i can't feel my emotions i mean that i am very detached from them.  I can tell when i'm agitated based on how i am acting (pacing, rambling etc.) but i can't feel the agitation if that makes any sense. I don't really know what joy feels like. I am not depressed, just can't tell when i'm happy. Usually it feels like a whole lot of nothing but it's a peacefulness to it. It's not bad."

schizophrenia,3bhgfn,Necritica,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:25:38 2015 UTC,"Look, I have to ask, since I've asked this several times before in threads similar to this. I really hope I don't offend anyone with what I am about to say, but:  Is the whole ""schizophrenic = murderous psycho"" attitude an American thing? Because where I live (Israel), the reactions I get from people when they hear about my condition range from feeling neutral about it to downright praising me for functioning externally semi-normally with such a horrible disease. Everyone has been understanding and helpful. Not one friend turned on me at the darkest times when I was paranoid and hurt everyone around me with horrible words and behavior. I don't mean to start a political discussion with this, but it also happens that the media never blames terror attacks (both from sides of settlers and Palestinians) on mental illness. Actually, I can't remember the last time I heard the issue mentioned in the same light as what this post is about - if ever, it is mentioned in the connotation of breakthroughs in research.   Can we attribute this to the whole ""news now exist to feed sensational stories"" attitude in the US towards the reasoning behind this? To turn any mass shooter into a schizophrenic to get more hits and more heat without even factualizing any of it, just to create a more interesting story?  If any of this is the case, I sincerely hope that'll change in the future, nobody deserves being demonized like that while the shit he deals with is so harsh as it is, and being affected so much from the feedback you get from society. I know I wouldn't be where I am if I had this kind of mess thrown in my face while trying to recover."
schizophrenia,3bhgfn,Necritica,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:53:03 2015 UTC,"To tell the truth, most of the stories I get about crazy psychos are from western media. I am from Lebanon. I had one person tell me that schizophrenia is dangerous. But a lot of people have expressed positive feelings towards me and been very kind and helpful once they found out that I was ill.  Someone once said to me that ""It can affect any one"". An endocrinologist praised me for being highly functional.  I think this is all due to the prevalence of such conditions in our war torn region. Here in Lebanon a lot of people became ill, especially when there were wars.  In fact, my second psychosis was trigged when Israel started bombing Lebanon.   But that being said, I am trying to immigrate to Canada. And they have some restrictions to people who might pose a threat to the safety of Canadians and themselves. Schizophrenics are sometimes targeted by this policy.  So the general impression I get is that in other countries I will have more trouble.  But that being said, one major issue is that insanity is the subject or a lot of ridicule in here. And it is not well understood. I once told a priest about my condition and he thought that I have different personalities and told me that I can't ever get married. So that's that.  Hope you are doing well in Israel and you don't harbour any animosity towards us arabs."
schizophrenia,3bhgfn,Necritica,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see... Definitely agree with what that guy told you... I believe us, as highly-functioning schizophrenics, really need to work on changing the attitude of those that blindly call us madmen, because in fact most people who suffer from schizophrenia are being very human; they are afraid, they receive input that makes them behave the way they do.   I don't know the exact numbers, but I believe the strain of war that looms above our peoples does cause mental issues... I am not certain about any concrete numbers and research, but I bet a decent chunk of the mental illnesses would've evaded if there was no war. It's difficult on people, even if they won't show it.   I do know some countries have problem with schizophrenia - I don't know about the west, but if I remember correctly from certain work stuff, I know that you flat out won't be allowed to enter China if you suffer from schizophrenia or other mental disorders. As for more western countries, well, I believe that with Canada you might be able to petition to go to an interview, prove you don't pose danger to anyone, and it'll take a while to process but will eventually be able to get there.   As for the attitude in Israel, I believe it is generally understood. Statistics found that a fifth (20%!) of adult Israelis take at least one type of psychiatric drug. And the numbers aren't that far from the rest of the west. Also the wars made us both jagged and warmer; we realize people have different reactions to war, and most aren't ridiculed, as their ailment could be related to the security situation. Also generally, Israel is one of the leading countries in the world in mental health treatment; last year I spent 10 months in a day ward; you'd come in at morning, be monitored for a few hours, eat lunch and leave. All for free. The clinic is in financial trouble but they change lives; mine, in particular.   As for what the priest said, well, I don't want to offend your religion but that sounds like horseshit. He had no idea what he is talking about; Schizophrenia is not a multi-personality disorder; multi and split are not the same thing (split being represented with the usually messed up affect), so take what he said with a grain of salt. Keep your head up.  And finally, no, I have absolutely no problem with you guys :) I have problems with Hamas and Hezbollah, who hold their populations hostage and use everyday people as shields in attempt to hurt us. I believe - I know - that more than 90% of the citizens of both sides just want to live peacefully. Many Jews who live in Israel lived in what will turn to be Arab nations for centuries, in peace - much more peace that has been had in Europe. Heck, many words in modern Hebrew were taken from Arabic or pan Arabic languages; Many foods, and customs, too. I, myself, am a quarter Yemeni. I hope you guys will be free from them soon; that everyone will just lose the damn warlike attitude and realize everyone just want the same thing. I just don't know if we will get to see that in our lifetime."
schizophrenia,3bhgfn,Necritica,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"Man, I was planning a trip to china in two years. I was even trying to improve my mandarin. Those bastards. Maybe try Taiwan instead.  Yeah, the priest was full of shit. And what sucks for me is that off medication a big part of my psychosis is religious. One good thing though was that all the priests I talked to told me that it was medical and didn't bring up demons or anything like that. Well all except one who was senile.  Yeah, here many people are affected too with this illness.   Canada was the bane of my existence. I always wanted to leave Lebanon but always postponed my application (long story). Anyway I should get an answer from them in a year or less and then I will try the process to its fullest.   I also don't have a problem with you guys and want to live in peace. But to tell you the truth I also don't have a problem with hizballah. You have to understand that they grew out of what was going on in the south to the shiites and that they provide a lot of help to poor shiites. I don't like their anti-semitism, but where islam is concerned Shiites are a lot more moderate and modern than sunnis. In fact the reforms that people want to make to islam already exist in shia isalm, although Kmeini did sorta of a counter reform.   But what is true is that if Lebanon will ever have a peace with Israel, shiites and hizballah will have to get on board.   It is sad though that people can't just get along. I think the conflict can be largely resolved if people look at things just from a financial standpoint with compensations and land division.   But the truth is that religion plays a big role on both sides. This gives me some perspective as someone who has suffered from religious delusion and has seen how bad a person can be affected when he thinks in absolute truth. Although my religious delusion didn't get turn me violent, but the opposite. I could see how if was raised in a different religion with different belief things might have been different.  Anyway, if I ever do become a canadian I would very much like to visit the holy land and see the places where jesus walked.   I would also like to see the high tech seen in Israel. i work in IT and have read a lot of good things about your country."
schizophrenia,3bhgfn,0n3tw0,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"Hm, your point about Hezbollah is interesting. See, to us, they are just the proxy assholes of Iran that try to terrorize us and control Lebanon for Iran. They are also much more dangerous than Hamas, because of their ties with Iran (Hamas are practically independent ruffians that just want absolute control over Gaza, so they usually just throw pebble-grade rocketry at us. Doesn't make it ok, though!). Also, to me personally the situation got a lot scarier because of the civil war in Syria - intel shows Hezbollah got chemical weapons from Syrian caches - question is how many. We had a threat like this before during the Gulf War (well, not me, since I wasn't born yet), everyone remembers shuddering, scared, in apartment/local bomb shelters, gas masks ready, for when they drop. We experienced that same thing over and over, many times. It made us more resilient, but it also took a toll. However, with all that said, I believe what the civilians in your country was a lot worse. Israel is a developed, prospering nation; we could afford vast defensive arsenal, have both our backs and fronts prepared, many expenses spent over making sure the civilians won't get harmed. That is not meant as an offense to you guys, but we are more stable and can afford all of this. Gazans and most of the Lebanese (correct me if I'm wrong) aren't at that level. That means when a skirmish or even a war starts, the civilians will get hurt.   As for religion, well, we have several religious nutbag groups, but there are good religious people, too. The biggest demographic is the secular Judaism. Last election (like every election) was pretty tight when it came to right-wing vs left-wing. The reason Bibi keeps winning is because he is a great politician, and panders to the religious/settler parties. I believe in the end of the day, neither sides have a government that can support peace.   But anyway, that's getting a bit political, and off topic... My hallucinations and paranoia were never related to religion. I was raised in a secular family. However I believe, in the end of the day, while our past and education affects us, in the end of the day we are the masters of our own fate. Some might want to obscure that fact, but it's not true; if you open up to hear other ways, other paths, you can tread them. I  think one of the scariest thing about schizophrenia is you feel even your thoughts aren't yours to control; a part of your brain is actively working to oppress you. Many schizophrenics hear orders they feel an irresistible urge to carry out. Once you get treated and stop hearing them, or as John Nash did, learn to live with them, you can really bloom. It took me 3 and a half years, from age 16 and a half to almost 20, to get to this point (and it usually takes a lot more!), and I have not finished that part of the journey yet. However, you sound like a person who will manage it, if you set your mind to it.  I wish you all the best. I sincerely believe once you schedule an interview with Canadian officials, they will see you are a rational person with a managed problem. It'll take time and paperwork, but in the end, you will get there. And who knows? Maybe in 20, 30, maybe even 50 years, you will be working for a big corporation and have conference meetings with folks from Tel Aviv, and none of that would be awkward, because the grievances of the past have been forgiven."

It seems like a scam. People are not that persistent when they really need money.  Also, you did not have enough money even if you gave it to him, and there are always to get to the hospital.    If the puppet master is real then I can't help but feel consumed by my hatred for the puppet master. I shouldn't feel hatred or negative emotions, it's not true, I'm schizophrenic.    It can be difficult to get a good perspective on oneself, but I find that living a simple moral life compensates for any problems I have with perception.

You aren't an idiot for not giving up, it's very good/supportive of you, I'd say.  It may get better, it might not.

That may help you learn some maintance techniques, as well as allow you to learn more about schizophrenia and how it manifests in your partner. I'd also say that Google could be a good friend to you in that there's so much information on schizophrenia out there.   Be sure to hold her accountable for her actions. Maybe not so extreme when she's psychotic but she still needs to know what is and is not acceptable to you. And one final thing: please remain patient.

We're all different.    My SO takes care of me as well. I have a job (barely) and I do help out sometimes but for the most part, she takes care of me. And I'm honestly terrified that she will have the same thoughts as you do, and start forming resentment towards me. This fear causes me to lash out and act like a brat sometimes. And this always happens when we go far too long without talking about things and really hashing everything out. Especially if it's leaning towards the paranoid type of schizophrenia, the longer we go without talking this shit out the worst it gets. It could be the same situation.    I really encourage you to talk to her about it. Be gentle, but honest, and make sure you reiterate a lot that you love her but it's causing a lot of stress. Use ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements (I feel like, instead of you make me feel like for example).

G's family is supportive overall, but they seem to perceive her schizophrenia more like a passing phase than something to adjust to. Even though they try hard to understand, I don't think they really get what her illness entails. For example, her dad is truly a great guy, but sometimes he unintentionally gaslights her when she's on the verge of a psychotic episode. He thinks he's joking around when he's actually setting her off.   Also, like I mentioned in my original post, I'm worried that her mother will continue enabling her and caving to her every demand.   I do hear what you're saying, and I'll definitely have more discussions with her parents and encourage them to go to more family therapy to help them better understand.

Freaking out is far from being out of the ordinary, but it does take being able to talk about what's going on with you to get stuff under control. I understand how difficult work can be, and being able to feel like you can gain any control over your emotions during times like this can be incredibly difficult.  It helps me a lot to eat very well and to learn about nutrition as well as do everything I can on my own to help with the emotions during my free time. It helps me a lot to write and to play music on my own as well as talk to people online, here.  Reddit has helped me a lot with being able to handle my anxiety and I feel like I've managed to find ways to handle extreme moments of stress and anxiety throughout work days.   It may help to write down specifically what you need help with and what aspects of the job are overwhelming you.. Good luck, and please keep writing about what's going on with you. We care and it would be good to keep us updated with your situation, I feel like it would be important for all of us, and fulfilling to read about."

Living with him is extremely depressing, but he is my father. Before I moved in with my dad, we. bought him a plane ticket to go on a vacation to his mother and sister. His house was roach, rat, flys infested. My sister and mother and I had to gut out his apartment and clean the shit. My father never cleans and when we tell how to clean or to clean up after himself he throws a fit. when he cooks and does the dishes he leaves food in the sink and nv throws out the garbage.

It really makes me wonder if I did the right thing there, and if I should do that more often to keep other people away from me.

It gets worse if the person gives it to me and wants me to eat it with them or they want me to be around when I eat ti because I think they want to make sure I eat it. Or that they want to watch me eat the poison.

As a magus, I let go of what is outside my jurisdiction: I avoid concentrating mental power on that which is subject to multiple chains of cause and effect which are outside of my control sphere.   Psychosis and dark magick? No good for anyone. A wild, chaotic mind is not ""natural"", nor is a mind which is hyper-focused on fear of loss.

Over a career spanning a decade, I fell into 7 years of developing in .NET. At some point I began to really hate it. It wasn't innovative enough for me or fun.   So a year and a half ago, I moved into a programming job that uses Open Source software (java etc..). I am now a lot more fulfilled at work. I get enjoyment out of coding my apps and this enjoyment keeps me motivated to work.  That's how you should approach things.  The second issue was that I take the minimal dose of medication that keeps me from having psychosis, all the while being able to function. I know if I took a bigger dose I would feel sleepy all the time."

They are normal and common, although, many do not remember them.   Is she more attentive to these kinds of things? She could be overstating her experiences.  However, if she has mental health concerns, she should see a doctor or other mental health professional.   Should I be worried for her?   No.   Like I said, she is totally aware that all these things aren't real, and she appears totally mentally stable otherwise.   The descriptions of the possible hallucinations are somewhat disturbing, and if she thought they were real or occurred other than when she was sleepy, it would be a concern, but as you describe it, it sounds like she is just more aware of herself when dreaming or near sleep."

I'm curious what you think of the fact that she hallucinated while I was talking with her. (We were talking via skype) It was late, and she was in the living room of a house she is visiting. She looked behind her for a second, and then asked me if I saw anything in the corner of the room, which I didn't. We talked for about an hour after that, so she wasn't actually in the process of falling asleep, although she might have been pretty sleepy.  Do you think that fits for a hypnagogic hallucination?"

I have lived with about 5 or 6 people over the course of several decades, who see phantom cats running around the house or sitting on the bed, etc. when they aren't there. Phantom cats should be a thing.  I have also known several practitioners of feng shui who take ""spirit paths"" and/or doorway and window areas, very seriously, and these people usually see all kinds of movement which they relate to spatial arrangement. Humans are just weird sometimes-- think of our thousands of religions(!)-- and I've found that the more rural an area that I live in, the more people will share beliefs in shadows and spirits as a normal part of life.  Edit: I am not trying to stretch the bounds of normalcy, I am just pointing out that such particular examples are not uncommon.

You've got a complete ""system"" of all your delusions working together, like a machine, each part helping the other parts.   If you are being controlled by something, and you have created any ""reason"" for that control, or have invented any plot that goes along with that control-- that is systematized (you've added a plot and reasons, and have started to maintain multiple delusions that all tie together).  If each piece of your delusion (characters, reasons, methods, technologies, agendas, plans, results, etc.) is a gear, and all the gears fit together so that they work as one grand delusion story-- that is systematized. You've built a system,-- a set of gears, or a plot and story-line, or a bunch of consistent reasons and logics-- which serve to continue the delusion, and to provide context, and to enforce its false reality in your world.  A delusion which is not systematized is less complex. It has less ""moving parts"". It's simpler. It involves perhaps only one or two logical fallacies or untruths. It exists for its own being, so to speak. It stands alone as an unexplained event or happening or experience.  As soon as you start ""explaining"" your delusions (why they happen, what is causing them to be the way they are, why you are the target or subject or involved, etc.) then you are constructing a ""system"" for how it is happening to you."

I've been lurking on reddit almost since the start and I've read a lot of stories about injustice. Looking at what I've written on my whiteboard is telling, often I'm at my worst when I add to it. If the world was perfectly aligned to get me then I've imagined the perfect way they'd do it, and there's precedent based on the articles of injustice I've read here on reddit. The one thing that I can't prove is the mind-weapon responsible for the voices I hear.   I've developed counter mind-weapon strategies and patterns of thought often poetic, spiritual, and metaphorical. If I'm stuck in a web then I should stop being afraid of spiders. If I'm afraid of torture then I should accept that my mind will enter a delusional state to protect itself.

American hospitals and companies charge whatever they want for anything. In fact, the smaller it is, the more expensive it is.  Another reason why they are more expensive is because in the USA and one other country, there is direct to consumer advertising. This is a massive part of the pharmaceuitical company budgeting, and it is all for marketing. Plus, they spend even more on marketing to doctors.  So you can see that drug companies in America are primarily in the business of buying doctors and advertising to the population, rather than actually making and designing drugs.

People can however share personal experiences or advise people to talk to their doctor about issues or concerns they may have about their medical treatments. Unfortunately, psychiatry is not always scientific.   So if it works for you or you think it does, fine.    And if it does not work, then one needs to work to revise the treatment plan.

I know a few times i was not warned properly by the doctors of the side effects and so i refused medications for a long time being too afraid of any side effects that the doctors did not tell me about.    so shearing personal experiences about medications will help people better prepare themselves and be less likely to be surprised in a negative way when starting a new medication."

schizophrenia,3b1ggc,JosephFaolan,2,Thu Jun 25 12:26:54 2015 UTC,"I'm just posting this because people might browse into here while worried about their meds for whatever reason. This is what I generally get from this forum, and I personally think it's wonderfully truthy:  Meds can change lives (just like epileptic meds-- and that's my own analogy because the drugs are similar in side-affects and variations in response). They can make you functional where you were not functional. They are not always 100%, and it can be very scary to be taking meds with side-affects and still be having symptoms (which in my tiny opinion is probably what usually happens). This can also be very frustrating. Sometimes the anxiety control is the big win, and the symptoms have to settle down on their own when emotional reactions are subdued a bit, like a stormy sea slowly settling after a storm. Meds are very different for different people, and the perfect meds combo is sometimes just accidental (yay) and is sometimes the result of a good doctor who knows his patient demographics and tracks his various results and is not afraid to try different drugs. Good doctors are very rare! (This is just the way it is, same with epilepsy doctors, etc.) There are success stories, and there are meds-free survivors, but being meds-free is no more a ""goal"" than constantly switching meds is a ""goal"". The goal is function, and relief from disrepair, and relief from suffering. Meds can suck, especially side-affect-controlling cocktails, but hey, what can you say. A good few months on a working drug has often changed lives, and some of our happiest posts are people posting about their treasured relief from symptoms.  Best to everyone, this is a great forum. I think it's possible to ""get better"" in a true sense, and I know that goes against the grain for some people, so I am always quick to suggest the relief and function that meds can (often) bring."

If I can't work then I can't support myself, If I can't support myself then I'll end up on the streets. When I'm on my meds I end up bed ridden worring about the impending doom of life on the streets. If I try to work I get restless and frustrated at how difficult it is even when the work is easy and I can envision the entire solution in my head. The meds are expensive and I'm working part time, I'm not on any assistance, I don't trust the government much or how healthcare is operated. I can't help but feel there is deception involved or they don't believe a single thing I say. When I tell my psychiatrist I want a smaller dose or to try something else I'm given more pills for the side effects or a higher dose. There's so much money involved, I have bill collectors calling me daily due to my hospitalization a few years back. Why is this so difficult? It feels like it's designed to be difficult and not being all about it must place me under suspicion, like I have an agenda or am a potential trouble maker. I can't win it's a catch-22, guess I'll take my meds."
schizophrenia,3b1ggc,0n3tw0,2,Thu Jun 25 15:45:49 2015 UTC,"It is a catch-22 with medication. I have made a lot of effort to keep the dose of medication that I take very low. It is very effective in stopping and controlling symptoms, but at the same time if it were just a little bit higher, then I would not be able to function.  I assume that you are from the states just like a lot of people here, and I don't know how things work there. But here in Lebanon, if you don't like a doctor you can go to a different one or seek another opinion.   In my case I switched from doctors who wanted to prescribe me high doses of antipsychotic, to one who was willing to let me stay on the low dose. This made all the difference in my ability to work.   Stress always exist. But in my experience I was a lot more stressed when I was not medicated vs when I was. The side effect of medication is lethargy.  But when with the dose I take that side effect is minimal.   Hang in there."
schizophrenia,3b1ggc,0n3tw0,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:50:41 2015 UTC,Thanks. I actually cut my pill into four pieces and stockpile them when I'm seeing a psychiatrist. This keeps the costs low. I'll take a full dose when the symptoms get really bad. It's a rollercoaster but I can manage.

I couldn't believe I was prescribed an anti-depressant the last time I saw my psychiatrist, I don't have the strength anymore to voice my opinion or concerns.

schizophrenia,3b01pb,callmestranger,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:14:53 2015 UTC,"The list of what you've been feeling is great. It shows that you have self awareness. Some of the symptoms of schizophrenia are loss of interest, flattened affect, feelings of not fitting in, isolation, disorganized thinking and some other things.  One question is, how much of a change have you noticed, and how much of a change have your family noticed? Part of diagnosing a mental illness that develops in adolescence isn't just about symptoms but the change in personality. Sometimes there is a reason to worry, sometimes not.   This might be the real you, but things could get worse. I was really against talking to a therapist when I was a teenager and it made my diagnosis really contentious and forced. I had to hit rock bottom, where I was choosing between having a home and going to therapy before I was willing to capitulate.   Hope this helps.  ninja edit: one more story - Schizophrenia is a thought disorder and that makes it difficult to recognize the symptoms on one's own. When I was being diagnosed I had a period of pro-dromal, or pre-syndrome, meaning before I became psychotic. But, I didn't heed the signs and I ruined my life before I was properly treated.  edit2: just to be clear, the lesson I took of this is that I should have taken therapy seriously and not avoided it because I was scared of finding out I actually did have a life-changing severe mental illness."
schizophrenia,3b01pb,0n3tw0,2,Wed Jun 24 22:59:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much of a change I've noticed. Some days it feels like a lot, other days I feel like I've always been this way, but I just had an easier time coping. I definitely think being gay worsened my ability to deal with things this past year, even though a lot of stuff (being untrusting, having no close friends, feeling out of place) go further back. My family seems to notice a much bigger difference. Especially these past six months, I've had both of my parents confronting me about how depressed and 'secretive' I've been acting. My dad has all these theories about what I've been up to, and my sister is especially upset with me, blaming me for being the saddest person in the family who's just too selfish to do anything about it.   I've always been a bit morbid, even when I was a kid. But things have definitely gotten worse (not the morbidity, but other things). My environment's gotten worse too as I've grown older though, so it's not really a coincidence. I don't know how much of this is just me being lazy or immoral, and how much of it is outside of my control. Everything seems to have muddled together at this point.

You're untrusting, and don't have close friends. I'm wondering if there's someone you can trust, who is close to you, to talk about your feelings with.  It sounds like your family notices a bigger difference in your personality than you do. This happened to me, too. I learned much later that it was completely normal for me to miss my own changes because my brain was processing information with a thought disorder.  There might be environmental causes and being gay worsened your ability to deal with things this year. You're not lazy or immoral. Your sister definitely should not blame you for being the saddest person in the family.

Using encryption tools might put you under closer scrutiny, I've thought about using them but this is the reason I don't. Also remember, there may be millions of people with the same browsing habits making your data unremarkable.  Many sites are switching over to HTTPS, there are organizations like the ACLU and EFF that are fighting to protect privacy. There are laws in place to protect the people, the constitution and bill of rights are still valid. The NSA may not be up to the nefarious things our paranoia leads us to believe, hopefully they are the best and brightest and care about upholding the rights of the people regardless of their way of life.

People who get the diagnosis normally do not think it is something desirable.   There are people here who have other diagnoses, but have psychotic symptoms in common with schizophrenics, or have had previous diagnoses or considerations of schizophrenia.    But has any one on here been magnetically drawn to this sub because 'society' could easily 'deem' you schizophrenic? I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.   People with higher levels of schizotypy might recognize they may have schizophrenia like traits, but generally, society is an idiot which does not know what ""schizophrenia"" means."

Religous themes are central to many peoples psychotic experiences and this as a rule could create some uncomfortable gray areas.   Yes, that is why I wrote about delusions.  I mainly do not want people going past this, ie, ""I used to be have the delusion that I was the Messiah, but now I am an atheist, and let me tell you why..."". The first part is relevant as a symptom, the second part is just the religious choice of the individual.  Of course, it goes other ways as well, such as people who follow specific religious or have novel religious beliefs etc, which have nothing to do with schizophrenia or symptoms.   Also, this constant pushing for rules and regulations is making the sub feel unwelcoming and arbitrarily authoritirian which is a covert political theme in itself.   I am sorry you feel that way, but consider there are no new rules and no content has been removed for quite a while.

schizophrenia,3aznw2,valleyspirit,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:09:50 2015 UTC,"I agree. Irrational fears can be a sort-of OCD. For instance, some germophobes don't just hate germs-- they live in constant fear of true disaster related to germs. I wouldn't jump to classify this as delusion or paranoia. Even if you were constantly ~convinced~ that something was going to happen (the bathtub WILL fall...), it could still be more of a panic attack than a delusion. I doubt it is related to schizophrenia. If you were carrying the knife because Xantharus the alien from Centauri was planning to send his minions to abduct you, then it would be a different matter (Xantharus is no one to fuck with, right?). Talk to a doc if it is disruptive to your life."

You'll have to excuse me, suggesting that someone could just pick up the pieces and dust themselves off isn't an attitude that is very easy to embrace for someone who has entirely lost who they once were.  I can't just get a new father.  I don't expect to live long enough to develop another meaningful romantic relationship.  I've been struggling with making and maintaining friendships for years now.

It's the ""impossible task"" line that you just threw out there, that I take absolute objection to. Nothing personal.  As far as climbing out of the well of delusions and depressions and perceptions that schizophrenia brings-- I would say I have had much help in my life, from many people, but few (hehe) have been inside my head, choosing ""a"" instead of ""b"", choosing ""this"" disbelief instead of ""that"" belief, choosing valuations of love and art over dispair, etc.   If anything could be considered to be done alone, I think that navigating your own mind into a safe space (and beyond that, into a functional space, and then an artistic space, and then a loving space...) at least qualifies for consideration as being done alone. Maybe surviving our own thoughts is the ONLY time we ever actually pull ourselves up with the things we've clothed ourselves with.  Surviving schizophrenia, and battling the depression and futility that comes with the altered world view-- is not exactly like getting a bank loan, or writing an http processor, or doing laundry. What do you do to make it happen-- do you take the love you get from your world? No, there is no guarantee that the world is going to manifest love for you. Or anything else. Some of this is actually OUR JOB. Regardless of whether we have all our limbs or hear voices.  I think that's what shekib82 was getting at. In this case, ""no, it's impossible"" was not the right answer for me, and it sounds like it wasn't the right answer for shekib82."
schizophrenia,3awrrc,shekib82,2,Wed Jun 24 19:45:46 2015 UTC,"It's literally impossible to pull yourself up from your bootstraps, unless someone is lifting you or you have wings. I always interpret the metaphor as snarky, shekib82 never mentioned it, I did. I feel like metaphors like that can limit critical thinking, these issues are much more complicated than clever phrases. You've both explained your point of view and I don't think you're wrong, we shouldn't feel powerless and we should make an effort to enrich our lives.   I know what life was like before schizophrenia. The voices are unwelcome no matter how flattering or convincing they are. If I believe the positive things they say then I'm vulnerable to believe the negative. It's always frustrating, annoying, and can lead to severe depression. Feeling negative emotions for no good reason is maddening, some go inward and some outward and it can be tragic. The best way I can deal with it is to address the negative emotions, I'm schizophrenic and there is no solution that works 100%, but I can develop strategies to deal with negative emotions. We're all different and we have different strategies. I'm learning new ones just being here and interacting."

That being said, you've also mentioned that you were a straight A student and presidential scholar at MIT.  You've also said in this post that you've received a lot of help from other people.

I was telling my parents that they needed to support me.   But then I realised that I had to pick myself up. My parents told me that I can't be jobless at 25. I decided to take the medication, after years of resisting it. I found a job that I stuck too. And now 8 years later, I managed to climb the latter from job to higher paying job. I support myself and others and lead a pretty normal life, given the country I live in.  it is not all roses, i don't have as many friends as I would like and haven't found that one special person. but most of the time I am upbeat and my job gives me confidence that I have control over my life and my future.

I had went out with this girl a couple of times, but she had made it clear that she wasn't interested in me romantically, and i kinda found her vain.   So anyway with my mind on psychosis I started imagining that she was the one for me and God has sent her my way. So I called her told her that i love her, told her to leave a guy she had started dating. Then I gave her an ultimatum: I will give you a couple of days to decide to be with me, otherwise i will never speak to you again.  Well as it happens, she never spoke back to me neither did I speak back to her.  When I think about it now, I know that I wasn't myself. I didn't really care for her, but my psychosis made it seem to me that she was more than she actually was.  It is hard for people who never experience psychosis to know what is like. But suffice it to say the person is not himself. His brain is acting out on him and showing him things that are not true and making him think in an irrational way.

With a bit of caution I don't see why you couldn't maintain contact with him if that is something you are comfortable with. The same practices that apply to meeting people from the internet apply here, just make sure you are being aware of the situation and taking note of any warning signs that might pop up that the individual is behaving in a dangerous manner.

That is far from being stable in my own context of stable.  I hear you with the meds because they certain affect your cognition and your ability to function normally, however psychosis exacerbates one's perception too much to see reality clearly.

schizophrenia,3avram,madavmyers,2,Tue Jun 23 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"I almost feel like I want to go to an assisted living home, just so I can get out of here and get the support I need.   This is basically my mindset whenever I am thinking about the future (which is more or less all the time).  Parents suck and I'm glad I left mine. Granted, I had abusive parents, and it's probably a bad idea to generalize, but I don't think parents will ever be able to understand what it's like to live with a severe mental illness."
schizophrenia,3avram,istillhavenoaccount,2,Tue Jun 23 22:30:22 2015 UTC,I don't know much about assisted living but you need to get away from your mother.  She's obviously resenting your illness and taking it out on you through denial and ignorance.  You need time to heal her mentality before you can even think about building an understanding.  I'm not sure how it works for you but I have a social worker in my program that I can go to anytime if I need advice about getting housing or social security.  I would suggest looking up some of the processes where you live to weigh your options.

schizophrenia,3aty4u,Cocooned,5,Tue Jun 23 14:11:37 2015 UTC,"I can contribute this.  In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and in gongfu (Kung Fu), and in all internal energy exercises where you are attempting to circulate the chi (qi) along the large ren and du channels which bisect the body, including the Small Heavenly Cycle which runs in a loop along the spine and over the head top and along the front center of the body--  The best way to connect these meridians, in most breathing patterns, is to gently touch the upper tip of the tongue to the juncture between the back of the upper teeth and the mouth palate.  This connects the ren 24 point with the du 26 point, and allows easier circulation of energies along both these channels.  Edit: However, when this is used traditionally, the mouth is never hung open. In fact, muscle tension is released from the tongue and jaw by having the mouth either gently closed, when using the nose, and almost closed, to the point of appearing to be closed, even when breathing through the mouth. ""Wind"" meditation named for the sound of exhalation is often done with apparently closed mouths, even though the exhale through the mouth can be heard.  Edit 2: This is used a LOT of places, even in Japanese Zen, for ""still point"" or ""no mind"" or ""no thought"" or ""small mind"" meditation, where no symbolic thoughts are desired and are discarded as they appear. Beginners focus only on the muscle actions of breathing, and the imagination of the chi movement along the channels. Then when the newly-learned muscle patterns of reverse or abdominal or belly breathing are learned, the only perceptions cultivated are those of the energy movement, and finally the energy circulation also becomes autonomic, and the mind is allowed to be empty, or single-pointed.  Edit: Google images for ""small heavenly circle""."

But because it's placebo effect I'll likely forget it and during a genuine episode of voices trying to stop brain freeze probably won't be my first thought and/or it won't work.

It's actually a technique used by Yogi's and meditators to stop sub vocalisation. It has its roots in Chinese acupuncture.  Anecdotally it has been used with people who suffer from schizophrenia to stop the voices temporarily if they get too much.   I picked up on your anger in that response.

There's easy targets to lash out against, family, government, religion, neighbors, psychiatry, politicians, pills, aliens, hollywood, priests, teachers, healthcare and on and on.

I feel terrible hurting people around me and losing friends.  I don't feel like myself anymore, when I look into the mirror, I see something alien.  I feel like a camera floating around a lot.  But I still think there is some hope.  I try to practice spirituality, I keep learning, I try drill positive concepts into my heart.  Find healthy ways to relieve stress, art and/or exercise.  Paint, draw, write, or take pictures.  Eat better!  Eat green food, stay away from bread's and sugar.  I really think health helps stabilize my mood.  Good luck, all things are temporary .

It can also be caused by something physically wrong with the brain, like a tumor or cyst for example. If you don't have any other symptoms of schizophrenia, I would seek doctor's advice first, you should probably get a CAT scan as a physical injury to the brain is probably more likely."

I feel kind of out of myself while completely in myself and I feel very fuzzy and disgusting but very clean and pure. But I can't do anything while I feel like I could do anything? Like in manic catatonia, like I feel so good but I feel bad because I can't do anything.   I've had people move me into positions during this in the past and just move me however they want. It's a very weird experience because I can feel it happening... but not. I can't see it happening, but I can. It's hard to explain."
schizophrenia,3aqtwj,upstairsbox,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:02:32 2015 UTC,"Catatonia was the reason I was hospitalized. I seem to cycle between two types, agitated where I can't stop moving and stuporous where I can't move. I wouldn't describe it as being unable to move, but being so detached from your body that you have no interest in moving it and so it becomes an irrelevant detail and you focus inwardly.  People can move my limbs and I'll hold them. The longest I've been in catatonia was 48 hours with short periods of clarity where I was able to 'break free' (which is quite hard) and go to the bathroom and stuff. During the clear periods, I'm still moving very slowly and there's a general spacy feeling. In these periods I still won't be able to talk.  If it gets deep enough I can get Oneiroid syndrome where it's almost as if I'm experiencing two realities at once. Hallucinations are most present for me during catatonia.  Catatonia is linked to any disease on the spectrum of schizophrenia, bipolar, and depression and is highly under-diagnosed. It is particularly dangerous for me because the attacks often occur without warning and without indication of how long I will be gone. I don't think you are mistaken; what you are experiencing sounds like catatonia.  Here is a description of the different stages of catatonia:  http://moonflower77.dreamwidth.org/155819.html"

It's okay to be curious. We love you anyway. We know you don't understand and the experience we have in being judged and ridiculed only softens our hearts.   The particular pact of a particle is the fact of an article of scripture.   Christ is also an interesting word since it does not belong to any man and is only a title given to those that are crazy enough to identify reality as an enemy.

I have been meds-free and shock-treatment-free and people-trying-to-hospitalize-me-free for several decades. Am I still schizophrenic? YES. No one can tell and no one knows and I have achieved great things and small things and yet I browse and post here. I think you know why.  Pity instead of anger. I taught my daughter this way-- I said that it's best to defer to being gentle with people, because advantages of knowledge or intelligence are not things to be levered against others, but rather are an opportunity for altruism.  One of the greatest sadnesses of this disease is the constant pitting of the tortured individual against the world at large: they talk about me, they can read my minds, I have been selected, I am an experiment, they are making fun of me, they are out to get me. Whatever is doing all those things, it is not other humans. All the other humans are down here in the bucket with each of us. We have to maintain our connection to others, and our gentility with others."

Many positive things have happened since my first psychosis.  It takes someone extremely intelligent to understand even pieces of what it all means.  It's like God's contact is expanding our consciousness.  Religion is pretty dumb, but for a lot of people it works for them, it's a means for simple people.  I see nothing wrong with that, even though they have it much of it wrong.  God specifically told me Religion didn't matter, It's about the spirit of man.  The bible is a book of stories, with lessons about mankind.  God is a lot like a father of sorts.  Just my opinion.  Loved your post, I feel I can relate a little."

I understand your concerns, but noone of us can probaly say anything about this in-depth without knowing your brother.  Remember to support him, believe in him, and so on. He might not know what he's done, and he might've been delusional, and this is where he needs a hospital.   The doctors might be able to tell you more, and if they find that it was the illness he will most likely be committed to a hospital for a very long time, don't think bad of this though, as it might get him on the right track, for a while, or forever.

Hopefully the judge will have mercy on him and find him innocent by reason of insanity or something along those lines and get him into proper help. I think that's the best we can hope for.

It's hard to say as I don't have much experience with the american psychiatry, and I probaly never will, but I do know that it will not harm him in any way, it will most likely do him good although it can be very frustrating to be locked up and not have any rights, which you usually don't have much of those places (my experience).

But that doesn't mean we should just accept not getting help for it because we're 'different'.   People have told me all of my life their is nothing wrong with me and I am just different. It's what's currently stunting my psychiatric progress.   Uglyness is also perceived. Someone ugly to you is beautiful to someone else and vice versa. A mental disorder is a mental disorder whether or not you think it is. Uglyness can go away with time and self-care. Mental illness never goes away but is only controlled.  We also already got over segregation (?) of race. But, again, you can't control your race; you can control your mental health with proper care and medication."
schizophrenia,3aowjo,vilehatemachine,4,Thu Jun 25 10:33:58 2015 UTC,"Schizophrenia isn't a race. It isn't an aesthetic appearance. It isn't just something that ""causes distress but doesn't need a systematic treatment"".  There is nothing wrong with being mentally ill- someone who is psychotic isn't ""different"" or ""distressed"". They're psychotic and need treatment appropriately, as a patient who need a doctor.   This kind of neurodiversity needs to learn to stop trying to apply to all other situations. Neurodiversity works for you, fine, but you're not schizophrenic and you don't get to on a schizophrenic community to try and tell people ""you're not sick, you're just different!"". There's nothing wrong with recognizing you have a disorder that needs to be treated, instead of sweeping it under the rug as ""it's not a disease, you're just different"".  That's like how disability movements tend to fuck over people with chronic illness with the whole ""you're not disabled, you're differently abled! Stop looking for a cure for your disability, you're perfect the way you are!""."

Do you know what it's like to experience extreme hypotension, Parkinsonism, dizziness, severe vision problems (to the point of being unable to read) and sedation as a result of such treatment, which was maintained for a pretty long while? And this treatment was supposed to be maintained forever. I escaped it, gladly. I moved to another city - and there, I was able to get assessed for what I was. (And I got further evaluations in other cities too, so that in case if one psychiatrist made a mistake again, my history of previous assessments would contradict it.) All because what you experienced was labeled as undesired - a disease, which should be treated at all costs.  And do you know what it's like when people learn of the severe psychosis you experienced? Do you know what it's like for your own grandmother, to tell you that people like me are unpredictable, and can ""snap at any moment and shoot people up"", and therefore, I ""shouldn't tell about my experience to anyone""?"

schizophrenia,3aowjo,SoullessSingularity,-4,Tue Jun 23 03:34:59 2015 UTC,"To begin with, you're completely distorting my argument. I never said the differences seen in schizophrenia don't need treatment if they cause distress. I'm emphasizing on not considering schizophrenia as a disease. The same way transsexual people may need GRS in order to correct their gender dysphoria. Or homosexual people may need to live in societies which accept homosexuality. Some may also seek therapy in case if the sexual orientation difference causes significant distress.  Providing the best condition to the person (be it via medication, therapy, or environment) is surely needed. But it doesn't mean that we need to see something which can't be cured and is innate as a disease. Why? It's not a question of semantics. It's the question of consequence. We need to ask the question: Would the people in question be better off if we treated them as sick, or if we treated them as simply different? Being treated as different but not sick would probably lead to more acceptance towards this difference, and less rejection.  We could as well treat homosexuality as a disease. Why not? It's chronic, can't be cured, and is a result of an interplay of many factors, which are not in the person's control. And the most important: It may cause distress.  And if you're really schizotypal as your label says, I have had most likely had a bigger share of psychosis than you. I know what it's like. And I know what it's like to be treated as sick and undesired because of it. You're treated not as an individual, but a ""psychotic"" because of it.   The philosophy of treatment of chronic psychosis has to change. We shouldn't seek to eliminate it at all costs, seeing a person with a huge number of side effects as being better than a slightly delusional person, or a person who hears slight undistressng hallucinatory whispers. We have to make the individual better off, not ""treat the disease until it's eliminated""."

My point was that just as transsexual people may need treatment (HRT, GRS, etc.), so do people with schizophrenia. But neither should be considered a ""disease"" just because they may need pharmaceutical (or other) intervention.  And it's funny how you can get rejected when presenting an argument to the schizophrenic community if you have bipolar and ASD, and those who are rejecting you actively don't have schizophrenia, and have things like schizotypal and psychosis-NOS.

My point was that just as transsexual people may need treatment (HRT, GRS, etc.), so do people with schizophrenia.   You're comparing two groups of people who couldn't possibly be more different from each other. Trans people don't typically get admitted to a psychiatric hospital and get forcibly medicated.  That's like comparing schizophrenia to, say, a big wound in your hand. Sure, you don't need to treat it, if you can live with a big scar and usability impairments.   But neither should be considered a ""disease"" just because they may need pharmaceutical (or other) intervention.   By your logic we could eliminate the DSM altogether.  Diseases are classified as such because they require medical treatment, which is important for health insurances.

My personal experience with the far-right is such that I know what their ideology is, and I agree with some of the paradigms, axioms (facts), but conclusions are not possible to such a degree that violent action is justified.  Wolff is/was delusional about a phenomena. There is a scientific basis for race/class in how intelligence/producitivity are measured, as well as behavioral tendencies:   Political racists seem to interpret the science though (especially statistics) with a pre-determined bias, itself a delusional mental state. Racism is not innately ""evil"" in how biology studies genetic categories/origins; the moral designations come from application, development of political programs, and common bigotry.  Wolff does not understand how the information he thinks is ""truth"" has been corrupted by a chain of delivery through biased filters.  Race does exist, and north Asians -from Lisbon to Tokyo- are categorically superior, but beyond that, the complexity of human nature nullifies any type of conclusion regarding the political authority of one race over another; racial superiority is irrelevant in modern times because of how global interdependency modifies economic systems.     ""Might makes right"" is simply not utilitarian anymore as a core policy."
schizophrenia,3amasb,shekib82,4,Sun Jun 21 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"I think this article brings up the important question of the role that society plays in triggering violent actions in people who are perhaps more predisposed than others to lash out.  If you live in a very diverse and tolerant community where the standard rhetoric of neighbors and politicians is both respectful and accepting towards all demographics, it would stand out as quite delusional for a person to suddenly speak and act in a way that demonstrates hatred and fear towards a single group. This person would most likely become an outcast in his community (especially if the community accepts all demographics as ""their own"") and it is possible that this isolation could even further push the delusional individual into some sort of paranoid psychosis. In this case, because any ""proof"" the individual would have to feed his paranoia towards this specific group would not be based in any sort commonly accepted ""reality,"" I think it would reasonable to assert that such an individual has a mental illness.       But the situation is different if the community the individual belongs to is constantly engaging in ""us vs. them"" rhetoric against a specific group. When outwardly expressing paranoia towards the ""out"" group, it is likely that the paranoid and potentially violent individual will find validation from other individuals, which feeds the delusion. Yes, the people from whom the delusional individual seeks validation may not personally want to commit violent acts against the ""feared"" group, but they may share (albeit to a lesser extent) the same delusion as the person who does eventually ""snap"" and kill people.     So this begs the question: If a large group of people share the same belief (that blacks/jews/muslims/mexicans/""out group"" du jour are ""taking over the country""), is the person who happens to act out on this belief in a violent manner really ""detached from reality"" (aka suffering from a psychosis)? Or is he just acting out on a socially sanctioned belief in a not socially sanctioned way?     I, and I'm sure many other people, often feel as if people with opposing political (and sometimes religious) beliefs are ""delusional"" and/or ""mentally ill."" But mental illness does not work like this. A delusion is ""a false personal belief that is not subject to reason or contradictory evidence and is not explained by a person's usual cultural and religious concepts.""  If a man belongs to a culture that validates beliefs that trigger him to act violently, then the man is not delusional. The man is simply, for better or for worse, representing that culture of beliefs through his actions.   This man is not delusional. He is a terrorist."

schizophrenia,3amasb,JosephFaolan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:39:06 2015 UTC,"How can someone commits such an act (1) know right from wrong and (2) be able to control their actions? They are mentally ill almost by definition.    Do you think people can commit voluntary actions?  Or are you merely assigning everyone to set courses of action and deeming those unlike you to be ""mentally ill""?"
schizophrenia,3amasb,Pongpianskul,0,Mon Jun 22 05:27:33 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. No one is born bad or good. Bad actions or good actions are caused by the environment in which a person was brought up.   If a person is treated horribly, they will grow up to treat others horribly cause they won't know anything else. This should be obvious.  Mental illnesses are mostly caused by a sustained and egregious lack of proper nurturing. Depression, anxiety and other disorders are the result of terrible childhoods.  Being infected with terrible biases, values, opinions and so on is also not voluntary. Each of us is conditioned to believe whatever those raising us believe. A child has no choice but to absorb whatever is taught since the child cannot compare what they're being told to other points of view.  It is ridiculous to believe that people who commit atrocities are sane. It makes the word ""sane"" utterly meaningless.  Control over one's actions is also not a choice but a result of childhood conditioning. One who is taught to be circumspect and thoughtful will be circumspect and thoughtful. One who sees only violence and hate will only know violence and hate.   I wonder why some people fail to see this. What are they thinking? That those who commit murder are demons? Born bad? Making poor choices even though they could be making better choices if they wanted to?  Believing that a person chooses to do bad things even though they could have chosen to do good things is what is called The Fundamental Attribution Error.."
schizophrenia,3amasb,autowikibot,2,Sun Jun 21 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"Fundamental attribution error:       In social psychology, the fundamental attribution error, also known as the correspondence bias or attribution effect, is the tendency for people to place an undue emphasis on internal characteristics (personality) to explain someone else's behavior in a given situation rather than considering the situation's external factors. It does not explain interpretations of one's own behavior, where situational factors are more easily recognized and can thus be taken into consideration. Conversely, from the other perspective, this error is known as the actor–observer bias, in which people tend to overemphasize the role of a situation in their behaviors and underemphasize the role of their own personalities.

This is usually a specific person close to oneself, ie, one's mother has been replaced by an imposter.   Delusional misidentification syndrome is the general term for delusions which involve this sort of theme, for example, the belief that other people are actors, that other people are actually the same person in disguise, that oneself is dead, etc.  Truman Show Delusion is the relatively new term for where a person believes that everyone around them is an actor and that one is being monitored."

I'll watch it eventually on cable, the action looked cool. We can still view these movies as critics from a distance without getting too involved, it's just entertainment after all.

I would treat this like any other relationship problem: talk about it at a time when you're both well rested, not hungry or angry, and then form a plan that you can both agree upon. Perhaps spicing it up, or going back to an old favorite could help (basically just a change of pace). If you're lacking a sex drive, you should gently tell him that maybe he could try doing something different to try and increase libido on both ends.   If this is a big problem, which I get the feeling it might be, I would ask your therapist/see a marriage counselor. As we all should know, there is no shame in admitting that you have a problem, and that getting help is the fastest way to alleviating the problem."

I'm 43 and have ignored the reality of my psychosis for four years now. I'm thinking maybe a hobby is something I can learn a thing or two about. Work was the same. I was successful and took pride in my work, loved my family and suffered under the tyranny of a threat I could not foresee. I am self-medicated on a previously prescribed medication so I am not only motivated but am motivated to believe tomorrow will be just one more yesterday. If I have half of my success and the opportunity to explain my illness to all those I've hurt, I would give the other half of my success for them to believe just two of my words... I believe."

schizophrenia,3afqyg,jfrock25,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:44:18 2015 UTC,My sympathies to what you are going through. The whole situation sounds so horrifying that would send me straight down an episode as well. I am very happy to hear you have a supportive family and fiance. I do not however have much experience with Bi-Polar so really cannot comment on that. Voices for myself are consistant and do not really let up. I have to find ways of distracting myself from them to cope.  The best advice I can give is to talk with a psychologist and work with them to get get a diagnoses. That may take some time as they need to talk and evaluate things. Usually longer afterward as the denial sets in but it sounds like you are fairly open at the moment. Also really need to eliminate all other drugs from your system as many can play hell with the anti-psychotics and the psychologist wont be able to diagnoses anything until they eliminate that as a factor.  Lean on your support network and try your best to trust them. I wish you the best of luck and really hope you see your way through this.

I went crazy and stopped sleeping.  I was a wreck it made all my symptoms worse.  Also the Zyprexa made me gain 50lbs in 6 months.  Went from 180 to 230.  Im just starting to lose this weight now.  Im riding my bike to work which is a 16 mile round trip bike ride.  I have lost about 15 pounds in the last three weeks.  The worst is the sexual side effects.  Apparently I am very sensitive to them on all these meds.  It has really messed up my sex life.  I have know desire and cant get it up.  Its only now that its starting to come back.
schizophrenia,3afqyg,plornt3,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:03:23 2015 UTC,Lack of a sex drive is something that I have dealt with in past. Many of the anti-psychotics tend to have this affect. The weight gain never really hit me but I go through periods that I forget to sleep and eat for days until I get splitting headaches and pain. I seem to lack the feeling hungry. Remaining psychically active is great though! Riding your bike like that is going to do wonders for you. I think communicating to your psychiatrist that you have a priority on your sex life and want to not threaten that.

I have had demonic experiences, and experiences with holy archangels, but it's not fair to me or to this forum, to describe those experiences here; however, I just want to say, this has NOT in any way contributed to my believing in any God that is anything more that the bounded sum of the self-awareness that truly self-aware creatures experience, in any realm of perception.

If a mind-weapon really existed they could hook it to a computer and put it on a loop and it comes full circle with a SOAD song Toxicity, ""Conversion, software version 7.0"". That song reminds me that their tricks advance the way software advances and the way my delusions advance so I shouldn't let it affect me, knowledge is power. The mind-weapon has limitations and it would be illegal if such a thing existed so they rely on discrediting and trickery.  I'm reminded of a Star Trek episode I watched recently ""Who Watches the Watchers"". Picard chose to educate instead of reinforce a species religious delusions to save Troi after they broke the prime directive.

'Blinded by the light,' he repented from his murderous convictions, shed his material desires and did his best to share with others the glory he saw in his psychosis. Muhammad, Jesus Christ, Ezekiel... even Joseph had a dream. They all suffered and they all did it with joy in their hearts to be counted worthy of something they did not understand until they understood what cannot be explained. Its just my opinion, but all Human Scripture should be the very foundation of understanding the mind and what few will see and many will not. A repentant man once said something about not caring about what others think of him because if he did, he would not be a servant of Christ. Only the Spirit can teach it and we could care less what a mortal man says about us. You may call us Famine and Pestilence, War and Slaughter, Death and Hades... sticks and stones y'all.

I've often thought that biome deficiencies and immunological effects could be a component of the disease but these results don't seem specifically tied to symptoms...could someone more versed in the biology weigh in?
schizophrenia,3ab80a,Metallio,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:23:17 2015 UTC,"Check out fecal transplants, it is vastly superior to probiotics.  Also the premise of the research is heavily flawed. Probiotics improve general health and general health is linked to schizophrenia. Mental endurance is linked to physical fitness, especially considering peak stress responses.  Having that said, you can only conclusively claim and prove how various methods of improving physical health would compare to each other in terms of schizophrenia. That improving general health itself is beneficial to mental illness is a well known fact. Without putting data about a single method of this causal category into relation to other data of the same kind, you cannot show at all how it would be any more beneficial to schizophrenia than eating healthy and getting plenty of rest and exercise by exactly the same underlying mechanism. A standard, logical common sense approach.  Statement based on wrong premise: ""Probiotics are microorganisms that modulate the immune response of the host and, therefore, may be beneficial to schizophrenia patients.""  Statement based on sane reasoning: ""Probiotics are microorganisms that can improve gut flora and therefore may be beneficial to the general health of the host. Therefore they might also improve symptoms of schizophrenia.""  Why does the article not reason like this? The answer is, that the researcher tries to justify his research, by indirectly making causal connections to recent research trends, namely the immunomodulatory neurodegenerative model(s) of schizophrenia. This is both a big brainfart of the researcher, as well as it is a direct result of the deficits of the scientific publishing system. Like probiotic yoghurts sell better on the consumer market if you can find them on google with certain buzzwords and associated claims, research also does in the market of the scientific publishing system. And researchers fall for it, just like mindless uneducated advertizement responders. This is of course not only limited to probiotics (ironically, whereas the real buzzword here is immunomodulatory), but also to all sorts of other things. In the past it has been a whole lot of dopamine/serotonin theory for psychiatric conditions. Generally speaking, scientific research has a limited amount of tools and knowledge to reason with and base new research upon. Researchers then try to grab whatever little there is, re-assemble it with a new atomar piece of information, and push it on the market. In absence of any accepted holistic theory (such as an actually usable model of schizophrenia) the most popular, most simplistic, most mass-compatible BS becomes the invisible and unspoken theory in the background (e.g. dopamine theory) which everyone believes in but no one admits to have claimed to be real. Before scientists essentially discovered neurotransmitters, they would not reason with the nervous system and dopamine/serotonin but with the blood and insulin/glucose. This is how insulin shock therapy came into existence back then. Now the nonsense continues.  Schockingly enough, no one is actually ""in charge"" of the research system, to supervise and rectify such critical issues. Every single researcher is just a tiny wheel in a giant self-emergent machine. Now machines are tools and tools are meant to be slaves for human purposes. But if the tool starts to build itself in absence of a human controller, how can we predict where that leads us at all? What we generally know is that everything currently uncomputable necessarily has to optimize towards paths of least resistance, under certain premises. Like an engine in a car runs more smoothly and efficient with less traction or no traction from the wheels generated by overcoming distances, that is the intended human purpose to transport the passengers from A to B, the scientific publishing system also runs more smoothly if it optimizes against fullfilling its purpose to get from A to B, that is from problem to solution.  No one is really aware of, or paying attention to all those grave fundamental deficits which effectively result in nonsense information. It is fair to say, that this created a parallel reality of sorts. Just like the marketing industry reflects a parallel reality where commercial products can cure all our needs and desires, make us infinitely happy, if we only keep pumping out the money to them. Medical research does exactly the same, by pretending to be able to cure scientist's cravings to find proper actual explanations with sufficient data for actual real-life problems. Every single researcher tries to cure cancer or solve whatever critical problems, improve the world so to speak. But to do so, they have to act within the system. Learn it, deal with it, accept it. Now once you start moving within the system, the real question is, if you are only just feeding into it or if the system does also feed on you.  Sorry if this is off topic, but I am just sick of the bullshit.  EDIT:   So I had this simple idea. What if people don't really know what they doing and are just trying to explain their experience? What if no one is really trying to make sense to the world as a whole, but only sense to their own lives? But then how can you take anything seriously at all? If you think of the researcher as a child, trying to explain their behavior to a parent, then suddenly it all makes a whole lot more sense. A child tries to reason from their own limited viewpoint and they will believe in whatever it is that still gets them what they want but doesn't cause trouble. You would be permissive towards a child to make logical errors in their statements, as long as they still try to fullfill the right purpose. So with this mentality, you basically have to discard all the explanations they are coming up with and just try to bend the information into shape that reconstructs their experience. Then the statements read entirely differently: ""We believed that probiotics are microorganisms that modulate the immune response of the host and, therefore, may be beneficial to schizophrenia patients, because we tried really hard to see how this could be true, because our friends have been interested in something similar."" Under this light, I would entirely agree with this statement. Maybe no one can see those errors, because it is just human bias.  All my life has been about finding and eliminating the misconceptions of other people. In computer programs, in software, in myself, in others. So I just complain about them all the time. But no one can share my viewpoint."

schizophrenia,3a8lr0,Lilly_jen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"My condolences. If you have a religion or spirituality that has rituals for grief, it would be helpful to follow them. It's common that people get hallucinations of loved ones during grief, but it will not necessarily be distressing and might help you cope/tell them goodbye.  Don't be afraid to ask for emotional support."

As for your questions, I think the answers to them are largely dependent on your specific situation and how your subconscious chooses to handle things. I honestly think choosing to worry about it will only make your stress levels higher, which in my experience when I have higher stress levels my hallucinations become worse. Just try to relax and focus on grieving your brother, processing the emotions related to it and not worrying too much about how it affects your mental health until such a time where you are experiencing any struggles with mental health. If anything is to arise, speak with your mental health professionals and they will help you out."
schizophrenia,3a9dzf,plornt3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:13:03 2015 UTC,"Don't think about this in terms of illness, think about this in terms of problematic behavior. For example, if your project involves spending a lot of money or making other sacrifices (like obsessing about it 50 hours a week, breaking ties with friends, quitting your job), that is problematic. If you can't work on your project every other day or every weekend, but only in some special mental modus (aka psychosis) that is problematic as well. Why would you brag about something that you have not even started? Just stick to common sense behaviors. It is not as if you cannot see or define what those are.  Maybe you can and will do those projects/ideas but you shouldn't be taking all the risk and put them up front as if they were the truth, when they have not even happened yet. Don't talk about things that are not (yet) real so people will not call you delusional either.  Every normal person may have grandiose ideas and ideals. But when they consider how they can put them into reality, they quickly get frustrated and back off from it. Because they are not willing to take the risk, they will not make all the sacrifices, they will not mentally overcharge themselves then crash etc. They just have more sane behavior patterns in mind."

Great work. It's a tough question, though.  I think organization, routine, rut, consistency, and correspondingly-- organization of goals, routine of goal-seeking, rut of goal accomplishment, consistency of actions toward goals-- these are the big wins. Not just for you but for most exceptional accomplishments, as well. You may have to set some big, tempered, slow-motion goals for yourself to enjoy that stable grind, though. And if you suddenly start thinking that you can bypass that sort of long-term progress and somehow gloriously cheat and accomplish great things quickly-- then, that's a clue right there that may set you back down on your ass.  Think ""gong-fu"". It means ""hard work"". Diligent work, over time. A chef or a taxi driver can have excellent gongfu. It means those excellences we cultivate individually, through self-dedication and notable self-application. There are other words for fist-fighting and martial arts, in Chinese. GongFu means hard work, over time. Try to find and cultivate kung fu in your life. REAL kung fu. Blossoming skills that you know, you are developing because of consistent, long-term self-application.

schizophrenia,3a9dzf,DVIANT88,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:04:13 2015 UTC,"So the minimizing embarrassment, if someone says something in a hallucination, I just forgive and forget. If before you were sick, you had a dream about someone would you ever tell them? Probably only if you really knew the person and it was an interesting story. Same rules apply to hallucinations. If they are physically nowhere near use dream rules.  If someone is in the room with you and you think you just misheard, ask them to clarify as soon as possible.  Enough years of practice I can be completely emotionally detratched to things people say passive agressively. I don't forget what they say but, I have had hallucinations tell me pretty much every possible mean thing. You better use get some sticks and stones, if you want to hurt me.  This has lead to it's own problems in I've been so afraid to confront people, that I've hurt people's feelings that were trying to flirt. This mostly happens in workplace situations were I'm can't react honestly and their flirting is inappropriate. Kinda my fault when this happened because I talked about sex at work too much.  This Pollyanna pronia could have been dangerous when I lived in Detroit. I had to be on my toes a bit. When I was younger, I had a friend that listened to me and was chill. Chillness is a great goal, I've made progress. Great feeling.  Right now I am financially safe enough, everyday workplace BS doesn't bother me. Lazy people would start fights and realize I was not strong enough to argue if they blamed mistakes on me. I would get in trouble, be scared everyone hates me and I would be fired. I then would spend the rest of my money, quit, and try to kill myself. Almost never actually fired. Some places don't fire people to avoid paying unemployment, they just make your life help until you give up.  Now I have a disability rehabilitation specialist, she disclosed my illness and educated my employer. Unfortunately I work in fast food so one of my bosses is a felon. That's fun. I pretty much ignore all drama unless they are talking about jumping me or getting me fired. No other fucks are given. Sorry that was long, that's just how I deal.  If someone says something to me job related I respond immediately. Bullshit you better say to my face, if you want a raise out of me. I am not quick with comebacks, but I stockpile them."

Your awareness of this happening and that it is not normal is really amazing. When I was 19 I thought that everyone was dealing with these types of visions and that I was just really sucking at dealing with it.   While colors played a much lesser part of what I went though the anxiety and preoccupation of the mind played very heavily in what I went though and still go though. I did and still do have very aggressive audio hallucinations and they are not always voices but also come in footsteps and scratching or thumping. More so then anything else is the emotions that accompany these episodes like fear, insecurity and general resentment.  Many of my episodes also demanded my attention and would evoke even worse if I ignored them. Visual hallucinations still are the worst as its very hard to cope with and makes me question much of my surroundings and life. I know during clear points that they are not real but in the moment its hard to describe but there is no telling that they are false. At best I have learned to attempt to ignore and not interact with situations or things that seem threatening.   For myself now at age 36 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia but have been able to trace back its roots to about the age of 16-17. Your awareness of what your going though this early I think will give you a great head start in however you choose to deal with it. Do not let any doctor or anyone tell you that you cannot achieve whatever you set out for though."

All of my visuals come and go within a day or sometimes get stronger in certain weeks. I don't typically project them into real life, they're like a film over my eyes. They respond to my emotions like whenever I get angry, then happy, then sad, whatever it's like somebody's changing different sunglasses over my eyes. just with moving pictures in them. They don't seem like solid hallucinations in front of me but it's hard to see ""through"" them, they're vivid and real and distracting.  Now that youre older have you tried any medications? I once tried adderall to force me focus and it worked pretty well but I hate the idea of meds. In a way no matter how stressful they can be I like the visuals.

schizophrenia,3a8vr5,vapor_rat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:34:25 2015 UTC,"I have attempted a few medications and many times of self medication. What I can say is for myself smoking was a problem as it would trigger the effects a bit more, but I was addicted so refused to address it for many years. Felt much better after kicking that. Drinking caused hell on wheels and i never really liked it because it was very ""social"" and hanging out was horrifying.  The ones I got from my doctor really did not help myself. They made me able to cope a bit better but the side affects where so bad that I just stopped. Everyone did not approve of me doing that but I saw the side effects inhibiting my ability to work.  Not all of my hallucinations are a solid object or person sitting in the room. Many of them ""layer"" or augment what I see and hear. It was only recently when getting a gopro like camera for other reasons that when watching the video's things did not look the same as before. I am still unraveling and attempting to figure out how to tell what I am seeing and hearing is real.  All I can say is therapy has been the best thing that has helped me to cope. My psychiatrist has helped me understand what is affecting me but therapy has really helped me on how to cope better.  Do not have the best advice for friends though. I have turned into a bit of a shut in when at home. At work i upkeep ""friends"" but really its just a facade. They are not bad people at all I just do not know how to relate to them.

schizophrenia,3a9xqg,hotnerds77,2,Thu Jun 18 11:50:53 2015 UTC,"Many years ago, I found a good survival technique to be ""switching channels"". You know how you can ""normally"" sometimes consciously start thinking about something, or involving yourself in something? Examples would be, getting back into a movie or a book, or starting a computer game, or doing a grocery list. Or if you're high-functioning-- driving, or doing office work, or coding, or even painting and writing. But of course, for schizos, the examples are much more interesting. At one point, I had several different scenarios of intrusive thoughts and/or hallucinations, and once I noticed the transitions between them, I was able to start ""changing channels"" somewhat at will. If you have ever been stuck in a horrid set of delusions, you realize that such toggling off/out-of such a thing can be literally life-changing. Even if suddenly you have moved into a paranoid state where everyone is reading your mind, or whatever, it may be better than the one you just left.  I advocated learning to ""change channels"" for years, but I'm a bit rusty these days with the terminology I used. Sometimes it was as easy as listening for characteristic voices, or watching for characteristic ""meanings"" that were for whatever reason, less unpleasant than the ones I was experiencing.  You know your life is going weird when hearing demonic voices behind you and having chills run up your spine and your hair stand on end, with a brief panic feeling-- means you're getting rooted again, and things are going better. hehe. Or if you start thinking about the thoughts of people around you, in order to escape the thoughts of ~other~ things, etc.  That's old school for me. Like, we're talking 20 or 30 years. I'm high-functioning, and I think that moving between delusional scenarios was my start to a ticket outta crazy town, to some extent. I thought it relevant to the question.  I don't typically try to create non-physical experiences, because BOOM suddenly there they are. This made learning traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) chi pathways, both very difficult and very easy. It became a very sensory thing, with a lot of sorting involved. I still know a few dozen acupuncture points that I can stimulate pretty easily now. Depending on how much you believe in qi-gong, those energy flows could be considered hallucinations, but they're quite clear to me."
schizophrenia,3a9xqg,valleyspirit,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:22:42 2015 UTC,"Dissociative states can be induced which can include hallucinations and pseudohallucinations, but I do not think they are quite a result of psychosis.

schizophrenia,3a9xqg,JosephFaolan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:19:39 2015 UTC,"People with schizophrenia don't need to be in a dissociative state to experience hallucinations. I would say dissociation is just a cheat to trick yourself into thinking that you do hallucinate, when you really just imagine things. Very much like just blurring the image, instead of using real photo manipulation. I have taken datura and DPH, then just stared on the floor and it was like a weird dream that is near impossible to remember. Wouldn't call that hallucination at all. More like open-eyed dreaming. Nothing alike hearing clear voices that communicate with you, while being wide awake. It is an entirely different matter.  I just wanted to clarify this, and how this doesn't relate much to schizophrenia. Because dreaming or imagining things more intensely, or just blurring the lines between A and B is something different than solidly hallucinating or having very very clear and powerful (but flawed) ideas and concepts. Which is what really makes schizophrenia special. If anything implies that you are locked into some very volatile state of consciousness that is hardly compatible with much of anything you do in life, it can't really serve any purpose. If I wanted that, I would probably try a sensory deprivation tank or something. I think anyone can possibly achieve this, but doesn't because it simply lacks utility."

And, oh yeah, there was one other thing-- that world was intellectually stimulating. It was exciting like a dark movie. It made me important. It gave a plot to my life. It made me ~think~ hard about things and propelled me forward with some sense of urgency.  Long story short-- I didn't need to live in someone else's novel, and I didn't need the extra intellectual stimulation. Fuck that, to be honest. It wasn't worth the cruelty or the cruel light that it portrayed other humans in. So if you remove the interesting-ness, what have you got?  On one hand, you've got a dark and cruel world that isolates you from people, from other HUMANS. You've got some ego on the line, and you've got pride and/or self-worth on the line, maybe. You may even have some bitter disgust or hatred for the people doing these things, but really that also just falls in the category of a hateful place where you're separating yourself from other humans. And THEN, on the other hand, you've got a beautiful world, full of kind people generally (especially in comparison to the dark world), and you've got inner happiness that isn't dependent on the actions or behaviors of others. You've got freedom from clinging to hatred and mistrust, and you've got inner light, and you've got self-growth, and you may even get back your altruism and love of your incarnation if you spend enough time in the ""light"" world.  For me it was a no-brainer. I committed to rising above the bullshit. I decided to be a better person than all the crap.  Perhaps it was watching my mother survive, day by horrid day, in that hell of a world she lived in, for decades of her life. But after watching that, I was simply NOT going to stay in the ""dark"" world. Fuck That. Seriously. Fuck That. My bottom line quickly became, ""I have no interest in being anything like people or things who could be so stupid as to behave that way. And,-- here's the kicker-- anything that stupid is NOT running the universe. There's OBVIOUSLY mind out there, which is intelligent enough to be kind and to be laterally mobile in culture, and that mind is NOT the crap of the ""dark world"". So, that pretty much negates the idea that the cruel and dark world of delusions is actually the ""larger world at large"". Because it's not. It's not only cruel and dark and self-damaging and useless, but it's also too stupid (by nature of the fact that it IS those other things) to actually be the status quo. Rise above it. Then, after spending some time in the light and breathing nice air, and loving yourself, and (gasp...) loving the world-- THEN decide what it may be. Don't lose yourself for days or weeks or decades in what is simply crap. If you ever watched a loved one do it, you would find a way to claw your way into the better place, and stay there. Best to you."

One of them being ideas of reference.  So they'll say stuff that I'll find insulting and that will scare me, but they won't say it directly to my face.  Kind of as if I were saying ""some people should really be stabbed"" to someone while looking at you, but in a way that is less obvious.  When this is happening, I have to assume that I'm just being delusional again, because being delusional is usually the reason for this. However, it's been happening a lot more often recently, whereas the voices, for example, have been much more quiet than usual.  Their motive being that it's an easy way to make fun of someone, because I can't stand up for myself and act on what I have to assume to be a delusion. I've asked two people about this. Both of them have denied that this is actually happening, but both are the kind of people who'd have great fun with things like this, as is everyone else who is involved. I've seen them bully other people.  All of this sounds silly in compare to a lot of the other stuff that you find on here, but it gives me a huge headache and it's been going on for months, I can't stop thinking about it and would rather get myself checked into a hospital, if this really just is a delusion."

I do agree it sounds really bothersome, and like a doctor said once to me about my hallucinations this sounds really real.    When I was in the hospital and there was a person who was behaving really oddly we would talk about them.  Sometimes that person would over hear and get upset with us.  We would always deny it.  The person would be a bit more upset but usually walk away. People could be doing it but maybe their intention is not to hurt you they are just being careless. Nanlons' Razor: don't put to malice what could be accounted for by negligence.  I know i started risperdal and it is used sometimes for psychosis and other times for anger issues.  It is really nice aside from the akathisia.  I was starting to get upset that everyone in my town was talking about me but no one would talk to my face.  Then I took risperdal. Now everyone still talks about me but it does not bother me so much.  You could be right a trip to the hospital might be a good place if you wanted some different meds.  However the hospital is expensive and i generally do not like to suggest hospitals because i have had a bad time there.  do you have a psychiatrist?  Could you go to your regular medical doctor and ask for some help?  I see a medical doctor for most meds because i do not have a psychiatrist close by."

It's easy to move away from coding as your career progresses, unless you really like coding.

The author dropped out of college because of mental distractions, had a nervous breakdown, was diagnosed schizo, and got shock treatments. Then, with his ""it's not me, but it's really me"" narrative, he was instrumental in introducing Zen to a world very hungry for information on eastern philosophies (think, the ""Bruce Lee"" craze, and ""Karate Chops"" in action movies). ZAMM is one of the most famous English-language books in the last century, to be sure (though people are forgetting about it these days, and we've got a glut of information on all manner of esoteric philosophies and religions, through the internet, now).

In fact I have better hygiene that my house mate.   Please tell me the Doctor you're talking to is just a GP.

On it, I don't exhibit any positive symptoms and rarely have negative symptoms. I work as a software engineer and had a career for 10 years. I also study taking online courses. I have an engineering degree (although I got it before onset).  So basically the only thing that it out of normal for me is the pill I take before I got to bed.  So yeah, you can be normal and be schizophrenic.   I would say the extra challenge for people like me is to get society to accept that I am normal.  So like I had a girl tell me that she wouldn't date me because of my illness. I had a priest tell me that I will never get married for the same reason. And I might have an issue immigrating to Canada (I live in lebanon) on account of my condition.  None of it has to do with how I act daily and have for years. All of these assumptions are based on if were to stop taking my medication and remain unmedicated for months for psychosis to reappear.   So it is an uphill battle to get people to understand that i am normal. Although I usually don't share my health status with employers and people in general.  I will also add that I have been told in the past that I am not a schizophrenic by doctors and other people, because i am so normal."

Work isn't all fun. You have to put the time and do the work even when you don't like it. You just have to stick through. Remember little steps when they pile up become a whole body of work.   I work in software. Sometimes I don't feel like coding. I feel bored or think that it is difficult. So I divide the problem into little pieces and do these little pieces. Little by little, I find myself writing the program that I need to write.  3- Music helps. I found that music helps me while coding. It helps shut out the distractions of the world and my thoughts. But it is a double edge sword be careful.  4- Don't quit. Accept the bullshit that people might give you at work. You might not see eye to eye with everyone. Don't be aggressive, just deal with people as you are and keep it in mind that you are all here to do a job.  5- Stay up to date in your free time and do things you enjoy so that you can give your work 100%.  6- be cool under pressure and accept that it is part of the job.

No. You have diagnoses which can cause psychotic symptoms and you are taking drugs which may cause such reactions.  Those need to be eliminated before considering a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.
schizophrenia,3a2ryj,frost0r,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:27:55 2015 UTC,Look. the drugs suck but tell your doctor you've still got issues. get the medication upped. then once you're stable you an be reduced to what is called a maintenance dose. This should end up being less than what you'll get initialed put on unless you still have issues. You may need the higher dosage to be able to get the symptoms under control at first but again once you're stable talk to your doctor about reducing to the level you both are comfortable with.  I think i remember reading the more attacks you have the more medication you may end up needing to be on permanently. So get your issues under control NOW rather than putting it off and doing more harm than good.

schizophrenia,39zp37,Tip718,2,Tue Jun 16 04:23:02 2015 UTC,"To me, everyone else is delusional. My mind constantly tries to figure out other people's thoughts. It can be pretty stressful, depending on how far it goes. Sometimes I get lost in it. I am currently trying to get into the minds of mice. It is not so much distressful to perceive their thoughts and feelings, than it is to realize the strong parallels between them and the reasoning of people.  Tell your voices that they are retarded as fuck. There is simple logical proof that suicide cannot change your experience. Because experience requires existence. If you kill yourself, all that you will experience is the pain before death. You will not end or begin anything with it. Not suffering, not happiness, not Christmas not anything. Because all those things require that you experience them. And the end of experience cannot be experienced as well, only the things that happen before it, if you thought you could smart the facts out. The end of your existence, will simply have zero effect on you. It is not that nothing will happen after death, but that there is no after to begin with. Not accepting or understanding this logic is the delusion."
schizophrenia,39zp37,hotnerds77,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:02:10 2015 UTC,Well put. Sometimes I think insects are on a whole different plain of existence and are represented oddly in our 3rd dimension. Or maybe the universe/solar system is some sort of organism we can't comprehend because we are so tiny. And mammals are interesting due to the kinship.
schizophrenia,39zp37,0n3tw0,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:14:39 2015 UTC,"I think the universe is best understood in 5 dimensions. 3 for space 1 for time 1 for proability. It is not that those dimensions are but that they make sense to our interpretation. The smaller the scales, the more we find that everything just resolves into randomness. Dimensions itself stop making sense. String theory and other non-standard physics models try to explain it with extra 10 or 26 or whatever dimensions. But you could as well go as far as to scale the math to infinite dimensions, that then just become increasingly uncomputable. I think it is fair to conclude with our current level of empiric knowledge, that reality itself simply loses its scope of definition with increasingly small scales. Conversely very big scales have already been set from the very beginning and are so defined that hardly any events occur at all.  It is all a matter of scope. Similarly, what we understand as consciousness is only defined within a certain scope within the mentioned 5 dimensions. Our bodies extend through space within certain limits, that we can influence. The same is undeniably true to time, and somewhat less obviously through probability. It is not that we exist at any certain point within those dimensions, but in a certain range. Our brain is never one atom, a single thought we have never occurs in a single nanosecond but in many many seconds if not hours, days or weeks, and decisions we take or opportunities we have are not momentary either. Those are just plain logical conclusions, but they seem so counter-intuitive to people's natural state of experience, that they are blinded towards actually making this realization. Therefore what they can understand can only make sense within a smaller range.  What is interesting about this understanding of reality is, that you can expand consciousness (and everything within reality) as a whole and reason about the effects. Insects are on a lower plane of consciousness, because they are more connected to nature. Nature meaning the rules,  shapes and environements that evolution has developed them into over the course of very long timespans. The lower the plane of consciousness, the more the life form lives through high numbers. The will of one becomes the will of many. Scientists try to reduce everything to its elements, to understand it through conventional social exchange within the scientific system. But consciousness itself is highly interconnected, so we fail greatly to even grasp it, yet build any usable model for it that makes sense.  I believe the element of schizophrenia only opens your mind towards being able to interpret more than what is fixed on the plane of reason that everyone else is on. But if you leave this plane, things become complicated and unknown to you. Intuition hardly works at all. There are too many new ways to do things wrong. Only through well defined and rigorous logical systems you can possibly navigate this space. Mathematics is universal and we know that the rules and operation of computer programs must directly translate into math, if only math was yet as advanced to comprehensibly grasp computer programs. Since brains are biological computing devices, we can learn from this knowledge how to apply it to thoughts and the mind itself.  What makes naturally sense to people is often more or less the most proven healthy way in terms of evolution. Emotions and thoughts resolve quickly, because this reduces the potential for errors. If you had a thought that will not easily quit for days or month, it maybe is so erroneous that it consumes all your resources in this entire time, to no ends. Many things about cognition can possibly be changed by thought alone. But you have to acknowledge the limits of the system and prepare for the consequences."

Feel free to have a look on Google scholar. One question is whether stress is just a trigger; are people with schizoprhenia somehow fundamentally different? I suspect that you and I would disagree on that point.  The behaviour of a psychotic person is bizarre and extreme, but my belief is that the individual is fundamentally normal but displaying a reaction to extreme life events. Now , of course not everybody goes psychotic when bereaved, or upon failing exams, or losing their job, etc etc, but some people are more resilient due to their attitudes to life, social support networks and so on.

schizophrenia,3a12ps,SoullessSingularity,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:11:55 2015 UTC,"Hi soullesssingularity, I think the difference between PTSD and psychosis is that the first is caused by extreme acute stress, the latter by extreme chronic stress. With the chronic stress one is eventually pushed over the edge by one or more simultaneous major events.  Psychosis does indeed happen in people who appear to have healthy family dynamics and good attitudes to life. But appearances can be deceptive. For example we traditionally associate divorce with the ""broken home"", a negative thing, but a family who struggles against divorce to avoid the perils of a broken home might be putting pressure on the family members who would probably have an easier life if the family split up. Another example is the woman who never complains thus it is assumed she is fine, but in reality she is bottling up her emotions which eventually explode into unexpected psychosis.   I am sorry you didn't like the way I wrote my article, I guess I went out on a limb and it does need improving. However, I do not feel obliged to apologise if you happen to disagree with me. I would be very happy if I could open up a debate, I am putting forth something which I hope might be new insight;I am not writing an exam so I don't feel a need to provide sources, I am asking people to open their minds.  I did try to give a logical mechanism for reconsidering the role of genetics in schizophrenia, that was my aim in writing the article. The data from studies is my own life experience.  Edit: by life experience I mean the knowledge I have gained by talking to nurses and doctors, reading articles, meeting mentally ill people."

I knew an Indian girl whose family's spiritual guru ""gave her a blessing"" at one of the big Indian river holy festivals. She showed me a picture of this old man draping a scarf over her head, and I said, ""Is the gift the pretty red scarf?"" and she growled and whispered, ""No, he is telling me my prayer IN MY MIND."" So much of our attitude about transpersonal experientia is cultural, and deformed."
schizophrenia,39terp,thecrowdelusion,2,Sun Jun 14 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"Logical thought is, to me, taking something to the extreme of what it sets out to be.  Delusions could be multifaceted assumptions that build a picture which is often difficult to integrate into life.  Where I find value in delusions is identification of the emotion that drives it. This emotion is correct, you have it and I find for me it pays to acknowledge it as true. It may not be helpful, it may be ugly but it is there none the less.  One aspect I appreciate with psychosis is the switch of masks. At least, I appreciate the mechanism as being fundamental to the human condition. We excel I believe because we can change our point of view. With psychosis I find my point of view switches deeper than is traditional, I find I desire to acknowledge deeper contexts and yet am hesitant to throw away all of the previous. This is some what a burden and quite disorientating.  There is no shame in this. There is value in it as a way for your mind to get you to acknowledge some discomfort that will continue to be present. Medication and therapy can help a great deal. If you attempt to suppress these feelings then I believe they have greater impact. I feel it is better to get them resolved. I am currently doing that with delusions from my psychosis last week."

Some more background - Before the episode, for 33 years, I never experienced this kind of experience, or thinking, ever. I'm slowly moving back into how I was, before the psychotic episode.  I don't wish to acknowledge it. I wish that I could erase these past two years of my life, completely. I've slowly been working on rebuilding my life, back to the point right before I got sick.  I figure, hey, it's only two years out of my lifetime, a few years down the line, the experiences will only be a mere blur."
schizophrenia,39terp,sikfoq,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:25:06 2015 UTC,"Understand how humans evolve, change, or are modified by environment/natural forces:  ""...before the psychotic episode."" is a place you cannot recover; I stopped trying to ""recover"" the past. Instead, I see (with CBT) what I am now. For example, in childhood, I wanted to be by myself and play, and I did that as much as possible. Currently, I understand that old motivation as very important, but act on those behaviors while still doing mandatory stuff like eating, hygiene, or errands.  ""...slowly moving back into how I was"" may be toxic regression into deeper shame; if you want to get to the root of your ""self"", you can be confident that toxic shame is not there. I am in touch with my radical self, the vital force I find there.  Talk with your doctor or therapist about past and future as mental blockages."
schizophrenia,39terp,jkeller4000,2,Sun Jun 14 19:46:37 2015 UTC,"you talked about cbt.  i only took a very small amount of dbt,  i am not sure if theses concepts are similar.    emotions are to help motivate a person to action.  if you take no action the emotion builds ntil an action is taken,  like take anger, some one hurts you, you feel anger,  you then either ask them to apologize, or you punch them in their face.  then you do not feel so angry and you forget it.  now i nowt very good with the shame one. i am not sre what action it wants you to take, asking your therapist  they might be able to help there,   I will assume though you feel ashamed so this is to motivate you to do work never to be delusional again.  but you have worked on it, so maybe there is more actions to take.  did you hurt someone when you were delusional? do you need to try to make amends? or are you just super embarrassed and never want to make the same mistake again?   I have lots like the time i went into the hospital for bugs crawling all over me, i asked 6 nurses to look at my head because i was certain they could see bugs.   and i am embarrassed i did it.  i tel myself never again will i let my hallucinations be so real to me,but i keep failing. and so i keep trying more and more to not let them take control.  i try to avoid the embarrassing things.   i know i used to think halucinations were funny before i had them, and so a little of the emotion i feel is kinda anger at myself for not understand other people.  and now that i understand i get mad at myself for not being smart enough before to understand.   tl:dr; emotions are useful, let them help guide you and they will become less strong."

He believed inside every human was a wild, uncontrollable, and animalistic force that could not be contained and that would taint every human's intellect and emotions, behavior and decisions. He believed also though that this unconscious mind within every human was a force of great majesty and beauty despite its sinister influence.  According to him this part of the mind gave way to art, religion, literature, and the human experience. He believed that civilization was inherently evil and designed to oppress every human and contain the dangerous forces within the mind and because of both the evilness of the individual human and the evilness of society, Freud became isolated and pessimistic of the world."

schizophrenia,39ti48,sikfoq,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:54:10 2015 UTC,"Freud got in trouble when he was a young psychiatrist, by pointing out the huge number of sexual abuses of children and patients that was going on. You can do your own research, I won't corroborate myself. He then changed to mainstream theories and became hugely successful. The word ""hysteria"" comes from the idea that women get ""hysterical"" and have mental problems when their clitoris isn't stimulated enough, and that was the scientific age that Freud was born into. Edit: same root as the word, ""hysterectomy"". He suppressed his own studies and ""changed his mind"" about his initial work, in order to have a career with the current crop of nuts.  The last major school of Freudian medical thought in the U.S. was/is?? Harvard. I once accompanied a victim of childhood sexual abuse to a Harvard-trained psychiatrist, who recommended that she was fine, but that I should be committed for inpatient observation, for having issues with her behavior (I wasn't having any ""issues"" that I could recall, except trying to be supportive. My sin was being a male, I think.). Edit: Yes, the person I was with thought she was crazy, as well, and almost ran for the door when we were ""done"". Freudian psychs are nuts, in my limited experience. 100% and completely. Sometimes a nut is just a nut.  Jung's ideas on ""self"" and ""pleroma"" (the ""many""), and individuation, come from the huge amount of reading he was doing on Buddhism and Eastern philosophies. Let me just point out that if you read the German translations of Eastern philosophies, common to his time, they are a bit.... ""off"" to put it politely. Poor translations to say the best."

schizophrenia,39ti48,sikfoq,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:32:58 2015 UTC,"I think Jung acquired ""pleroma"" from Gnostic teachings. I also thought pleroma was ""non-dual"" reality? Some Gnostic teachings come from Greco-Buddhist syncretic exchange, so one way or another, it comes from the ""east""."
schizophrenia,39ti48,valleyspirit,2,Mon Jun 15 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Hehe. As pleroma is both differentiated and undifferentiated, it falls outside of our conscious contemplation, right?  Word-play aside, I think Jung's pleroma is indeed incapable of being qualified by dualistic mind, or qualified at all, by his definition. Yeah, non-dual. This to me, means that we cannot exclude consciousness or life from its ""nature"". We can't exclude anything from its nature.  I think I have deferred to the idea that Jung may have attached a proper gnostic word to a very common Taoist or Buddhist concept,  where we ourselves inhabit and are inhabited by ""the ten thousand things"", ~rather~ than having fully embraced a gnostic ideal of a non-living reality (or a non-perceiving reality or a non-qualifying reality) which is in some way differentiated from our own perceptive state. For one thing you'd have to immediately toss out any gnostic ideal of a non-living or non-animate pleroma.  In fairness, this is long before French metaphysicists started whining that noumenal reality was a much a part of reality as phenoumenal reality. I think French metaphysics was a very late but reasonable contribution to the western discussion, of which Jung was aware.  Perhaps you are right, for sure. I think an ""eastern"" viewpoint would be more or less (pardon the equivocal pun) forgiving of our selves as manifestations of the pleroma, in the pleroma. But I am not so solid on gnostic teaching.  In other words, yeah probably, but I don't personally get much animism from gnosticism, and I think it's implicit in Jung's use of the word. School me should you feel so declined."

Your sister needs to be in a facility, I think (and I opposed commitment for a family member for many many many years until her death, but in this case, I think your sister needs to be in a care facility). If this is the U.S. you should be able to throw a fit to get Spanish-speaking staff for her, and if the squalor is too bad you can have someone investigate and force-ably remove people from the situation.

You need to take care of your own needs. A therapist may talk to you more about solutions and how this affects you. Your siblings might benefit from therapy, too. But, you need to put yourself first.   As for your sister, it sounds like she needs social skills and job skills training. I think you need to ask her to take her psychologist/psychiatrist more seriously. It's important for her to take control of her own treatment as much as possible. Life-skills training can help with some of the issues you mentioned.  In a strict sense, your mother should really be responsible for her children. I think it's risky for you to take on more family responsibility. I don't know how you feel about it, or much about the situation at home. But, I'm concerned that you're taking on too much.

Tell him that you may feel differently about what he is experiencing. Treat him like he's never changed. He is your brother. Continue being that influence he needs in his life.

If the mind can produce dreams with audio/visuals, then I assume it can do so while we are awake. Psychosis is therefore like a hernia in how one part of the body is moving into another part through a tear in the muscle tissue; our unconscious is pushing through a rift in our central nervous system so that what we imagine is real, and vica-versa."

Two years ago I started reducing my medication with my doctor's help because he told me that there was a chance that I never experience psychosis again. I had been without symptoms before.  I ended up developing psychosis 6 months later and getting back on meds. However although my psychosis was more public this time as I posted online videos and because of facebook, it was less severe than the psychotic episode I had 6 years earlier.   For instance in 2007, I heard voices, I had visual hallucinations smell hallucinations in addition to delusions.  In 2013, I suffered from mild delusions. A part of it seemed to be the time that passed.  My p-doc tells me today that there is a chance that in the future to stop the medication. While I don't want to in the next 5 to 8 years. Maybe 15 years from now it might be a good idea to try again. And if that happens, I might not need to go back on meds.  So in short, over time psychosis becomes less severe and disappears.

I have had moments where i'm totally clear and at peace and then there was one time when the voices got way to close and started speaking like they were in my head instead of coming from somewhere.  I have had a bad trip. And it is by far worse thing i have ever experienced. I didn't learn anything useful. It was hell on earth. Way worse than what happens in a typical bad trip.  Since then i have been very weary about trying them again. Honestly, i would not recommend someone diagnosed with schizophrenia to do psychedelics.

I was never 16 with schizophrenia, I was diagnosed at 19.  I can only imagine how hard it is adjusting to this lifestyle when you've barely even decided what you're doing on this earth.  Trust me when I say things will get better.  They might get a little worse for a while, but with enough effort you will be able to walk down the street or fall asleep without irrational fear nipping at you with every step.  Some advice: take some time off from the things stressing you out if you can.  Not so much that you slip into boredom, but enough that you have some time to do the things that you truly enjoy, or start doing things you think you might enjoy.  Distraction and relaxation are key to getting a greater perspective on your experiences."

I have been schizo for about 35 years and meds-free for 30 years and I can tell you these three things: 1) The people who survive and ""get better"" just drop off the medical radar. But there are lots of us, achieving our dreams and loves. On meds and off meds. Some of the new meds are pretty amazing compared to 30 years ago. 2) If I have learned anything in decades and decades of dealing with ""things no one else can sense"", its that they're BULLSHIT. They are not as substantial as what you had to eat last time you ate. They are NOT worth being terrified of. That's the only game. Not hurting you, not taking over the world, not infesting those around you with demons, not anything except bullshit. The only game is your reaction, and your fear, and you can learn to control it. In this way, you are NOT different from everyone around you-- you are just the same, learning to control your reaction to things you experience. Finally, 3) There are millions and millions of people having similar experiences, and you can do this. Humans are amazing. (You're human, right?) Yeah, humans can do this. It's freaky and it's different but humans deal with this every day, all over the world, and you can do it. Keep in mind that the meds don't just suppress the voices,-- they lower your anxiety after they get into your system. That's a big win. A huge win. Best of luck."
schizophrenia,398rdw,valleyspirit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:14:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah you just started. Psych meds especially antipsychotics tend to just flatten feeling across the whole spectrum even feeling you might desire or work towards ( a giddy caffeine buzz moment, being hyper in a good way) You'll still get feelings, all of them but what meds ought to do is quiet down noise, your symptoms especially your anxiety that comes from symptoms should be lessened to where you're clear minded and focused on what you're doing rather than racing thoughts/ paranoia. I don't know what you're taking but I'm assuming an AP.  You can take on a lot of activities if you're up for it. It's a great opportunity to be in school and have these avenues  to go down, sports, clubs, all good stuff. You should try to find a group for young people with mental illness. Maybe your clinic has some or knows where there might be one. Being around others struggling through the same thng can be helpful, so can groups focused on developing coping skills. Life does and can get so much better as you get older. People in this day and age are becoming aware of their illness, learning about it and doing the best they can to cope and deal. Keep coming to this subreddit too. I don't know if it's the same for everyone but hen I was your age I didn't see a lot of hope in my future. Things changed so much down the road and I learned so many things about myself I didn't know. Still learning too. If you could go back to 12 year old you would you be able to help her?"

N=/=1 Not one person really has the same chemical imbalance though schizophrenia treatment options are generally used in the same (average per person) The real question here to ask is if there is any harsh side effects of the medication. I remember how many different cocktails it took to have me on the right medicine at the right dosage I went a few months around 11 trying almost everything my psychiatrist threw at me..

schizophrenia,397xv1,Pyid,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:24:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, and it made miracles. No more hallucinations, no more paranoia, and it even helped improve the negative symptoms: MUCH increased ability to concentrate, will to take care of myself, balance the affect, be less reclusive etc.  However, Clozapine requires a lot of maintenance: You will need to have a weekly complete blood workout every week for the first 18, and then each month for the rest of the duration you use the medicine. The main concern is developing White Blood Cell deficiency, which occurs in 1-2 percent of the people who take the medicine. You can also expect increased appetite, and an increase in blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine and liver enzymes. You will have to monitor them, and you will probably have to become active with aerobic workouts, as to not gain a lot of weight and increasing all of the above to dangerous levels.   On a side note: Clozapine probably will make you extremely sleepy, for the first 6-12 months it will knock me fast asleep within 20-30 minutes and will require at least 10-12 hours of sleep to function. After about 18 months of usage, I can make do with 7-8 and will be somewhat resistant to the knocked asleep part, but it's still there. Also, I experience hypersalivation, which can be countered with medicines but since it doesn't really hurt anything I just let it be for the time being. Mainly, I just take the medicine 30 minutes before planning to go to sleep, and it helps falling asleep. I advice not to take it during the day, for the reasons stated above.  I think that about covers most of it - feel free to PM for more information."

Oh Baby, don't you know, I'm feeling SO much... nothing.   Available in stores now! The new album, I'm Feeling So Much Nothing, by CallMeStranger. Featuring the smash hits, ""Can You Not Feel Me"", ""Baby You Know I Don't Have That Feeling"", ""The Blues Must Not Be Trying Because They Haven't Found Me"", and ""I May Not Be There For You"".

""I want to tap into my emotions to motivate myself...""  Well, don't forget to remember this one thing. We think our actions (including our emotional actions and our emotive reactions) come from motivation. But that's not how we're hard-wired. Motivations come from actions.  Motivations are learned functional processes that we embrace as conditioned, functioning creatures. Conditioned not as in programmed, but conditioned as in, we have a body, we have limbs, we breath air, we eat and poop, etc. Our motivations flower because our organism knows the past result of our actions. Motivations come from actions.  Just do. Just do it, or just do the other thing, or just do the thing that's not it, or whatever. You are doing anyway, you may as well find something functional to do, while you are doing. As others have said, drugs are quite known to have this affect. But it won't stop you from going down the path where you are creating emotional and intellectual motivation, by pursuing functional actions.  I'm just saying, you still have some control here. But you've got to be willing to work to be paid, instead of waiting for the gold to drop before you do anything. Trying to tap into motivation is like waiting for someone to pay you before you do any work.  Best of luck, stranger. You are the voice of thousands and thousands, when you post things like that.

Now on to the more pressing matter: Not everyone diagnosed with a mental illness becomes any of what you just asked, however more people with a mental illness do versus those who have no illness.

Or the next Jimi Hendrix, right? My basic personal challenge with the few bipolar people I have known, is that they swing from ""I can do ANYTHING! I AM GREAT!!"", to grievous self-deprecation and depression. And so, when someone like that is peaking, at what point do you buy into the self-hype, and encourage it, versus taking a step back and acknowledging qualities but encouraging something less modest? What if that person is a wife or a child? My personal experiences have shown that to contribute, you have to temper the great self-glories, as well as the immense self-harshnesses, and come to the understanding with the person that the truth is somewhere more human and practical. For instance, someone who is peaking on their ""I can do anything"" sort of vibe, may go out and have an incredible series of sexual conquests and misadventures, and then when they start losing their empowerment they may suddenly realize they have grossly crossed their own personal boundaries, and will spend a year or years, doing penance for their actions, and being scarred by their own behaviors. I am just trying to share the little experience I have with bipolar individuals.  Blame and regret will serve no purpose. Fear of the future, similarly, won't help much. I have very modest non-professional advice, and it's pretty simple, so just take it for what it is. Here it is:  Stay busy, stay organized, keep things in neat little boxes, set a goal or two and work toward them, and do not stray, and get yourself into a nice, deep, monumental rut of a pattern, and cultivate stability from deep deep in the bottom of a rut that you have personally designed for yourself. And then, be careful of change, and cultivate the art of ""steering"" your rut without leaving it. In other words, establish a functional, challenging, hard-working comfort zone with an applied focus, and be careful when you depart much from it.  Example: Get in college. Go FOUR years without any significant breakdown or relapse or episode. Graduate from college with honors. Big, open possibilities, big open challenges, no clear path, plus a little bit of self-tripping on the accomplishment... and BOOM, massive breakdown and massive episodes and hospitalization, after four years of stability. Start post-college career with a huge friggin' episode and breakdown. Only start recovering fully after spending time in a solid job, which unfortunately wasn't the first one because it took some job floating to find a stable professional home.  That's a scary example but I have to tell you-- in a similar example, a close family friend who happened to be a (""semi-famous-in-her-profession"") psychologist, warned me-- when ""x"" happens, they won't have their stable structure, and they're going to have a breakdown. And she was right. And BOOM breakdown. She told me it would happen a year before it did, and got it right, to the month. So, I modestly submit that massive self-structured life seems to help immensely, and when you have to steer and change your life, then care should be put into steering that beast of structure that you create.  Also, hospitalization and homelessness? Fear not. They are temporary things. I can't tell you the number of people I've met who look back at hospitalizations or episodes or being on the street or sofa-sleeping, and the one thing they have in common almost always, is that these things pass. They pass and years later it's just something that happened. It's like your parking permit expiring and you get a ticket. You try to avoid it, but hey-- you will make it through. Stress is not useful. These things are very avoidable, and when they can't be avoided, life will go on anyway so there's no point in stressing. Strive for stability, and the more stable you are, the more solid value you'll find for yourself, and the less blame and regret you'll have to live with. Best to you.  My advice is strong stability and structure, with as little ""unknowns"" as possible, and then staying focused on the forward path. You can improve your instability by consciously cultivating stability. Not just as an attitude, but as a set of consistent actions in your life."

And to make matters worse, judging by wife, it's contagious. I want to contribute to the world and in fairness I have achieved a lot in my life. I think I have just as much a shot at guitar greatness as anyone else who puts in 10,000 hours.  Have you seen the studies that say that it takes about 5,000 hours of doing something, to make you an expert at it, currently in our world? Some people also quote ""10,000 hours to master something."" This applies to so many things that I have become rather amazed by this statistic. For instance, most of the military aircraft demonstration flight crews get up around 5k logged hours as they start being good. This number seems to also apply to internal energy (chi) development, kung-fu forms learning, etc. etc.   If I played 3 hours of guitar a day, in one year I'd have roughly 1000 hours. So, if I play 3 hours of guitar a day, for five years, I start being good enough to play professionally. Well, that seems possible, but it seems a bit light for ""expert"" (or I'm slow, hehe). So let's say that I start getting guitar creds if I play six hours a day for 5 years, OR if I play 3 hours a day for 10 years. Yeah, that sounds about right.  Sure! Go for it! I am. I just recently picked it up again, with massive encouragement over several years, from my wife.  I think schizo has probably claimed more possible world-changing geniuses than we can count.

It's rare that a person with mental illness becomes a successful artist, so I'm skeptical about the reason to put this logic forward. Why would someone suggest that schizophrenia or another mental disorder is likely to make a person more artistic? Most of the time mental illness makes life more difficult.   I believed I was changing the world when I filled three notebooks with word salad. It hurts me that I spent so much time obsessed with my own thoughts. I would rather have been forming relationships. My creative outlet didn't make me more artistic, it kept me from experiencing real life, and removed me from reality.

It is an option maybe, but the depths this could take are rather extreme and unhealthy if you really tried. The artist is often trying to convey their whole emotions, individual experiences over longer timeframes, that they want to share. In other music they convey things they wish to be true, an idealized path success so to speak, based on real experiences of course.  The information density in music is just too low to seriously uncompress the actual message in full detail. It is after all just music. So you rather take a little bit of it, but not too much, however it works out by itself without getting too absorbed in it."

schizophrenia,391u11,hotnerds77,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:16:29 2015 UTC,"I have tried to analyze music recently because I can't really comprehend it on a fundamental level. So I can't really create it either. It bothers me that I can't understand it.   I am not sure what ""stories"" you are exactly talking about, other than lyrics obviously. I am interested in that. Superficially most songs are always about the same basic emotions, often it is just love and rejection. Then there are cultural influences of the time that influence the emotional directions. We either share that plainly from having lived through that era, or having aquired it later on through keeping in touch with old media content.  But what are the rules, the formula so to speak, to put all this together into a linear stream? That's what I would also categorize crucial to telling the ""story"" of the music and part of it. Other than that a story has to be about having a certain experience in a certain situation, obviously.  I have felt somewhat close to understanding some rules with demoscene music. It is more minimalistic, schematic and discrete in nature, no lyrics and limited sound-effect ranges.  For one major part, music mimics the sorting activity of underlying cognitive processors inside the human brain/mind in an idealized manner. The sort of maximum pattern frequency that any person can tolerate in music is around 32 Hertz, from 240 BPM with 8 TPB. But what kind of sorting is happening there? Then also there are parallels to language from the different instrument sounds, especially if you compare this to early mammalian languages, e.g. mouse and rat language or prairie dog language and of course frequency and time-scale this to account for sensory and nervous system changes since then. In general, truly understanding animal language (that is, what is commonly understood by people as plainly grunts and squeeks without particular meaning) seems to be key to understanding the language of music concerning note patterns and arrangements.  Well anyway I listened to La Dispute - 35 and I find that it is very simply about a guy who feels for a short moment, but not really anywhere near seriously, that he needs to break free from ordinary everyday worklife to look at the world at a wider angle. Very simple rock melody. Can't see anything particularly interesting in this song.  So that song is about you because you feel the same? How is that so interesting?"

But despite the overreaction, which might be interruptive to following the song, how do your feelings not resonate with the conveyed message?  I mean it is just like watching a movie about alien invasion and then overreacting to it. Because you imagined it with such an intensity that you believed that the movie is actually real, and that aliens actually landed on this planet. Thus then you begin thinking about locking the door, getting a weapon, stashing food reserves, etc. instead of following the movie further.

In other words, I would move to prevent this particular scenario from happening, by disproving it to the extent I can, removing ~any~ believe-ability or purpose from it whatsoever, and then help myself to let it go, and move on.  There is no telling what is beyond the door, metaphorically, when you step from one room of scenarios to the next room of new scenarios, but I survived by removing any intellectual stimulation or interest or purpose or validity from such scenes, and boldly moving forward to see what tomorrow brings.

However, I think you will find that there is no empirical evidence for these abilities.   This goes hand in hand with what scripture says, and the occult activity being exposed proves the time of the return of Jesus as now.   Every generation has expected that the Second Coming was imminent.   Live a good life and be at peace, regardless of whether you think the end is near. Scripture says people will be surprised when it comes."

In my experiences I've had ""conversations"" with people that expose my deepest thoughts not known on the surface. It's hard on me because that's a clear breach of privacy. I can learn to accept that telepathy is delusional, but the Revelation stuff I won't. There's a lot being exposed with the occult, and looking at the real world prophecy is being fulfilled. ISIS is going to be attacking Israel in WW3 which is the prophesied war of Revelations. Those of us who look into things realize the Luciferian age is rising, and everyone labels us as the ""crazy illuminrtrzzzzz confirmed"" people.

If you're no longer experiencing these symptoms and feel otherwise mentally alright it's unlikely you had schizophrenia.

schizophrenia,390qoh,JosephFaolan,3,Mon Jun 8 12:43:38 2015 UTC,"I had childhood schizophrenia. It is not something one generally recognizes as abnormal in oneself because one is too young to know better.  What you described certainly seems to indicate childhood psychosis.  You are still very young in terms of development.  For me, I had similar experiences as you described to a degree in early childhood until adolescence, but I still had hallucinations during adolescence, but they were different from the ones I had when I was younger.  If you have no more symptoms, I would say it is something for you to document and keep in case it becomes relevant later.  Watch out for any returns of symptoms, decline in cognitive abilities, depression, or anxiety. If you experience those, contact a doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can."

A lot of not-schizophrenic kids say they see monsters and hear people that aren't there, so I think there's a tendency to ignore it. For me it never stopped, got worse with age.

I'm sorry you're going through this, know that you are not alone, and you do not need to ever hurt yourself to save them.

I'm on medicine to stabilize me after my recent hospitalization, though a goal of mine is to be medicine free in the very near future.

I have the medication for backup, it usually quiets things down when I can't take it anymore.

The most important thing it is you are happy and in peace with yourself.  Many psychiatrist have it difficult to understand it is possible to live with psychosis or schizophrenia without medication, and the only way to solve problems they see it is with more meds. Sometimes it is only need someone to talk with, someone with whom you feel safe and you can organize your ideas.  So your fear is understandable.

It started with a simple paranoia: thinking that people were talking about me. I would get to work and think my co-workers had been talking about me just before I arrived, or I would go to the bathroom at a party and when I got out I would think everybody at the party had been talking about me. Then I started thinking that random people in stores or along the sidewalk were talking about me. Then I started thinking people were watching me, even while I was in my own apartment, which evolved into believing there was a plot where people were watching me and talking about me because they wanted to hurt me. I would even believe there were people in my apartment waiting to kill me in my sleep.  The voice didn't come until some time later. I was laying in bed, trying to sleep, and it told me to gouge my eyes out on the corner of my bedside table. I thought that was stupid and that I was probably just overly tired so I ignored it and went to sleep. It kept coming back at any random time of the day or night. Sometimes just saying one thing and then going away: ""kiss that person"" or ""hit that person"" or ""gouge your eyes out"" (it really seemed to like telling me to do that) but other times it would go on for a while with a list of instructions.  I can go on if you want. I was untreated for just about 4.5 years, and as I mentioned it was all very gradual."

This was many years ago, with borderline-dangerous doses of Mellarill (Thoradiazine?? I think). And yes, they kept upping the doses to get consistent results.

Gestalt is trans-personal-- it works with shared symbolisms and effectively, symbolic-process telepathy. I started ""working"" with this stupid old man at this dying Taoist commune, and I pretty much had my mind opened up just as if I'd traveled to India to meet a guru, gazed upon his blessed purple-chakra-outpouring face, and invited a diamond bullet of love into my third eye. Except, the difference was, Gestalt as done by Perls was all about acquiring functional processes and getting people back on their feet, and back out into the world, despite what atrocities had been inflicted upon them by their lives and their lives' conditioning. No one was out to convince me they were god and then take all my money and fuck me, so to speak. Then, while I was at Stillpoint, I met an old speed-freak witch who was also hanging out at this dying commune, and she was pretty freaky with her mind. So, by the time I had wrapped up the occasional seizures that quitting my meds had given me-- I was quite squarely in the den of vipers, so to speak. I found myself surrounded by very intelligent, very transpersonal individuals, with reasonable background in Taoist meditation, tantra (much of which is demonic, if you actually ~read~ the Tibetan teachings...), transmission of teachings, and finally historical Buddhism and Taoism. And then, oh yeah, Gestalt and witchcraft. I've met Carl Sagan and studied at Cornell and M.I.T. but I have to say that those two people out in Colorado had a larger impact on my life than anything traditionally ""academic"" I've accomplished.  So, (and I've never had the opportunity to say this before, hehe, so here goes a big one....)-- just when I thought the world couldn't get any stranger, with invasive seemingly-self-aware thoughts and gardens of flowering paranoias and conspiracies and finding out that my schizo mother and I were sharing crazy memes, so to speak, and with my father out to turn me into a zombie slave (he ended up coming out to Colorado to get me, but they turned him away at the gate, with a Sheriff present, and didn't even come find me in my cabin to disturb me)-- how do I put this? If you think hearing voices is strange, try learning that not everyone has a problem with it. There. I said it. Millions of Buddhists for instance. I am not a Buddhist though. I'm a software architect."

I'd love to have done that.   I have never heard voices myself (as I am not schizophrenic.. although I have experienced some slight delusions though as part of being bipolar), but I can see that not everyone would mind it. To be honest I have always wanted to know what it felt like. I suppose it depends on how hostile they are?"

My psychiatrist at the time tried switching me over to Abilify the following February because I was becoming quite the porker, but I went back to Zyprexa after two weeks. I tried to stop taking it in August of last year by myself, but I started thinking people were out to get me, racing thoughts, and many numerous physical effects (dizziness, diarrhea, loss of appetite, etc.) I tried again in December and the same thing happened, and I've been on 2.5 mg ever since."

schizophrenia,38tzw6,icantrange,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:33:27 2015 UTC,The easy way to answer this is: Yes. The more complex and complete way to answer this: Our bodies become more aware of the substances we take in. This includes all medication and all drugs/food.  Try not eating chocolate or any kind of caffeine for 6 months then eat a chocolate bar. The thing that helps with my schizo is upping the doseage or lowering the dosage though not on my own but with the guidance of my mental health team. Ive been at the high dose of Seroquel and Tegretol for a while now though when first starting the medication I was taking a very low minimum dose then gradually worked my way up to the current doseages.
schizophrenia,38tt3z,edcujm,3,Sat Jun 6 19:32:08 2015 UTC,"Part of getting diagnosed is dealing with these professionals. It took me five and a half years to get properly diagnosed. There were many people who did not do their jobs or people that ONLY did their jobs along the way. It's important to remember that these professionals are people. I know your circumstances call for you to be diagnosed, and that is tough. There are many tests that need to be preformed to rule out other possible causes of psychosis - unless, of course, there is an acute onset of symptoms that led to a hospitalization and subsequent diagnosis by a psychiatrist. This is a terribly bizarre disorder, so much so that no two people manifest the disorder in the same way. Remain open to help, even if it's not entirely the right fit - it may lead to new and better treatment, meds (if that's what you need/want), diagnosis, etc. Again, about ""Anne,"" don't let her get to you. She's making a diagnosis from what she's choosing to observe. In short: you're not her, she's not you, I'm sorry you're having issues getting help."

The good news is that there is likely to be no real paperwork.  Applying for SSI is verbal most of the time. The lawyer usually takes a legally defined percentage of backpay when you get benefits.  So, if you qualify and get a monthly payment, they will send you backpay for the time you were disabled minus five months (weird SSA rule), and the lawyer would get a percentage of that."

So, your feelings are a product of your brain, like all feelings.  Lovecraft wrote of such things:   The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.  The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

If it's any reassurance, in my (non-qualified) opinion there's nothing you've said here so far that strongly suggests schizophrenia. Small hallucinations (especially late at night when you're tired) and paranoid thoughts can be attributed to anxiety.

The article is focusing on delusions and hallucinations, and it does not address the fact that cognitive deficits and negative symptoms may still indeed be present or even worse, as time goes on.  Recovering does not mean eliminating hallucinations and delusions."
schizophrenia,38oan5,JosephFaolan,2,Fri Jun 5 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"According to an interview that Nash did for American Experience on PBS he did hear voices which, of course, qualify as auditory hallucinations.  Everybody's personal circumstances are unique to them but I think it's interesting to look at the statistics for how things have progressed for different people over time, particularly as they age.  The article does point out the protective factors that are helpful in aiding people's functional recovery but as you so rightly say people with this diagnosis would greatly benefit for assistance with negative symptoms and some of the various cognitive difficulties that often arise.  There are treatments out there for these things, such as cognitive remediation, that should be made available much more widely than they currently are."
schizophrenia,38oan5,ttgr888,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:48:02 2015 UTC,It's important to note that symptoms disappearing doesn't mean that functioning will go back to normal. Symptomatic recovery is far more common than functional recovery.

schizophrenia,38rwvv,MCsam115,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:48:56 2015 UTC,Try ecstasy or LSD! I tried ecstasy and wen't crazy. Spent 3 months in a mental hospital and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It was a life changing experience for me. I was always an atheist but now I believe in a higher being. I believe aliens truly exist.
schizophrenia,38rwvv,Mizzay,-1,Thu Jun 11 16:58:43 2015 UTC,"Although no one has tried this, I can assure you that it works:   Read up on datura on erowid, how to prepare safe potions (as in non-lethal) and what people experience who take it irresponsibly. You want that. Get amounts sufficient for 6 month consumption. Get some solid amounts of meth, cocaine or speed for the next 6 month.  Grab any other drug that really fucks you up from the inside. Like DXM, hawaiian woodrose, PCP, DPH and build some stash.   Now here is the difficult part: You have to train yourself to take the drugs only in certain intervals, without killing yourself from accidental overdoses. Because on the drugs you basically can't tell apart left from right and today from tomorrow. I recommend using an automatic food dispenser for cats with 2g capsules that you can get on ebay. Maybe modify it, make it more resistent against manipulations, such as destruction. Mix all the stuff into the capsules wildly, so that it won't kill you at any point of course.  The next most difficult step is to avoid hospitalization by erratic behavior (e.g. loud screaming or running around with axe) or accidents (e.g. broken leg or scissors in eyesocket). Don't leave the house and remove all dangerous and sharp objects. Lock yourself inside, hide the keys. Don't forget to install safety locks on the window, because you will eventually try to escape through the window even if you live on the 5th floor.  Buy canned food for the next 6 month and stash it in some corner.  Initially, slowly touch up the dosage so that you don't lose control entirely and avoid those disruptive situations as best as possible. Do this for 6 month. This nutjob drug abuse regime will probably punch anyone into irriversible psychosis, if it doesn't result in accidental death or just weird brain damage.  Good luck."

I want everything to go to black then I wake up at the top of a hill overlooking a destroyed city, with cannibalized corpses at my feet.    This nutjob drug abuse regime will probably punch anyone into irreversible* psychosis   FUCK YEAH, that's the way to go.

I do groceries though about 3 times a week. You have to go out though to maintain cardiovascular health. Running and jogging are good. I only do that 10 minutes a day, but it is better than nothing. Don't use elevators etc. Maybe get some weights and do some exercises inside. It doesn't have anything to do with other people. Wear headphones while going outside if people bother you. No one is going to lock you up because you are jogging around the block.  Change your comprehension of the world. People are not evil. There is no evil in this world other than what we perceive within our thoughts and actions. Maybe it is difficult to comprehend, but nothing that people intentionally do is meant to hurt anyone. Because every person in this world would feel uncomfortable with it, can't sustain doing it even if they tried really hard, it goes so much against human nature. The exact opposite is at fault. People are hurt by everything that is done unintentionally, the things that people couldn't forsee because of a lack of proper knowledge or thought.  ""Do not judge and criticize and condemn others, so that you may not be judged and criticized and condemned yourselves."" ~ Matthew 7 AMP  The truth of the matter is, that you don't know what's really going on with others. It is easy to judge, criticize and condemn others so that you can put it under the carpet where you don't have to think about it. And it is challenging to understand how they tried to make sense and you didn't make sense of them. Your feelings are made to tell you to understand this, confront you with the realities of other people so that you can connect to them in a manner that is neither deceptive, nor the result of selfish perspectives. But you don't try to understand your feelings."

It has been a bit of time for me because i am too afriad like i said of the police, and i currently working on getting teeth pulled and doctors appointment and i bought a new book, so i will not be having lots of free time to just sit and see the world.  i do not know if this is how you feel but it is similar to how i think you feel."

It used to bother me more and was even really distressing at times to feel so disconnected and crazy. More recently I find myself experiencing something similar, but not so distressing. I see it as my mind kind of taking a step back and just observing the surroundings - the movement and sounds and colors, and all the people that are each absorbed in their experience, often oblivious to those around them. My reality is usually revolving around myself, my experience, my emotions, my thoughts, my goals and desires, etc as well so I think it's good for me to step back from so absorbed in that to take in the world and people around me...at least occasionally. I appreciate the temporary shift in perspective.  On another note, I've read about symptoms of ""derealization"" that seem to describe that disconnection. It's often described alongside a symptom called ""depersonalization."" They sound sort of similar but I understand it as derealization being the experience of disconnection from reality/the world around you, feeling separate from your surroundings; and depersonalization being the experience of feeling disconnected from yourself, as though you are external to yourself, in a way, watching from a (mental) distance rather than experiencing things firsthand and directly like usual.   Both of those terms come up a lot around describing symptoms when someone has experienced significant trauma as well as described symptoms that may come up during panic attacks. My guess is that these symptoms come up in all sorts of other diagnoses and for a variety of reasons/causes. Just a guess."

A highly functioning schizophrenic can and will perform any job they are capable of. With proper treatment, most people with schizophrenia can lead productive and fulfilling lives.

A separate thought is that I've heard a lot of different people diagnosed with PTSD describe seeing moving shadows and/or animals running by in their peripheral vision. For these people, it doesn't seem limited to happening before/after sleep but rather when they are feeling ""on edge"" or anxious.  It's not impossible for people with schizophrenia to experience the symptoms you described but other types of psychotic symptoms would be present as well. I've also read that auditory hallucinations (voices, other sounds) are more often the primary type of hallucination experienced in schizophrenia but multiple types of hallucinations can be experienced in one person.

Now as a child with schizophrenia it's important you and the child is honest to the psychologist/psychiatist that is going to be helping you once you find one. yes children's and adults imaginations can run wild and that may be the case but remember just because the person is a child does not mean they can not have an actual illness."
schizophrenia,38bmfc,icantrange,2,Wed Jun 3 04:22:30 2015 UTC,"They have special child psychologists that would be the best place to start! I have heard some great things about great child psychologists.  but maybe not all of them are great so it might be like finding one that fits.    but here is my take.  I guess I am only around a 3 year old :( and i have not read too many child development books.  at 6 she should be starting school. and I guess you said class mates.  she could be being picked on.  i know why do i say that,  ""sometimes i feel like I'm not human""   seems to be a negative view of her self.  the students at her school are not making her feel welcome.  ""Or an alien left here on accident""    she does not feel apart of the community. i know you say she went to classmates house. but it seems clear that it is not a ""friends"" house.  so even you seem to be subtly saying your child does not belong to any particular group. i could just be miss reading this.  and a child psychologist would be able to explain things better and or get a more accurate picture.   but it would seem logical that one who does not belong in a group becomes easily frightened because they have to solve every problem by them self and if faced with a problem then cannot solve they will become hurt in some way.  so being afraid of the dog barking she cannot control dogs yet if a dog attacked her she would be defenseless and get hurt.  so imaging or even halucinating a dog and trying to fighure out what to do would be reansonable to make sure if there was a real dog how she would be safe.   now that above is just a quick mostly false analysis.  but going to a psychologist to help your daughter would be the best solution.  because there are many childhood tumors and tumors can cause hallucinations, and a psychologist would be able to notice whether or not other neurological symptoms occur.   I am not a big fan of psych diagnosis for children.  because children are like clay, if you keep telling them they are smart they will try harder to be smart and then they will become smart.  if you tell a child they are different they will feel bad and that will make them more different.  a psychologist would be able to help the child get to the issues and figure out if the child needs more help or what the child can do to help herself feel more accepted by society."
schizophrenia,38bmfc,jkeller4000,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:13:18 2015 UTC,"Ok  So she  does have a psychologist. So there is help, but day to day things come up.  Or she needs more answers than she can get at the doctor.   She is in school.  It's a great, small, accepting school.  She just finished kindergarten and it was a tough year.  There was bullying from a group of girls.  She worked with the school social worker (her idea) and actually resolved it.  She kind of mind hacked the leader who was following her around like a puppy by the last day.  She has a set of friends in her class Ra that are devoted to her.  Approximately 7 girls, the school mate from Monday being one of them.  But she can't really see that.  She thinks that her old best friend is the only one that wants to play with her.  She completely ignores as girls inscently call her name.  I know now that it's because she doesn't know if she's really hearing it or not. She's got a lot of older friends. She's six but seems to get along best with 8 to 10 year olds.   So she's actually pretty accepted but often can't see it.  The way that her friend from school talked her through the incident makes me think that this kind of thing happens there more than I realized."
schizophrenia,38bmfc,jkeller4000,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:05:20 2015 UTC,"well then ask the psychologist if there is more you can do to help,  maybe schedule a session for you and your child to be there and talk with the psychologist about your concerns.   maybe call the psychologist first to see if he/she thinks this would be a good idea.  and maybe the psychologist will give other better ideas.  i will say, all the medications for schizophrenia  are very harsh.  like clozapine blood draws every week.  seroquel very sedating.     if your child is not doing bad in school, then she can function well,  and then the medications would reduce her functioning and would most likely make her less functioning.  so a diagnosis might actually hurt your child more than it would help.  but talking to a psychiatrist might be helpful to understand the risks."

schizophrenia,38bmfc,Soylattebrewing,2,Thu Jun 4 02:27:20 2015 UTC,"I think it is really difficult with children in that age to diagnose this.(altough I could be wrong about this, not a doctor..).  I think they still have a rich imagination and can react strange in extreme situations (like when you are scared of a dog). For example with this dog situation it could be that she was scared and started running upstairs and because of panic was not realising that the dog was not following her anymore. so better be safe and run for a bit longer than sorry and be attackt by a dog... Its a panic reaction like when someone is afraid of mice and when he sees one jumps on the table although the mouse could't realy give a shit about you.  But I also agree with /u/icantrange and would go see a professional about it when things like this keep happening and seem unsusual. But don't panic too much and try not to jump to conlcusions before evaluating this carefully.  And I don't really know how they diagnose children or if there are a lot of false-positives. That would be very very bad for the child."

She and I are busy looking for a place where her symptoms can be discussed and responded to seriously like an adult.  No matter what you call it,  the things she's experiencing are disrupting her life. I'd posted a question earlier asking for suggestions for support groups for parents/kids with psychotic symptoms.  Do you have any?  Its really frustrating for both of us to try to tackle an issue and constantly meet the debate of ""is she just imaginati ve"". It's more than that.  And since you probably need to know her in person to discover that yourself, i guess I'm just asking for people to trust and address her issues directly like you would with an adult."
schizophrenia,38bmfc,hotnerds77,3,Wed Jun 3 12:28:44 2015 UTC,"You are right. But she is not an adult, thats the thing. You don't just treat a kid by the same standarts as an adult. I am really happy that you try to find help, and i think you will find it.  I am not saying you are the following but there are parents who overreact at things like that and then for example put the child on medication and such which can lead to serious risks in children which have still developing brains. Look at the adderrel epidemic where perfectly normal kids are given drugs we don't even know how they function on a deep level in the brain because parents think they have ADHS and such and really don't.  Thats why I said be carefull.Parent do often worry too much(which is sometimes a good thing!).   constantly meet the debate of ""is she just imaginati ve""   You can't axpect people to not say things like that when you just write a few sentences about your doughter with vague stuff like you did which can be normal and can be not normal.   I'd posted a question earlier asking for suggestions for support groups for parents/kids with psychotic symptoms. Do you have any?   The thing is I would firstly , before finding support groups for children with psychotic symptoms, find out by a professional(a real doctor) if she is having them and what thing is causing them. A lot of psychotic symptoms can have other reasons and not be just a mental problem.There are many illnesses which have psychotic symptoms. But its not bad to try to check for both things at the same time in the case its really attributed to shizophrnia and the likes I guess...  And I realy dont want to downplay the problems of your doughter, so forgive me if I am sounding a bit harsh.  And you asked for ""thoughts"" and not specfic things. Places to treat the child if it has mental problems can be recommended by doctors who have the authority to diagnose children with mental illnesses."

My parents are religious people, and to be fair they have come very far in understanding what I'm going through. but they do still firmly believe that prayer can help, and while I respect their beliefs, I wish they would understand that it doesn't help me.

Hopefully they take the next step and accept it's a disease, and not something you can just ""get over"".  The good news, plenty of people here understand what it's like if you need to get it out."
schizophrenia,387fit,hotnerds77,2,Tue Jun 2 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"I suggest you try to understand the voices. What you have to do is to attribute them to their actual cause and then respond to that cause emotionally through actual experience in a way that works for you without voices. The voices are real, only how you think of them is wrong, because it impairs your life. Maybe you hate yourself and your family that's why the voices tell you to kill. If it is possible at all, you have to understand this and accept it, then work on a solution to change it.  Just think about that for a second. What does it really matter if you hear voices or if you just have a feeling about something? So that you can attribute your dysfunction to something more concrete? Put it into some corner and so that you can say ""it is not me"" or ""this goes past my head""? Listen: This is all you, and it is all inside your head. Those voices don't just magically appear from the 10th dimension, or something. They are all the result of your mental faculties, needs and desires. You are not some magical spiritual being that exists separate from your nervous system and body. You are your entire body and whatever it is and produces. Physically and mentally. Error or no error. Good or bad. And you cannot just wish it away because other people are different. Try to accept that, somehow. Maybe you want different things but that doesn't change what you are at present. Work with what you have got.   So you hear voices instead of just having feelings. That doesn't mean that they can't they be decyphered. Voices are more clear than just feelings, more imminent. That is not just an impairment to everyday life, but also an advantage to comprehend the underlying problems. Which is even the fundamental reason in the first place why you have them. Human cognition has somewhat grown away from that though, there is too much logic now. So you have to come up with new competitive logic. Normal people as well have to actively think about their feelings, figure them out. So you have to do the same as well. In a way it is easier to figure out this stuff if it overrides your reality perception. All you have to do is to try to make sense of it to improve your life.   Have you ever even had this idea? Accepting what you are and have to work with, making sense of it to improve your life? Yes it is difficult, maybe you don't want it. Maybe you don't want to concern yourself with it. But isn't this just the same as to people who do not hear or see things that aren't there? Don't they as well just wish to feel differently but then are forced to confront the issue? Do they deny the circumstances they are in and start ignoring who they actually are, what they feel and what directions that tells them to go? Well yes, partially, but that's obviously wrong if you really want a working solution. Just before people go nuts, they usually will go with the working solution instead. Quit their job, leave their family learn they are a sinner, have neglected their children, have abusive parents they need to turn away from, or understand how they misconceived past circumstances and events. Whatever it is, it is very real and you can figure it out.  Even if it means you have to reject everything you believe in and value. Maybe religion is your issue, or maybe how other people understand the world. Maybe everyone is just wrong about life but it happens to work out for them regardless. If something can't be proven to work out correctly, it is not real to that context, in the shape and form it was conceived. Most knowledge we posess is procedural, very very little of it is written in stone. The issue might be your idea about self, god or the idea that the voices ""do not exist"". Evidently they exist inside your mind. Try to understand how and you will know how you can make them superflous. Whatever you believe in doesn't work correctly. So make it work.  Lots of effort. Maybe keep a diary, log your progress and which experiences you made to teach yourself differently. Figure this shit out. No mental disorder was ever solved on the weekend, or after a day of work in a 38 hour week. Not realistic. This is all you. Inside your head, you are always on your own. Good luck."

People on disability can still work.  As long as he doesn't act out at work he wont lose his job.  He needs to get help before things get worse. It sounds like you could do better. You need to help him remain stable if you are financially entangled with him.

And I'm moving because I'm being kicked out because of my roommates girlfriend wanting to move in. So it's a quick random they're engaged. I can only afford out of state and my friend already has a room for me no kicking out or drama in CO. They go camping and surfing in rivers. It's wonderful. It just feels wrong, because someone has to be there. I'm her only reason for living because she expects to see me at some point. I'm all over her walls, all she talks about. What do I do? What would you do in my position? How can I help her?  When dealing with family and friends with mental illnesses take it from someone who lives their daily life as a schizophrenic. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FEEL OBLIGATED. Yea its your mother, yea she brought you into this world, yea you both love eaach other. but you don't have to do things to always be on the back burner. I tell my family this all the time though they live with me because of my severity. I tell them and let them know I am the one with the illness and they should never have to feel drained or weighed down due to the cards that fate handed me."

Common sense may not get through and stick and that will be futile and frustrating for those who try. It's better to look things over once on medication and develop long lasting strategies to deal with it in the future. Nothing is perfect, it may take time to find the right medication and/or treatment.   The best I can explain my experience is a river of inexplicable emotion. My mind doesn't understand why, so it looks for reasons, creates stories, and delusions. One strategy of mine is to try and label the emotion and disregard the reason why. I say to myself ""I'm feeling really sad and depressed today and I don't know why"", ""I feel angry and scared and I don't know why"", ""I may be feeling this way right now but that doesn't mean I will feel this way a few hours from now or tomorrow"". Some people can turn their emotions into creativity and become artists or have a therapeutic hobby. Men can have a difficult time dealing with strong emotions, we tend to be socialized that way. There's no good reason why someone should suffer from mental illness."

And John Nash's schizophrenia in real life was much more severe and very different from the movie. For me, i struggle mainly with thinking straight and trusting my own judgment. I have been in a delusion where i felt people were all in on a big conspiracy. In reality it was just one person but everyone i met along the way was somehow ""in on the con"". It was all in my head. Thankfully, i was able to sort out this situation with my therapist. I have never held a conversation with any of my hallucinations. I hear whispers rather than full on voices and have never hallucinated a person that i could talk to. That would be more along the lines of someone in a delirious state, not schizophrenic.  But most of the time i can admit that it is very hard to tell what thoughts in my head are based in reality and which ones are not but it is still hard to see how i am ill.  I can always tell my hallucinations from reality. Unless it is a visual illusion in which i'll see something in something else. One time i saw a dead body but it was a pile of wood in real life. Freaked me out a bit lol.  Edit: most of us never have a full on hallucination where you're seeing and hearing a person that you can interact with. I wouldn't be able to manage that."

What they showed was not a typical case of schizophrenia, although individual symptoms could be possible. The issue was that the audience had to be ""fooled"" up until the diagnosis was made.  In reality, psychotic symptoms are not so seamless or sensible.  Also, it sanitized his life for the sake of the film. They omitted the woman and child he abandoned before he made Alicia.

schizophrenia,3850qz,icantrange,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:43:32 2015 UTC,"Well for me, it's mostly accurate. The only difference is I don't have any vivid visual hallucinations, like actual people, seemingly flesh and blood, as seen in the movie. My hallucinations are mostly auditory, and I think that goes for many other people with schizophrenia. Certainly I have episodes where my senses are grossly altered--my surroundings look brighter, sounds are unnaturally deafening, shadows take on terrifying forms, people have a different look to them that doesn't seem right, and so on--but that's it. I heard somewhere, I think it was John Nash himself who said it, that Nash never had any visual hallucinations; the movie crew just added them in to make for easier storytelling.  Also, the film did not follow one vital detail in John Nash's life, that is, his use of medication. Nash didn't take meds for most of his life; he only did in the beginning, then he stopped. Said it got in the way of his doing Math. And he was like that until the day he died. If I remember correctly, the film made it out that it was medication that ultimately changed Nash's life, that he never stopped taking it. As already mentioned, it's not true. John Nash is credited as one of the few schizophrenics who was able to reach stability without any use of medication. Apparently one of the screenwriters has a relative who is a psychiatrist, and he changed that detail because he didn't want the film to encourage mentally ill patients to stop taking medication.  And yes, they also did not mention John Nash having an affair with another woman (and fathering a son with her)."

Here is a PBS article aboutJohn Nash and schizophrenia and recovery. It says it wasn't a miracle that he recovered. Most people with schizophrenia have decreased symptoms with aging with or without medication. It is natural to get better with age.   Most people don't talk about this progression of the disease that it gets better. I read this in several books that it is common or so I'm hoping. It's a common misconception that you can't get better naturally with time, though the road might still be tough. Schizophrenia is a difficult illness."
schizophrenia,3850qz,kirs1132,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was mentioned by my psychiatrist. But it's not necessarily getting better with age; the brain doesn't stop rapidly deteriorating at all, it's just that the positive symptoms tend to disappear and are replaced by worse negative symptoms. I was warned to get ready for that by following a routine this early in the disease.  And I don't know man, I'm not sure if I can agree that a schizophrenic patient does improve with age when untreated. My dad and uncle are just like me except have been untreated all their lives, and they're worse than ever. My dad is an even worse asshole, I actually just had a fight with him because of his symptoms and I just gave up man; guy is hopeless. They didn't get any better, they just became worse, especially in their cognitive, disorganized, and delusional aspects. What's even worse, they got even more stubborn with age. So I dunno man, I can't say I agree. I still don't know how John Nash did it. Or maybe my dad and uncle are like the few exceptions? I sure hope so.  On that note, if you can suggest anything I could do to help out my dad and uncle, please do. I really don't know what to do anymore. I've been so depressed over this for days.

I think they did that to tell the story better and capture the audience. But some do experience those type of hallucinations.   I can't speak to whether those visual hallucinations are accurate portrayal of schizophrenia as I only have auditory hallucinations, which is the most common symptom. And visual hallucinations most likely vary from person to person just like auditory hallucinations vary from person to person. People who hallucinate have a variety of different experiences.  His delusion that there was a conspiracy against him is common though. I similarly became really paranoid once my illness developed.  Here are two ted talks of people with schizophrenia: Elyn Saks and Eleanor Longden, if you want to learn more about schizophrenia. Both are very different, but considered high functioning people with schizophrenia. Elyn Saks is a law professor at USC and Eleanor Longdon is a British psychologist. Both are successful women in their field, but have different symptoms, I believe; vastly different experiences with their illness; and different dependencies on medication. Elyn Saks couldn't do well off medication while Eleanor Longdon can do fine off.  People with schizophrenia vary widely based off of severity of the illness. Not all are high functioning like Elyn and Longdon or great contributors to society like John Nash."

It was the straw that broke the camels back after a very stressful first few months as a CNA, and I cried there in her office.  She didn't treat me any different, however.  By the end of the year she asked me how I turned myself around, and I told her that I just had faith in myself and I didn't want to quit.

schizophrenia,383uw9,joesavu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:02:41 2015 UTC,"THAT was awesome to read. Faith and not quitting, and pushing through, is about right.  I have thought a lot about what enabled me to keep jobs, and I think it comes down to two things.  Raw guts is top of the list. If you can walk through a fuckin' mall, or be out it public and pay for gas, or ANYTHING, with everyone sneering at you under their breath and the government in your mind (or some kind of mind control that everyone is lying about...) and seeing yourself jab knives into the eyes of every baby that is pushed by in a stroller (and twitching horribly at the sickening violence) and seeing fat naked asses sitting on everyone's shoulders and seeing faces inside other faces moving from body to body and watching shadows move onto things causing their faces to become ugly and watching them suddenly snapping at their kids and watching people on the TVs talking to you and all the other endless glorious shit I've heard from schizos and seen-- if you can fucking go out in public and keep a straight face and not just slice your wrists or break down and cry, or run away freaking with a panic attack more likely-- if you have the guts to walk through a mall or go up to a gas attendant and pay for gas-- then that's the guts required to do a job while that's going on. Oh I've had a great morning, and I sold three cell phones, but then this one guy came in, and he DEFINITELY talked to me in my head, and said something mean, and now I can't blah blah and I'm suddenly blah blah and now everyone blah blah--- no. Sorry. No Can Do. You finish having a great lunch, and then you proceed to have a great afternoon. And you leave work at the end of the day instead of running out, and you do it again the next day. What is easy about this? How can I describe it so it sounds do-able? It's not easy and it's damn near not do-able. You just have to do it anyway. Don't quit, have faith that we don't accomplish things from motivation, but we gain motivation from accomplishment, and push on through.  The second thing is that for a long time, I KNEW the best thing for me to do was to take time for myself and to study and practice abstract thinking and basically TEND to my illness. When the time came and I had to get back into the work force, I didn't just do it for the hell of it, or for someone else's idea of success-- I did it because it was required at the time, and I was done thinking through my condition, so I was free to do it. So I just did it. Like walking to the mall or paying for gas. It's not really important what you take as a job, if you need the work. You can dig ditches or load newspaper trucks or bale hay or anything, regardless of your concentration or focus skills. Then the next job is probably nicer (you've got all that interpersonal practice and probably some new skills) and it goes from there. So, having a reason to work, is a big deal, and being done with thinking through your illness, is also a big deal. If I can stay at home on SSDI and rent assistance and food stamps and make art all the time-- then I don't really have a reason to ever work, except for social interaction. Our culture has no shamans any more, and WAY WAY beyond that, there's no PLACE for discursive aesthetics in our culture. Art and lifestyle that comes out of left field, is not consumed by our culture, which for some reason moves incrementally like a governmental budget, a giant blob. It can only tolerate small changes. We pay many prices for this inflexibility, but one of them is that we have no place, no use, for shamans, for crazies, for ascetics and people who meditate and mystics and those who are suited for things besides ""making money"". It's all dog-eat-dog and everyone for themselves. So, we have no cultural support for ""slackers"", and the cost of this culture is assistance programs. It's how our culture stays human. It's feeding the poor, so to speak, instead of kicking them in the head as we walk by. It's a requirement of culture, in some form, yes. So, if someone has found support to ""not work"", I totally approve of them doing that, and not working-- provided they can force some sort of functional human interaction into their lives enough to retain function in this shared world. So the need to work is important. The actions have to be productive for the individual (in a meaningful way), and the requirement for socialization has to be well-defined by the individual, and understood in his or her own way.  So there aren't shortcuts to helping someone who's schizo, work. You cultivate courage, and that's not easy. It's done through kindness and love and synergy and sharing and equal footing. It's done with a lack of antagonism and absence of criticism. And then when you have the courage to go stand out in public with things making fun of you in your head, and just wanting to DIE because you are so fucked and so fucked up-- when you have the courage, you have to have a reason. Some motivation that you KNOW is going to personally put you in a better place. Not easy.  Sleep, organization (everything in little boxes, metaphorically), enough of a rut or pattern to cultivate will-power (brushing your teeth well every day, etc), and then basically RAW GUTS, and a personal goal. That's the basics of what drove me forward (after I took the time to work through my condition sufficiently). Looking back, it was no harder than walking through a mall, or going up to an attendant and paying for gas."

schizophrenia,383uw9,TDz86,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:22:09 2015 UTC,"It's been many years since I was in that space, but I still have to work at feeling life-full, every day.   If you can imagine loving and treasuring yourself as a valid, valuable bit of color in the universe-- I mean, really appreciating and cherishing that you are a self-actualizing, self-aware mind in an impossibly difficult place and time-- if you can imagine that space of self-valuation or at least self-validity-- that is what I achieved first. For years I thought about Zen's ""ego-loss"" as a step on the path to enlightenment, and I just laughed bitterly, quietly deep inside, because I thought, if anyone wants a bunch of ego-less people, they should just look at schizos. They aren't ""allowed"" self-valuation. So I just embraced it, and somehow it stopped being important what I was or how good I was at being human or how ANYTHING I was. That null-ness of self-valuation went really well with all the other null-ness going on in my life. I guess without the self-criticism, the appreciation of what I was as a human, surviving-- that kinda grew into an appreciation of some wierd grace of mind in this universe.   I started working and re-entering the world (working, forcing myself to interact in public, etc.) with all my intrusive thoughts and delusions and paranoias and hallucinations fully intact, but it was like a bullshit swarm of crap-- the World's crap, not MY crap-- just uselessly swarming around mind, and there was MUCH less self-loathing and depression. All the apathy and numbness (and symptoms) were still there, but I started acting out my life in a state of kind-of zen-less, beyond-ego-loss, ""we are the shit of the world"" sort of thing, and it really wasn't that hard to work once I was focusing on focusing, and working on attention to the world, instead of fighting off the dreadful sucky-ness of my life all the time.  The numbness goes away with every thing you force yourself to enjoy, and those little things build up over decades into something that is able to force itself to fill itself with life, and enjoy and be involved into things.  Best to you. Sometimes after decades, reading this forum just leaves me staring and vegging. But hey, man, state of grace in the shit. I just want to share that it is do-able."

schizophrenia,380ryj,icantrange,2,Mon Jun 1 02:55:15 2015 UTC,First things first. Apply for food stamps if your state has the program you should get an answer for this a lot sooner than ssi. Secondly  After applying for hopefully getting food stamps apply for vocational rehabilitation. Unless you are severly disabled through your mental illness I would go this route as living off or trying to live off 770 a month is a joke. I am a disabled veteran and getting way more than 770 a month because of my schizophrenia. I am rated permanent and total by the va because my condition has me completely sedated almost in the form of a living breathing zombie.. due to the medication sterngth I must take.
schizophrenia,380ryj,jkeller4000,2,Mon Jun 1 08:06:38 2015 UTC,"there is food stamps, general assistance, walk down to you r local government center and find where the social workers are and ask for help.  however i would suggest getting a job, then if you get fired for being in the hospital too much or fired for some other symptom then that would be significant proof that you cannot hold a job. and then you would be more likely to succeed in getting benefits.  i had a job but quit it, then was hospitalized,  the social worker in the state hospital got disability for me from the point i quit the job.   i have been to the state hospital even more since then so i guess they made the right call that i would have significant difficulty getting any kind of meaning full job. i always thought i would be able to go bad to work. jobs are one way people socialize and meet new people to talk to."
schizophrenia,380ryj,JosephFaolan,2,Mon Jun 1 11:33:12 2015 UTC,"Would calling them and telling them to hurry the fuck up help at all?    In general, no.

Different states have different options. Talk to a doctor, mental health professional, a mental health advocacy group, etc about this."
schizophrenia,380ryj,0n3tw0,2,Mon Jun 1 13:20:18 2015 UTC,"I went through the same thing. They told me I would probably be denied. I waited 4 months to be told to wait more. Instead of dealing with the boredom and uncertainty I started looking for a job and found one. It has been a roller coaster of emotion and paranoia. I feel like the government is going to claim I'm not really schizophrenic and go after me for fraud. This spawns all kinds of delusions about the government that entangle with conspiracy theories and propaganda. I worry for my future, what if I can no longer hold a job? What if my family no longer wants to care for me? It's no wonder people end up on the streets unwilling to accept any help.  It's so absurd to hear voices, it's a constant mind-storm. I've been like this for the last 8 years and am starting to crawl out of the rabbit hole and deconstruct it. Are all these psychological defenses I'm building up going to free me or lock me in my own mind? I take comfort in knowing that I'm not alone in this struggle and sometimes recognize the madness in others and their artistic expressions. I try not to think about it too much but I can't help it sometimes. I'm doing fine for now."

schizophrenia,380ryj,0n3tw0,2,Mon Jun 1 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"That's tough, you'd think they would be more sensitive.   The voices can be very persecutory for me. I worry about being framed or false accusations. I then get fixated on the possibilities. What if a mind-weapon exists? Why are they targeting me? Maybe this is some sort of pre-crime program and I fit the profile because I'm a little off? Do they want me in prison?   Talking about it feeds the paranoia. I realize that whoever listens, may listen with suspicion. Maybe that's the mind-weapon operators playbook? They want the victim to hang themself figuratively or literally because what they do in secret is illegal and immoral by every rule of man and god. If such a thing is true then it is the worst evil that I can imagine today.  I've been reading ""Man's Search for Meaning"" written by a holocaust survivor. It's comforting to know that even if I did end up in prison or institutionalized I still wouldn't have it as bad as being in a concentration camp. I'm still free and I value my freedom."

My psychiatrist told me to consider it and she seems confident about the whole thing but from what I understand there's a good chance that it isn't going to pan out in quite the same way my psychiatrist has in mind.  Don't know what I'm going to do without an income.  Don't know what I'm going to do for the next few months while I wait to even find out if I've been approved or not.  Don't know anything anymore.

schizophrenia,37rfqg,creepmouse,2,Fri May 29 20:07:10 2015 UTC,"Do people who only present as crazy deserve immediate help?   I think people who need or want help deserve it. And the help they get should be the help they need. People wanting stable housing, food, security, etc, are not helped by pumping them full of drugs and sending them back to the street.  Schizophrenia is only one disorder. There is a whole range of schizotypy which is possible.   You may find the diagnosis called Schizotypal Personality Disorder to be interesting to read about.  You are right about them waiting too much. I get the feeling they only see it worth action if it is a crisis, which makes no medical sense at all.  Medical doctors, dentists, financial advisers, etc all advocate for getting things fixed as early as possible before it becomes a crisis.  If it gets to the point of crisis, it has gone too far.   However, there is no accountability. Nobody pays attention to results and they all get paid regardless of what happens."
schizophrenia,37rfqg,JosephFaolan,1 point,Fri May 29 20:30:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I agree, help should be available for people who want it. I have been through the system, and it took a crisis for me to get any help because I was never ""bad enough"" to warrant immediate help. Until it was bad enough that people paid attention. I wish it never had to get to that point, and I didn't lose so many years and make bad decisions as a consequence of that.  As far as my partner is concerned, he has a family who will advocate for him, and has advocated for him at least the last 15 years. As well as now, there is enough of him present to want to change, but what began as a 500 page novel turned out to be 1000 pages, it's a lot of work. What he truly needed was that immediate help 25 years ago and his life might have been a different story. I do think at some point he did/does fall on the schizotypy spectrum but with poor documentation and the unwillingness of professionals that is my opinion only. Still, that is still not enough for me to believe that the system won't fail him again, because it already has. He has interwoven a way of coping that is not allowing him to live a full adult life. Therapy has largely given him the tools to begin creating one, however old thought patterns unravel it at the same time, two steps forward one step back. It is not enough to try to logically explain to someone who rejects outside interpretation as criticism while saying that nobody understands. True, it is impossible to understand another's inner experience, but when the people who you seek out to help understand do not agree or can't understand over and over and over you have to wonder, ""is what I feel as right, or the presence of God, or whatever"" being perforated by a chemical imbalance or traumatic response? It's a worthy question that I put to him often, but he is his own judge, jury and executioner. If you add someone who has a strong sense of spirituality (we share the same faith), as well as being well versed in psychology it almost becomes unbearable to watch them find reasons to support dangerous thinking. Not everything is arbitrary, and I do believe he is experiencing something however the lens of interpretation always supports what he is feeling inside (if he feels hurt then the interpretation is of hurt, if he is feeling criticised the interpretation will support that he is being criticised, if he feels good then he is getting guidance that it is good), it seems to make stability difficult and being able to make choice is very difficult [for him]. I have never not believed his experience (I have always believed his inner experiences), it's his interpretation that I find so inflexible but voicing that was running the risk of being critical...never my actual intention. This I believe can be worked through in therapy, but the lack of any kind of ""diagnosis"" is alarming to me, as some people need it, and need more than just ""it's a personality disorder"".  A passage that kind of sums up what I'm thinking at the moment:   'Have you ever thought about doing psychotherapy?' she asks one day.  I tell her it didn't do me any good. 'I'm not sure if I believe in all that stuff. Freud's wacky and he's too negative about people. I prefer Jung - he's more of a mystic.'  'Your unconscious has an enormous influence on you. Psychotherapy can help you understand it better. I've been doing therapy for years,' she says. 'Yeah, I found a book called The Discovery of the Unconscious in the library,' I tell her. 'But the unconscious isn't a discovery.'   Felicity says she believes people come to Canary Ward because of unconscious conflicts and psychological dysfunction. She says if people did more therapy they might not need to take pills. I like Felicity, but it's scary and confusing talking to her. All the other psychiatrists and nurses say I have a biological imbalance that I need to correct with pills. Felicity is saying I've got deep personality problems and  I need to undress my head in front of some wacko psychotherapist for years if I am ever to recover. What a choice.   Why not then both? Can we not be treated to both address the biological imbalance as well as our unconscious conflicts. Why not both and see what happens, especially if using one is causing major issues to arise so they can be addressed and integrated can we not  Sorry for the wall of text! that was more for me to work some kind of understanding out!

The diagnosis means fuck all really and you're recovery is largely up to you from this point on. You should still talk to your doctor, but at this point he's of little use other than signing your scripts for medication.  Once you get past that hurdle of thinking about what you have or may not have you can start working on yourself. To everyone (ill or otherwise) I recommend you do some meditation each day (20 mins at least), get some exercise (40 min walk minimum), and stick to a healthy nutrient rich diet with suppliments. Check out the CR diet for optimal functioning and increase life span. Then all you need to do is stay away from drugs as much as possible, including caffeine, nicotine, pot, or anything else. You'll feel good, your mood will be stable, you'll look good, then you can focus on finding a purpose in life.   It's taken me about 8 years to figure all this out, but I feel good and I wouldn't trade this lifestyle for anything. I now look on this 'illness' as more of an ability more than anything else.

He has become very bitter and emotionally hostile towards her as a result. I've tried to connect him to local resources to get help for her, but he hasn't lifted a finger to help her or himself. If anything, he makes the situation worse. I've heard him in the background while on the phone with my mother, taunting and antagonizing her out of resentment. I do understand that what is going on is real to my mother, but she is cognizant of how absurd and ""unbelievable"" parts of it are and I was hoping to appeal to that rational part of her. Last week, she told me that two men watch her everywhere in her house through hidden cameras and narrate her actions aloud through hidden speakers. When she went to her sister's house to escape it, and the voices (there are at least three) followed her, she concluded that her sister was in on the cruel plot against her. When I encouraged her to come to my house, which she'd felt safe at before, she accused me of being in on it, too. I guess there's just some part of me that wants to believe that if I started hearing disembodied voices that followed me everywhere I went, I'd at least entertain the possibility that I needed to see a psychiatrist. Thank you for your suggestion. I have tried a similar approach, not challenging her beliefs directly, but explaining that given her situation (of irrational beliefs and fears), she's on heightened alert (i.e. paranoid) and under extreme stress. As a result, she's making accusations that have no merit and drawing connections from coincidences.

It sounds like she is in the grip of an episode currently. To get a shot at the rational part of her, you will have to wait until after the episode.   I'd at least entertain the possibility that I needed to see a psychiatrist.   That's what we all think/thought. The issue is once the acute episode subsides and things return to ""normal"" (normal for her), it is very easy to convince yourself you're fine. Even if you're ot convinced, the residual paranoia keeps you from seeking the help.   her claiming that any normal person in her position would do the same thing.   She does have a point there. The counter argument (for when she's not in an acute episode) is that with the proper medication, she may find herself in that position less often. Or less intense. Or shorter duration.

It's one step forward, two steps back.  I'm bipolar (type I), so I've been through my own journey of screwing up my life and seeking help. I knew something wasn't quite right and was never hostile to the idea that I needed help, so it didn't take me long to reach a place of acceptance. Different illness, different kettle of fish, of course, but I've been trying to support my mother the way I wish someone had been there to support me, encouraging her in the right direction without being judgmental. Unfortunately, the paranoia poisons everything. I've asked her what would be so horrible about seeing a doctor even if she wasn't sick, and she had no good answer, just a whole lot of excuses about how stupid, time-wasting, and pointless that would be.  I did encourage her to take her medication to help keep her from being overly suspicious of everything, which she has openly admitted to being, but she is adamant that she needs to be completely free of medication to feel better.

Medical bills were also stacking up, not to mention school expenses. What I don't understand is, if I go to a counselor and they contact the authorities, who force me to take an ambulance ride to a hospital for evaluation, and then a second ambulance ride to another hospital were they hold me for 72 hours without my consent, why do I need to pay over a thousand dollars for that?

For example, in Texas when I was first diagnosed I had gone to the local MHMR (Mental Health Mental Retardation) Clinic and signed up as a patient.  They asked for my financial situation, had me fill out the finance paperwork, got me properly diagnosed, and entered into the system. That same day I was given a plan based on the intensity of my symptoms which was pretty high at the time (Uncategorized Schizophrenia with violent tendencies).  My counselors came to my house 1-2 times a week for 30 minutes and talked to me about managing myself from symptoms.  Just gotta look around for state / local programs to help with your illness.  Call around to clinics, tell them your situation, and hopefully you can get something worked out without having to pay $200 for a single session. Good luck."

I think it is a bit suspicious.

schizophrenia,37ithf,AbuHanifaRA,4,Wed May 27 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"Well, look at it this way. Humans are getting along with their lives, and making breakfast, and cleaning their trucks, and proposing to their true loves, and writing websites, and playing computer games, and writing poetry, and playing guitar in Slayer, and learning the cello, and teaching martial arts, and dealing dope, and scuba diving, and waging wars, and burning villages, and craving power, and craving money, and beating their wives, and stepping on old land mines, and teaching villagers how to fish, and designing water purifiers for starving countries, and running for local office, and taking the trash out, and going to bed alone and lonely, and curling up with their soul-mates, and having one night stands, and having dreams and nightmares and getting up to pee in the middle of the night because they're getting old, and waking up, and getting on with their lives, and making breakfast, and... another day. All of this in the same world that you share. With all those forces all around, waiting to be seen or imagined or felt or to fall to or to overcome.  Who knows what shares this tiny spot on the jungle floor with us. But one thing is for sure. Each of us has a one in EIGHT BILLION chance that they're really out to get US instead of anyone else-- and generally, they're not.  Maybe they're out to get Bob Dylan, that would suck for him, right? My mom was the only one being tortured by the government, as an experiment, except for the other twenty people I've met that were ALSO the only one. It is all so familiar to be the one surrounded by demonic forces. Why is that? Maybe the worse part is feeling unique enough to be isolated. But none of us are isolated. We are all together in this mess. Every day, I pass in the streets, a thousand people who are just getting on with their lives. Maybe they do it by closing their eyes, or maybe they have another space to be in, from some random grace of nature. But it's our job, every one of us, to honor our incarnation and do the best we can. You have to find your clarity. Every day here, are people whose lives are shit, but who can feel good today, because today they have found some clarity. They can feel good about feeling bad, instead of feeling bad about feeling good.  Life I guess, is what you have to do. Perhaps the things you are feeling, are just opportunistic. Like a cold wind, they just chill whatever warmth they fall upon. Or like a disease they penetrate self-valuation and self-reliance wherever they can. Humans are bustling around with literally thousands of things mindlessly, opportunistically, primitively attempting to attack and degrade the thing that makes us, us. From bacteria to weather to radiation to.... whatever.  The thing to do is life. It's pretty big, so I got nothing after that. Stay calm and find your grace. You may have to do it every day. Lots of us have to do it, every day!!  So, in the big picture, if it starts making you uncomfortable, you should really   a) find a therapist or someone to talk to,   b) be open to treatment if it starts really hurting your life, because things CAN be better and you deserve it,   c) consider that meds could actually stabilize your sleep schedule and also relax you, and in the big picture you're worth it, and  finally,   d) Don't live in fear, be proactive! If this is to the point where it's messing with your life, then the next step is maybe talking to a pro. Some of them are morons, and some of them are absolutely amazing people. Just like any other profession. But if it starts being disruptive, I would start there.  Staying up a lot will definitely make it worse. Sleep is vital and a sleep ~schedule~ is even better for our minds and our outlook, usually. Best of luck!  tl;dr: Yeah. Schizos are the masters of creepy feelings."

I would recommend you stay completely away from pot as more often than not it makes schizoid symptoms much worse. If you want to do something in regards to altering your consciousness, a positive way to do this that doesn't really have any adverse side effects would be to practice meditation and also check out binaural beats that induce lower brain wave states.

Check out the binaural thing I mentioned if you want something more ""intense"" and that is forced on you rather than sought out. My experience has been that meditation and the binaural stuff puts me in a state that is much more ethereal and relaxing than any drug I took in my youngerish years. The deep thoughts I used to have when stoned are massively outshined by the insights I have gained from meditation, and as you said getting to that point has taken a fair bit of practice and patience."

Do you think psychosis-proneness would help or mess with trying to  get insights, joy and tranquility while meditating or listening to binaural beats? Do you think that ethereal and relaxing state you get drug-free has relation with the disorder? Maybe you wouldn't be able to achieve such state without a ""schizo mind""?

schizophrenia,37js02,BlankUsername42,2,Sat May 30 00:33:21 2015 UTC,"Take a look at anything labeled ""delta waves"" or with the word meditation in the title. Stuff that has music or rainfall over it has been my favorite, the droning pulsing only stuff is boring to me. As for the meditation stuff, I am not quite sure how to put it in words. I was actually working to describe it to my psychologist today. Its not anything new to me, I have been practicing meditation off and on for years now. I am uncertain if my schizoaffective enhances this experience or if it has no effect on it. For my purposes it is a question best left unanswered. Worrying about that aspect of my meditation does me no good and knowing an answer would not change what it is that I experience when meditating, so I generally kinda just forget about it and just let things be as they are.  As for the types of insights, none of it is really delusional or revolutionary, its mostly emotional wisdom that I wind up gleaning from my meditation. For me it is an experience where I wind up being able to have an objective view of my stream of consciousness while remaining aware that it is mine. This is particularly helpful for processing emotions or delusional thoughts. When meditating I am aware of my emotions but my emotions to not dictate my physical stance, my stream of consciousness, anything about who it is that I am on a day to day basis. It lets me get out of my mind and to a place where nothing stresses me out, but nothing is removed from my reality as was the case when I would get black out drunk to deal with stuff. It is a spiritual experience for me and everyone winds up experiencing meditation in their own way. From the sounds of it your experience has been significantly different than mine and I am fairly confident that difference is a result of me having more practice at it. I think if you give it a shot and try some guided meditation first, you might be able to get to the point where your experience is more like mine.  Also, I'm not sure how long you have been smoking pot, but if you wind up quitting for an extended period of time you might wind up feeling a lot more stable with your psychosis. For me it took about 3 months for my head to really clear up from it, and then it took me even longer to realize that the amount of alcohol I was consuming also made my psychosis worse (for me that means emotionally impactful). Its just a thought and ultimately you will travel your own path which may differ significantly from mine in regards to habitual marijuana use."

I've been smoking almost daily now since about october 2014. I plan to stop it in some weeks, when my classes end, so I can ""recover"" and drop the meds in a year. I'm getting some psychotic symptoms when I smoke too much, like weird thoughts (maybe thats normal when high), feeling like the birds talk to me (when they sing I get a strong feeling, like when they sing happily or sad i get the same vibe), some strange tinnitus in my ear so loud and starts out of nothing, and feeling like my friends face and body are not ""connected"". They just started some days ago and thats one more reason why I'm leaving the weed life. Thanks for the effort writing this.  :)"
schizophrenia,37js02,stillfreak94,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"OH MY GOD! I FUCKING FORGOT ABOUT THE BIRDS! That exact same thing used to happen to me, I was truly honestly convinced I could speak with nature and hear the birds talking and I also wound up hearing voices in other ambient noises like the wind. I am honestly convinced the weird thoughts I would have when stoned were not quite the same weird thoughts that others would have when stoned, I am pretty sure my schizoaffective factored into this. This feeling that nature could talk to me actually caused me to investigate Buddhism and improve on my meditation practices, so in that way I guess you could say my diagnosis has affected my meditation? As it stands right now I feel that my meditation probably isn't affected by the schizoaffective but as I had said earlier, it really doesn't matter in the end and I don't really worry about trying to figure out if it happens to be one way or another.  But yeah man, smoking pot even on a semi-regular (like, once a month) basis would often leave me with a worse psychosis than what I had experienced before getting high. It's hard to let go of the easy escape, but honestly pot and some other substances have such an adverse effect that removing them from my life was the only choice I really had. I decided to quit pot when I had a complete break with reality, a psychotic episode where I hallucinated that a customer was a demon and out to get me. In my defense this woman was really angry and really bitter, disproportionately so to the lack of ketchup on her burger (hey lady, I don't make the food), but the experience showed me that there was something wrong in my life and fortunately for myself I was salient enough to recognize that a large part of what was screwy in my life tied in with my pot use. Again, this might not wind up being your experience as everyone travels their own paths and have different things that happen in different situations, so perhaps you might be able to manage your psychosis while smoking pot, but I would caution against it. If you start to feel uncomfortable while high my experience has been that it will only get worse as time goes on. If you really struggle with quitting on your own you can also seek help from a treatment center. I managed to quit pot on my own but years later I wound up having to get professional help to quit drinking and I have to say if I had sought that help out sooner my life would be a fair bit farther along than it is now.  Feel free to message me any time if you have questions about your mental health symptoms, dx, marijuana use, treatment, etc. I have a couple years more experience than you and am more than happy to help you tap into this experience to help strengthen yourself."

I was on seroquel, then geodon/zyprexa for a year before it sent me to the hospital with a heart arrythima,  where they changed me over  to abilify. Prior to the hospital visit I was dealing with / struggling with the sedation, anhedonia & blunted affect, and still dealing with a lot of constant low level paranoia & voices (ie instead of voices of evil people tormenting me and plotting to kill me 24/7 it was just moreso me overhearing real people talking indistinctly  (ie neighbours) and my brain reinterpreting that to be shit like ""ugh that guy is so annoying what a loser, hes gonna fail"".).  Afterwards it was amazing. I was suddenly not tired, i could feel emotions & express them naturally & the paranoia and voices TOTALLY disappeared after a month. I ended up going off abilify about 3 or 4 months after, and have been symptom and medication free for 3 years now.   Althoigh, i firmly believe that a big part of my recovery was attributable to not just the change in medication but a healthy diet and plenty of exercise, as well as forcing myself to be more sociable.   Good luck!"

schizophrenia,37c43q,plornt3,7,Tue May 26 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"Schizophrenia is a collection of symptoms, and the diagnostic criteria sort of require that the symptoms impair employment or other important areas of functioning in life.   B. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relationships, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset    Since one only needs one of three symptoms, Delusions, Hallucinations, or Disorganized Speech, exactly how it impairs employment depends on the symptoms.  Many people with delusions and hallucinations do work with them, at least, for a while, and try to ignore it or work around them.  We get a lot of people here in this situation, who are having trouble at work because of their symptoms.  The distraction and distress hallucinations and delusions may cause can severely impair the ability to meet social and employment expectations.  Disorganized Speech, Disorganized Behavior, Catatonia, and Thought Disorder are more likely to be something one cannot work around by their very nature.  And finally Negative Symptoms and Cognitive Deficits may remove the underlying ability to work effective for a variety of reasons.  Those who can manage their symptoms to be mostly normal usually have the best chance of sustaining employment, but as we know, it is difficult and somewhat rare for this to happen. Treatments are not that effective, and individual cases can vary a lot in response and progression.  And if one gets past all this, very few employers want to hire people with schizophrenia."
schizophrenia,37c43q,JosephFaolan,4,Tue May 26 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"As a schizophrenic myself working in a Federal sector, I can say it is very hard to get/stay employed with on-going symptoms unless you have a solid history of staying on track.

schizophrenia,37bvdz,JosephFaolan,1 point,Tue May 26 15:40:06 2015 UTC,Delusional disorder can be caused by the same chemical imbalance that causes schizophrenia. The difference is that with schizophrenia you don't necessarily need to be Or been delusional.
schizophrenia,37bvdz,icantrange,1 point,Wed May 27 14:29:04 2015 UTC,"This is your answer:  Schizophrenia is characterized by the presence of both both hallucinations and delusions as well as a few other features ( thought disorder, regression from a previous level of functioning, etc.)  In Schizophrenia the delusions are bizarre. ""There are four thousand invisible pinhole cameras in my bedroom wall which are uploading information to the satellites so the FBI can rebuild my skeleton with car parts.""  In Delusional Disorder the delusions could actually be real (but probably are not). ""Everyone at work is against me"" or ""my wife is sleeping with the milkman when I'm not home.""   Sometimes it is difficult to determine if the delusions are real or not (the first example above is extreme to demonstrate the point).  But if hallucinations are also present, there is no current organic etiology (e.g. Brain tumor) and drug use is ruled out then schizophrenia may be the diagnosis.   If depression, mania or mixed state depression/mania is also present then the diagnosis may be Schizoaffective Disorder, depending on whether the mood disturbance started first or came later, in response. To make things even more murky, if the hallucinations or delusions only appear when the person goes through severe bouts of depression then Depression with Psychosis may be the diagnosis. And when in doubt just insert the ""Psychotic Disorder NOS ('not otherwise specified')""diagnosis."

Sometime in the late afternoon I'd finally be fine enough to concentrate on things. Prior to that though, I'd be able to do absolutely nothing  The recommended therapeutic doses of any medication I've been on, be it anti-depressants or anti-psychotics, always seem to be too much for my body to handle.

schizophrenia,37apfb,Thatinsanity,1 point,Wed May 27 03:11:52 2015 UTC,"Hello love. I am a MFT, and all Marriage and Family Therapists, if trained at a proper school, are trained and knowledgable about any and all disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorders, currently the DSM-V, which include schizophrenia. If your therapist is not helping you with the schizophrenia, please seek another one. Because as MFTs, our entire trainings are based on Mental Health Disorders! We are called marriage and family therapists simply because unlike typical therapists, we have a systemic understanding, how family of origin affects our lives today, our patterns, how disorders develop, history, etc. but most MFTs are really great individual therapists. You can find profiles of MFTs near you that are AAMFT certified (very good!) using this online therapist locator.   http://www.therapistlocator.net/iMIS15/therapistlocator/Content/Directories/Locator_Terms_of_Use.aspx  You can also use Psychology today's site, but I truly recommend MFTs, not because I am biased, but I myself have always had better luck with MFTS. My advice though, you may find better luck with the medication and symptom managing with a psychiatrist who solely has knowledge of mental health disorders. But as for therapy, it is best to stick to an actual therapist. Credentials are important, when choosing a therapist, find out about their credentials, experience, background, and areas of speciality, and if choosing an MFT,  make sure the college they went to was COAMFTE accredited and that they have experience in managing/treating schizophrenia. Here's the Psychology Today link for psychiatrists, (and also other mental health professionals if you decide against an MFT) :  http://m.therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/  Another note, it can be really challenging to find a therapist that is the right fit. As a therapist myself, I went through 6 therapists before finding one that was right for me, which is frustrating for anyone. A good therapist will help you work around feelings and help you manage and treat your Schizophrenia (except the pharmacology part which is of course left to psychiatrists) I have several friends that deal with Schizophrenia and I know how challenging and frustrating it is at times for them. I also have patients who have schizophrenia. The one thing I always tell anyone with a mental health disorder is that you are NOT your disorder! To label yourself ""a schizophrenic"" boxes you in, and is not fair. You have a mental health disorder like many Americans do, but you are NOT your disorder. It may help to think of it as a part of you, but it is not YOU, and does not dictate your life, what you are capable of accomplishing, or how happy you are capable of being. Of course there will always be times when a disorder can feel like it is restricting us, and we are battling against it. If you have had trauma in your past, you might consider EMDR therapy which is incredible for trauma. There are so many different types of therapy, of course I don't know your history so I couldn't say what may or may not be more helpful. Good luck mate, I hope you can find someone who is more helpful to you for your specific needs, because you deserve someone who is knowledgable and experienced with the issues that you bring to the table, so that you can get the most beneficial treatment possible ❤️"

You can be clear that the reason you're cutting him off is because he has not sought treatment and you don't want to be around him.   I recommend you see a therapist who has experience treating severe mental illness to talk about your options. In some states it's possible to have a person hospitalized who is having hallucinations or delusions. Another reason to go see a therapist is to talk about your experience.

schizophrenia,37796u,improveworld,2,Mon May 25 13:29:27 2015 UTC,I test reality in my head with the scientific method. I can usually deconstruct my delusions when I'm not in the middle of it. It can help to have someone you trust that you can talk to.
schizophrenia,37796u,0n3tw0,2,Mon May 25 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what do you classify hearing voices/having intrusive foreign thoughts as and how do you deal with them?"
schizophrenia,37796u,pyrocheetah,3,Mon May 25 23:06:07 2015 UTC,"At first the voices were gibberish and now they take on structured sentences and phrases and have recurring themes. They feel foreign because I don't think in the way the voices do, the foreign aspect leads to delusions and paranoia that I'm being targeted. Noisy environments are difficult. I think my brain is interpreting words in the white-noise, I hear a stream of vowels and/or consonants and my overactive brain picks out words, phrases, and sentences that intertwine with my delusions and thoughts.   This idea of brainwashing weighs on my mind. The definition of this word for me is when one tries to make someone think like they think. This creates cognitive dissonance which expresses itself in various ways. I think there is a war of ideas taking place in the media, culture, politics, and on the internet. Most art is biased by its creator and it's not uncommon for many people to have the same beliefs. This misunderstanding has lead to a lot of conspiracy thinking in myself. I can entertain them in my head but I will only truly consider cross-referenced peer-reviewed (scientific method) ideas to paint the bigger picture of the world we live in. Study of history is important to me.  I have my good and bad days like anybody else. Never forget, the golden rule. Peace, love, and understanding. Be true to yourself."

Maybe after he gets better, he will realize how he was or what sort of trouble could have came from it. He will need much family support if he were to get institutionalized, thats for sure. He may just need to see a doctor to get evaluated which may take a couple of day or weeks depending on his condition. He will definitely need to get on meds."

After helping him with meds would he start to realize it was a delusion and come to terms with his illness so he knew I did the right thing? Or would it just help him and he still think I did something wrong?
schizophrenia,376lp3,Kristouph,1 point,Mon May 25 22:30:00 2015 UTC,That is a difficult decision that I cannot make for you. You may need to consult with family members about that. There are some who are aware of their illness while most are not. It can be difficult to get through to the person when they are not aware. I guess it really depends on him if he is quick to blame others or himself which can result in how he feels towards you. You probably need to talk to someone who is closer to him and similar to his age that will have more authority over the situation.

For me they are mania like heightened activity, interest in philosophical texts, believe in the paranormal, motivation and drive to turn my life around, less sleep.  It's certainly good to know ones own early warning signs for relapse, but it doesn't always help, at least in my case. When I quit my meds last year: I thought I would recognize my early warning signs as signs of psychosis, but the psychotic boost was too strong and fast, and I was convinced that those were signs of divinity and I was God again in no time.. then hospitalization etc, now on high dosis of meds again.

It happens to me when my neurons recede after an episode. More the episodes, the more they recede.   These are just precursor which are semi psychotic state that can get better over time. When I feel like my brain is about to explode is when I know a major break is going to occur. The voices start to set in at this point.

schizophrenia,376gu2,hermanlerman,5,Mon May 25 07:23:13 2015 UTC,"It depends.   It should involve basic tests to eliminate other conditions, which may involve an MRI or EEG.  However, most of the time, it merely involves examining symptoms, family history, and drug use.   It is something which some doctors may diagnosis hastily, but they should not do it immediately, because the disorder is basically a catch-all for severe psychosis without any known causes.  They will need to:   Ensure that the symptoms have the number and intensity necessary for a diagnosis (it is possible to have psychotic symptoms and not have schizophrenia). Ensure the symptoms are not caused by substance use (legal or illegal). Ensure the symptoms are not caused by a mood disorder (psychosis caused by mania or depression is not schizophrenia). Ensure that the person does not have another mental disorder which better explains the symptoms (ie, if one qualifies for a diagnosis of Autism, it is much more difficult to get a diagnosis of Schizophrenia)."

schizophrenia,371n13,Kayasi,3,Sun May 24 05:15:59 2015 UTC,"One thing i learned there really is not a whole bunch a therapist can do when you talk about hallucinations.   they can tell you what your hearing is not real(you probably already know this because well you know they are hallucinations)  they can tell you that what your hearing is disturbing you(you already know this because you want to talk to someone about them)  there are no well known techniques to deal with hallucinations basically just hospitalize and dump anti psychotics on the person until they stop talking about the hallucinations.   however i have found it very help full when my therapist opens her mouth, i wave my hand and say, no no no, i do not want to hear any of you therapist talk right now, i just want you to listen.  then i proceed to tell her what ever is bothering me.  and then i let her speak afterwards if she really has something important to say.    so make it very clear you think it would make you feel better if you told your therapist what your hallucinations were and why they bothered you.  if he tries to derail you or does not listen to you stand up and walk out.  that would show him you think his behavior is so despicable you don't want to be there anymore. and find a new therapist.   you should never dread going to a therapist. if you feel this way you could ask for a referral. and leave once he gives it."
schizophrenia,371n13,Borrillz,2,Sun May 24 11:35:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think in the end you ""just"" have to learn that the voices really are just manifestations of your feelings and that it is just not the right way to listen to them. In a way it is like having imaginary friends. Eventually you have to admit to yourself that they aren't real and replace them with real friends. And so you will ignore them and they will fade away. If you keep telling a therapist about your imaginary friends and try to analyze them it will likely only make them more real to you.  Maybe therapists don't really know what they are doing, but that doesn't mean that there isn't value in their approaches."
schizophrenia,371n13,fire--starter,2,Sun May 24 12:26:04 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents. My doctor didn't want to label me either and for months I was being treated for OCD before I was hospitalized for schizo.    I'm rather shy, but I would probably ask him what he believes you have, and why it is different then the psychiatrist. Then I would explain to him that I was dreading the visit and say why.   Though, as my therapist says the label doesn't really matter in therapy what matters is helping the patient, which yours is not doing.   Good luck! You shouldnt have to dread an appointment."

Others may be schizotypal their entire life and have it slowly escalate.  And others can be in-between.  As the sticky states, people with anxiety often mistake their symptoms for schizophrenia or other disorders.   Does anybody here at least have support to offer?    Make a list of the actual symptoms you experience which cause you distress.  Show that list to a doctor or another mental health professional."

schizophrenia,37211r,jkeller4000,1 point,Sun May 24 11:40:55 2015 UTC,"Hi Full-scale. Normally when you're posting on reddit, if you have a particular bit of content you'd like everyone to discuss, you'd start by making a thread about it rather than posting your content in a comments section. I definitely don't blame you for making that mistake since learning how to use reddit is really just something you do as you go. Just be aware that next time you have something you'd like to bring to everyone's attention, you'll want to make a thread.  Bear in mind I'm only a schizophrenic, not a doctor. As is covered in the FAQ section on the sidebar to the right, nobody here can make a diagnosis or provide and legitimate medical attention. The best we can offer is advice, insight, discussion, and someone to talk to.  It sounds a lot like your friend is experiencing paranoid delusions. While schizophrenia is not the only psychological disorder that can cause these symptoms, it's certainly the most famous one. So if I were a doctor I wouldn't make a diagnosis of schizophrenia so quickly, although if the symptoms have been occurring for five to six months then it certainly becomes a possibility.  You'll want to let your friend's family know about his current situation, if they're not already aware, or if he has any to alert. Prognosis for schizophrenia, and most psychological disorders in general, typically is higher the sooner you catch it and the sooner it's treated. As for help, no one can send your friend to a hospital for him unless he is an immediate threat to the safety of himself or someone else. The best thing you can do for him is to try to convince him to go of his own volition. Hopefully he's able to see there's something wrong with his current disjointed thought process.  Feel free to come back and ask any questions you have."

schizophrenia,37211r,Regal_Bear,2,Sun May 24 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"For me it started with anxiety, depression and depersonalization among other symptoms. I look some drugs (legal highs) and went completely off the rails for a week before being admitted to hospital with psychosis.   I think I had a schizotypal personality (interested in spirituality, philosophy, and esoteric ideas), which is one of the warning signs.   The best thing for you to do is talk with a mental health doctor (a psychiatrist) and see if they can help you. The diagnosis doesn't really mean a lot, it's more about getting help for the suffering that you're already enduring.  Also, anxiety is a heightened state of awareness. It means that you are getting ready to perform a task that your biology considers threatening. Think of it as positive and it will lessen the effect of it and turn it into an ability rather than a bane. There is plenty of stuff online you can learn to cope, but I do recommend  to stick with medication that your health professional recommends."

I haven't told my counselor because if he doesn't believe me, then nobody ever will. I don't believe it's just run-of-the-mill anxiety. If it was, I'd be getting better by now, not worse. I came here because I was worried I'd been misdiagnosed, and I wanted to talk to somebody anonymously before I told anybody I know. I don't want to tell anybody personally because I need a firsthand account. I need something to compare my experiences to. I know that might be pointless, just because of how varied different cases can be, but I don't believe it's just anxiety, because I can feel it getting worse, and my anxiety meds aren't doing a damn thing to stop it. I need to know if I should tell somebody, and I figured I'd come here, if not for guidance, then for support. Don't just tell me I'm imagining it, or doing it for attention, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.  I'm sorry about the rant, and if any of that came off as confrontative, I didn't mean offense.

schizophrenia,37211r,keyvin,2,Sun May 24 23:19:30 2015 UTC,"You need to share with us too! Psychiatry is tricky business and schizophrenia is a very serious diagnosis.  What are your delusions, and how do you know they aren't real?   To answer your question, I had periods of wellness in between illness that allowed me to function until it had built to the point there was no going back. To everyone around me, it looked like a V8 engine exploding, but now that I know the symptoms I can trace it back to when I was 16 or 17.   I'm interested in how you know you have delusions. I did not know I had them, and it cause me to do things I deeply regret now - such as barely talking to my grandmother in the six months up till she died, or believing that my mother starved me when I was young for a period of years. Even knowing I am ill, there are some things that people tell me are from the illness that I refuse to let go.   Be 100% honest with your therapist and your doctor.  P.S. Anxiety is difficult to treat with pharmaceuiticals. Your worsening anxiety could just be your body developing tolerance to the anti anxiety medication.   P.P.S. I did not recognize the fact I had schizophrenia, even after I was diagnosed till about six months ago. I could control my behavior around other people, and I assumed that meant that I just had a good imagination and the medicine and diagnosis were worthless. I quit medication and discovered that yes, there is something very wrong with my brain."

schizophrenia,371ffb,sikfoq,1 point,Sun May 24 20:56:37 2015 UTC,"ASMR is related to traditions which use repetition as a method to induce ""god consciousness"". Self-hypnosis is not some type of unsubstantiated nonsense, and for those of us with diagnosis related to psychotic behavior -or abnormal brains/nervous systems- ""meditative hypno-media"" has a strong chance of triggering episodes.   However it does depend on the media itself, and it's intention.   As a person who was once seriously preparing to ordain as a Buddhist monk by submitting to expanded monastic precepts -assuming the novitiate as if I was already committed- regular meditation practice ( 1 or 2 hours a day for several months at a time) matched with ascetic practices like regular fasting, led to a major episode.  Mentally ill folks are warned to not engage in meditation practices, and I support that to a certain point; mindfulness practice in regards to all activity is very helpful, especially if paired with CBT, but formal sitting meditation may lead to a long episode, or even permanent dysfunction.   Formal meditation is related to self-hypnosis: training the mind to accept it's own transitory nature, the ""emptiness of self"" in regards to awareness of particulates as temporary forms. Long term, formal meditation will increase that experience, and for those of us who are prone to psychological dis-integration to begin with, we may become unable to integrate at will, and thus be institutionalized as vegetables.   It's one thing to enjoy entertainment media if it is relaxing, and helps the mind reduce ""toxic noise"", but another where the self (ego) diffuses into ""nothingness"" and eventually floats away."
schizophrenia,371ffb,Cedrichendrix92,2,Sun May 24 21:05:24 2015 UTC,"That is somewhat unsound reasoning. ASMR, like sleep, can be used to assist hypnosis. That doesn't mean you should avoid it because it could potentially do similar things in unrelated contexts. I don't know about meditation, but if you are getting psychotic from it, then I believe you are doing the opposite of the intended."

schizophrenia,370znx,JosephFaolan,2,Sat May 23 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"The way I deal with it is like this: if they read your thoughts, who are they comparing your thoughts to?  Their own.  Nobody has a pure mind, everyone thinks things they don't mean that could hurt or scare others if said out loud.  So they should understand when you have the occasional impure thought, right?  The real work is to stop fixating on the fact everybody can read your thoughts.  I think it's true for me when I get angry or scared, but when this happens I do anything to distance myself from obsessing over the fact everyone can hear me.  It just takes practice to do, focus your attention on another neutral or happy thought when the thought broadcasting idea comes back and you'll stop caring as much.  Good luck!"

There is a male to genderless voice that either keeps a running commentary of what I'm doing, or calls me all sorts of disgusting names. He also tells me to do things I shouldn't, in a very persuasive and sinister tone. If I'm making dinner, he will say ""suure, cut yourself, go ahead"" (I don't self-harm) He also repeats ridiculous phrases that are meaningless to my situation or day, like ""find my watch"". Huh?!   It's easy enough to ignore them unless I am in a crowd and mistake them for real persons trying to get my attention. Sometimes they make me laugh out loud because they can be funny.

Often it was outside commentary on what I was doing. Almost like I had an invisible narrator friend. When I felt paranoia I would hear people talking about the contents of my bags or specific details about me they couldn't have known when I was walking around in the city etc. This is how I knew they weren't real.

One of them does most of the talking, the other one seems to be there for the sole reason that the first voice has someone to talk to. They're usually standing outside and in front of the house, occasionally they're inside and in front of the door already. They follow me wherever I go.   Most of the time, they comment on what I'm doing or thinking. They're hypercritical and mean and presumptuous. They'll talk about how disgusting I am a lot and about how I can do nothing right. Everything I try to do, they'll bash me for it. For example: If I try to take a shower, they'll say that I'm fat and ugly. If I avoid taking showers due to the voices, they'll tell me I'm a smelly and lazy fuck. The same can be applied to any other day-to-day situation.   Sometimes, they'll be worried about my mental health. They'll say that I'm psychotic and that I should really go see a doctor. This one is a less bad, but it's confusing as fuck, as they themselves are the problem, while acting like they're real and like I'm not listening to them, but to someone else who isn't real.  Other times, they'll doubt that I'm paranoid and say that I must have made that up, even though they're right fucking there, still talking about me.  Sometimes, when I get very tired, I'll have dozens of voices outside, celebrating how fucked up I am, because it's funny to them. If I'm lucky, there'll be one that defends me from the others.   They also talk a lot of plain old bullshit.   Overall, it can get kind of repetitive and is rather annoying than scary most of the time, since it's been going on for so long."

schizophrenia,3702kf,D_as_in_avid,4,Sun May 24 12:43:08 2015 UTC,Long as i can remember. When i was a boy i would hear other people in the room wen they weren't there. I was very delusional mostly. My understanding of the world was just different compared to everyome else.  Was hospitalised at 17 for two suicide attempts. I was very psychotic that entire time.  I went undiagnosed until a couple of months ago. I didn't start hearing (well....noticing) more consistent voices until about a year and a half ago.  Currently i'm experiencing the most symptoms i ever have but not the modt intense they've ever been. Currently i experience visual illusions (things look like what they're not) Auditory hallucinations.  Delusions (this is the hardest symptom to recognize unless i go back to my old hendrix delusion) Disorganised thinking (hard to recognize)  Paranoia (part of delusional thinking not sure which causes which) I experience a range of negative symptoms as well.  This is only a list of symptoms and doesn't paint a picture. Ask me more questions if you want to know details about symptoms.
schizophrenia,3702kf,Cedrichendrix92,2,Sat May 23 18:08:46 2015 UTC,I'd love to know more about the details of your hallucinations and delusions!
schizophrenia,3702kf,Thatinsanity,5,Sat May 23 19:31:38 2015 UTC,"I was not diagnosed until I was 19, but symptoms have been around for my loving memory, definitely having started by at least 10 when persistent hallucinations began. Lots of little kids say they see monsters and talk to people that aren't there, I just never stopped and could actually see the things. Between that and being high function, no one caught on until I tried to get help on my own initiative."
schizophrenia,3702kf,Richard_Punch,3,Sat May 23 18:56:08 2015 UTC,My psychosis came out of nowhere and hit me like a ton of bricks 6 years ago. When I was hospitalized all those years ago it was shortly after the onset of symptoms. Originally I was diagnosed as being bipolar due to my delusions of grandeur. I hid the paranoia and my hallucinations. 5 years passed and nothing improved (I was being treated for bipolar after all!). Then after 7 months of suffering I was hospitalized for a series of things. My shrink in the hospital was very nice and asked me a series of questions that no one had ever asked me before. It was determined that I wasn't bipolar and was in fact a paranoid schizophrenic. Even on medication I experience delusions from time to time and I'm almost always filled with paranoid thoughts. The hallucinations are gone and I'm currently having weekly CBT sessions with a brilliant therapist.
schizophrenia,3702kf,shesgonegilligan,3,Sat May 23 19:40:14 2015 UTC,"I was 24. My computers, wifi, and cellphones got hacked or so I thought they did, and I went to the FBI. I then became so paranoid that I thought people were following me everywhere. I thought that I had exposed something I wasn't supposed to expose and that the government was out to get me. I then thought my family was in on it and they had all collaborated and began poisoning me. Prior to that I never really had any significant symptom except I was experiencing ADD and GAD."

schizophrenia,3702kf,Kmarsharry,2,Sat May 23 22:49:25 2015 UTC,"I had psychotic symptoms since I was very young, mostly concerning demons and magic spells (recently, my boyfriend and I were laughing about how weird it must have been for a cute little blonde haired girl to insist to strangers, ""you have no idea what unseen sinister forces are at work here!""). My teachers were concerned and brought my parents in to talk about a possible mental illness, but my mom insisted that I was her perfect baby and there was nothing wrong. However, I continued to get in trouble at school whenever I had an episode, and so learned to hide them. This made it so I never got treatment and my parents still refuse to accept the fact that I need psychiatric help and aid. Currently I'm trying to find treatment that doesn't involve being hospitalized."
schizophrenia,3702kf,Soylattebrewing,2,Sat May 23 17:39:45 2015 UTC,"I've had mental health issues ever since I was a small child. I had a breakdown a few years back and sought psychiatric help after that. To help me at social situations I was put on Xanax which made the voices come out and tell me to self harm and commit suicide. That was the first time I realized there was something more wrong and that those voices I had heard since I was a child were not simple thoughts but something more. Something evil. That was in Mayish '14 And I got my diagnoses following that whole ordeal. My psychiatrist actually says I have severe Psychosis but I have been studying Schizophrenia for a while and I'm pretty sure I have it. My family doctor told me that Schizophrenia and Psychosis are essentially the same thing. My shrink also diagnosed me with Schizophrenia but she's a shrink, not a doctor so...... yeah."

schizophrenia,3702kf,RusselDunbar,1 point,Sun May 24 01:18:34 2015 UTC,"I was a little strange as a child. I started using drugs and alcohol when I was 13. The earliest memories I have of my illness were after my first episode at 15. I was on the way home from the summer camp I had been kicked out of for using drugs and I became outraged that I wouldn't be able to go back. It was really sudden and disturbing. I became withdrawn over the course of a few years in high school and college.   I started to act out at school. I used to make weird speeches and disobey simple directions. Even while descending into mental illness I was accepted to an ivy league university.   While I was in high school I started to run away from home in my senior year. I believed that I would hitchhike across the country write the next great american novel, and thus, having impressed on the psyche of the country a sort of back-to-the-woods/ ""beat"" aesthetic, usher in a literary revolution. Around that time I was diagnosed as prodromal, which means pre-syndrome, indicating that I would probably develop a mental illness.  I started using marijuana more heavily when I went away to university. My sleep cycle got reversed, which caused me to miss classes and eventually I failed out of university. I worked tirelessly on personal projects that took me away from the reality I was living in. I wrote a play about my high school friends.  After I lost my spot at uni I had another episode while at home with my mom. I broke dishes and put holes in walls. I was upset that my mom didn't want to turn off the lights in a room we weren't using. My parents threatened to put me up in an apartment out of the house unless I went to therapy.   I went to more than six therapists and pdocs before I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. During that time I was also diagnosed with aspergers and autism. I resisted medication until I had to decide between my home and treatment."

schizophrenia,3702kf,jkeller4000,1 point,Sun May 24 11:30:48 2015 UTC,"I had an imaginary friend for a while when I was a kid, but I think that's not too abnormal. I was also very withdrawn. I remember hearing voices once when I was on a holiday when I was around nine or ten, but that one could also be attributed to stress or an overactive fantasy. In general, I don't really remember much about my childhood, though, which makes it hard to judge.  What I do remember is that I became very depressed and anxious around the time I turned 14. I stopped caring about school, which led to me transferring to a different school and losing all my friends at age 15.  There, I stopped talking altogether for about a year, and I was having panic attacks, as people were bullying me for being so strange. In hindsight, I was already being a little paranoid, insofar that I felt like the people on the covers of magazines were watching me, and that my fellow students would somehow get into the minds of the cats we had at home in order to watch me through their eyes. I had to check behind the shower curtains and so on before I used the loo, too, heh. Again, I remember hearing voices during that time on one occasion, I heard fellow students talking about me in front of the house, but when I looked outside, no one was there.  This gradually became worse, and the drugs I was taking in order to cope certainly didn't help.  I started hearing voices regularly and was convinced that people were plotting against me by the time I turned 18. I also thought that people could read my mind and that they were trying to manipulate me.  Teachers had been telling my parents that they should get me to see a therapist for ages, but they never listened. I was failing tests because I didn't want them to use the info, I'd have to give them by answering the questions, against me. So I flunked out of school. I checked myself into a hospital that summer due to helplessness and wanting very badly to kill myself, where I was diagnosed with psychosis. I thought they were wrong about it, as no one had even actually spoken to me during my visit. Turns out, they were right and I was lacking insight.  It got really bad when I moved out. The voices were present constantly and kept getting more and more aggressive. I checked for them everywhere etc. before I came to the conclusion, that I, in fact, must be psychotic. I tried very hard to educate myself and recognize when I'm being delusional, and it works to a certain degree. I'm 22 now and my life still revolves around this illness, but earlier this year, for a few months, I was alright (though still having symptoms). Then I carelessly triggered an episode by smoking tons of weed. But I think that I'll get back to being alright."

Many patients I work with whom suffer from schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders rarely are able to understand their experiences to be in fact, delusions.   That being said, maybe it is time to speak to your therapist/psychiatrist about your symptoms, and maybe a mixture of therapy and a medication change will help.

It was really hard for me to get help when I needed it and it put my whole life in chaos. Being there for your brother can be a really important resource for him as he navigates the illness. He needs you right now.   The most important thing for your brother is to continue treatment. That probably means therapy and medication. So, you can help by being a stable influence in his life that urges him to keep going to therapy and taking medication. One positive thing is that medication is pretty good at treating positive symptoms of schizophrenia (i.e. auditory hallucinations).   It's also important to remember that you have needs, too. Right now you're able to give in your relationship with your brother and I encourage you to do that. But, if it gets hard you need to be able to step back and remember that you have your own needs.   I'm inferring that your brother's living situation may be a challenge. I was diagnosed three years ago and living independently is still a goal of mine. Schizophrenia took a lot from me and one of those things was the ability to properly motivate myself to maintain an independent lifestyle.  The initial onset of my schizophrenia was a traumatic experience that lasted years. I needed to learn how to care for myself all over again.

The problem I (and it seems many others) have is that it's very hard to find people who will be absolutely judgement free and truly want to hear what we have to say. When you ask him about his psychosis, I feel the best way to treat it would be as if you were asking someone who had just come back from a crazy vacation in a far-off land. Keep general interest and openness about what he experiences. You don't have to agree with everything he says or treat it like it's real, you just have to acknowledge that that is his reality that he has to deal with every day.

I have lived with schizophrenia and at first I shut myself off from everyone even my mother/father/sister. At first they didnt know how to respond to me. Therapy truly helped me but for others it may not because again its only one form of help.

Instead try saying that you see things differently. My wife does this with me and she shows she's listening while maintaining an independent and objective viewpoint. Does she think I'm weird and get worried, even personally offended or attacked? Absolutely. The thing that's important to remember is being supportive as much as you can.

If you are thinking about hospitalization, usually you can only be hospitalized if you are a harm to yourself or others. Some states also say if you are ""gravely disabled"" you can be hospitalized, but that varies by state how that's defined.   I was hospitalized at the climax of my episode. I have mixed feelings about hospitalization. I needed a safe haven, but they over druged me where I lost temporarily my short term memory. It's scary to lose your rights to treatment. Some doctors have a tendency to over medicate and I would make sure to do your own research on the appropriate/normal dosage. In my opinion a person should never be medicated so much that they are losing their memory, but that was done to me in Maryland. If she ever gets forced treatment, you need to be atuned to her side effects she's experiencing and advocate for her if she's experiencing too many side effects from the medication. Also you should be aware that medication doesn't work at all for 30% of people. So the medication might not work on her. And for most only some medication works on some of the symptoms. So doctors use trial and error to figure out the right medication. If you don't see any positive change in her after awhile, I would question the doctor whether he or she should be switching medication. Remember medication doesn't work on everyone and if it does work on some of her symptoms, she needs to decide the right dosage for her with regard to the side effects. Some people eventually decide to not use medications at all and do fine. This all depends on the person.  Why does she say she won't go to a doctor? Is she willing to see a therapist? Have you explained to her what you think she has?"

What you describe sounds as intellectually stimulating as many schizo experiences, but a lot less intrusive and disfunctional.  So, some of the smartest people I've ever met, had imaginations this active. Way before computer games were complex enough, all the geeks I hung out with at MIT were playing elaborate Dungeons and Dragons games spread out on huge floors in some of the public buildings, and talking about their characters all the time, as if they were real people.  Also, though Wikipedia doesn't mention it, the great poet William Butler Yeats had a great love for a spirit mistress, an imaginary woman that often took him from his wife.  Many novelists spend years with their characters, if you can imagine that. (Hehe, you probably can. I sure can.)  I hear your feelings about wasting your time this way, but it could be much worse-- it could be drug or food addictions, or fear of going outside, or a thousand other things. I think the more you fight against it and push against it, the more it will raise itself up as something to be pushed upon, and maybe if you just ride with it and find peace in yourself, it will find an appropriate place in your heart and mind. Anyway, best to you! Like Cedrichendrix92 said, I also think you may want to cultivate some writing skills and use your imagination and your gift for context and situational depth."

When i was deep in my mind at 17 i would spend all night creating imaginary stories in my head and it was so vivid i swear it was happening. But i'm not sure if that's a symptom of schizophrenia. I just think i have an overactive imagination and it got amplified during my psychosis.   My advice is to write stories about it. You have an artistic mind. That's what i gather. Want to reach your potential? Start writing. It'll definitely help with the anxiety it causes you.   Edit: i don't believe weed causes schizophrenia. I can smoke it and be just fine if i'm in a good environment. My illness is very dependent on my environment regardless of whether i'm stoned or not. I can't be high all day though. I don't think anyone should be regardless of mental health. But if quitting has helped you, then by all means put down the green."

schizophrenia,36uqoq,Cedrichendrix92,2,Fri May 22 17:33:10 2015 UTC,"I was helped by researching the origins of psychosis/autism/schizophrenia as words for a root condition related to ""mania"" in regards to ""chronic inability to adapt to consensus reality"" (my paraphrase). There could be a brain injury/malformation along with acquired behavioral traits/conditioning, or both former and latter have distinct causes without the other.   If social functioning is impaired, then thought disorders (paranoia is ""disorganized thinking"") are a condition which requires treatment.   I have sociopathic and autistic traits, but they all fold into my general diagnosis, which is the now redundant, ""undifferentiated schizophrenia"". Therefore, I cannot be officially placed on the ASPD or Asperger's spectrum. Recently I looked at my updated diagnosis during an appointment, and how I am classified ""on paper"" and it looks like they are using ""non-specific schizophrenia, paranoid personality disorder, non-specific acute anxiety, non-specific psychotic personality disorder"". I did not write the exact words, but I wondered why ""undifferentiated schizophrenia"" is such a ""poor descriptor""?  Anyway, I understand your question in how Bipolar with psychotic features is well founded in the root of western psychiatry/brain sciences in how ""mania"" and ""psychosis"" are basically the same thing. So, personality disorders, autistic spectrum conditions, psychotic disorders and mood disorders are all rooted in one dysfunction in regards to the brain's inability to cope with ""reality""?"

The chances of the psychosis returning stand at 30%. If it does indeed return, said trial can be taken again, but the odds are now standing on 60%. The next time it'll be 90%, and from that on, in case you haven't learned your lesson, the psychosis will return, period.  Sad thing is, we don't really know the in and outs of the statistics, only that observations found a certain percentage react in certain ways - in other words, we don't have tests to know if a person is within the percentage that will have his symptoms return, or is he safe to give it a bash."

It ended in November and I have not experienced any breaks since then. So it's been 7 months.   Currently, I'm psychotic 0% of the time. I do experience voices, but there is no break from reality.

But like yesterday morning, paranoid episodes flare up and I send ""word salad"" electronic messages to people about how I think they are part of a plot against me.   I respond to unresolved resentments by ""putting pieces together"" and then communicating my findings to people who don't seem to care.  200mg of anti-dep medication helps out a lot, and if I am focused on finishing an animation or audio project, then all my awareness of ""plots against me"" is reduced.  So the good part of psychosis is how it gives me new ways of making cool art, but I have to reel myself in with CBT when paranoia, mysterious visual phenomena, and auditory signals from, or directed at my mind ""flood"" my personal space."

I don't even have a number off hand for how many times I can claim to have had psychotic symptoms. There have been maybe dozens of episodes throughout life. 8 of which got me to inpatient psych.  About a dozen times where   I talked my way out being committed.  Maybe 75% of my life is of mental illness maybe 13% of my entire life time  which would make up about 4 years  I can account for having  experience persistent light to severe psychotic symptoms 24/7. Between the months and years long episodes  maybe 13% or 4 -6 years of my life if the cray went back to back instead of broken up. It might be way way higher than that for all I know.

Heed his or her advice, take the medication, go to therapy, whatever.  At least give it a shot.  Schizophrenia isn't just going to go away and it very well may even get worse without treatment.  Have I tried ignoring it?  Yes, that's how I've chosen to deal with this illness.  Has it worked?  No, not at all, but it's a hell of a lot better than when I was actively paying attention to it and trying to fix it.  The side effects of the medication can be a little overwhelming and for me it was simply too difficult to deal with.

I have explored the possibility of schizophrenia with my doctors, but they tell me that I'm not actively delusional nor otherwise psychotic (no thought disorder, no negative symptoms, no changes in personality) when I'm in a ""normal"" affective state/not under medication, so it can't be schizophrenia. Plus, they tell me that I don't have the characteristic signs of schizophrenia.  However, I was once diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia by one out of my many (perhaps, 10) doctors and psychologists. So that's why I'm wondering. That happened after I had a severe delusional episode after taking more antidepressants than prescribed, and not telling the doctor about the fact that I was taking them (because I was too exalted and excited at the time to even think about telling about this)."

You are anomalous enough that you can and should discard the entirety of the current medical establishment's views that no one gets better and you're only in remission and if it got better it wasn't schizo and you must have had drug- or stress-induced psychoses and you're broken for life and all the other (literal) crap that is the fatalism of current thoughts on the matter.  Make your own destiny and raise the positivity of anything you are told by several orders of magnitude. Best to you!!  Edit: I want to add a few things. First, it's very brave and open of you to share. This sub if full of awe-filled and awesome and awful experiences. You can obviously be objective about your experiences and that's a real saving grace. Second, stress can play a huge part, and you can always work on your zen. I mean, really work on it. Cultivating meditation or Qigong (""chi"") or internal martial arts studies, even for a few years, will leave you with an indelible ability to have some say over your physical and mental reactions to stress. I have been meds-free for, oh.... decades and decades, and I'm quite successful, but there have been high-stress times when I ""stepped in the shit"" again, and you just have to wipe your shoes off on the grass and try not to track it into the house, so to speak. No biggie. As they say in Chinese gongfu-- you cultivate internal harmony during times of peace, for when the tiger is in the village. And, the tiger is always in the village these days, whether it's your boss walking up to you on a bad day, or something happening to your kid, or your wife getting ill, etc. etc. Stress management is important and it's a rare skill these days. Also, if you are so inclined, introduce yourself to the basic precepts of Indian Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism, Japanese Zen (""at your own risk, self-guided"" Buddhism, etc.), Taoism, etc. You may find that the ""non-white"" world has a pretty transparent history of acknowledging that humans are growing in the midst of a vast jungle of interactive mind. This is a perspective far-removed from ""I am alone in my box of my mind, experiencing phenomena and noumena in isolation."" Finally, find both love and altruism in your life, for these forces are like wearing end-game armor in an online rpg. They just rock hard. Harder than that. They rock REALLY hard. Best to you!!"
schizophrenia,36llre,Hydrogen_Ion,2,Wed May 20 11:59:41 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypy  There is growing consensus that schizophrenia exists on a kind of phenotypical spectrum that ranges from normal personality functioning to personality disorder to serious mental illness. Someone on the normal end of the spectrum has a stronger predisposition to psychotic experience than someone who is not on the spectrum, especially in stressful circumstances. Also, where a person lies on that spectrum may change over time, in either direction.   Age 21 is also when I was at the peak of my schizotypal experiences, which gradually tapered off during my twenties. Now, in my early thirties, I rarely experience anything I would consider schizotypal. Though I can still easily empathize with others on the spectrum."

They'd usually ask me to prove I had been assaulted as a kid, offer accounts of friends/family I had at the time, and when I couldn't 'prove it' or I didn't want to dredge it up, they'd chalk it up to ""so you're just tormenting this poor boy and ruining his reputation because you're mentally ill"".

For example had that boy never existed your mind in that state would have found another delusion as you went on with your day to day life.   Same for me and the same for everyone else. The real eureka moment is realizing it wasn't real. Even that doesn't guarantee there not being a re-occurrence with perhaps some other new angle on  delusion. Even knowing your delusional while it's happening is still difficult.  Don't worry so much about why it unfolded the way it did but look at it more in a clinical sense, you were delusional and there was some underlying cause that needed treatment long before the noticeable onset of symptoms that led you to doctors.

It's pretty much between him and his doctor, but for the snoring you can suggest breathe-rite strips. Less snoring usually means better sleep, which might help him feel more alert during daylight hours. Better sleep for you at least :P  There's no good way around the drowsy/hazy feeling that I know of, but sleeping that much can be bad for general health, as I heard it from my doctor.  Might all be stuff he discussed with doctor already, night be that he hasn't realized just how much he's sleeping and snoring yet. Decision is his, but in my book there's no such thing as too much information when making a decision.  In short: that's normal, there are alternatives but there's no guarantee they'll work as well, and you should tell him your concerns so he has the extra info. when he makes the decision with his doctor."

Remember, schizophrenia treatment is a marathon, not a sprint."
schizophrenia,36k1kz,areallyniceguy,1 point,Wed May 20 05:50:11 2015 UTC,How different is Clozapine and Seroquel?
schizophrenia,36k1kz,overk4ll,1 point,Wed May 20 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"Quite different. Both in the molecular and functional levels. Clozapine is an old generation drug - it has more severe side effects, which require regular blood works to make sure you do not suffer from. Seroquel is a new generation one, less severe side effects, easier to consume, doesn't require the same attention and maintenance as Clozapine. With that said, Clozapine is the most powerful - and could be the most useful - antipsychotic. Not only it is the most powerful in terms of stopping psychotic episodes, it also helps negate the negative effects of schizophrenia - helps balance out the twisted affect, somewhat returns your ability to concentrate and more. However for our interest - the sleepiness and drowsyness - as far as I know, is not an accurate science. With antipsychotics, you can't know for sure what side effects you will suffer from until you give them a try for a certain period of time. I tried 5 drugs before Clozapine, and only the latter gave me the sleepiness and drowsyness side effects. However, what I do know is that generally, side effects such as these mellow down the longer you consume them - as I said, Clozapine used to easily knock me out, nowadays I can handle 7 hours of sleep and even wake up a few minutes before my alarm clock :)   However, with all that said, Clozapine is generally perscribed in special cases and there are health regulations that require special programs to be able to be perscribed that medicine. Almost never will you be given it before trying anything else, it is kind of a last line of medical defense before what you can try are electric treatments. Usually the first medicine tried is Risperdal, and from then it is more of a free roam that your psychiatrist can navigate after getting to know you and your history.

But it seems that such a complex combination must incorporate hallucinations, illusions, and delusions.   Is it common to be able to hold an audible conversation with a hallucination, which covers the speech of the psychiatrist?    it is not common, but not uncommon for those with severe psychotic symptoms."

I was incredibly agitated, and paced around a lot. I also experienced lots of visual hallucinations - more so than auditory.

I think the both of them have opinions about me that are not fully expressed.  Sometimes a trainee case manager will sit in and I focus on them for signs that they are undercover federal investigators.   I have also argued with them about how I think they are participating in a ""Maoist re-education camp"" in regards to standards of ""normalcy"". My ex-therapist has drunk the ""cultural marxist kool-aid"" and I argued with her about political issues (she was not argumentative, none of them are; they just calmly ask me questions).

It's really not about you in this case.  Another ridiculous analogy: ""If she loved me, she wouldn't be thinking I'm part of a government conspiracy...."". Nope. Not the way it works. They call them ""breaks of psyche"" for a reason. Taking something like that personally, would be.... well, it would be like what you are doing.

I am out of the game in regards to being ""a serious man of my culture"". My ""inner child"" will always be able to express it's rebellious nature, and that is why I have to do CBT on a daily basis so that I don't end up in some type of lockdown.  From early childhood, the game was set. My mind is permanently twisted, and that is objective, clinical fact.  Based on the illusion of ""free will"", I chose to abuse substances from the age of 12, becoming a relatively toxic addict by mid-20's, and then getting sober 7 years ago. Since then I have had some slips, but for the most part I can claim ""sober living"" in comparison to 2 decades of malignant narcissism, and psychotic behaviors sourced in the ""wicked demon child"" which once ruled my mind.   Yes, substance abuse can worsen what is already present in regards to brain defects, but take away the party candy, and I still find ways to behave which appease the ""wicked inner demon baby"".  I know I can survive in lockdown, and I will just become catatonic most likely; the administrators of a future, hypothetical facility will just be warehousing the shell of ""me"" as ""I"" drain down the vortex at the bottom of my skull.  I have good hobbies, and I like doing them, and so I take my medication, and cooperate with my Pdoc/case manager in the hopes of remaining independent.

Wouldn't recommend doing drugs, as a rule, to anybody reading this thinking ""maybe I should start smoking weed"". Risky. Unnecessary.  Pretty much everybody needs to at least try a few different medications before they get one that works, and they all take like a month to kick in and almost as long to wash out, so it's a process. Don't be discouraged yet. However, keep a close eye on side effects and talk with your doctor often about this stuff, IMO.   I am one of the minority of patients that does not respond to antipsychotic, but hot some side effects during the process that totally kicked my ass, and a couple that turned out to be permanent (lasting after discontinuing the culprits, for a couple years now). My word of caution: talk to your doctor frequently if you start to feel worse, gain weight, etc., and read the Rx sheet carefully to see what signs you have to watch for with which meds. Don't let that scare you off, though: I'm unlucky, it's more common to get some relief and not get screwed."

I can't drink coffee, though.  I don't mess with hard drugs either and never have. I'm sure something like meth can make schizophrenia worse or even trigger it.

schizophrenia,36ca47,dvenny,5,Mon May 18 05:57:08 2015 UTC,"Any tips on dealing with delusions   In general, it is best to avoid conflict or escalation, by arguing or trying to disprove delusions. Delusions are a symptom, not a choice, and evidence does not matter.   The experience is real, even though it is not objectively real. You should focus on the impact of these real experiences and be supportive and helpful.  Do not be afraid of strengthening or encouraging delusions in these attempts.  You did not give much details, so take this as general advice.   getting her to go back on meds?   Find out why she stopped.  The drugs are not cures. There are high rates of dissatisfaction with them. Find out why she stopped and address that. If a person stops because the drugs make them tired all the time, kills their creativity and blunts their emotions, and makes them fat, well, perhaps not taking them is a very rational decision.  Also focus on the symptoms she has and how they actually affect her life.  Remember, the goal is not to be ""normal"", but to be happy and safe.   Also, if she stops during episodes, then she can on her own when she is feeling better allow treatment during these times with an Advanced Directive for Mental Health. Her psychiatrist, therapist, case worker, etc, should be able to help with that."

Sometimes we need other things to help us cope rather than medication. I know I tried to stop medication but couldn't due to the withdrawl phase. I would find her some form of therapy but it does not have to be therapy in the form of talking to a therapist. Some schizophrenics find therapy in writing, drawing, coloring, painting, taking pictures of wildlife, farming(gardening), there is a list of things that would / could be suggested but there is reasons one may refuse to take medication and just like joseph said one of those reasons is the side effects."

It was a reality check to me. But overall I think I was in a better mind set at the time.   The hospital I was staying at over drugged me at first where I lost temporary my short term memory for three months. I switched hospitals at the fourth month. At the new hospital, they significantly lowered my medication and I was able to remember things and think better. People that visited me in the first hospital said that I could barely put sentences together because I was so sedated.  So I think the change in treatment was a dramatic improvement.

Shit like mind reading, I knew that it was just a symptom that I was experiencing but I still went out of my way to avoid thinking about certain things around certain people.  I knew that no one was trying to poison me but I still avoided eating certain types of food that would be difficult to tell if it had been tampered with or food that was prepared by certain people.  There were a couple more wild ones like that but for the most part they were all easy enough to identify as delusions and I was able to deal with them to an extent.  They still occur to me from time to time but they don't stress me out any more.  I'm not sure if it's a symptom of the illness or if I'm just insecure, but I still tend to think that people are talking about me when I'm not around or can't hear them and that most of the friends that I had all had ulterior motives for being friendly with me.

My goal was to fix myself, and not become a part of that statistic. Because, once you're heavily doped on drugs, how could you be sure what will happen? In the 80's, schizo drugs were strong and mind-deadening.  Can you imagine that 78% (or whatever) of the long-term care beds in U.S. hospitals, are occupied by people having the same kinds of disfunctions that we have? It was a mind-blowing statistic.  My mom was unable to be committed by my sister, for decades and decades. As a result, she never escaped from the dark alternate reality she lived in (telepathic experimentation, people being cruel in her mind, etc. etc.),-- but she was happier supporting herself modestly with government pensions and living on inherited property and renting part of it out some time-- than she would have been taking drugs and losing even more parts of her mental function. The one time that my sister REALLY went for it and got my mom involuntarily committed (in Nevada, I recall), I think the max time the state could hold someone who wasn't losing it, was 4 days. She refused to talk about her experiences, avoided talking poorly about her daughter, wouldn't take any medications (faking it if she had to), and managed to get out the day after the minimum involuntary inpatient time.  For me, staying out of the hospital was as easy/hard as escaping my father. Without him around, no one was trying to commit me and give me shock treatments. The doctors I met while hospitalized were morons. I did meet a fairly brilliant shrink afterwards, but the ones doing their time as hospital staff were truly closed-minded, block-headed idiots."

Taking it merely because of a diagnosis makes no sense.  Antipsychotics are frequently (or at least, were frequently) prescribed for people who did not have psychotic symptoms, but this led to lawsuits and criticism.   I do experience full blown psychosis with exalted mood when I take antidepressants. However, this one stops within a few weeks of discontinuing antidepressants.   This seems to indicate bipolar disorder. This is a common reaction to anti-depressants with people with that disorder.   Do you believe I still could have schizophrenia?    Nothing you wrote indicated you would, but the consensus seems to be ASD and the evidence seems to suggest Bipolar.    Is there a way to know for sure, if different doctors are saying different things?   Not 100% sure, but time and consensus seems to eventually settle on an appropriate diagnosis."

Its really that simple, you don't need a degree in medicine to decide if the pros out weigh the cons (And yes, there are pros. Its not strictly harmful like you are pretending it is). Just like if caffeine makes you feel better in the morning you keep doing it, I consider it the same thing. And like caffeine, you limit your intake, because caffeine isn't particularly good for you either.

That seems like it might be a little excessive, but that's just my opinion and I'm neither a doc nor a parent. Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding this; if it's a vitamin, how does the school nurse know when she hasn't taken it? Or is your daughter on antipsychotics already?  I had symptoms starting at age 10. What might have helped me is not what will help your daughter I suspect, as my mother overreacted, called a priest when I said I was seeing and hearing things and acting strangely, to come and bless me and the house (yeah, wtf right?)...before ever taking me to see a doctor. You probably would know what is going on instead of freaking out. Uh, idk really; stuff like not telling me to shut up about my hallucinations, and having a parent not complain about how weird I am in front of me and the rest of my family.   I also had to educate my friends parents so they'd stop calling my mom and telling her to put me in rehab for suspected drug use (because of my behavior in front of them). I didn't know about schizophrenia, except that I had a ""psychosis"" as they told me at the time and I would tell them that, it's a mental thing, I'm not on drugs... If in fact your daughter is having outward symptoms, be prepared to field awkward phone calls and questions from teachers and other adults. I'm not saying to tell them that your daughter has any diagnosis, but consider what you'd say that wouldn't hurt their opinion of your child. The only other thing that I can think of is just to be kind, and if she's having mental health issues, be up front about it. Saying ""you have problems"" is hurtful; I was told that numerous times, asked when I was going to be ""not screwed up"" anymore. (Thanks daddy)   Maybe explain it by saying some people's brains work a little differently than other peoples. Again, I'm not a parent so all I can comment on is from a perspective of what definitely didn't help me. You sound like you are vigilant and you care already. I hope that's helpful!"
schizophrenia,367qqx,AshamedImErica,5,Sun May 17 00:57:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!   So I'm giving her an actual vitamin. The nurse knows because my kid will suddenly remember that she didn't take it and then go see the nurse or social worker to inform them.  I've told the school staff that it seems weird but I have my reasons and I want that call made.  They honor that request.   She's very involved in all of her therapies.  She's working on many sensory, nerve,  motor planning, etc issues and keeps a little chart/journal about things like chewing objects, seeking pain or temperature extremes, feeling disconnected from her body, etc.  I haven't used the word schizophrenia as far as I can remember but we've discussed it. We talk about how she's developing differently than some kids and how her brain thinks of things that some people's never will.   Her school is supportive and goes to 8th grade.  We fought tooth and nail to get her in. It's a montessori school so lots of freedom to independently learn.  This has meant opportunity for her to remove herself if she feels the need.   Right now she's decided that she wants to focus on fitting in. It is what it is,  I guess.  So I'll support that how I can.  This means that at school she tries to talk about worms and rainbows and kindergarten stuff.  I hate it because sometimes I see her and it looks like she's shattering.  But we walk to and from school most days.  Its between 30 and 45 minutes of her talking nonstop.  So far she's talking about philosophy and writing stories that seem to be delusions she's had.

schizophrenia,367qqx,JosephFaolan,3,Sun May 17 02:06:30 2015 UTC,"I'm just learning about schizophrenia myself as I am recently diagnosed with it. Educate yourself about the critisms of antipsychotics as well. This is still seen as a very complicated disease and honestly doctors don't know everything yet. Antipsychotics are far from perfect treatment.  I've read that 30 percent of patients do not respond to antipsychotics at all. Some people still try being on antipsychotics when it clearly doesn't help them. All they experience are the side effects.   Others can be helped, but again you run a lot of risks, like developing extrapyramidal effects.  Try reading Robert Whitaker and Joanna Moncrieff. Also look up organizations, like Mad in America and Madness Radio. You can also read about people who have managed to be off medications, like mental health advocate Will Hall and British psychologist Eleanor Longden.  With that being said, sometimes antipsychotics are necessary for some. I'm currently on Haldol. It reduces my auditory hallucinations and helps me concentrate better as a result. I made sure, however, to read all sides. It's nice to be informed as much as possible.  It sounds like you are a very involved parent, which is good. I'm hesitant to say you should be worried. What you are doing might be premature. She is at such a young age. Even though it's possible to develop schizophrenia that young, it is rare. I'm glad you are monitoring her and looking for signs though. I'm not there so I don't know what she is like. Try not to worry so much about the future. The best thing you can do is be supportive."
schizophrenia,367qqx,oldschoolmaps,2,Sun May 17 07:15:37 2015 UTC,I recommend you get trained in the LEAP method so you can keep an open dialog no matter what happens.  Make sure that she knows that you don't have to listen to the voices and that there are ways to reduce them in addition to meds.  Meds might not take care of everything but for some residual hallucinations can be blocked with music or cbt techniques.  For me I either have to sing or picture a series of multidirectional spinning rings in my head....basically it needs to be something that takes a lot of mental energy and what that is varies from person to person.  Once she knows they can be stopped or ignored she can test things out to find something that works.
schizophrenia,367qqx,JosephFaolan,1 point,Sun May 17 13:56:24 2015 UTC,Thank you!  I'll look into LEAP for sure.  That's exactly the kind of advice I was hoping to find.

I've been told recently by her team of docs that she is likely to be diagnosed at some point later in life.    What symptoms does she have?  How do they affect her life?   But what else? If you have a diagnosis, looking back, what might have helped you?    Do not restrict yourself to drugs. They are not cures, and the human mind is very complex.

She does need the vitamin every day – just not as much and in a different way than she would need meds! I think that even for neurotypical kids, getting in the habit of taking medicine every day is wise. I've had to take allergy medicine every day since I was a young child, and because of that, as an adult I've never had any trouble remembering to take birth control pills daily or other pills when that became a thing – when I know that remembering pills daily is something that alot of other people struggle with. When she's an adult, she can make her own choices about whether and when to take medication (if she needs it at all), but you've helped lay the groundwork for her to do so effectively."
schizophrenia,367qqx,Paradise__Lost,1 point,Sun May 17 02:19:30 2015 UTC,"I'd love to know what there is beyond medication so yes please share what works for you.    There is not much beyond medication really, however, I feel the system is far too medical for its own good.  At what point does being different become a disorder? Schizotypy is a broad spectrum.  At what point is it unacceptable and worth involuntary drugging? These drugs are not normalizing substances nor are they cures. They have major effects on the body and brain.  Furthermore, they can actually cause psychotic symptoms or make certain symptoms worse.  So, drugs are highly imperfect, although, they are sometimes necessary or useful.   Being healthy and safe and reducing stress are far more important, and rare, I feel.   If you were detained in a restrictive setting and involuntarily drugged, you would exhibit the exact same responses of those with schizophrenia in the same situation. People with schizophrenia are human, with or without symptoms.   And also, psychiatrists and doctors only have drugs in their toolkit, and they are the focus of billions of dollars in pharmaceutical marketing (ie, pharmaceutical companies pay more to get doctors to prescribe their drugs than they do on research and develop of drugs).   Pharmaceutical companies are sued all the time because of this, but they do it anyway because the billions lost in lawsuits are outweighed by the even more billions in sales.  It is disturbing that the doctors are looking at a future prescription. That is a bit medically unsound I feel. You should certainly be aware of statistical risks and her mental state, but it should not be enslaved to doctors' and their hubris.   She feels fine day to day.   Conditioning her to take drugs in this way in anticipation of a future desire to drug her seems a bit disturbing to me.  Some people tolerate the drugs well, but most do not. Remember, if she takes antipsychotics, it should be worth the risk: addiction to the substances (ie, you cannot stop them without causing psychotic symptoms which would not otherwise be there), heart problems, diabetes, and weight gain, not to mention sleep disturbances, movement disorders, and loss of creativity and will power.   People generally do not stop taking the drugs just because they feel better, but because the drugs are usually highly unsatisfactory. Very few people are actually content with the drugs. Those who take them see them as the lesser of two evils."

Should we forbid critisism just because some people might not be able to take it the right way?(I am not implying that you have this view). I don't think so. Voicing criticism and being criticiced is a very important part of being human and being part of a functioning society. At least in my opinion.  Of course there are exceptions to all this but I tend to generally treat people as ""normal at the moment"" by default unless they show clear signs of symptoms of schizophrenia or any other illnes, instead of treating and communicating with everyone like they are on a psychotic episode.  Sometimes it is complicated to judge the mental state of somebody by a few words written on the internet, so I just go by my default assumption most of the time."

schizophrenia,3632g3,Lshrsh,1 point,Sat May 16 19:31:35 2015 UTC,"I'm someone with OCD who has experienced a lot of what your husband has - the fear and ""urge"" of harming someone, driving your car into something etc. These are all signs of severe OCD and anxiety. Psychosis is  accompanied by loss of touch with reality, hallucinations etc. I know you aren't looking for a diagnosis , but I urge your husband to realize he has OCD. Tell me - did this get worse when he realized you  were pregnant? It is very common for these obsessive worries to come about during something like pregnancy. CBT is really good for OCD imo. Encourage your husband to attend every session  -if you don't like your counselor, then find a new one. Don't just just give up on therapy.   I've been through very similar of what your husband is describing he seems to be in a constant state of panic. I remember in October 2013 I was looking up hospitals cause I felt like my mind was racing constantly and that I just couldn't calm down. I did calm down though, and yes, I do still have spikes in OCD type worrying, but I always recover. Please check out a couple of articmes I linked below  http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/11/obsessive-thoughts-a-darker-side-of-ocd/281260/  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anxiety-files/200906/those-damn-unwanted-thoughts"

His psychiatrist has diagnosed him with OCD, but since his hallucinations have gotten worse in the last few weeks, she admitted that ""it's a bit more than just OCD at this point"".  He starts CBT/ERP at the end of the month. That's the earliest they can fit him in."

schizophrenia,3632g3,jkeller4000,1 point,Sat May 16 21:11:56 2015 UTC,"As someone who's been diagnosed with OCD, complex seizures, and depression with psychotic features, I can't help but to respond to your post.   For me personally, I take medication for seizures and find ways to handle the other problems without medication. I will admit, though, I know my OCD would become a nightmare if I was expecting a child while living away from my parents for the first time. (Regardless of whether he feels it or not, this is stressful!!)   I am very curious as to whether or not your husband's medical team has fully explored his potential seizure disorder. Some seizure disorders can very much mimic psychosis, and anti-psych meds won't do much to help it. Also, be wary of anti-psych meds for OCD. Here's a quick read that is rather anecdotal, but may be useful, and here's another read that could be helpful in understanding ways to treat OCD. From the second link:   ""One option is augmenting an SSRI with an antipsychotic. Drug choices include first- or second-generation antipsychotics, but the evidence is stronger for the newer drugs. Studies indicate that 40% to 55% of patients with OCD, after failing to respond to a first treatment, do improve when an antipsychotic is added to an SSRI — although residual symptoms may remain. If one antipsychotic doesn’t work, the APA recommends trying another.  Bear in mind that an antipsychotic used to augment OCD treatment should be prescribed at the lower end of the dosing range. At high doses — or when prescribed alone — antipsychotics may worsen OCD symptoms.""  So... the anti-psychotic may be useful, but it could backfire. And it could backfire bad. Anti-psychs could potentially worsen OCD and worsen seizures. His doctor's approach sounds reasonable, though.   My advice, as someone who's been in his shoes, is to not feed into the fear that he may be schizophrenic. Yes, it's a possibility. But Schiz OCD can be quite debilitating in itself. I have had hallucinations due to seizures and have had obsessions about having schizophrenia that have caused me panic attacks and have caused me to isolate myself, but the most helpful thing for me was to realize that most of my functional limitations were caused by the fact that I was terrified of becoming schizophrenic, and not any sort of actual hallucinations/perceptual distortions I was having (and yes, I was having hallucination/perceptual distortions, but they didn't impact my life like the OCD did).  A word about seizures: it is possible to have a seizure disorder even if you have never had a positive result on an EEG. I have never had a positive EEG test, but I have been diagnosed with complex seizures and the (anti-seizure) medication I'm taking has work wonders. I used to have many ""schizophrenic"" symptoms that disappeared with the meds.  Also, has your husband had any auditory hallucinations? Because tactile and visual hallucinations are much more characteristic of seizures than schizophrenia, if I remember correctly. I'm sorry to push it, but it bothers me that it seems that your husband may be having seizures, but they're not giving him a seizure med, especially since I know that my hallucinations were caused by seizures and went away with anti-seizure meds. His experiences, of course, may be completely different than mine, and I could be wrong, but I think it's super important to know that the combination of seizures and OCD could be causing his ""psychosis."""

The things you hear, and your erroneous assumptions about the world, and your fears (because it can be terrifying to be suddenly in an alternate world...)-- all these things combine to put you in a place where you have trouble figuring out what's real. Imagine becoming so convinced that the ark of the covenant is buried near your house in a construction site, because you are the reincarnation of an ancient jewish holy man, and it was put there for you to find and advance the world! (Recent boyfriend of a friend of mine). Now, imagine struggling to realize every minute or two, that in fact, that's NOT true, but unable to stop the constant talking to you which indicates that 1) it IS true, and you should go dig it up, and 2) you can't actually SAY it's not true, because then, who are we, talking to you in your head? Huh? If none of this is happening, how can you hear us?  It seems to me that 5 minutes of thought, on your part, should provide you with PLENTY of answers for yourself. Perhaps you can figure out what you're being blank on, what assumptions you're making that are stopping you from finding some clarity on questions like why it could be scary, for instance.  What if your apartment complex manager is coming to kill you, right now!!! That wouldn't be scary? Good luck. Then maybe a week later, after hospitalization, you realize you were having an episode. Or maybe you just forced yourself through your day, with the idea that there was a 60% chance that someone was going to shoot you in the head, all morning."

It is not necessarily scary.  But the fact one knows things are not real does not change the experience.  Pain is pain, regardless of injury.    But when you truly know what they say is not real and it's in your head, is it still scary, and why? Thanks   Because everything is in one's head. All sensation and cognition is a function of the brain. Everything you see, hear, feel, etc is a result of your brain.   The lack of an external stimulus does not change anything about the experience.   See an apple allows us to know an apple is present, but it really does not mean that. It means our brain perceives an apple, and that can happen regardless of sensory stimuli.  EDIT: And to add, hallucinations are only one symptom. Other disruptions of thought processes can occur, and the awareness of the objective situation can diminish. After all, it is not easy to be rational when your brain is perceiving threats, ie, why do people react in fear to monster pranks?"

The part that gets me is when the voices say insulting things and they are repeated so often as to not be ignored easily. True fear of the voices comes only when they shout. It is usually abrupt and startling. For example, last time that happened was a few months ago. I was laying in bed, reading, and a voice screamed ""what are you going to do about it???!"" Of course I know that isn't real at all, but in that split second, I jumped and threw my book. The day to day hallucinations I have, like being called a dirty fucking whore when all I'm trying to do is get something out of the fridge, aren't scary, I know they aren't real, but they still suck.   The real fear comes with the cognitive issues like memory problems and speech problems. I fear them getting worse and of experiencing them in public.

I used the commitment to get a place away from my family (homeless).  I told the hospital i was not going to leave unless they let me walk out the doors.  this added about 3 more weeks to the two weeks, they were ready to let me go after 2 weeks if i went back with my grandparents.  but because i told them they have to let me go and be homeless they took an extra 3 weeks to fill out the paper work.       you will get a social worker when you are committed,  if you can use them to get a place away from your family, your own apartment, r maybe group home if you want to be around people. your social worker may help you get that.    this might hurt your parents but it will make them realize commitment does not benefit the mentally ill.  it benefits the business owners who do not want us on their streets.   so do not be afraid, you have lost, no amount of anger nor action will get the commitment process stopped.  you will spend some time in the a state hospital.  all you can do is behave well.  and get out shortly. and use the hospitalization as a tool to get more resources like your own place away from your parents.   the state hospital will not want you to be there if you are well behavied,  and so saying your going to stay until they help you get what ever it is you want, and as long as that request is reasonable they will help you get it.  they have been known to kick people out, however they must un-commit a person before kicking them out.  so you might end up homeless if you listen to me, but you will not be committed. when your homeless."

A problem with your observation would be that the natural progression of symptoms over time would be disrupted by taking drugs. I had major delusions and hallucinations, and now I do not. If I had taken drugs, I would possibly need to talk them to prevent a relapse into those old symptoms.   I realize that waiting for decades for symptoms to change gradually is not something everybody could do, but it is important to realize that the drugs are not cures and can be quite harmful.   One must be fully aware that taking them for a present problem may in fact cause problems in the future.    you'd be a wellspring of excellent, objective observations about various drugs, for others to use as a reference base.

This might just be apart of who you are now.  however what i am also saying, you might enjoy something now that previously you did not enjoy.  finding it may be the hard part because your memories will still make you want to avoid it.    for me, it has been crying, when i watched a sad show a few years ago no tears, nothing, just kinda a oh thats sad, now when i watch a sad so i start getting tears in my eyes.  when i think of something sad i get tears in my eyes.   games. sometimes i get bored of a specific game for a few months and then i can return to it and enjoy it again, but sometimes i never return.  so i will say again,  your preferences can change, you just need to go into the world again and try everything again to find the one thing you will like. I know it sounds very strange. and most may not understand.    with most psych meds. 6 weeks for the meds to make effect and 6 weeks for the meds effect to be completely gone.  if it has been more than 6 weeks this is the new you."

I had trouble walking long distances; my nervous system seemed to dis-integrate in regards to brain/organ command and response. I felt like I was made of cardboard, and like Abilify, akathisia was present as a side effect, but, Haldol makes me want to not move, so the ""nerve popcorn"" just kept doing it's thing if I managed to be motionless.   After Haldol (not hard to go off it by a week of tapering) I felt like I might have Parkinson's symptoms, but that could be a residual effect of substance abuse -especially drinking.   I understand why Haldol is injected when a patient is 1st brought in for involuntary hold. My previous Pdoc told me something about it. Not sure about why ""monthly injections"" work better than 3-5 mg's a day? I had a low dosage during my ""experiment"", but it really did not alleviate hallucinations.   I guess our experiences are different; my anti-dep (200 mgs, daily) seems to alleviate paranoid symptoms (or atleast the need to tell everyone or react with temper tantrums).   I trust medical professionals, so anti-psychotics seem to have a purpose, and some patients seem to find them useful, but I concur with your experience."

The dots are short-lived, visible for a second or less, and traveling short distances along seemingly random, curvy paths. Some of them follow the same path as predecessors. The dots may be elongated along the path like tiny worms. The dots appear in the central field of view, within 10 to 15 degrees from the fixation point.  The left and right eye see different dots; someone looking with both eyes sees a mixture.

That is actually the first time it happened to me. It was neat. Most times i will see something in place of something else.

schizophrenia,35ypd6,schizowritter19,7,Thu May 14 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"Please, anyone with experience of having a loved one who has schizophrenia or anyone who has schizophrenia themselves I would love to hear from, what have been your experience or main questions pertaining to this difficult experience?   The main issue I have seen is that the fact that schizophrenia is a complex disorder with no easy answers seems to cause it to be treated differently.  Schizophrenia:   Affects the mind in ways most people do not realize is possible. Has no known cause. Is unpredictable, although statistics can help, there is no way to know anything about the future of the disorder (ie, a person could have one psychotic episode in their life, or be psychotic forever, starting at any age). Has no cure. Has treatments which can help with some symptoms, some of the time, in some people. This fact is ignored and people think they are cures. They are far from it. There are no easy answers and sticking such powerful drugs into people without a clear reason is more harmful than people realize. Can be frightening or confusing to the person with schizophrenia, or the person may not realize anything is wrong at all.   And the biggest problem I have is that the focus is often on other people.  This Other People Approach to Treatment is harmful. Society, and individuals, are perfectly content to let schizophrenics be homeless, commit suicide, live in squalor, or be victims of crime (including abuse by police officers), or be locked away in prisons against their will (mental hospitals) forever. However, if these people inconvenience others, then they are given a lot of attention, and only to the extent that they do not inconvenience others.  It is essential to consider this. If people treated other medical conditions as they do schizophrenia, the average person would see a bleeding person and their first thought would be that they hope they did not get blood on the carpet.   Schizophrenia is complex, poorly understood, and has no easy answers. That does not change the fact a person has a serious condition they cannot help and may need help.  It is hard on the family, but it is harder on the person with schizophrenia and they would do well to remember that."
schizophrenia,35ypd6,JosephFaolan,2,Thu May 14 23:15:41 2015 UTC,or be locked away in prisons against their will (mental hospitals) forever.   Don't discount actual jail and prison sentences. A lot of people do and just write folks off as criminals. Good summary as always though.
schizophrenia,35ypd6,gayrudeboys,2,Fri May 15 03:35:15 2015 UTC,I used to work at a jail as an officer. I can only vouch for the incredible amount of mental health patients that are put in jail because there is no where else to put them. There is a severe lack of training for jail personel - although I've heard they are starting to train more. Unfortunately a jail is neither the place for help nor a solution for anyone. It's not just dangerous to officers it's incredibly dangerous for someone with Schizophrenia especially when it's not understood right away. It's definitely sad and disheartening to watch.

You are so right."
schizophrenia,35ypd6,keystroker007,3,Mon May 18 23:14:30 2015 UTC,"My first experience was when I was 14/15 yrs old was was with an older brother. I had no clue about mental illness. He went untreated for at least a decade+. Today he takes his meds..he's semi-functional meaning he doesn't work (on disability) lives in a small apartment and is able to somewhat take care of himself. My sister takes him to any doctor appoints etc. I have to wonder that if he'd been treated way back when, if he would better than he is now. Education & awareness is key.  My wife was diagnosed a year ago. Prior to that, her behavior didn't seem like a mental illness to me until she had multiple psychotic breakdowns. When that happened, my heart broke for her. She ended up being admitted three different times in the course of a year & half and finally on the last one I suggested a different medication. I'd done so much research on my own I should have a medical degree. Hindsight is always 20/20 and the more I looked back at the past few years before this happened, I wanted to kick myself in the ass for not recognizing the signs.  Today she is so much better, almost as if it never happened. She takes Cymbalta and Abilify along with thyroid medicine. She had thyroid cancer 4 yrs ago. After her surgery numerous health issues cropped up. I am certain that during this time she started experiencing symptoms of fibromyalgia, which we confused with regulating the proper amount of thyroid medicine. That went one for almost 2 years before she was diagnosed with fibro, everything up to this point I believe contributed to severe depression, which triggered existing PTSD from past abusive relationships, culminating into a psychotic breakdown...oh by the way, her mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia when my wife was around 8 yrs old...so there's that factor too.  I can speak as a husband/caretaker..it fucking drains your soul...it breaks your heart to see someone you love suffer..and there is nothing you can do about it. Families that go through this need support. I suppose I may be a rare case because I had no support, but not everyone's situation is the same. There needs to be a support group for caretakers.  There needs to be a better way of educating the masses on what the symptoms look like and how they may appear to be something else. Mental health issues are a huge problem in the US, but it's not talked about enough..as if it were taboo. There are too many people suffering because of it and the impact it has on families is taking it's toll.  I spent the best 20 yrs of my life in the US Army Infantry (active duty all 20) with numerous deployments and retired in 2011. I even went back over to Afghanistan as a civilian contractor for a little under 2 yrs. With everything I've gone through I should be a statistic, but I guess I'm wired different. Nothing prepared me for what happened to my wife. Her & my kids are my achilles heel.   Good luck with your book and I hope it does help a lot of people."

Something I didn't mention above is that in our family it was my brother, but he happens to be one of the few diagnosed who is incredibly abusive at times.  Society doesn't know how to react or how to help.  Schizophrenia is pushed under the rug as though it is some made up illness to give people a good show in the media.

I felt very upset and alone which caused me to go down the wrong paths in life and that end up back in the hospital.

This is such a complicated illness that might be one disorder or a group of multiple disorders where the causes are still unknown. This is a hard illness to describe to others as doctors still don't know everything about it. They just group people based off a range of symptoms that are observed. There is no biological marker for this illness.   That being said, I hope you make aware in your book that people with schizophrenia vary a lot, dispel the myths, and PROVIDE HOPE. Provide examples of people doing well. I think both family members and most importantly the person that's diagnosed needs that."

schizophrenia,35ypd6,Kristouph,2,Sat May 16 15:34:51 2015 UTC,The only two questions burning on my mind are why me? and Will my kids get it?
schizophrenia,35ypd6,gerbilista,2,Fri May 15 03:26:06 2015 UTC,"Other commenters have offered some valuable perspective, but as a long-term psychotic, who was only diagnosed ""properly"" about 5.5 years ago, I learned that ""outsider"" perspectives are honest (sometimes) but flawed attempts to understand what psychotic folks experience on a day to day basis.  Around the age of 8-9 years old, I ""broke"", and that was related to a fusion of my perception regarding reality, and my already powerful imagination/interior ""child world"".Later I was classified as ""mildly retarded"" by having to repeat the 8th grade; I was prone to catatonic stupor and early understanding about Attention Deficit was not the issue. My mind was ""defective"" in how I coped with ""reality"", and thus I was consistently labelled as ""immature"", a ""latebloomer"" or just plain ""retarded"".   Late 70's/early 80's did not feature widespread, public positioning of kids on the autistic spectrum (Aspergers) but I was clearly autistic/psychotic, not to mention developing character/conduct disorders from an early age which are now latent sociopathic, anti-social traits as part of my whole diagnosis/mental health profile.   At the time of my ""break"", I was still rightfully a ""child"", but even before that, I was not a ""normie"" in regards to early signs, and the abuse I experienced. I really did not have a chance to develop as a fundamentally ""right"" person; family dysfunction is important as a cause, but now it's my responsibility to work on being ""human"", and accept psycho-education regarding thoughts, feelings, actions.  If I do not actively maintain ""personhood"" I will regress into that ""9 year old psychotic"". The difference between myself and ""normies"" is that the latter do not have to work on ""personhood"" on the same level.  It's not a ""new lifestyle""; we are not one person before diagnosis or episodes, and then another person after ""recognition"". We develop into what we are today, and what we might become in the future. I know nothing else but psychosis, as well as depression as a constant mental state with variable intensity and consequences:   There is no ""before and after"" as if suddenly a weird looking mole appears on my skin.  I don't play games with my ""diseases"". I want to stay out of ""supervised care"" of one sort or the other, especially segregation within a correctional facility. Thankfully, I experienced the mentorship of strong males who ""fathered"" me in a way where I practice daily CBT exercises, as well as mindfulness, to maintain personality.  I never had my own personality: up until about 2-3 years ago, I simply acted as a chameleon, adopting, absorbing, narcissistically leeching off people, places, situations, and things as a way of being ""me"". There was no actual ""self"", I could not ""be myself"" because there was nothing there, no ""inner child"" to recover, no root to grow a new stem from.   I suggest M.Scott Peck's ""People of the Lie"" as deeply insightful; he uses the term ""autistic"" as a classical analog to ""psychotic"" or ""schizophrenic"", and the common quality of all 3 is chronic withdrawal from reality, difficulty with normal, common functioning. Peck's book is about ""evil"" people, and not all psychotics/autistics are purposefully ""evil""; we have behaviors which try the patience of others, and therefore some of us are closely associated with sociopathy. If we have brain injuries from birth or childhood, we might be labelled as psychopaths within the new DSM category of ""anti-social personality disorder""."

schizophrenia,35ypd6,Nachthauch,1 point,Sat May 16 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for sharing! May I ask what your ""proper"" diagnosis is? Aside from what I've described above about my sons symptoms you have described a lot of how we saw his behavior the past 3 years. We are moved from one diagnosis to another, new meds, we as parents and family are doing our best to provide a stable, even, loving home. No surprises, no changes, rules are the same with lots of consistency. But for the longest time (up until the voices) I was leaning to psychopathy. I say this because he has a severe lack of empathy and feelings. When I read:  I never had my own personality: up until about 2-3 years ago, I simply acted as a chameleon, adopting, absorbing, narcissistically leeching off people, places, situations, and things as a way of being ""me"". There was no actual ""self"", I could not ""be myself"" because there was nothing there, no ""inner child"" to recover, no root to grow a new stem from. It made me cringe and shiver. We call him a social chameleon. There is no ""person"" there is only what he thinks you want. He is the master of manipulation and I wish nothing more for him than to become someone. His own person. The only motivation he has is materialistic and food and even that obviously doesn't fill the deep void and need in him. It breaks my heart that I can't seem to help. As I said above... we have new meds and he is trying and working hard with us to stabelize and it's like having a different kid. BUT I am aware that it may go away as quick as it happened. Any advice for a family that is really trying?"
schizophrenia,35ypd6,Nachthauch,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:14:25 2015 UTC,"Looks like you are providing the basics. ""Trying"" to do more is where your son will be able to behave dysfunctionally by seeing your ""moves"" before you make them.  Do less; do the minimum required by law in regards to your legal status as a parent.   ""Psychopath"" and ""sociopath"" are both on spectrums, and they are also different in how psychopathy is related to brain defects while sociopathy derives from environment. Also, anti-social personality disorder, along with other personality disorders with similar (co-morbid) features, are the new designation for ""psychopathy/sociopathy"" (as far I can tell) and this means your son is not a complete monster or something like that.   Even Hannibal Lector may have treated patients in a normal way and they each went their separate ways when the therapy was done. As a sociopathic person, I am not completely lost to the ""dark side"". Put away the fictional associations perpetuated by entertainment media. Observe your son as a clinical scientist would.  If your son is nearing the age of 18, legally he is becoming his own entity, and a parent must begin to let go of the child, even to the point of expelling the child from the household if that child threatens the common good of the family. It's harsh, but it has to be done.    Stop trying to fix what is beyond your jurisdiction: even if the child is still young enough to be under the legal authority of the parent, the parent's duty is to provide the ""basics"" as well as what emotional support can be offered to a mentally challenged son or daughter. Ask yourself what you must do everyday as mandatory duties, and then what can be put in ""column b"" as optional. Don't let anyone else tell you what those duties are except for a mental health professional. Even then, the advice may be optional, and you can take it or leave it."

I cannot talk to the people I live with because I hear them spying on me :(    I do not want to talk to strangers because they will know I am crazy :(  But I like most humans want to be validated, want someone to say its going to be ok, I will never ask for it because i am too afraid of them insulting me for being weird.  so what i am saying, be there, talk to your family member, take them out in public to a safe place do not make a scene (i have an aunt who i will not go out in public with because she will complain about something every time and it is really embarrassing).  like coffee once a week or once a month.  make it seem like it is your idea, ""i really want a cup of coffee but need someone to come with, will you?""  it might take a while to find the right phrase that will get them to say yes.   however this just might be me, and maybe no one else has this problem.  but a few therapists have said everyone wants more friends. so maybe this advice would be how to help anyone in the entire world.  but this would be what i need right now."

That's true. What isn't real (they SAY) that I remember is standing in a circle and passing the ball and saying something about yourself so you and everyone else get to know each other.   You can't even imagine how bad the memory of humans realy is, even of completely healthy ones. Memory is a combination of many things like facts,emotions,prejudice,other memories, and lots of other stuff. And when the memory is old than its pretty normal that people who were in the same situation have different memories of it all after a long time. In your specific example it could be because this ball game is commen place when a group meets for the first time, so the memory of this is associated with meeting new people and than your mind fools you.   Then there are mirrors and beds. It's hard to look in a mirror because I KNOW I'll see something behind me.......

Schizophrenia is an insidious disorder because there are no easy answers.  It affects mental processes in a way which most people never realize can be impaired.   I would not judge him when he is psychotic (I am sure you do not as well), however, when he is well, he can be held accountable. If he will not recognize the pattern of his disorder or will ignore the real problems it is causing with him and his relationship with his family and you, then he should be held accountable to that.   But I know in a few days John is going to calm down and then beg for me back. He will take the bus to the apartment. He will probably stalk me for a while. I have to be strong and ignore him and his manipulation. His promises and his bullshit.    This is a critical time. When he calms down and thinks clearly, you should present your concerns to him. He is doing these things and it is affecting you (and others), and you know that it is not his fault. But, since he is not doing these things now, what is he going to do?  He needs to set up a Mental Health Advanced Directive (or talk to a lawyer, doctor, or mental health advocate) about what to do when he is not dangerous, but exhibiting such symptoms.   If he wants to take medication which works, but will fail to do so when his mental state changes, he can let it be known that it is his wish to be treated.  Here is a possible form to use, but it may vary according to your jurisdiction: http://www2.nami.org/Content/Microsites59/NAMI_of_Southwest_Louisiana/Home56/Resources12/Advance_Directive_for_Mental_Health.pdf  If, when he is calm and thinking clearly, he refuses to take measures to manage this disorder, then that is a major issue."

schizophrenia,35pxfd,Necritica,1 point,Wed May 13 00:09:23 2015 UTC,"I've been taking clozapine for 16 months now. It's amazing, well worth getting into the program and all the side tests and maintenance it requires. I am not even on a very high dosage, 300 mg a day. Before it I tried Risperdal, Solian, Seroquel and Zyprexa. Risperdal and Solian gave me severe akathisia, Seroquel just wasn't powerful enough. Zyprexa was second best, but it gave me an annoying extra-pyramidal tremor (basically caused a restless leg syndrom) and I'd still hear voices from time to time.   About a month after I reached 300mg I noticed how much it helps me - no more hallucinations, recovered a big chunk of my ability to concentrate, helped balance the affect, paranoid thoughts are practically gone, more social, able to withstand difficult situations without going psychotic and more.   Side effects I suffer from are tiredness and need to sleep more (I usually won't be able to pull through a work day without at least 7 hours of sleep) and it takes several hours to fully wake up - but on the bright side it helps you to fall asleep. Used to knock me unconscious 20-30 minutes withing ingestion, nowadays it doesn't hit me that hard, but it still helps me to fall asleep. The other side effect is hypersalivation during sleep, I pretty much wake up in a puddle of drool every day, and it takes my body several hours to compensate and thus I can't really eat solid food until a couple hours after I wake up.  Overall? It has a lot of potential side effects and you have to be organized and take all the test, be with your hand on the pulse, and odds are it'll do wonders. It did for me. If you have more questions, feel free to ask."

schizophrenia,35pxfd,Necritica,1 point,Wed May 13 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! As for delusions, well, it kind of depens what you mean by the word. If the definition you go with is holding a certain belief with conviction even with evidences to the contrary, I didn't really experience delusions. I am, by nature, a very skeptical person. That, and combined with low self esteem usually mean I am not very adamant in opinions and thoughts, and open to criticism of them and able to alter them when things don't make sense. In fact, this is probably the part that saved me; eventually I figured the voices I hear can't be real, because no one else could hear them and I'd often hallucinate with no visible cause to the voices. Being stuck in a nightmare, but knowing its a dream. A dream you can wake up of. And then I sought help."

Apparently there are no clinical or laboratory tests for mental illness, but researchers can collect data about behaviors/environmental conditions and produce models/axioms/paradigms which make up the current DSM; I assume that is why it has to be updated so much.  In short, I am just plain clinically psychotic, and even autistic in how it was understood 100 years ago. In regards to your post, it's clear that I am unable to function normally in society, hold down a position, or participate in common social activities.

It depends on the environment, as well.

Now that you bring it up I am afraid to drop the nicotine level in my ejuices. As for worrying about what you said in the past about being medication free, I wouldn't pay it much mind. The past is the past and the best we can do is learn from it. I've done a lot of stupid shit in the past and if I were to hold onto it, those past mistakes could wind up making my present worse than it really needs to be. Granted I still sometimes worry about the past but over time I have learned to worry about it less and focus on learning from it when the past does come to mind. You have an additional challenge here as you have seemingly built up a bit of a delusion surrounding your conception of self, but if you work with mental health professionals to find a way to manage your delusions this should become easier. A lesson I might propose you could learn from this is that there are many ways to perceive things and sometimes a lack of information can lead to unrealistic conclusions. That doesn't mean you are bad for your past actions, you were merely looking at things from a subjective point of view where you hadn't accounted for all factors. I do this a fair bit myself in my interactions with other people but so long as I allow myself to learn from those mistakes and help build a world view where my mind is open to all possibilities, I feel the past while I might worry about it at times did ultimately serve a positive purpose.

I once thought that everyone hated me, but wanted to worship me like a god, and that is why they hated me. Through CBT exercises, I reduced that level down to 70 percent, and I modified the thought pattern to include people who I have clear memories of.   My reddit username is not just a joke about encyclopedia dramatica's excessive use of the term; I am in fact a ""psycho (sick) fuck"". All my offenses are in the past though, I have done my time in a prison of my own making.  My Pdoc thinks I can operate in society, face to face, but it's very difficult. Human beings are ""noise"" to me, and I tolerate ""in real life"" contact when I am obligated to do so.   I love myself no matter what, but that is just a result of mindfulness practice, and experiences of unity with ""me"" where acceptance became forgiveness.   I avoid social contact because conversations lead to intimacy, and if people actually discover my offenses, then there will be some real backlash. In politically correct circles, I am a ""monster"", but in rational circles, with balanced views about human experience, I am morally rehabilitated, and fit to receive authority and trust."

Its not easy but on the right medication regimen things will be more stable, and I am guessing your relationship would not suffer as much. I too am very quick to point out flaws in a person and am often irritable. I never use to be this way, I guess it's probably either part of the illness or a result of chronic suffering. It really sucks to have this and not have someone.. so my first thought is not to dump her right away, but if things do not improve, then I guess you have to. I would try to make sure she is properly medicated and take it from there. Anyone of those illnesses alone can ruin a person, and when you have all three well - she probably suffers a lot. The best thing you can do is make sure she has the best treatment possible, and if things don't work out - well #life.  Cheers."

Not counting my doctors, Social Security employees, etc who needed to know for official purposes, I have only told my mother (and only after a long time), one of my sisters, and an old teacher I had years ago.  My mother suspected, but initially speculated the slightly wrong diagnosis (someone in her family has Schizoaffective Disorder), and my sister knew the details of my problems long before I revealed the diagnosis, so it was just a word to describe what she knew I experienced.  Other than that, it is not something I would think one should reveal because the word ""schizophrenia"" has too much misunderstanding that revealing it can be counter-productive.

As for the internet, I try to show articulation and share the story in a coherent, relatable way, and the feedback is almost always positive.

These drugs are very powerful and can have major effects on a person and it is critical they are carefully monitored. There is no reason to pay for drugs (especially expensive ones like Abilify) which do not have a clear benefit to you.  I would not recommend discontinuing drugs on your own, but since you were taking them on your own, I do not know what the best thing to do would be.   Now I'm just trying to sort myself out but I'm wondering if my psychiatrist actually just prescribed me placebos and I don't actually have schizophrenia,    You did not think you needed drugs and you do not realize how different your experiences are. I have had schizophrenia since early childhood and I simply do not know what it is to be normal, therefore, I have a very hard time appreciating how different I am.   I feel like such a failure.   You are at a critical time in life, the beginning of adulthood. If you had previously unrecognized (or fully recognized) differences, it is possible that you will experience new problems in life related to circumstances.  However, it is not your fault.   I keep trying to ask for help but I don't know what kind of help I want and no one is able to support me in the way I know I need. I do feel like a fraud.   Contact a local mental health advocacy service in your area if you can.   I guess I just needed to get this down into words, but any comments or suggestions are more than welcome. This is such a wonderful community and I'm always glad I'm a part of it.   We are happy to have you here and I hope it all works out for you.

It can be difficult to conceptualize such experiences in a way which is easy for others to understand, but what you described could be consistent with several psychotic states.  Just because you do not recognize any hallucinations, that does not mean you do not have schizophrenia. That is only one of five possible diagnostically significant symptoms. No individual symptom is necessary for the diagnosis."
schizophrenia,35lt9z,JosephFaolan,3,Mon May 11 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"It's a simple as this: schizophrenia is simply a group of symptoms in which doctors have found a specific type of medication to have a positive effect in function.  It doesn't matter so much that you match all the symptoms, just that the meds help you live a normal life.  Meds like Abilify might help get your breaks from everyday reality under control.  You seem to have a good sense of whether you're in or out of the common reality, so you might be a good judge of this.  It's easy to go off the rails though, so someone you can talk to backing you up always helps.  Just remember that everyone needs help sometimes.  I thought I had my disease under control until I missed MY finals a couple years ago.  Meds are a good route to go down if you're having troube with seeing reality like neurotypical (""normal"") people.  Some suggestions for you: find a community mental health organization.  They can direct you to affordable services used by people with little or no insurance.  Go on a cheaper, off patent med.  You save a lot of money (while potentialy sacrificing energy and well-being) on the cheaper, generic meds like seroquil.  They will get your symptoms under control but you might not like the side affects.  Anything's worth a try to get life back on track though, and initial side affects may go away with time.  Stop doubting your diagnosis.  Your symptoms fitting the label of schizophrenia isn't the big issue here, you just need to get into a state where you can complete school and live a normal life.  If the schizophrenia meds help you do that who cares if you have a ""classic case"" of it?  Give your meds a chance.  Take them as prescribed and see if you get better.  It might take a couple weeks even.  But meds are the most proven way of getting better, don't let doubts get in the way of you taking them.  Be patient.  Good luck and I think I speak for anyone replying to you when we say please post again if you have any troubles at all!!"

There are some schizophrenics who have a difficult time with this. I know I did. I do not want to be hospitalized for life, under the control of doctors and nurses, therefore I work on my brain as best I can.  Some of us have to relearn basic things on a consistent basis. It's fine. It's what we are working with.   Progress happens, it is possible. You can help yourself right now by looking at your post and determining what is important; what do I have control over?

While it was disappointing to do as previously I was used to hearing the voice/voices of a particular deity/beings and believed I was a channel, psychic, etc. I do now feel that I am a bit more grounded in mundane reality. Your theory on the doc and the placebo med reminds me of myself in a psychotic state. Be safe. Be well. You are not fake/faking it.  I test myself and my thoughts frequently and try to really stay focused on what is definitely real. If I have an idea or theory about something, I sit with it and consider it (sometimes for days on and off) and also consider other alternative ideas. I am not 100% okay at all but I have not been caught kissing someone imaginary at the park lately either. ;-)   I am not on medication (I had a bad experience with haldol) but do see a psychologist.

My strategy with my brother is basically to tell him I love him, don't argue at all, and mostly keep him away from my kids (he pulled my son aside one day and told him that he'd killed people in the past.) In this situation, it seems less important for me to try to drill the truth into his brain, and more important for him to know there's someone in his life that's there for him. Me and Mom.

He is labeled disorganized, yet he is able to do everything normally or even better, such as playing chess and other board games, he finds all my hiding spots for things such as my money and items that he wants. Also he is so eager to share what he is seeing and hearing, and it's usually something about his ""females"", and perverted nonsense (though he has had no contact with females). Also when it comes to cutting the grass or doing work around the house, he can't do it.. but when it comes to stealing things or ordering us to buy things for him or asking for cigarettes he can't be stopped, or else he gets violent. He's an asshole, and a pervert; and sorry for being ignorant, but I'm sick of him. Is there anything we can do about him? I don't want him here anymore. He says he loves his voices and seems so happy about them, which I find crazy to believe, he has broken our family.. and continues to do so. Is there anyway to prove if he's faking it?"
schizophrenia,35eqxl,VulpesVulpesFox,2,Sat May 9 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"I can't really say anything about whether he's faking or not. In any case, I'm sorry that you and your family had to go through all of this. You feeling tired of him, even angry, is completely understandable and actually pretty common. So don't feel guilty. You can only handle what you can, and a family member's illness could very well be where the limit is. It's not your fault. (Though you need to remember, it might not be your brother's fault either.)  What kind of care is he receiving? Could you maybe discuss his condition with his doctors? They could be able to give more insight into this, whether it's him being actually schizophrenic or something else.   I don't think him ""loving"" the voices he hears indicates lying. The illness could just as easily make him feel that.   The more interesting thing is that if he has been receiving care (which he should), his condition and hallucinations should have gotten better, not worse. Of course, that's not always that easy, and that in itself isn't suspicious. It doesn't often go very smoothly, but some progress usually is to be expected, if there hasn't been any incidents nor complications.  You didn't say what age you are?  Maybe start with making sure he takes his medication and meets his doctors or whatever is ""prescribed"" for him. I'm just thinking that if he's faking, he might not really be eating his drugs or doing other things he should. (Although, he could just as well be avoiding those things while suffering from the illness. Watch out for his condition. Does it remain static whether or not he takes his meds? Does he deteriorate depending on the use of his meds?)  Could you talk about your concerns with his doctor? Perhaps there is a facility he might stay at for a while? (But if so, please make sure it's a reputable and trustworthy facility!)  And BTW, have you considered talking to a therapist yourself? Probably your whole family would benefit from that, either together or separately. I don't think you're being unreasonable or anything, no matter what the truth is, it'd do you good."
schizophrenia,35eqxl,VulpesVulpesFox,1 point,Sun May 10 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"He is receiving aid from the psychiatrist only currently, and we started therapy a week ago. We've talked about the issue with the psychiatrist, but they don't really pay attention to it. He has really not shown no progress over the course of three years, and at the beginning of his illness, we were told that he told his friend, ""I enjoy getting all the attention"". I'm 17 years, I have a 19 year old sister, a 6 year old brother, a mom and dad (never divorced), and my brother who is 21 in june. He has been taking his medication as far as we know, but during the first week of him getting the medication 3 years ago, he use to throw it out without us knowing til we caught him. We also feel as if the higher the dose on any medication, he gets worse (stated from mom). He has been to some facilities, due to being overly aggressive, and the facilities say he is a really nice kid, and he is actually believing what he hears.. i'm not sure if they're the best facilities though.. and therapy is a bit pricey in our current situation."
schizophrenia,35eqxl,Uberhip,2,Sun May 10 00:40:01 2015 UTC,You are very young. It is unfair that your brother's problems make your life so much harder. You shouldn't need to be responsible for taking care of a grown up man. Especially since his parents are on the case.   So could you maybe try to just leave the thing alone? Don't think about your brother or do anything about it when possible. Let your parents handle it. Focus on yourself and your school.  Maybe you could figure out a way for you to live away from your brother? With a relative or something? Or get you your own apartment?

Distance in time and proximity has helped me a lot as far as my compassion for her. If you are all living together I can totally understand your frustration!
schizophrenia,35eqxl,BlankUsername42,2,Sat May 9 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well, at least I'm not the only one. I can honestly say I hate him.. even before he got sick. He did so much drugs, and was a lazy bum. He was given everything, he is the eldest. He got a brand new expensive truck, and a job with my dad in construction, but he threw it all away, my dad got rid of the truck since he would steal it to go do drugs with his ""friends"" that forgot about him, and the few times he did work with him, all he did was complain about how hot and hard it was even though he would just stand there. I'm stuck here fucking upset, we had to move from my town I was happily going to school in because he would sneak out and do drugs, my parents got into debt trying to find a magical cure for him. How can someone be so naive? Mental illness didn't ruin him, and it's no excuse.. he chose the route.. yet I have to deal with his outcome? I'm afraid of him, he gets aggressive. Anyways can I ask, how/what is your sister doing now? and your family?"
schizophrenia,35eqxl,Cedrichendrix92,1 point,Sun May 10 00:20:59 2015 UTC,"I had those same feelings about my sister. She did a lot of psychedelics for years before her first psychotic break and I wouldn't be surprised if they pushed her over the edge. She also seemed to be lazy, careless, and thoughtless. I wonder now if those qualities are a symptom of the disease.  She had threatened family members with knives and would also get very upset and scary, similar to your brother. Eventually she set fire to my parents house and ended up institutionalized for a decade in a state run metal hospital. This turned out to be a good outcome for my parents, in that it gave them a much needed break from the stress and fear, but I really don't know if it helped my sister beyond providing her with a safe environment and got her in touch with a helpful social worker.  She is out now, living in a group home that is supervised by a psychiatric nurse. She has a part time job in the day and a boyfriend. If she stays away from drugs and predatory characters perhaps she'll be okay. Also, her delusions are more under control and she has learned to deal with her illness more gracefully, which makes it much less scary for her family. I am hopeful, as everyone deserves a chance!  I have to say, moving away and having my own life really helped me forgive some of her behavior. It sounds like you are stuck with your brother at the moment, and that immediacy can make everything a sibling does infuriating. I feel for you, hang in there! You are not alone. This is happening in families all over the world. Do you have a trusted friend you can talk to?"
schizophrenia,35eqxl,sikfoq,2,Sun May 10 11:33:00 2015 UTC,"Holy, that sounds so similar to my situation.. I feel as if him staying in a state hospital will have a better outcome than him being here and continuing his terrible habits. How did your parents deal with letting go of her, and did they visit or talk during the 10 years? and yes I am stuck here, usually alone. I don't really have much friends, and the ones I do.. I don't really trust."
schizophrenia,35eqxl,equivilency101,1 point,Sun May 10 13:19:34 2015 UTC,"My parents didn't have a choice about letting her go because after the fire department was needed to save their house, the District Attorney got involved and prosecuted my sister, even though my parents didn't want that. It was an upsetting time. Jail, etc.  The first few years they would drive 45 minutes each way to visit her several times a week. After a while she was allowed out for short jaunts, so they would take her to a park or somewhere low key and not well populated. Occasionally out to eat, but that had the potential to be embarrassing or worse if my sister was out of sorts. Then she was allowed to come home for the weekends, so they'd pick her up on Friday afternoon and deliver her back to the hospital on Sunday. This was a a long process and involved much working with the social worker and doctors in order to get permission. Most of those poor souls at the hospital lived there day in and day out with no visitors or hope for years. Very sad.  I think the hospital was really best for those of us who are well. It was like a big holding tank for people whose illness is not under control. I was amazed at this, but there were people much sicker than my sister there, also real criminals, which was scary. I know my sister was a criminal too, but she paid for her crime by spending weeks in a burn ward and getting skin grafts for the terrible burns she got due to the fire.  Life is hard! I would be happy to talk to you."

I feel like the more we wait, it's just waiting for him to do something deadly similar to your sister setting fire to the house. Last time he got picked up by the fire department was because he threw a fit that he was going to murder someone and left the house. I feel like it will be one of us (i feel bad saying that), I also know that he is perverted in the mind, and I can't let go of the constant worry that he might do something inappropriate to my brother, or even my mom.. he's a REALLY strong guy, hate to admit it..but he is, he broke my uncles jaw, but no one pressed charges.

schizophrenia,35eqxl,colorlessnoob,1 point,Sun May 10 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"Hey it has been a while, you popped up in my head today due to an incident that happened. I'm not sure if you're interested, and by all means you don't have to reply, but I just wanted to tell someone about what just happened.  My schizophrenic brother spent two weeks in the hospital, and recently got picked up Monday because the discharge lady, and nurses said he was stable. They lied, or he somehow tricked them. Today is when my brother finally snapped (reminded my of how your sister did too). Everyone was minding their own business, and my mom (the one who can barely live without him, for some reason) left with my 6 year old brother to tee-ball.  I thank god they left.   It was just me 17f, my sister and her bf 19f/m, and dad 42m, just details (maybe I'll look at this some time down the years).   Now to what happened, my brother attacked my dad and punched him hard two times in the jaw (luckily not knocked out), then another punch later on. My sister quickly went between them (I admire the bravery, I was cowering in the back with a knife incase, even though I know I wouldn't use it). My sister was on the phone with 911, while she was on the phone he was about to punch her, and I know it would have been lights out for her, he's very strong. My dad pushed her into a room before he had the chance, and my dad went in there as well.   I turned around and went through the front door ready to jump in the car , but didn't. He came after me, calling me I knew he was going to try and hit me. I ran down the driveway, and my dad got worried about me and was already out the door holding a big stick in case, thank god. (he told the cops later on that he wanted to knock my dad down, then knock us afterwards).   Cops came as which it felt an eternity, but they took him away, I pray to God it's for good he's cause so much fright in me countless times. I am no angel, I know that for sure, I may have deserved to get punched by him, because I find it hard to tolerate him, but I just can't help it.   The reason he got riled up we believe is because he isn't allowed to smoke cigarettes anymore, it has been 3 weeks since he hasn't, also because we told him to get a job. But he also mention, my dad stole his girlfriends, while my brother has never had a gf.   The only problem is now my mom is all ready to go see him, and possibly try to bring him back. I think it's better to lose contact with him, because he already stated that he just wants to be taken care of, he wanted to go to a ""nursing home for the mentally ill"", how crazy is that? I don't understand how someone could do that. I'm happy everyone is for the most part fine, my dad is a little hurt, but he didn't dare raise his hand towards my brother even though he rightfully could've to defend himself. How is the situation with your sister now-a-days if it's ok to ask?"

I would ask a mental health professional about ""character disorders"" or ""personality disorders"". These are psychiatric categories which have replaced ""sociopathic"". Psychopathy also integrates into updated categories like ""personality disorders"" (ASPD) but is also a matter of neurology because of the brain trauma/birth defects which may induce lifelong psychopathic behavior.  I have had psychotic symptoms and behavior patterns since childhood, as well as depression, character and conduct disorders which got me in serious trouble. I know your brother because I had a similar effect on my family and neighborhood.  In college, people called me out, exposed me as ""f*cked in the head"", and whatever part of me that was ""sane, good"" eventually began to gain strength through a long series of events culminating in a 6 day hold in a psych unit; 7 years later, and I am free of alchohol, other substances, and my behavior is moderated by medication, CBT exercises, and regular contact with a psychiatric doctor.   I am still ""sociopathic"", permanently in a state of low level depression/anxiety, and psychosis is always present. I have to adjust to reality on a daily basis through CBT(cognitive behavior therapy) by asking simple questions about how valid my thoughts are. If I don't do the ""work"", then prison, mental hospitals or an early grave are my options.   Your brother can be re-educated in how to be a human; professional, formal intervention is required IMO."

If I am really delusional, I seem to pick up on hidden meanings of my own interpretation in the song. Also songs become out of context.  Before my psychotic break, I would hate to listen to bassy music. Now I enjoy bass fullfilling type of songs with headphones on. EDM is my music of choice.  I also experience how my hearing would break down, similar to coming off of a psychotic break. This would lead to my hearing becoming less sensitive as well as not being able to process language properly. I have since been taking dietary supplements that seems to be helping with maintaining neuron connection for hearing so I can listening to music for alot longer before I noticing any signs of hearing changes.   Yes, music invokes memories that are intertwined with the times of when the music was listen to.

I remember 2 decades ago, doing some recording on the piano, then listening to the recordings, and how the gloomy rainy day, my narcissistic focus on my playing (somber, minor key/atonal noodling) sparked a repeating voice which was not ""in"" my brain but ""surrounding it"":   ""...difficulties...having difficulties...difficulties...""  I don't remember any auditory hallucinations before that point, and since then, no experience with music has produced them, yet in the past 26 years, I have been witness to how my own mind seems to be ""talking to me"" or in a severe psychotic episode, my body/nervous system is an antenna. I don't think it's ""crazy"" to say that either if I consider certain facts about how objects are magnetic.  Sound is hypnotic, and I think our subconscious will rise out of it's ""basket"" like a ""cobra""; that image of a Hindu fakir is related to Kundalini Yoga in how primal ""god consciousness"" or ""prajna"" spirals it's way out of our lower ""chakras""(basket) like a ""cobra"" and dwells in our mind as ""enlightened knowledge"" (Gnana Yoga).  For those of us with ""psychotic depression"" listening to ""sad songs"" is common because we need their ""power"", we absorb ""energies"" from the environment, and thus we can see why huge electronic music festivals are popular, or why group assemblies for listening to music are historically important. Music tunes a crowd to a similar frequency, and so ecstatic collectivity mutates individuals; they leave the venue ""changed"" and associate the gathering with mostly ""positive vibes"". However, if someone takes the ""brown acid"", well, the ""primal fear"" of the collective saturated their nervous system, and they ""short circuited""?  Also, alot of pop songs marketed as ""love songs"" are secretly ""gospel songs"", if you listen to Whitney Houston, the lyrics are easily understood if you think about how she is singing to Jesus. It is not too far fetched considering her Gospel background.  Roberta Flack's ""...the 1st time..."", the ballad from ""Play Misty For Me"", was a song I wanted the church band to play for my baptism, and even now as an apostate, if I hear the song, I get sentimental about the long list of ""mystical experiences"" I thought I was having regarding my fiancee ""Jesus"" (the Bridegroom).

Unfortunately, as you know, treatment is very difficult to get even when it is available and effective.  For her head, brain tumors are not evident externally (ie, it would not cause a bump). Also, the skull has natural bumps on it so it may be coincidence. And it could just be part of the hallucination.   Again, sorry for the long post, but does anyone have any advice, or has been in a similar situation and could provide some information as to what to do, or what we can do to get her the aid that she needs?   You can probably work to convince her to get a physical complaint checked by a doctor. Assure her that you just want to make sure she is safe and to see what is going on with her sensations.  Anything which causes pain, discomfort, depression, or anxiety, could be used to convince her to get checked out.  Addressing psychotic symptoms directly should be avoided, because what she is experiencing is real to her."

Probably just a coincidence then, since my aunt (who is not schizophrenic) said it was a bump.  I'm not too sure how well convincing her to go to a doctor for a physical reason would work; she more or less refuses to see any kind of doctor.

It is a mental disorder classified by symptoms (not causes). So the early signs are not specific to schizophrenia.  However, there are prodromal signs of schizophrenia, although not everyone will have them. It would be impossible to really recognize them if you had any depression or anything already.  Depression itself can result in psychotic symptoms as well.   I have depression and am paranoid I'm going to end up schizophrenic as well.    If you are an adult, then I would think you have gotten your mental health concerns already evident.  Do not drive yourself crazy about going crazy.

But, ahh, anyway. You're smart enough to understand self-fulfilling prophesy, and the same probably could have been said of me. You have to find a way to look forward. You may not think you want to, but that's pretty much your mind-body's job, and the more you accommodate your incarnation, the more pleasant your incarnation is. Think out of the box, and let your chains become your new freedoms. It's a huge world. You could save to go to China and work in a bar in the River district of Beijing. You could do anything. I can practically see you in your 40s and 50s, looking back on your teens and thinking, damn.  Best to you, my young friend.  Hey-- If you are worried about a dark fate, then every single tiny bit of that worry, is because you value life and light. If you didn't care,-- then you wouldn't care. But you DO care. And really, that's what you're probably supposed to be doing. You may think you don't give a shit, but that's just being cool, because if you really didn't give a shit, you wouldn't be worried or concerned or posting. You give a shit.

There really aren't preliminary signs you can spot to say someone will go on to develop the disorder. Some people can be in the prodromal phase for years before developing the full blown disorder. Some people can randomly develop it over the course of a few days. The prodromal symptoms are just signs that are documented that people experience while the disorder is beginning to manifest but many of these symptoms overlap with many other disorders. No one can say conclusively who will or will not develop the disorder. Best thing to do is not worry about it. Even if you develop it, it's just a label. It doesn't define you as a human being and many schizophrenics have made major contributions to our society."

You're more likely to never have schizophrenia ever than to come down with it now in your life. That's not to say your life can't get worse but schizophrenia probably wont be the outcome. Whatever your taking antidepressants for try starting there and seeing where you are with those symptoms. If you have depression is it under control? Anxiety and paranoia kind of go hand in hand.

There is your answer: do not drive yourself crazy about the possibility of going crazy because there is nothing you can do about that.   Actually, you can:   Exercise Be healthy Make preparations medical emergencies including mental health (ie, prepare a plan for when you are medically unable to make choices for yourself).

I stated that hearing ""voices in my head"" was not a symptom.  The distinction between hearing something and hearing it in your head indicates it is not a hallucination because hallucinations are perceived as sensory experiences, not loud or intrusive thoughts.  A person may recognize hallucinations and their origin, but hallucinations alone are not perceived as being from one's head.   source: I work in schizophrenia research   I have schizophrenia and I can assure you that hallucinations are not internal experiences."

For my mother, for myself, and at least a dozen other people I've been friends with. I could always tell the difference between ""someone"" saying something to me ""out loud"" and ""someone else"" saying something to me ""in my head"". So could my mother, who had both experiences as well. She ""knew"" when I couldn't hear something that was ""said"" because it was said to her (for instance, all the thousands of people who believe in governmental mind control, or who think they are experimental subjects who are differentiated from others because things are spoken ""just to them""). She also often thought I heard other things that were ""said"", because she thought they were said ""out loud"".  Delusions of grandeur because of some sort of selective communication, are not... uh.. uncommon (whatever that means in this context...) in my experience.  Doing schizophrenia research is a great way to talk to many people and get a broader sample base, so Thatinsanity's reference as a source is valid, IMO."

schizophrenia,355ntf,moms_on_reddit,6,Thu May 7 13:24:36 2015 UTC,"In that work, the scientists used a common genetic modification system to ethically cross-breed mice with and without the gene of interest (Arp2/3). This allows the production of baby mice who have the gene and those without the gene (called a knockout). Arp2/3 gives rise to a protein that controls actin which is involved in a broad range of body cell processes. It controls how a cell moves, interacts with other cells and gets rid of waste.   Knockout mice show disturbed movement and learning. This was partially reversed by haloperidol and clozapine treatments.   As a scientist in the field, this is a great finding to show the involvement of yet another gene in schizophrenia. However, it needs to be noted that schizophrenia is recognized as a polygenic disorder (involvement of hundreds of different genes). So, knocking out one gene in the mouse does not represent true schizophrenia. It is also important to recognize the disorder as a human illness (i.e. affecting human behavior and brain activity). We may never know whether if a mouse is experiencing hallucinations or delusions because they cannot express their thoughts to us humans."

I can't wait for the rest of science to catch up with psychosocial research on schizophrenia and realize that all we have is specific symptoms and collections of symptoms, which represent normal human responses to stress that are learned from childhood experience, which often involved neglect or abuse that impacted brain development, that can be exacerbated by genetic predispositions, and typically become dysfunctional and pathogenic due to misunderstanding, stigma, internalized helplessness, psychiatric treatment, and systemic problems, rather than any inherent ""disease state"" or whatever.

schizophrenia,354kxd,gerbilista,2,Thu May 7 03:47:26 2015 UTC,"I've experienced something that sounds quite similar at night when I was sleep deprived and off meds.   My brain was like a computer processor where images were being flashed and ""processed"" really fast, it felt like my brain was connected to the internet and I was searching for something through millions of images.  I would say it was akin to a computer defragmentation. That's what it felt like anyway."
schizophrenia,354kxd,gerbilista,2,Thu May 7 20:57:09 2015 UTC,"Last time I was hospitalized (the only time for mental health) I was seeing a ""download/transmission"" projected on the walls; textures became all types of writing/languages and they were scrolling up and down, sideways...it went on for 36 hours...granted, I had overdosed on an unconventional substance, but the phenomena still occurs if I take a nap after reading. There is some graphics of Shaker characters seen in visions which look like what I saw, and of course the ""matrix"" intro is a close analog.   I know I am not the only one, and I am interested in clinical research about it."

The same time as I experienced the above, I saw hieroglyph characters and sidewards facing Egyptians continuously passing an object between them in the texture of my curtains.   Later I assumed that's what a visual hallucination is as I had not experienced such phenomena before. It did feel like an extra sensory part of my brain was active."

I also saw streams of characters/glyphs running through my head, and projected on the walls of the psych unit. I have made graphical representations of those hallucinations by finding a close analog in computer code.

I put it down to my brain fantasizing like a day dream or something, only it feels like a memory rather than a fantasy which may be attributed to a mild delusion mixed with a hallucination.   But as always, the other part of me wants to believe that its your brain downloading information about the simulation we live in.   Whatever you choose to believe is your reality.

schizophrenia,354fg3,gerbilista,1 point,Thu May 7 03:05:19 2015 UTC,"Just subtle things that they say under their breath in a sarcastic tone of voice. I feel like people want me to think that they're just kidding so that I don't get angry at them for mocking me, but in fact, they really are mocking me and they are just trying to disguise it as a joke. Then I become confused and paranoid because I can't tell if they are being serious or just fucking with me."
schizophrenia,354fg3,gerbilista,2,Thu May 7 03:59:39 2015 UTC,"If you are confused by it, then it is probably both. They probably are trying to joke but have some unconscious anger issues to deal with. I would begin to notice how you feel around them.   If you feel a bit angry, they might be feeling angry as well and are letting off steam. It is the fault of neither of you for the anger. That's just the feeling that arises possibly from unconscious unprocessed emotions which is very common. If you feel like it, avoid them. Otherwise work with what you have, express your situation. It is perfectly normal to get angry."
schizophrenia,354fg3,thrownaway866,3,Thu May 7 04:22:44 2015 UTC,"Also! one more important thing I found. Make sure all your needs are being met in the present moment. If you are outside smoking and it is cold, I've noticed that people's tone and conversation becomes swayed by the environment.   First thing to do is to take care of your bodily needs and immediate situation. I.E make sure you are warm, have a drink of water. Make sure you are taking care of yourself first, then you can engage in anything else. This helps not only you but everyone else as well.   I can resonate with this situation because it used to happen to me. My friends in the past would make passive aggressive jokes to me and I wouldn't say anything. It doesn't happen anymore. Now I know that if I take care of myself first, everything else falls into place."

This sounds like a guy that is new to the group, so who knows what he meant. I find if I spend too much trying to figure out a persons intentions, I'm better off away from them.  Myself in that situation, I would of asked him how that was supposed to be funny? What did he see that was so amusing about that?  He would probably be like ""its just a joke, don't be so serious"".  That's when I'd explain that jokes about my death aren't the least bit amusing to me. Try harder to be funny next time.  Boundary is established."
schizophrenia,352xg0,Ramza_Claus,3,Wed May 6 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"I know what you're going through. My girlfriend (who is now my wife) has schizo-affective and she was on Zyprexa for a while. She'd quit taking it and go crazy.   I had no choice but to petition her for treatment.  I called out of work one day and went to her clinic. I signed an affidavit swearing that she presented a threat to herself or others. Her mother signed it too. We asserted that she was a danger because she would drive to get cigarettes or whatever and she didn't pay attention to the road because she was more focused on talking to herself.   Within an hour or two of me signing the affidavit, a judge signed a pick-up order and sheriff's deputies were dispatched to my house to pick her up and bring her to a hospital.  She had the choice of either agreeing to allegations I made or disputing them which would mean I'd have to testify against her in court at a hearing to prove that she was really dangerous.  Thankfully, she did not contest the allegations. She agreed to go on court ordered treatment.  I had to do this her more than twice. And I'd do it again if I needed to. And the way she's been acting, it seems like I might have to.  She's told me that she will leave me if I petition her again. I hope she doesn't, but even if she was definitely going to, I'd still petition her if she needed it.  You can likely do this for your BF. I live in AZ, and it's much harder to forcibly commit someone here. I don't know where you live, but I'm sure that all 50 states have a similar law about people who present a threat to themselves or others.  PM me if ever you wanna talk. I've been living with this woman for 15 years and I've seen this issue come up again and again."

schizophrenia,352xg0,icantrange,1 point,Fri May 8 04:18:53 2015 UTC,"In my experience people can stop their meds for any number of reasons. I have stopped mine before because things were too quiet. As far as the food and the smacking of the plate stuff is considered, I know I used to have very strange command hallucinations that would try to get me to do inappropriate things. There were several times I gave in to make them quiet. One of the things was knocking things out of people's hands. That was me though."
schizophrenia,352xg0,Sometimesp,1 point,Wed May 6 18:00:36 2015 UTC,I took Zyprexia for 2 months I hate the feeling I had while on it. Though remember n=/=1. Some people can take it without having bad symptoms mine were only intensified while on it. And as shesgonegilligan stated he was probably listening to what his hallucination auditory was telling him to do. In cases like this the best thing I could suggest IS NOT bringing it up over and over. That will only make him ill and probably close him off from you. The best route to take is to talk this over with his health care provider/team. I suffer very little from auditory hallucinations...though I do have command hallucinations mine are normally touch and sight.
schizophrenia,352xg0,thrownaway866,1 point,Wed May 6 19:10:57 2015 UTC,Do you know why he isn't taking his meds?  If it's side effects there are other meds than zyprexa of course.  Injectables can work well as you only have to fight the battle with yourself once or twice a month whatever the reason is...they are also associated with a lower risk of relapse.
schizophrenia,352xg0,thrownaway866,1 point,Thu May 7 01:25:01 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, before he knocked the plate of food out of your hand, did you raise your voice at all, or make a sudden movement towards him?"

schizophrenia,352xg0,iliketurtlesdurr,0,Thu May 7 08:25:34 2015 UTC,"he is allowed to do anything he wants, until doing that makes him a danger to others, such as when he knocked that plate out of your hand. schizophrenia can be stable until people are very old, and live normal lives, but that is ONLY if they take their meds. If he doesn't take his meds, he is only going to get worse. If he doesn't take his meds, he'll be unable to unable to work or do anything by the time he's 30, and practically disabled and mentally retarded and unable to sustain conversation by the time he's 40. If you are in a long term relationship with this guy, you need to decide right now if you're going to que his psychiatrist to force him to take his meds. If you don't, you might as well leave now.  Life's not a movie. It's a choose your own adventure, and you only get one shot."
schizophrenia,35237f,krusten,3,Wed May 6 13:39:33 2015 UTC,Just like Joseph stated as long as the drugs chemical compound is the same it doesnt matter if it is generic or not.  x=3% y=70% z=27%  x=3% y=70% z=27%  As long as those numbers are still the same between generic and nongeneric the medication should still work the same way. Its only when the numbers look like this x=2% y=55% z=43%  x=55% y=2% z=43%  should you worry about taking the generic form.

schizophrenia,35237f,nocluewhatimdoin,1 point,Fri May 8 00:24:03 2015 UTC,AFAIK there is no generic form of abilify (aripiprazole)  It is still under patent by Otsuka corporation.  Source: I take the med.  It is absurdly expensive and I would take a generic if it were available.

I went to get a refill today and was told that my insurance no longer covers Abilify and that there is now a generic version.  Unfortunately they were out of the generic so they will call me when they get some in stock...  It does appear that this JUST happened last week.  I, for one, am glad that the drug went generic.  I really hate being on expensive meds.  It increases costs for the whole system."
schizophrenia,35237f,jindbay,1 point,Fri May 8 00:22:29 2015 UTC,"I'm glad too. I actually no longer take it, but when I was I had the most difficult time getting it.

schizophrenia,35237f,trustfundhipsters,2,Fri May 8 01:46:15 2015 UTC,"there's a coupon on the abilify website where you can get a 30 day supply for $5. there are, of course, some conditions, but it cant hurt to check it out. i think it might cover 60 and 90 day supplies too."
schizophrenia,35237f,jindbay,2,Wed May 6 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"I'm lucky that my insurance covers this medicine, but there is a problem with rising healthcare in the US and prescription drugs with patents and outrageous costs still affect the cost of healthcare for everyone.  Otsuka charges an absurd amount for this medication still under patent.  I believe the last time I got it filled it was $1400 for one month supply.  Considering I'm symptomatic enough that I haven't been able to hold a steady job and medicare has been paying for this med.... I'd much rather there be a generic so that public funds can actually go to something more useful, like rent assistance for homelessness prevention for mentally ill.  This drug costs double my rent.  The coupon programs offered by big pharmaceutical companies are a scam."
schizophrenia,35237f,trustfundhipsters,2,Wed May 6 19:38:51 2015 UTC,"oh yeah i totally agree. i could talk about healthcare costs for hours, but im sure you already know.   can you explain to me why they are a scam though? i'll admit i don't know much about these programs, i just needed a way to get my mother's medicine and the pharmacist told me about it and i jumped on it."
schizophrenia,35237f,jindbay,2,Wed May 6 20:21:44 2015 UTC,They often still get billed to the insurance company or paid out of assistance programs.

schizophrenia,34yr6x,WILDACCUSATIONS,6,Tue May 5 17:55:43 2015 UTC,The best way to help is be a friend like nothing's changed.
schizophrenia,34yr6x,Cedrichendrix92,3,Tue May 5 18:01:16 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you reach out to your friend, but don't expect too much while your friend is recovering. When I have a relapse, I don't want to be around people much, and your friend may feel the same. Just let him know you're there for him whenever he feels capable of being social. If he speaks to you about hallucinations or delusions be supportive, but it's ok for you to say ""I don't see things the way you do."" Just respect that his world may be very different than your world. I wish you both the best."
schizophrenia,34yr6x,cepheid22,2,Tue May 5 19:55:59 2015 UTC,"Hey,  You seem like a good person, but i would not try to do the job of a psychotherapist on him. I personally hate it when people see me just through the lense of my illness, I just want to be treated like everybody else.Thats one of the reasons I dont talk about specific symptoms a lot to people in real life. Because then people tend to stay away from topics that have something remotely to do with some of my past delusions.It feels like people are cencoring themselves to protect my fragile mind or something. But other people can feel differently about this and could even ask others to not talk about specific topics because they could trigger an episode or worsen a delusion or something like that.   Should I give him space? Should I drown him in attention? Should I balance it?   You can try to be a good friend, I think that is enough. So just have fun together and talk to him and then see from there. because now you just know little about what he still is or was experiencing. For example after he has moved to your town he could be depressed, happy, still delusional, not delusional. He may want to forget everything what happen or he may want to talk about it in depth(which can sometimes be problematic), he may need help organising his life or he has already a big support system in place. and so on and so on. You just can not know all the possibilities and try to plan for all  of them.   Edit: I also like the comments from /u/edrichendrix92 and /u/cepheid22 and agree with them."
schizophrenia,34yr6x,swagga_yolo,1 point,Wed May 6 04:43:08 2015 UTC,"Leave him alone. Especially if you haven't been a part of his life for a while. I still get old friends that call from time to time, and it makes me feel like shit.  Send an email to him or maybe his family members and let them know you will be around if there is anything that you could do. Maybe he'll want company, maybe he'll want to be left alone. This way you made the attempt, it's up to him to decide where to go from there."
schizophrenia,34yr6x,thrownaway866,1 point,Wed May 6 05:40:19 2015 UTC,"Everyone is different. The details of how to be a good friend come down to your relationship with him. At different stages of the illness, his wants and needs will change. For example, if he is experiencing positive symptoms, it might be best for him to be somewhere quiet away from people for a while. If he is experiencing negative symptoms, the social interaction would probably do him some good even though he might not seem like he's enjoying it at the time.  If I had to give you one piece of advice for being a good friend, I would have to say, routine contact. Just visit him once a week or more, at a specific time and listen to him. If he has nothing he wants to talk about, then find something you can both do together, like going for a walk or something."

I also got into spiritual matters. I'm fairly conflicted at the moment because I've read a path about where schizophrenia is linked to shamanism and ideas such as the 5th dimension where reality is less linear and consciousness is elevated. Off meds I experience a state like this.. But I'm not sure what perspective to take. Is it elevated consciousness or cognitive decline? Feels like both haha. Any how I'm staying on meds for now unless I get guidance from someone on that path which excites me much more than the illness idea.   I think the main thing is safety, if I can ensure I am safe and not a threat to others due to subconscious emotional outbursts then I am all for it.  The idea that has helped me most psychologically so far is from a guy called Greg Neville. He posits a cure for psychological stress. In short, the says that our development occurs naturally and automatically from interactions with our environment and we each provide ""data"" for each others development. That we are not missing out on anything because life develops us. Also by following a wisdom model that says ""I will create goals and be proud of my efforts"" rather than a achievement model that says ""If I am good I will get ____"".   This mans thinking had helped me a lot.  A purpose you say? Hmm. I had the purpose of wanting to spread as much love as possible in the world. But I've been unable to define love. Sure there's the good feeling of oxytocin or of orgasm, but its only temporary. Then there's charity work as a metaphorical love.The idea I have is of a greater love that is infinite (see pretty much any religious text). Though I have trouble relating this to reality."

I might be shopping and in my head wanting to browse at the options, but my feet want to head for the exit. And my feet win.. Every time!  It feels like an electrical (nerves) issue in my body, a tingling, like I can't hold myself down. I feel like that if I had some more ""staying power"" I would be able to interact with people normally instead of making it seem like I'm always In a hurry.   The funny thing is if I try to resist the impulse i feel to leave, it feels like a fuse is about to blow in my head, and when I do go to leave I literally slingshot out of there as fast as I can.

These people were supposed to be borderline genius-- real savants. The first day, I was talking with someone from New England who was in their 20s, and I said I was from Mississippi, and she said, ""But.... wait.... I don't understand. Doesn't everyone in Mississippi live in shacks, or something?"". Dead serious. Then, a year later when I went to college, I was walking down the ""infinite corridor"" at MIT, and passed the Black Student Union bulletin board, and someone had spray-painted a racial slur on it. That was the first public example of racial hate I had seen in my life, and it wasn't from Mississippi-- it was at MIT, in Boston, MA.  What are you going to do? People are morons. In 30 years, I've seen at lot of stereotypes go away, in the U.S., and also, you've got to realize how good the internet is, at distributing common information to the masses. The world is changing at light-speed now, but people in general can still be morons, hehe.  Think of the most closed-minded person you know. Now, imagine trying to tell that person, that humans may not be here in this space-time alone, and that other mind may actually be sharing this space with us, and that perhaps the universe is a big jungle and not a barren sea of rocks with humans at the lonely center. You can't tell most people, anything, really. If you have something that you know about, let's say an object, and it's simple and it's solid and you can hand it to them and they can hold it, there are going to be  some people that just won't understand what it is, especially if it conflicts with their basic operating data.

I don't tell everyone I have the disease, but it isn't really a secret either. Most people I tell this fact about me to usually parallel it to A Beautiful Mind; they see it as interesting and mysterious thing which they want to know more about, not that I am about to burst into a psychotic rampart and indiscriminately try to hurt everything around me.  When the one oddball does (and sometimes justifiably, seeing as the description of the disease can be quite disturbing) I just tell the tl;dr of my story, which contains no traces of destructive elements or will to hurt others...

With the internet, people with similar struggles can find other to relate with so communities form (such as this one). In the real world, it is rare to come across someone who is schizophrenic that doesnt exhibit extreme symptoms as they blend right in.  I think really what many schizophrenic struggle with, themselves, is the perception that this illness makes them believe in whatever comes into their minds. Basically, you become delusional by your own label and it turns you into your own stereotype.  If you can break free from your delusion, you can rationalize who you are by which are a make up of all your memories and experiences.   Everyone is unique to themselves, even those here with similar illnesses have their own personal experiences that makes them who they are. Schizophrenia effects everyone different, its how you handle it which makes the difference. Break free"

Do some things which may not feel good initially, but after a while, will become routine and feel good. The good news is that you will feel again and life gets better once you make some changes in your lifestyle. I didn't realize how much capacity I still had for feeling until I started watching anime. I started watching a mainstream one called Sword Art Online and actually finished watching all the episodes that have aired. I laughed, I cried, I felt like I could relate to the characters. I started walking, and losing weight. My friends and family noticed and complimented me, it felt good. I've gotten back in touch with all my friends and had decent conversations about my illness and how it affects me. They are mostly curious about it. Especially the parts where reality is warped.

schizophrenia,34s4v8,VampireReaper,3,Mon May 4 02:23:34 2015 UTC,"I've known that schizophrenia may cause a person to see, feel, hear, smell, hallucinations or cause delusions which is probably caused by the hallucinations.   Actually, delusions and hallucinations are separate. It is perfectly possible, and common, to have only delusions without any hallucinations.  I would not call a belief supported by hallucinations a ""delusion"", as the person is merely interpreting sensory experiences. So a person who believes that a cat is on the bookcase is not delusional if they in fact see a cat, even if the cat is not there.   A person who believes that there is a cat stealing their life force when they sleep without seeing the cat would be delusional.  Sometimes, delusions seem like they would require some physical evidence for the person to believe such things, but it is not required due to the nature of delusional thinking.  So, a person could be delusional that a person is breaking into their house, messing with their stuff, or even stealing things without any hallucination or evidence to back up these claims.   But what I don't understand is how do people have these episodes where they completely lose touch with reality? Is it sort of like being drugged?   Each possible symptom of schizophrenia can be expressed in a variety of ways and to different degrees.  It is possible to have three people with the diagnosis of schizophrenia and not have a symptom in common.  Furthermore, symptoms can be episodic or not, or come and go suddenly or slowly.  For me, I would say that if it can happen in a dream, it can happen in real life (during psychosis).   Hallucinations are not so bad. They can be annoying and frightening, but the real problem with schizophrenia are when the ability to think rationally is impaired or warped.   When this happens, crazy things can happen.  From the person experiencing it, it may be frightening, or they may not be aware of what is going on, and carry on as one would in a dream.   Is it sort of like being drugged?   I have never been drugged, but drugs can induce psychotic states. However, I would describe it more as a dream state. The world seems to change and the ability to think clearly may be impaired."
schizophrenia,34s4v8,JosephFaolan,1 point,Mon May 4 12:31:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting, so a person could have delusions but without evidence at all not even hallucinations?   How are the delusions formed? I always thought they came from hallucinations like if you hear voices you then come to the conclusion that somebody is broadcasting thoughts directly into your mind, at this point you then start thinking why they would do such a thing and you come to the conclusion you have secret knowledge that needs to be suppressed or you are in an experiment so these people are messing with you.     As for psychotic episodes that sounds pretty frightening that you go into a dreamlike state, I know half of my dreams I have little if any control of my actions so I end up doing crazy things like launching cars off cliffs, taking orders from my dog, blowing up buildings, running around naked, dressing up as a knight in black armor attacking people at the library while riding a horse looking for a tome of black magic etc. If I did any of these things in real-life I'd probably end up in prison, but in the dream for some reason it makes so much sense. I guess people in a psychotic episode must feel the same way."
schizophrenia,34s4v8,JosephFaolan,2,Mon May 4 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting, so a person could have delusions but without evidence at all not even hallucinations?    ""Without evidence"" is part of the definition of ""delusion"".   How are the delusions formed? I always thought they came from hallucinations like if you hear voices   You always thought wrong. They are formed from the dark recesses of the mind, usually indicating some malfunction of a mental process most people do not realize they have until it goes wrong.  Experiencing a delusion is difficult to describe, but in short, one just ""knows"" it.  A person usually tries to analyze it or look for evidence after the delusion starts. So a person who is delusional my see evidence for it, but that evidence is usually very flimsy and not the actual basis for the delusion.  A person may start to interpret things in light of the delusion. It is important to realize that it works this way, because the so-called evidence can easily be refuted, however, that does not affect the delusion.   If I did any of these things in real-life I'd probably end up in prison.   Where you would get the black armor?   As for psychotic episodes that sounds pretty frightening that you go into a dreamlike state   It can be total or partial. It is not a total dream because it is based in reality.  Psychosis can also reduce one's mental abilities, which leads to withdrawal, because sensory experiences can be overwhelming."
schizophrenia,34s4v8,JosephFaolan,1 point,Mon May 4 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"So do delusions just start out as feelings?  For example you feel someone is following you, despite no evidence of any sort at all. But its just a thought, but as you slip deeper into madness this feeling becomes stronger to the point you believe this wholeheartedly and to make matters worse you then begin to start seeing/hearing things, which confirm your beliefs.  Sort of reminds me of when I was a kid, like most kids I used to have all kinds of crazy thoughts but as a kid these were just ""kid logic"" not delusions. Like while I didn't believe in Santa for years I thought I might be broadcasting my thoughts out so people maybe able to read my mind, I also thought I might be able to ""talk"" to animals in this way.  Or does someone all of a sudden one day become full on delusional believing they are a divine being despite 0 evidence at all, and they fully believe this no matter what kind of evidence is presented.     As for where I would get the black armor, I could always buy/make it or just imagine it. But the point I was making was dreams don't make much sense and yet I believe them when I'm in one, and have little choice in the matter, so I was wondering if psychotic episode was like a waking dream as in you can still somewhat function but your thinking is about as bad as someone dreaming so logic is just totally gone.

This can happen, but for delusions alone, no.  A delusion can come on slowly or very quickly. Delusions do not cause hallucinations. Delusions are likely to cause one to interpret things in light of that delusion.  How individuals experience it depends on their individual case, but it can be sudden or slow. It can be based on something real or something entirely imaginary.   As for where I would get the black armor, I could always buy/make it or just imagine it.    Ebony ingots are useful for this.   so I was wondering if psychotic episode was like a waking dream as in you can still somewhat function but your thinking is about as bad as someone dreaming so logic is just totally gone.   It can be like that.  Or it can be just an intensification of the symptoms one has.  Or it can be just one symptom which comes and goes episodically.   Wonder how long does this last?   Episodes can be short or prolonged and people can always have psychotic symptoms.  You are focusing on positive symptoms which stand out, but schizophrenia is far more than that.  The Disorganized symptoms can severely impair one's thought patterns, ability to communicate, and understanding.  Negative symptoms and Cognitive deficits are extremely disabling and they rare get attention from people interested in schizophrenia.  You can read my blog for some of my personal experiences."

I'm having to stay away from it.  Though, it is something I love..it just effects me differently now since the extreme spice-useage and head trauma..."
schizophrenia,34quc2,mrscrawfish,1 point,Sun May 3 21:15:33 2015 UTC,I have a big phoenix on my left shoulder blade.  I got it after years of being in and out of the hospital and my first marriage falling apart.  It reminds me that I always rise from the ashes and overcome adversity.

schizophrenia,34quc2,enigmaticblue,1 point,Mon May 4 03:51:42 2015 UTC,"I have one. I got it before I was suffering from any symptoms, Though it reflects the generational struggle that illness has had on my family perfectly.   It's funny how people say that you'll regret getting a tattoo when you're older. I've had mind for 12 years and I don't regret it at all. I doubt that I'll ever regret it."
schizophrenia,34quc2,sleepypunk,1 point,Mon May 4 12:02:13 2015 UTC,"If it truly means something to you, you won't regret it. Any chance I could see it at all? Although I respect your right to privacy so I understand if you'd rather not show it off."
schizophrenia,34quc2,joesavu,1 point,Mon May 4 20:15:56 2015 UTC,"Not a specific related to mental health but I have a tattoo to remember my dad by. He suffered the same things I do but he had terrible experiences with hospitalization as a child and when he got older he didn't even believe bipolar/schizo/etc were things he had or even existed. his fave thing to say was ""bipolar was created by the pharm companies to sell medicine."" and so I lost him this year to his mental illness. We were extremely close and practically the same person so looking back I'm sure he struggled with what I struggle with. He had a small bar code tattoo on his wrist and so the day of his funeral I got a barcode with his birthday underneath it.  I got it on the opposite wrist because my other wrist has 0 + 0 = ∞ on it, a reference to Inio Asano's Solanin and I've used it to remind myself not to self harm."

Doesnt mean I wont get one when Im delusional enough.   I know someone who has tattoos all over his body from his religious delusions. Idk if they are religious based tattoos, as have not closely examined them. Just an assumption, but he has lots of tattoos."

Sorry I can't offer any better advice other than to give it a go for a few months and see if you feel any better and if the people around you notice a difference."
schizophrenia,34qoxr,enigmaticblue,1 point,Mon May 4 12:21:48 2015 UTC,I was on prolixan for a year or two. Just got off of it. Didn't notice anything positive or negative with it. Watch out for tardive dyskinesia. You Don't want that shit.
schizophrenia,34pjvg,Zlr,2,Sun May 3 11:37:14 2015 UTC,"I resisted becoming sexual in any way because I am asexual. I resisted being masculine because I am androgynous.   I think having some experiences where it seems like one is being forced to think or do things of a sexual nature may be somewhat common, although, how people respond to them may be different depending on personal values.  I think I heard one person with schizophrenia describe it was a mental succubus."
schizophrenia,34pjvg,JosephFaolan,2,Sun May 3 12:47:03 2015 UTC,"delusions doesn't need to be profound. they can be the most trivial and common stuff.  doesn't mean you can stop fighting them either, i know it's hard but you have to keep on rejecting them."
schizophrenia,34pjvg,Awake_tf,1 point,Mon May 4 10:56:27 2015 UTC,"My problem is more with how much they're valued in these experiences. It's like one must make a conscious effort to be masculine and sexual at all times, and masculinity and sexuality are the greatest, most important things ever. They must never be deviated from. I'd call it something like fanatic dogmatism.  Taoists have a cool concept called wu-wei in which one is effortlessly what they are. I prefer that."
schizophrenia,34pjvg,enigmaticblue,2,Wed May 6 04:57:19 2015 UTC,"I don't experience delusions any more. But I used to have them about everything from the mundane to the eccentric.   Just a suggestion, but have you tried occupying your mind with something instead of fighting your delusions. I like to think of schizophrenia as the thinking mans illness. We have auditory hallucinations but that doesn't mean we are destined to be at the mercy of them. If you stop thinking of the 'voices' as external and start thinking of them as internal dialogue that you control (at least your own voice), then you can chat with yourself and get insights into things from different perspectives."
schizophrenia,34o5ke,adfalcon,4,Sat May 2 23:32:58 2015 UTC,"How do they ""try out"" a diagnosis?   Treatment, if any, should be based on symptoms and response, not on the diagnosis.  Many people with Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective, Bipolar, etc reach their final diagnosis after going through several. The diagnosis does not really change anything though."
schizophrenia,34o5ke,JosephFaolan,2,Sun May 3 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"This is very important to note. A change in diagnosis pretty much determines your treatment, but doesn't change anything about what you experience. Your regular doc will still address the symptoms in a similar way, it just helps other doctors know where to start."
schizophrenia,34o5ke,phatskat,1 point,Sun May 3 05:19:26 2015 UTC,"Odds are your last hospital visit included a bout of mania. They might throw a mood stabilizer into your cocktail if they haven't already, but other than that, it's all the same to you."
schizophrenia,34o5ke,thrownaway866,1 point,Wed May 6 06:25:27 2015 UTC,"My doctor treats by symptoms, even though I was diagnosed Schizoaffective during my last hospital visit. He has not prescribed me a mood stabilizer in the last 2.5 years.. A good doctor will primarily focus on symptoms."
