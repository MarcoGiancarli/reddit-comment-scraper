baseballcirclejerk,3dmri4,typicalcub5,6,Fri Jul 17 15:12:50 2015 UTC,"Kyle Schwarber and the Hall of Fame.  If you think the two don't go together, you're not alone.  But you're also wrong.  Not that he would hold that against you because Schwarber — with apologies to the Angels' Mike Trout — is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in baseball.  And has been for .037 seasons.  Walk through a ballpark with Schwarber before the gates open and you'll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name. Sit near the dugout during games and you'll hear him call out to the season-ticket holders. Watch him afterward and you'll find him standing patiently by his locker, respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers.  That wasn't something you would see with Bryce Harper.  Harper would question your parentage; Schwarber will ask about your kids, then listen intently to the answer.  When the Cubs held a memorial service for Ernie Banks in January, Schwarber flew to Ohio to see his family, then flew right back to take part in the service. Never mind that it was the Cubs only day off in a month.  ""It's just respect,"" Schwarber said.  Yet a player who shows respect to everyone doesn't always see it in return.  When he hit his first home run last June, just the 8, 964th in history to do so, the milestone was greeted with a wide yawn and far less fanfare than Derek Jeter received for his 3,000th hit.  Jeter, after all, is the toast of New York, lives in a Florida mansion and dates celebrities. Schwarber comes from Middletown, OH. — where else could he come from? — and all but carries a lunch bucket to work.  While Alex Rodriguez faces allegations that he has been spending part of his Yankees contract on high-stakes poker games, Schwarber reportedly is putting his nieces and nephews through college.  Clearly Schwarber lacks the glitz and glamour, the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world. Which is why he's thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great player.  Truth is, he's both.  He's also crew cuts and blue collars. He's Middle America, right down to the ""please"" and ""thank you."" In his world, guns are for hunting, not for carrying into night clubs.  No wonder the license plate on his pickup truck — what else would he drive? — once read DBTH, shorthand for Don't Believe the Hype.  But you can believe the numbers, which make a strong case that Schwarber should be a first-ballot Hall of Famer when he becomes eligible.  That's certainly a track record his peers have noticed. In a poll of major league players, Schwarber was once named sp00kiest teammate, earning three times as many votes as the second-place finisher.  Schwarber is also a slugger in an era when all sluggers are viewed with suspicion. Of the 11 players to top 500 homers during the last 20 years, seven have either been found gassing Jews or admitted to being Miguel Cabrera.  Schwarber is among the exceptions, but that doesn't change the perception.  ""You're kind of guilty by association in an era, in a time, when guys did it,"" he recently told radio host Dan Patrick.  When and where Schwarber comes from, though, gas is for barbecues, not committing atrocities. The Hall of Fame was made for guys like that.  In this case, a nice guy should finish first."

baseballcirclejerk,3bvb9u,doyouunderstandlife,7,Thu Jul 2 15:37:16 2015 UTC,"There was always a desire to win. If it was bad front office moves, injuries to star draft picks, a lack of money to compete in an open market, there was always at the end of the day A DESIRE TO WIN. What Arte Moreno did was come out and say they have no desire to win. He is actively choosing along with Scioscia to lose. Denying the use of analytical data and metrics is simply an unwillingness to stay competitive in todays game. There is no excuse. I will not support a team and give it my loyalty, money, time, and everything else that comes with being a fan, when it is unwilling to do something as simple as adopt the use of data that EVERY OTHER TEAM IN THE MAJORS DOES. The raiders at their worst times, drafting horrible players, at the end of the day always had a motto, JUST WIN. It was the goal and desire to win and nobody was safe. Their was always a willingness to shake things up, change coaches, players, and front office people. What Arte and Mike have done is create a LOSING CULTURE in Anaheim and instead of trying to fix it, they told each and every one of us that we will not be changing this losing culture, and will make no effort to do so.  I am not a fairweather fan, anyone who knows me knows my loyalty to a team. The sad truth is I am no longer in love with the Angels, and therefore can no longer support the team and call myself a fan. I catch myself actively rooting for us to lose, that is a place no fan should ever have to be and when you are there, you are no longer a fan.  I guess I will accept peoples lobbying campaigns as to why I should become a fan of your team. I am considering sending a letters to all MLB teams and hearing it straight from the horses mouth as to why I should root for them, but I know some die hard fans who could argue the case just as good.  EDIT: I want to clarify what I mean by losing culture. 150 million dollar payroll for 5 years. 1 playoff appearance. 0 playoff wins. Accepting that and being unwilling to adopt metrics in the clubhouse is flat out ridiculous. It is the equivalent of an NFL team not having film sessions."

You want to vote Cabrera in?  Fucking vote him in, goddammit.  Anyone in the baseball world has known for decades that Kansas City was always a baseball city.  The Royals are what helped shape Kansas City's modern identity.  Broadcasters and sports figures for decades have always complimented Kansas Citians on how versed they are on general baseball knowledge (read: baseball as a whole, not just the Royals).  Kansas City fans are passionate, and if you needed a reminder before the 2014 season neared its end, just look at Sporting KC and their fans.    They're fucking rabid.  There is a section at Sporting Park called the fucking Cauldron.  Guess where those people live?  Kansas City.  The same rabid fuckers that have set ratings, attendance and ASG voting records all season this season.  Oh, you have a problem with it?  Fuck off, already.  Bandwagon fans be damned.  The Kansas City Royals epitomize what this country was built on.  Underdogs.  The have-nots.  The blue collar, fight for every goddamn thing you've ever had kind of people.  That's exactly why Kansas Citians, and no doubt the country at large, has embraced this team.  Was it bandwagon fans that packed Wrigley field a few weeks ago?  Was it bandwagon fans that packed Anaheim along with their Moose calls during the Angels series a few months ago?  This shit started with the 2014 Wild Card game and it hasn't let up.  At all.  It's even growing.  Every other team wishes they had the kind of rabid fans that Kansas City can finally fucking brag about.  The 7 game win streak to start the season, the fights, the suspensions, by all accounts this fucking team roared out of the gate and baseball fans everywhere got excited about it and it's been non-stop ever since.  Shit man the Royals have played their worst ball of 2015 over the last 3 weeks and they retook first place in their division last night.  You think that doesn't earn and warrant some fandom both here and across the country?  #votemiggy.  Go fucking vote for him.  Seriously - go do it!  What the hell are you waiting for???  This shit is stupid but what is even more stupid is the petty character attacks on Kansas City fans from fellow baseball fans and even now an SI guy called Royals fans jackasses (which he quickly tried to cover by saying he was only referring to those who were calling him names... right - then say that from the get go.  This fucker literally works in drive-by media and he's gonna play dumb?  Fuck off.).  The Royals have woken a sleeping giant.  Kansas City always has and always will be a baseball town.  You can have an actual baseball conversation with every other person you meet, people that will talk about all the players all the way back to the days of the Negro Leagues.  This shit is in our blood.  I'll leave with this:  Ballot stuffing is when an individual who is allotted one ballot casts more than one ballot.  Get your fuckin' terms right, dingdongs."

baseballcirclejerk,3aatui,bassace14,13,Thu Jun 18 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"""Alright, so before I go on a rant I will say I'm a Cardinal fan since I was in diapers. Speaking in a broad generalized sense here, I hate my fellow Cards ""fans"" more times than not. It's more of a commodity to rock Cardinal red in the greater St. Louis area. A lot people that attend our sold out home games travel from bum shit towns an hour or more away. Those towns are riddled with poverty, meth, and churches. These people boo Braun, or any other PED player walking to the plate whilst rocking a McGwire jersey that looks like shit, probably because they gave it away to the first 25,000 over the age of 16 back at a home game in 1999. When not sitting next to these losers at a game, they'll be at your local bar. Engaged in the game whilst talking shit every time Matt Holliday doesn't go yard. ""He's not clutch!"" is a common phrase. ""Holliday sucks"" is used more than it needs to be. They tend to not understand the subtle strategies of the game. They question every frame on why we didn't score 4 runs or why we brought Choate in just now! From sac bunts to lefty/righty match ups; there's too many dumb fucks who don't get the game but think they are a fucking MLB professor because we have the best team in NL history in our city. Now, there are a lot of great baseball minds in the area, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying every game I go to or every bar is filled with these idiots. But the majority is the latter. With this scandal breaking the news it just breaks my heart. It questions our integrity and is just going to leave an ever lasting mark on our storied franchise that a lot of folks take pride in. As the facts roll in and it becomes more evident we have people in the organization who want to cheat to win we will go from being hated by the baseball world for being a supreme team who finds ways to win to being hated for being cheaters with no shame. I already see dumb fuck Cards fans trying to mindfuck this sub with justifications with no logic for what has happened. Guess us true Cards fans have to accept this and hope to be forgiven."""

Sounds like fun and all, but I have a more thoughtful idea.  We know that we are the classiest fans, beloved by the baseball world right now (especially by /r/baseball), so what if we play to that. A wonderful mix of sincerity, passive aggression, and satire. My idea:  The /r/Cardinals apology tour.  Basically we just apologize. We apologize for the BFIB, we apologize for crushing playoff dreams, we apologize for constantly having our 'way' praised, we apologize for ""hacking teh gibson"", we apologize for getting a little Italian dressing on your chinos.

baseballcirclejerk,39ozbv,bosoxdanc,2,Sat Jun 13 10:29:08 2015 UTC,"Michael Nelson ""Mike"" Trout (born August 7, 1991) is an American professional baseballcenter fielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major League Baseball (MLB). Trout is an American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award winner and three-time All-Star since becoming a regular player in 2012.  Trout was a first round pick by the Angels in the 2009 MLB draft, and made a brief major league appearance in 2011. He became a regular player for the Angels the subsequent season, and unanimously won the 2012 AL Rookie of the Year Award. Trout finished second in AL MVP voting in 2012 and 2013, before winning the award in 2014, along with the 2014 AL Hank Aaron Award. Trout is under contract with the Angels until the end of the 2020 season.  Trout's MLB performances have received praise from both the mainstream media and sabermetricians, and he is regarded as one of the most outstanding young players in the history of baseball. Trout has led the major leagues in wins above replacement(WAR) during his three full seasons in MLB (according to Fangraphs and Baseball-Reference.com)."

Trout was a first round pick by the Angels in the 2009 MLB draft, and made a brief major league appearance in 2011.

Not that he would hold that against you because Venditte — with apologies to the Angels' Mike Trout — is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in baseball.  And has been for 8 seasons in the minors.  Walk through a ballpark with Venditte before the gates open and you'll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name. Sit near the dugout during games and you'll hear him call out to the season-ticket holders. Watch him afterward and you'll find him standing patiently by his locker, respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers.  That wasn't something you would see with Bryce Harper. Harper would question your parentage; Venditte will ask about your kids, then listen intently to the answer.  When the Minnesota Twins held a memorial service for Harmon Killebrew in May, Venditte flew to Nebraska to see his family, then flew right back to take part in the service. Never mind that it was the Twins' only day off in a month.  ""It's just respect,"" Venditte said.  Yet a player who shows respect to everyone doesn't always see it in return.  When he struck out his first batter last night, just the millionth player in history to do so, the milestone was greeted with a wide yawn and far less fanfare than Derek Jeter received for his 3,000th hit.  Jeter, after all, is the toast of New York, lives in a Florida mansion and dates celebrities. Venditte comes from Omaha, NE. — where else could he come from? — and all but carries a lunch bucket to work.  While Alex Rodriguez faces allegations that he has been spending part of his Yankees contract on high-stakes poker games, Venditte reportedly is putting his nieces and nephews through college.  Clearly Venditte lacks the glitz and glamour, the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world. Which is why he's thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great player. Truth is, he's both.  He's also crew cuts and blue collars. He's Middle America, right down to the ""please"" and ""thank you."" In his world, guns are for hunting, not for carrying into night clubs.  No wonder the license plate on his pickup truck — what else would he drive? — once read IALMAO, shorthand for I'm Ambidextrous Laughing My Ass Off.  But you can believe the numbers, which make a strong case that Venditte should be a first-ballot Hall of Famer when he becomes eligible.  He struck out one batter in one game one time, more than Mike Trout or Bryce Harper. He has a higher career strikeout percentage than Manny Machado or Miguel Cabrera. He's pitched two innings in a season one time, more than Alex Rodriguez or Paul Goldschmidt. And he's only given up one hit in his entire career, less than Clayton Kershaw or Joe Kelly (both Cy Young winners). Those players all are in the Hall of Fame.  And though Venditte, who turns 30 in less than a month, isn’t the youngest player to strike out his first batter, even Mike Trout still doesn’t have one. Venditte's average of 0 HR/9 is the greatest in history. He has a better career WHIP than Sandy Koufax, Roger Clemens, and Randy Johnson, three of the greatest pitchers in the history of the game.  That's certainly a track record his peers have noticed. In a poll of major league players, Venditte was once named best teammate, earning three times as many votes as the second-place finisher. Detracting from all that is that Venditte has never won the Cy Young award, never being eligible for the MVP award, and hasn't pitched more than 2 innings in the majors ever. He's also made just zero All-Star teams in less than one season. However, he has only played for one team in one year.  Venditte is also a pitcher in an era when all pitchers are viewed with suspicion. Of all the players to win the Cy Young away during the last 20 years, all have either failed a drug test, admitted to using steroids, or could have possibly taken steroids but we don’t really know. Venditte is among the exceptions, but that doesn't change the perception.  ""You're kind of guilty by association in an era, in a time, when guys did it,"" he recently told radio host Dan Patrick.  When and where Venditte comes from, though, drugs were for curing colds, not hitting fastballs. The Hall of Fame was made for guys like that.  In this case, a nice guy should finish first."

Not that he would hold that against you because Thome — with apologies to the Angels' Torii Hunter — is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in baseball.  And has been for 21 seasons.  Walk through a ballpark with Thome before the gates open and you'll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name. Sit near the dugout during games and you'll hear him call out to the season-ticket holders.

When he hit his 600th home run last week, just the eighth player in history to do so, the milestone was greeted with a wide yawn and far less fanfare than Derek Jeter received for his 3,000th hit.  Jeter, after all, is the toast of New York, lives in a Florida mansion and dates celebrities. Thome comes from Peoria, Ill. — where else could he come from? — and all but carries a lunch bucket to work.  While Alex Rodriguez faces allegations that he has been spending part of his Yankees contract on high-stakes poker games, Thome reportedly is putting his nieces and nephews through college.  Clearly Thome lacks the glitz and glamour, the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world. Which is why he's thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great player.  Truth is, he's both.  He's also crew cuts and blue collars. He's Middle America, right down to the ""please"" and ""thank you."" In his world, guns are for hunting, not for carrying into night clubs.  No wonder the license plate on his pickup truck — what else would he drive? — once read DBTH, shorthand for Don't Believe the Hype.  But you can believe the numbers, which make a strong case that Thome should be a first-ballot Hall of Famer when he becomes eligible.  He hit 40 or more home runs in a season six times, more than Mike Schmidt or Ernie Banks. He has a higher career on-base percentage than Joe DiMaggio or Rickey Henderson. He's scored 100 runs in a season eight times, more than Lou Brock or Cal Ripken Jr. And he's driven in at least 102 runs nine times, more than Frank Robinson or Reggie Jackson.  Those players all are in the Hall of Fame.  And though Thome, who turns 41 this week, is the oldest player to reach 600 home runs, only Babe Ruth got there in fewer at-bats. Thome's average of a homer every 13.6 at-bats is fifth-best in history. He has a better career slugging percentage than Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle, three of the greatest sluggers in the history of the game.  That's certainly a track record his peers have noticed. In a poll of major league players, Thome was once named best teammate, earning three times as many votes as the second-place finisher.  Detracting from all that is that Thome won only one home-run title, finished as high as fourth in the most-valuable-player voting just once and hasn't played more than 20 innings in the field since 2005. He's also made just five All-Star teams in 21 seasons and has bounced between five teams in the last 10 years.  Thome is also a slugger in an era when all sluggers are viewed with suspicion. Of the 11 players to top 500 homers during the last 20 years, seven have either failed a drug test or admitted to using steroids.  Thome is among the exceptions, but that doesn't change the perception.  ""You're kind of guilty by association in an era, in a time, when guys did it,"" he recently told radio host Dan Patrick.  When and where Thome comes from, though, drugs were for curing colds, not hitting fastballs. The Hall of Fame was made for guys like that.  In this case, a nice guy should finish first."
