HotWheels,3e4jei,marsmedia,2,Tue Jul 21 23:31:21 2015 UTC,"You must have the first edition. Some people find those desirable. I just collect what I like and makes me happy. There are occasions when I buy a vehicle because of its rarity (due to popularity,) even though I might not have bought it otherwise. A good example is the 2015 Ford Escort RS1600. I have seen less than 15 hanging on the pegs."

I think he's a ploy to get the middle and lower class to look at the extremely affluent in a more positive light.   I digress.  I can possibly go back to said store and pick it up if you have anything I desire. message me"

I just started collecting them recently, before I only got them to play with them as a kid and then as a teen I was too cool for them.   My next purchase might be the new 69 boss 302 super treasure hunt. Then maybe the whole 50th anniversary."
HotWheels,3dugr0,Yowomboo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:07:35 2015 UTC,You should definitely look at the 15th nationals Boss 302. It's going to cost about $10 more than what the super runs for though. It's a very nice piece though.  More pictures here.
HotWheels,3dugr0,Yowomboo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:36:02 2015 UTC,I like that. this is the one I seen. idk which one I like better.

I'm starting to accrue a handful of cars I don't really care for and will likely donate them soon.

HotWheels,3dj55i,LtSnowEagle,3,Thu Jul 16 18:13:21 2015 UTC,"ebay. Check the ""sold"" listings for an indicator on what is collectible and sought after and what isn't.    If you are desperate for a quick payout, bulk cars are worth about 40 cents each.  You might enjoy auctioning them off to other collectors as a hobby, which is worth more than just the dollar value of divesting yourself of them.  Having lost your dad, it seems like a good way of remembering him."

HotWheels,3ckpxt,uologan,0,Wed Jul 8 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"rarity =/= value  Value is a result of supply versus demand.  There are tons of really rare cars out there that don't fetch much money, and tons of not very rare cars that fetch a lot of money."

Did you not say that some cars could be rare and valuable while others common..yet valuable? It seems obvious why the question was asked what the case might be in these particular cars if they were not a particular expert on the matter...which I certainly am not. Thus, the genuine curiosity. My entire point here (if you would accept it) is can someone not ask a question without jumping to the conclusion that they are for resale as opposed to mild curiosity?"

HotWheels,3c8zmd,Red_Shoto,2,Mon Jul 6 02:54:30 2015 UTC,It's a Flying Customs Hare Splitter
HotWheels,3c8zmd,windog,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:59:02 2015 UTC,I need this SO BAD!
HotWheels,3c8zmd,militarydictator2015,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:42:10 2015 UTC,"there was a dude on here that was hell-bent on insisting this 5 pack was not collectible, and basically worthless and trivial just a month ago. but, actually, it is the one of the best things out this year."
HotWheels,3c7u4n,skeptoid79,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:36:38 2015 UTC,I thought the rear hatch opens on the F40 models. Where did this one come from?
HotWheels,3c7u4n,xdroop,2,Sun Jul 5 20:18:10 2015 UTC,Newer F40 casting doesn't open.
HotWheels,3c7u4n,iwanttobearockstar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:55:11 2015 UTC,"I know the blue brand f40 has the opening read hatch, didn't even know the brothers in orange had an f40 cast!"
HotWheels,3c7u4n,otakutaikun,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:09:26 2015 UTC,So this isn't a Hot Wheels casting?
HotWheels,3c7u4n,xdroop,2,Sun Jul 5 22:46:41 2015 UTC,"Nope, OP states in the album its a Matchbox. The wheels too are a dead giveaway, but the hot wheels one does have an opening hatch"
HotWheels,3c7u4n,otakutaikun,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:11:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hate that.  Fortunately this Matchbox does not do that."
HotWheels,3c895t,calKno,2,Sun Jul 5 20:47:47 2015 UTC,Gonna order a couple 9 packs tonight. Can't wait to get that Corvette.
HotWheels,3c895t,Chase93,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:29:59 2015 UTC,So it can be packs of cars to hit the $20 spot?
HotWheels,3c895t,thedonaldiam,0,Tue Jul 7 13:37:30 2015 UTC,Yup
HotWheels,3c895t,thedonaldiam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:57:22 2015 UTC,thanks... thatll do just nicely.
HotWheels,3c895t,JaquesNoir,0,Tue Jul 7 15:47:04 2015 UTC,Stop rubbing it in...
HotWheels,3c6v5t,calKno,2,Sun Jul 5 12:13:07 2015 UTC,Awww... why is this not applicable in Canada eh?
HotWheels,3c6v5t,JaquesNoir,2,Sun Jul 5 13:53:21 2015 UTC,"because hot wheels literally hates canada, we get the cases a year and a half later than the us"

HotWheels,3c6v5t,JaquesNoir,2,Sun Jul 5 22:33:21 2015 UTC,Can we buy single cars online?
HotWheels,3c6v5t,Chase93,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:44:51 2015 UTC,Don't think so. Gotta buy the 20 and mail in the cards.
HotWheels,3c6v5t,ThaddeusJP,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:49:26 2015 UTC,Went there yesterday and found some new Teslas. About to head back for this promotion. Hoping they restocked.
HotWheels,3c6v5t,jivatma,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:54:00 2015 UTC,"Most stores seemed to put out their case early.  Ours had the one case out yesterday.  Yep one case.  So if you wanted exclusives you were out of luck today. I'm out of town,  so my buddy stopped by yesterday,  and about a half case was out of M cars.  The other half put up this morning according to him. The problem comes I NV that the store receives no communication and second the cases are not marked special or with a street date at all. Sad is all I can say."
HotWheels,3c5cka,calKno,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:12:18 2015 UTC,I was digging that batman vs superman car until I realized it said sdcc. Everything that comes from there gets jacked up in price unless you get it there sadly. The other cards look cool though
HotWheels,3c44iv,beansmeller,2,Sat Jul 4 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"$3 for all of them. Not in the best of shape, I may try restoring one of them."

HotWheels,3c2mf3,BurningPickle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:34:24 2015 UTC,"This is gonna sound stupid, but I've tried searching for an answer to no avail.  I see all these posts about certain letter cases and can't for the life of me figure out how you know or what it denotes."
HotWheels,3c2mf3,Gumball_Machine,2,Sun Jul 5 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"The Lamley Group keeps track of what models are in what cases. For example, the Cadillac Elmiraj was first available in the K case, and was carried over to the L case. It's a really good idea to keep track of what cases have what castings so you know what to look for. Some castings are extremely hard to come by due to scalpers. The letter simply denotes what case it is. It may seem confusing at first, but the case letters are a lifesaver when searching for certain Hot Wheels. It's odd they don't make an app for that."
HotWheels,3c2mf3,Gumball_Machine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:52:03 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, and thank you so much for the informative reply. I've wondered for a long time what it meant."
HotWheels,3c0vvh,ImUnfazed,5,Fri Jul 3 19:14:15 2015 UTC,Right! They aren't THs.
HotWheels,3c0vvh,Helomyname,5,Fri Jul 3 19:15:47 2015 UTC,Those years has actual TH cards
HotWheels,3c0vvh,Red_Shoto,4,Fri Jul 3 19:23:10 2015 UTC,As others have said they are not TH's. That logo became the TH icon a few years later up till then it was a generic logo.
HotWheels,3c118t,ImUnfazed,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:56:13 2015 UTC,I also have a Homer that I forgot to include in the picture...
HotWheels,3c118t,PushcartPops,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:56:48 2015 UTC,What do you want for the tesla and the Evolution?
HotWheels,3c118t,Jawnzzz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:58:20 2015 UTC,Something Japanese. Let me know what you have. I also have a blue tesla and a plain gray and red Eco if you'd rather have those..
HotWheels,3c118t,Jawnzzz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:00:09 2015 UTC,I need that white Evo. What do you need for trades?
HotWheels,3bvsj2,LoneWolfPR,3,Thu Jul 2 15:39:53 2015 UTC,"Just for transparency, I do work at the museum, but I don't make anything off the sales. I just thought collector's would be interested."
HotWheels,3bvsj2,akeniscool,3,Thu Jul 2 15:45:25 2015 UTC,Thank you! I knew about the car but wasn't aware it was being made available online. Definitely going to pick a couple up. :)
HotWheels,3bvsj2,JoeBobbyWii,3,Thu Jul 2 16:50:40 2015 UTC,I'd consider it but $7 shipping for a car is insane imo.
HotWheels,3bvsj2,ThaddeusJP,2,Thu Jul 2 18:22:09 2015 UTC,"Its a flat rate so you could, in theory, order more (up to 9) and its still $7."
HotWheels,3bvsj2,bored-as-usual,3,Thu Jul 2 18:59:50 2015 UTC,$55.65 for 9 cars (most you can order online) and the shipping does in fact stay at the flat rate.
HotWheels,3bvsj2,FiteMeIRLm8,2,Thu Jul 2 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"that's cheap as hell for people in canada, when i buy cars off ebay it usually costs $15-20 to ship one car"
HotWheels,3bvsj2,ThaddeusJP,2,Thu Jul 2 21:13:39 2015 UTC,Expect these to be cleared out if one of the bigger Hotwheels or diecast blogs get this info.  Seriously. Collectors love exclusive stuff.
HotWheels,3bvsj2,bored-as-usual,3,Thu Jul 2 17:05:02 2015 UTC,It seems they have a ton. 20 in store and 9 online is the limit so I think they are prepared for them to sell (hopefully)
HotWheels,3bvsj2,ThaddeusJP,2,Thu Jul 2 19:33:36 2015 UTC,"If this gets picked up by THunted or Lamely, I think they will sell out."
HotWheels,3bvsj2,bored-as-usual,3,Thu Jul 2 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"They will,  this is for a good cause though and its pretty fairly priced to start"
HotWheels,3bvsj2,ThaddeusJP,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:58:55 2015 UTC,I agree. Shipping being a flat rate makes it nice.
HotWheels,3bvsj2,FiteMeIRLm8,3,Fri Jul 3 04:19:42 2015 UTC,The hell isa this? Error 9999: Failed AVS ( address and/or zipcode ) Check. i get that when i go to checkout.   can this not be shipped to canada or something?
HotWheels,3bvsj2,DarkEibhlin,2,Thu Jul 2 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"I saw this on Hot Wheels' Twitter account, and thought it was only sold at the museum. Ordered two so I can open one and add it to the rest of my cars!"
HotWheels,3bvsj2,PNDJ,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:54:55 2015 UTC,Got mine ordered. Thanks for the info!
HotWheels,3brr8z,pugaboy89,6,Wed Jul 1 16:53:11 2015 UTC,If my nearest walmarts looked like that I would crap my pants.   Mine look like a tornado went through or everything is in a dump bin. And nothing is new.
HotWheels,3brr8z,redhotlama,2,Wed Jul 1 18:48:04 2015 UTC,mine was a dump bin. the last case (k?) was too. it sucks that they leave 2 year old cars on the pegs and dump the new stuff. i still need to find a 918 without a bent card.
HotWheels,3brr8z,WitBeer,2,Wed Jul 1 20:05:55 2015 UTC,This store is normally the same way. Just got lucky I guess.
HotWheels,3brr8z,Futureproofed,2,Wed Jul 1 21:30:58 2015 UTC,"Same, and even the good Walmart I was going to got hit by probable scalpers recently. Every single Fast and the Furious and Porsche  car... suddenly gone. Grr."
HotWheels,3brr8z,WitBeer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:26:55 2015 UTC,i haven't seen the FnF cars at all. i hope they're just very late considering they're not worth much to scalpers.
HotWheels,3brr8z,thedonaldiam,4,Thu Jul 2 15:02:00 2015 UTC,Peg warmers here...
HotWheels,3brr8z,VinnydaSaint,4,Wed Jul 1 18:57:35 2015 UTC,DAMMMNNNN! That is a site. Wish the places I shop at stocked those.

HotWheels,3bsk0u,MotionRide,3,Wed Jul 1 20:17:41 2015 UTC,Loved it! I think it would be even better a little more sped up.

HotWheels,3brhs5,IamPatch,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:45:11 2015 UTC,"Nice shots. Welly makes really great models, but so many of them are downright impossible to find or sold only in regional markets...  I have one of their Kias and I want the rest."
HotWheels,3brhs5,Futureproofed,2,Thu Jul 2 01:45:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, their models actually have very good castings with decent details, for the price.  They go for $1 over here. We got a few models like the london cab, 2CV, Nova, 356 and 930 Porsches, mini cooper, but most of the time it's a red jag or alfa."
HotWheels,3brhs5,Turboimprt3,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:32:52 2015 UTC,I just came back from Poland on a business trip (military tdy) and I bought a ton of Welly cars. They're cheap and the quality is far superior to hot wheels mainlines. I wish they sold them here in my area!
HotWheels,3bp91t,pugaboy89,3,Wed Jul 1 01:29:50 2015 UTC,I remember asking for one of these... was told to just 'use your imagination'.
HotWheels,3bp91t,Sylentbob,2,Wed Jul 1 01:48:32 2015 UTC,That's awesome. How much did you snag that for?
HotWheels,3bp91t,calKno,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:57:01 2015 UTC,Only $2!
HotWheels,3bp91t,tipnitty,2,Wed Jul 1 02:52:02 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. I've been wanting to get some of these to create a ""hotwheels city"" in my spare room. But just don't have the free space!"

HotWheels,3bol1v,Sylentbob,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:46:57 2015 UTC,They were apparently put there to cover up the contest blurb since it's expired.
HotWheels,3bol1v,JoeBobbyWii,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:31:54 2015 UTC,I went and an old lady thought I was buying them for a younger brother. Adults collect them too!

HotWheels,3bp00u,Mx5lower,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:26:56 2015 UTC,I have some extras for sale. Trying to fund a pre-order of the next case....    Heritage for sale
HotWheels,3bp00u,bored-as-usual,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:42:43 2015 UTC,In your opinion is it worth it to pre order the cases?
HotWheels,3bp00u,bored-as-usual,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:48:20 2015 UTC,"It depends on the pieces in the case and what you collect. I collect Datsuns, which I never find on the pegs, so I got a couple datsuns, 1 complete set and then some extras to sell off."
HotWheels,3bp00u,BlitzWing1985,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:53:10 2015 UTC,"At $70-80 it's kinda pricey, I think I would have extras I don't need lol."
HotWheels,3bp00u,pugaboy89,0,Wed Jul 1 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"That's a mainline case. The heritage case is $48 from AandJtoys.com and considering the Datsun 510 in the case are going for $15/each on ebay, it's easy to make the money back if needed."
HotWheels,3bp00u,Helomyname,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:57:36 2015 UTC,sadly I'm in the same boat I know these wont be seen in the UK so I've just ordered my own case. I really enjoy the hunt but in this case I'd just be wasting time if I went out to look for them. I've also ordered my own case and I hope to recoup the costs by selling my unwanted copies.
HotWheels,3bp00u,BlitzWing1985,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:13:29 2015 UTC,How much would you be willing to sell a 510 for?

HotWheels,3bjpzz,tipnitty,2,Mon Jun 29 22:08:57 2015 UTC,They really do have some cool stuff.  The FF sets and Porsche were fun to get.  Not really a fan of the marvel/dc fantasy stuff though.
HotWheels,3bjpzz,ragingduck,2,Mon Jun 29 22:24:41 2015 UTC,"Same here. My girlfriend bought me half of them, and I really don't care to try and find the other ones. But I'm just needing a 2013 F&F set to complete the series. And I'll be watching for these like a hawk. I think the Porsche series had me more excited for Hotwheels than I have in a long time. I hope they do something like this every other month with cool themes. Maybe a Gone in 60 Seconds series next?"

HotWheels,3bix72,V8INT3RC3PTOR,3,Mon Jun 29 16:32:23 2015 UTC,I guess the takeaway here is: we shouldn't speculate on licensing issues or this is an older car that's gotten the custom treatment.
HotWheels,3bix72,canuslide,2,Mon Jun 29 16:50:43 2015 UTC,What you're saying is they had to respray an older car to make this one? I'm interested because I have the 1 of 1 2014 Mexico convention Veyron
HotWheels,3bix72,canuslide,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"No, I have no clue actually; from everything I heard they can't make them anymore BUT that's not to say that they really can't...who knows.  I have also seen really great customs too-so I don't know what I'm looking at really.  The only guy who knows is someone that goes to these conventions."

While this question is entirely objective and will vary for each collector, here are some things I collect:   Certain models (Drag Bus, Dairy Delivery, 55 and 64 Chevy Panels, Dodge A100, Deco Delivery, Thunder Roller, Corvettes, Datsuns, Subarus, and more) Pop Culture and Nostalgia series Retro Entertainment (now just called Entertainment) Series RLC exclusive cars, emphasis on Real Riders Convention cars, emphasis on any specific models I collect Treasure Hunts that I like. Not every single one (maybe eventually I'll slowly amass them, but not a primary goal), but I'll pick them up if I find them, or get the supers if it's a model I particularly enjoy. Sometimes whatever I think is neat. Kool Kombis, anything with the Gulf livery, etc.    How do you know that they are special?   Research, supply and demand, market values, etc. Treasure Hunts are inherently more ""special"", although basic TH fantasy cars are not worth much more than normal cars. Super treasure hunts and older TH are always sought after. Some RLC and Convention cars are popular and worth a good amount of money. Japanese cars (JDM) are very popular at the moment, and have a good market value (which annoys me because of scalpers).  There is a TON to learn about the Hot Wheels collectors market, and you will continue to find new things you never knew existed for quite a while. Just keep looking at this subreddit, blogs, other resources (South Texas Diecast for example, in the sidebar), and you'll develop your own tastes and desires.  Welcome to the addiction!"

Craiglist- you'll get low balls and probably sit awhile but usually they will buy whole lots.   This sub- usually if you put them on here people will want certain ones but you will go through quite a bit.   Ebay- ebay will get you the most money and the most interest but also take the most time to get the best price.    If your wanting the most money then price each one or whole series, if you just want them gone then do bulk prices.

HotWheels,3asgvg,Musenge,2,Tue Jun 23 03:39:51 2015 UTC,"It kind depends on the area and what you're interested in. Here in LA, people seem to be scooping up any JDM cars that have been recently released. I have yet to see any datsun wagon on any peg at any store- 2014 or 2015. The same holds true for the recent NA NSX, any civic, and the 2014 mainline kenmeri. Also depending on store, the premium lines will be somewhat hard to find. The stores near me don't stock up on them too often, so when I go they'll have early batches , have the same stock sit there for months, then all of a sudden, BAM we skipped three cases and have the latest one out. Plus some lines are store exclusive. I know you said you weren't US, but , for example, Walmart has an exclusive Porsche collection  and special ""zamac"" cars in certain batches."

HotWheels,3ajqig,rick_mcdingus,2,Sat Jun 20 21:41:02 2015 UTC,All of my local stores have been empty for months! So frustrating!
HotWheels,3ajqig,BioluminescentCrotch,2,Sun Jun 21 00:28:52 2015 UTC,"I know. Before this, I haven't bought anything since April because all the stores around me were filled with stuff from old cases that I either didn't want or already had. Also I was busy with other things so I didn't have time to go to stores just for hunting but it didn't matter because the same cars would sit in the same spots on the pegs for weeks at a time. It's like no one was buying any Hot Wheels"
HotWheels,3ajqig,BioluminescentCrotch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:54:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I only have a Target and a WalMart close to me. Actually, my latest haul was from Safeway, of all places. Found a Batmobile I didn't have, a new 370Z, and a nice Mustang. They're twice the price there though >_<"
HotWheels,3ajqig,Futureproofed,2,Sun Jun 21 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"Mine too, or just old stuff nobody wants to buy, lots of ugly  fantasy models both Hot Wheels and Matchbox. One nearby Wal-Mart has had the same Acura NSX Concept hanging in the exact same spot for like a month. I can tell because of how the tampo is messed up. Toys 'r' Us, too... weird."
HotWheels,3ajqig,BioluminescentCrotch,2,Sun Jun 21 01:15:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I only buy actual cars, or special edition ones like Curiosity Rover or The Homer or something."

HotWheels,3afjnl,Pumphrey,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:08:50 2015 UTC,One question. Why do the Dodge trucks have different names on the cards? They're the exact same castings.
HotWheels,3afjnl,IamPatch,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"I believe the one called Li'l Red Express was originally released just as a red coloured truck (possibly had some historic significance?).  The 78 Dodge was exactly that, a generic 78 Dodge pick up.  They just kept the names even after the new paint jobs."
HotWheels,3afjnl,PushcartPops,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:19:07 2015 UTC,The Lil Red was an actual special edition truck that Dodge put out in 78 that had the stacks and the gold decals on the doors.

HotWheels,3a85fw,SpeedyCarz66,2,Thu Jun 18 00:40:50 2015 UTC,"It's mostly just water soluble acrylic paints. the ones they have at Walmart for around $1 each work fine, you just have to be sure to get the finish you want.

HotWheels,39s999,Mcwando,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:53:57 2015 UTC,"It does my head in that Hotwheels won't release some of these Batmobiles without the flashy graphics down the sides.   You can get them unmolested in the special Batman series last year, but they weren't great. The Tim Burton Batmobile is, unfathomably, the morphed version and the overall paint job wasn't black on some, but dark blue."
HotWheels,39s999,devensega,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:18:00 2015 UTC,"I guess it's due to their tendency to not release the same car in the same deco more than once. I've got the original Burton movie Batmobile in all black from the initial release, but I don't think they've done it that way again since. Ditto for the 2003 toyline Batmobile design. They get around that with a few models like the classic TV series version though, so who knows?"

HotWheels,39s2ff,DrunkenFist,2,Sun Jun 14 05:14:13 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that, since there isn't much in the way of tampo work on the sides, there was room in the budget to do the headlights on this model. The front and rear tampos are usually skipped when there's a lot of design work on the sides."

I've seen regular mainlines with a higher sought-after level recently, though, so I certainly agree that regular TH are somewhat failing with collectors.  I really like some of the supers lately, though. Kombi, 599XX, Corolla, Mooneyes van. Very cool cars."

HotWheels,39hdaf,ThaddeusJP,6,Thu Jun 11 18:50:50 2015 UTC,"Its sad that the best reason to get rid of them is to kill the ugly side of collecting a $1 kids toy.  IMO just release an end of year set with all the supers in a nice box like they have before. BUT let us pre-order it   the whole year so no mad rushes, 2 sets per-customer max and dont limit the production just have a cut off date. That way collectors get their toys and scalpers get a kick to the nuts. Plus for those who want a hunt you can still go out try to find them at retail before the end of year sets are released."
HotWheels,39hdaf,BlitzWing1985,-1,Thu Jun 11 20:13:44 2015 UTC,"Two sets per customer.  No problem.  I have a wife and two kids, some friends and family that can get deliveries too."
HotWheels,39hdaf,MidWestMind,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:40:16 2015 UTC,"Why bother? When everyone preorders, they'll make plenty. With plenty of supply, the values will stay low. Who's going to pay $30 for one super when you can get the whole set for that?"
HotWheels,39hdaf,WitBeer,0,Fri Jun 12 04:49:07 2015 UTC,"Because not every will.   Back in 2002 Hotwheels did a promo thing with Lucky Charms and Wheaties for VW Buses.

I can imagine the joy not only in the adults face, but also the child's face as they pull the slightly more metallic collectable off the pegs. Its a thrill to go through a bin or pegs and find it just sitting there."

HotWheels,39hdaf,Rorbotron,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"This is why I loved the series collection when they came out.  Back then when I needed the Real Riders Peterbuilt truck, I was so excited to find a mainline to finish the series."
HotWheels,39hdaf,MidWestMind,2,Thu Jun 11 21:38:20 2015 UTC,"I'm about 50/50. I was searching through the store one day and the stock person said he had 2 cases to bring out if I was interested. I WAS PUMPED! He brought out 2 boxes that had been rifled through and there was only fantasy or boring mainlines in there. I was so sad. The only store in my town that sell them, and people are going through them in the back. Makes sense why I've found so few worth while (to my collecting taste) in this store. It took me 22 years and I finally found a super and a thunt in the same day, at a store 2 hours away. Makes collecting in a small town very difficult. But that's just me."
HotWheels,39hdaf,tipnitty,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"Sometimes small town collecting can be hard, but sometimes it is the absolute best thing, if noone working there collects. Where my grandma lives, a small town in poland, i was able to snatch a couple of deloreans and some tresure hunts and the pegs in toy shops were full. Thsts because the only people buying are kids looking for toys, and thats great if youre a collector."
HotWheels,39hdaf,Helomyname,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:15:52 2015 UTC,Agreed. I've had one really great score and it was in a small town store. But the town I live in is horrible. Guess it just depends. But I have a good idea of where to do within a 2 hour radius lol.
HotWheels,39hdaf,tipnitty,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:24:00 2015 UTC,"No f'in way.  Its a large part of the reason people hunt.  I have a substantial collection and when ive found a super it sticks out in your memory in a big way.  Just recently i didnt find a super but instead the vw caddy iVe been looking for, for a while.  It made my day, something so simple made my day.  If people want to be idiots about supers let them be BUT id wager they are in a pretty staunch minority.  Ive never been witness to someone harassing a employee and ive been collecting for well over 20 years.  My dad started me out at 18 months and im now 32  im certain it happens but its not common place.  Leave the supers, they are amazing to find in the ""wild""."
HotWheels,39hdaf,Rorbotron,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:56:42 2015 UTC,My target had to put up signs telling the customers that they're not checking the back for more boxes or specific cars. That means they've had a bunch of shitty customers.

HotWheels,39hdaf,Rorbotron,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:13:25 2015 UTC,"Same, been collecting since '91 and going to shows, meet ups and what not pre Internet.   When they started the series sets in 95 gave Hotwheels a huge boost and treasure hunt series was a goddamn genius idea.    We would ask employees but never harassed them.   If they wouldn't let us cherry pick, no big deal.  Others would.  I know saying this will get me down voted, but to be the first to get new cars you had to be a little sly.  Setting up at shows had its advantages because we got to cherry pick other people's finds as well before the public was let in.    Have I seen heated arguments over finds before, yes.  But it was the asshole of the club and we all knew who they were.   It's not a huge group so you can be singled out in s hurry in our area if you acted like that."
HotWheels,39hdaf,MidWestMind,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"I don't hit the shows often but I've been to a few and I've also had employees let my dad and I when I was little look through cases without even asking.  We would ask on occasion as well and sometimes it worked, other times it didn't.  My dad and I in the summer would go out in the middle of the night sometime when we couldn't sleep or were just up later than normal.  Treasure hunts, supers and the rare mainlines are the reason people continue to collect.  Eliminating them would be a huge mistake.  I also have no idea why you would be downvoted and it seems there is a very small contingent that runs around this sub downvoting.  I expect it in certain subs BUT here with s bunch of people collecting?  I don't understand it.  I've had posts I'd never expect in a million years to get downvoted get downvoted.  I don't give a damn about my karma but  I'd love to see downvotes discouraged here as some seem to be given without much thought.  Edit:  there are less than 1500 people here as subs.  I would think we could rise above the downvotes and burying stuff with them.  Talking out the differences in opinion would probably be best for the sub."
HotWheels,39hdaf,Rorbotron,2,Thu Jun 11 19:37:42 2015 UTC,The meta in here is anti flipper.   That's how I supported my hobby for so long.
HotWheels,39hdaf,MidWestMind,0,Thu Jun 11 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"Yea I mean no one likes a scalper BUT sometimes that's the only way to get the cars you really want.  I can provide the inverse of that with a post of mine being downvoted regarding the new Porsche set.  I said if i stumbled upon multiple complete sets I'd buy one to open for my son and one to keep rather than buying a majority of the stock.  Downvotes set awarded lol.  We have a small community here, downvotes shouldn't be a part of it.  Edit: and resellers don't need to be put in a negative light.  Hell when I found this place one of the first things I thought about was buying stuff that was harder to find in other areas but abundant here just for the purpose of straight up trading.  I don't need to make a profit.  I never downvote here unless someone is being ridiculous."
HotWheels,39hdaf,Rorbotron,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:23:55 2015 UTC,"True.    I have paid more than shelf price on many cars as well.  It's part of the game.  If I want it bad enough and can't find it in the wild, I'll fork out the extra cash.   I never have and never will fork out 75 bucks or so on a goddamn club car.   People need to realize it's like the stock market.  Prices raise and fall upon demand, not how many were produced.  Right now look at all the redlines and black walls that dropped in the early 2000's and haven't climbed back up at all.    Those years consist of people that wanted them now have them.  People who exited out of the hobby and liquidated their stuff.   Now those years are floating in this abyss where they are kind of cool to newer collectors but don't have the nostalgia value they had 10+ years ago.  In 1993 I paid 20 bucks for an original green Deora, today on eBay it's about the same.  *Note this is general and doesn't not include examples like the Road King Truck and other rarer cars."

HotWheels,39hdaf,WitBeer,0,Fri Jun 12 04:55:17 2015 UTC,Defeats the purpose of hunting doesn't it? A huge part of the collecting is the hunt for the rare stuff.  If you take that element away collecting loses a lot of its luster.
HotWheels,39hdaf,Rorbotron,2,Fri Jun 12 18:09:00 2015 UTC,"The hunt has no appeal for me. I just want one of each of the cars I want. If I could preorder every casting I want for the year, I'd do it today, and I'd even be willing to pay more for it."
HotWheels,39hdaf,WitBeer,0,Fri Jun 12 21:31:00 2015 UTC,Definitely too each their own.  In my eyes collecting has always been a matter of searching for the elusive pieces in whatever it is you are collecting.  If I could just sit back and buy it all it would be far less interesting.
HotWheels,39hdaf,Rorbotron,2,Fri Jun 12 22:45:53 2015 UTC,"Downvote? Once again I don't give a damn about my karma.  Give me 20 more on that comment BUT seriously?  Soo you disagree and that's fine.  Whomever is running around downvoting comments in this sub needs to get a grip.  Is this an adult sub or are we going for more of the recess ""nah uh"" feel?"
HotWheels,39hdaf,Rorbotron,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:49:21 2015 UTC,"If they get rid of super hunts, then they should scale back the amount of treasure hunts. Like 1995 to 2006 or when ever they changed it."

HotWheels,393l0e,mariusthemighty,2,Tue Jun 9 03:15:28 2015 UTC,"Some constructive criticism on photographing your cars, clean and polish them first.  I use Turtle Wax Ice polish, it dries clear and protects the paint from chipping but mostly you want to get all of the fly poop and lint off of your cars.  You can get the lighting and focus down great, but that piece of lint now looks 64 times bigger.    BTW, you and I have similar excellent taste in cars."

HotWheels,394buv,Msnge,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"what to buy? you buy whatever you feel like buying, collecting isn't always about collecting the most valuable cars. Just buy whatever peaks your interest. You can't just buy a super th in the stores, you'll be lucky to find one. but if you want to buy one you can buy them on ebay and they ship all over the world The porsche series is worth what you paid for it, maybe in 10 years it'll be worth double. but it's not that valuable."

HotWheels,394buv,Helomyname,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:29:57 2015 UTC,I feel like the porsche series might end up being quite valuable since scalpers take all the cars and the supply tends to be quite low
HotWheels,394buv,WitBeer,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:08:55 2015 UTC,"unlikely. there's tons of them. even resellers are getting $17 shipped per set. after shipping and fees, that's maybe $2 profit, and that's without factoring in time and gas. also, we have a history on these with the corvette and mustang series from the past 2 years. those are easily found for cheap, with the exception of the z06 in the corvette series."
HotWheels,394buv,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:21:42 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about what's valuable.  You'll go mad trying to figure it out.  Trust me, you won't know what's ""rare"" or valuable until 2-3 years after it's released.  Some cars that were hard to find when they came out 5 years ago are worth peanuts today, and some cars that were peg-warmers (in other words very common) years ago are currently bringing crazy money on ebay.  The market is very unpredictable so my advice to you is don't even try.  Just buy what you enjoy!"

Variables to sort and categorize by could include: Year, car name, Line name (mainline, flying customs, etc), #/Line, Series name, #/Series, Variation (Treasure Hunt, Super, odd variation such as roll cage vs no roll cage, etc), Years casting is also available in, have/want/trade, comments"

It did come with a set of Billstein sports and Bav Auto lowering springs though so at least it'll look good.   I'll get a couple of years out of it and then put it out of it's misery.

HotWheels,3854zk,billygoatfrontflip,4,Mon Jun 1 22:44:40 2015 UTC,You could try price guides but the best way to estimate a price is to look at ended auctions on ebay to see what people are paying for them

HotWheels,3854zk,rvsunp,2,Tue Jun 2 00:34:15 2015 UTC,Looking at individual vehicles eBay is pretty much going to be you're best bet.  If you posted an album some people might point some of the less common vehicles. Things could still be missed and I don't see many people pricing out large portions of vehicles for you. Though some may have rough ideas of what certain pieces may be worth so it couldn't hurt.

Most money- if you want the most money use ebay, doing it indivually, or by year, or certain car groups or just large lots. Ebay will be the most.   Quickest- the quick and easy way is craiglist. Just say how many you have with a few pics and set a base price. Be prepared for low balls, like super low as well as people wanting only half and things like that.   Slowest- the slowest option would be here and then ebay and then craiglist. Put them up here and let the people get go through the pics and say what they like and what not. Whatever is left send to ebay or craiglist.   The best option is to take the rare ones and put them in a separate list or pile. Then try to organize a little. Easiest way is by year or groups (muscle, tuner, fantasy). It's easier for people to look and for you to sell that way."

Search for the casting, it likely is named on the bottom of the base.  For example, I will use this Subaru Impreza that is sitting next to me.  It is a white car with red and black tampos (the graphics) with the number 13.  So in the Google window on the right hand side about 2/3 of the way down, I search ""Subaru Impreza"" and get this result;  http://www.southtexasdiecast.com/hwguide/subaruimpreza.html  I can see all of the different releases in a database, and from this I see that my Impreza is from the ""Track Stars"" release of 2007.  Now, you will notice that the value on this car assigned by the website is $1. That is not an accurate number.  I appreciate their willingness to try to keep track of values, but the database is so large that keeping it accurate and updated would be a huge task.  So I don't blame them for being inaccurate.  If you want to know an actual market value of a car, my recommendation is to check ""Sold"" listings on eBay.   Sort the listings by price + shipping and you'll get something looking like this;  http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?LH_Complete=1&LH_Sold=1&_from=R40&_sacat=0&_nkw=hot+wheels+subaru+impreza+track+stars&_sop=15  Some people don't do well in auctions for whatever reason, some people do very well. I average out between high and low results and base my expectations of the value off of that. In this case, a mint car on card would be worth around $6."

HotWheels,37q6i0,slytim,1 point,Fri May 29 15:01:00 2015 UTC,"Whole collections sell to the right buyer. Someone who has the capacity to flip them more individually for a profit (e.g., individuals, variety stores), someone who wants to expand their collection dramatically in one swoop, etc.  Selling a large collection usually means bulk pricing, though. The last large collection I bought was $0.50 per car, and that's even on the high side. If you have good documentation about what's in the collection and know what things are worth, you can negotiate a better deal for yourself ($0.50 for a bunch of Treasure Hunts, for example, is very cheap). Redlines are in a different league than more modern cars, which I am not very experienced in. Those can go for a lot more money, though, so I would be diligent with those.  In my opinion, you have to make the decision of what's more important: selling everything quickly, or getting the most money for the lot that you can. The latter will take more effort on your part to determine a value, but naturally result in a higher sales price."
HotWheels,37q6i0,akeniscool,1 point,Fri May 29 16:17:22 2015 UTC,"So usually I break it Down into 3 categories.    Most money- if you want the most money use ebay,  doing it indivually,  or by year,  or certain car groups or just large lots. Ebay will be the most.   Quickest- the quick and easy way is craiglist. Just say how many you have with a few pics and set a base price.  Be prepared for low balls, like super low as well as people wanting only half and things like that.   Slowest- the slowest option would be here and then ebay and then craiglist.  Put them up here and let the people get go through the pics and say what they like and what not. Whatever is left send to ebay or craiglist.   The best option is to take the rare ones and put them in a separate list or pile.  Then try to organize a little. Easiest way is by year or groups  (muscle, tuner, fantasy). It's easier for people to look and for you to sell that way."
HotWheels,37q6i0,bored-as-usual,1 point,Fri May 29 17:55:15 2015 UTC,"Sell the thunts as a lot by year. Sell all the similar cars together, like all corvettes. The remainder, sell as one giant lot. If you sell one at a time, it'll take you months or years. Just use eBay and take good photos."

You can report them to either the toy dept manager, or if you suspect he's in on it you can go to the store manager.  One of my local WalMarts had a night shift assistant manager who was a ""collector"".  I was chatting with one of the stockers around 3am and told her how bad my luck was at this store.  She casually mentioned that ""Steve"" made sure all the really rare toys never made it to the floor.  I called the store manager and reported what I'd heard the next afternoon.  That was about 2 years ago and since then, my hit/miss ratio for good stuff has surprisingly massively increased at that store!  I still chat with the same stocker and Steve is assistant managing another department.  Missing out on hunts to earlier shoppers sucks. But in this situation, you don't even get a chance to win.  It's not just shitty, it's highly unethical.  I can't imagine why they'd stop doing it unless they get called out.  That's just my 2 cents though.  Good luck and happy hunting!"
HotWheels,373y88,FeltchingBlumpkin,3,Sun May 24 19:06:54 2015 UTC,"So, you were going to look through the boxes and pick out the treasure hunts and were upset because someone else already did? You sure it was a manager and not another customer?  I speak from a point of sympathy, as I live in south Orange County and all our walmarts are paid off by scalpers. If I'm lucky I'll find something cool at rite-aid or ralphs."
HotWheels,373y88,xenocomagain,4,Sun May 24 20:05:05 2015 UTC,"Not so much another customer, but an employee. They helped bring cases out from their back stock but that had already been rummaged through. Possibly not a manager, but most likely an employee.   That being said I have a feeling the stores around my area deal with the same problem. All of the surrounding Wally's or targets or TRUs  seemed to have gotten cases devoid of kenmeris, 510 wagons, and toyota supras."
HotWheels,373y88,otakutaikun,1 point,Sun May 24 20:15:55 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's unfortunate. :(
HotWheels,373y88,xenocomagain,2,Sun May 24 20:20:04 2015 UTC,No as I said the guy that brought it back that said it was opened in the back before it came out was the boss I was told to ask if we could put some cars on the shelf it was almost empty. If it was opened by another customer that's fine with me first come first serve the fact that he mentioned there was 72 cars inside and they had just opened it in the back was fishy.
HotWheels,373y88,toscott_2000,1 point,Mon May 25 02:43:46 2015 UTC,This happens to 3 Walmarts in my area of Fort Worth. Managers here doesn't give a damn.
HotWheels,373y88,BlitzWing1985,1 point,Sun May 24 23:43:45 2015 UTC,Have you guys ever opened a 72 count box and not gotten at least a treasure hunt? 2 in a row lo
HotWheels,373y88,WitBeer,1 point,Mon May 25 02:46:33 2015 UTC,It really sucks that the whole hunting aspect that both Mattel and Fans love is killed by some ass hole who has nothing better to do then scalp toys while at work.  Saying that its Walmart so unless its the manager he's earning f**k all and its most likely the only source of fun in his life so I really just pity the guy.
HotWheels,373y88,tipnitty,1 point,Mon May 25 19:06:34 2015 UTC,"honestly, i just suck it up for that reason. the guy's probably making $7 per hour. if he needs to risk his job for a few extra bucks, then he can have it. not that i'm happy about that, but this is just a hobby after all."

HotWheels,373ey1,himbimbly,2,Sun May 24 16:04:05 2015 UTC,Aw man. I was gonna consider offering you something for the corvette.
HotWheels,373ey1,toscott_2000,2,Sun May 24 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"They are worthless, can I have them? Lol.....seriously the first pic with the green van and the black corvette are real riders with rubber tires. You have something there. I think you have another real rider I there somewhere. The Matchbox cars may be worth a few bucks. On the bottom it would say Lesney with a number. You can use that data and check with ebay. Seems as if you may have a few worth something."
HotWheels,373ey1,canuslide,2,Sun May 24 17:25:05 2015 UTC,I dig the old semi+trailer and general lee; sooo cool.  I use to have those when I was little...

HotWheels,36zrbx,PushcartPops,2,Sat May 23 20:13:25 2015 UTC,That's awesome.  Same reason I had 3 loose Veyrons and a few R34s. They were just plain old 93 cent cars at Target.

HotWheels,36zrbx,PushcartPops,2,Sat May 23 20:33:45 2015 UTC,A white one? The burgundy one isn't as sought after right now.
HotWheels,36zrbx,WaddleWaddleMofo,2,Sun May 24 11:15:21 2015 UTC,It was the burgundy! Glad I didn't miss out then. Is there anyway to check the rarity/collectors value on them? Tried Hotwheels wiki and I can't seem to find info from there

Might take me a few tries, but when you hunt regularly it becomes a lot easier.  It can be more difficult for some people, just depending on how many collectors are in the area, how often new products come in, how many stores get them, etc. Being in a large metro area, I have my pick of the litter when it comes to stores.  Speaking of - those green 620s are all over the place by me. :-p"

HotWheels,36wn1d,canuslide,1 point,Sat May 23 02:58:17 2015 UTC,I have a 240z... And 2 green pickups.  Would that be a fair trade for your 2 green lambos?

HotWheels,35m0qh,ThaddeusJP,10,Mon May 11 16:40:07 2015 UTC,"shameless cut and paste comment I made on another site  I'm going to put on my tin foil hat and say the guy stumbled on a massive TH theft ring. Factory workers rather then cramming single cars down their pants pack TH's in a single box to sneak out the door with the normal boxes. It's sealed just like any other box but maybe they mark the box to make it easy to spot later. Then maybe at the distribution centre some guy finds the box, picks it out and sends it to a faux retailer who now sells the TH's for a ebay prices."
HotWheels,35m0qh,BlitzWing1985,5,Mon May 11 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"You know back when I was kid picking up cars I would never have considered that, but after collecting as an adult, and all the shady stuff I've read about and seen I cant say its not possible."
HotWheels,35m0qh,FeltchingBlumpkin,5,Mon May 11 18:49:06 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  You'll notice that the newest THunt releases available on eBay are mostly shipped by the same 4-5 people out of Malaysia.
HotWheels,35m0qh,yanchovilla,6,Tue May 12 01:23:39 2015 UTC,"...and promptly bought them all. Great find, but makes me pretty salty. Have to say I wouldn't have bought them all."

I'm not gonna act like I would've only bought one, I probably would have walked out with 8-10 of them, one to keep, the others for trade fodder and to give to a few friends and kids. Damn sure wouldn't have bought them all. But it is what it is, and there are bigger problems in the world to be worrying about."

HotWheels,35m0qh,Lancer007az,2,Tue May 12 01:22:14 2015 UTC,True. We all know the next guy would take them all.

HotWheels,35m0qh,pixelsandpixels,3,Mon May 11 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"I see your downvoted but I'd do the same. Lets face it collecting supers means if you ever get a double you know you can trade it later. That's what I'd do, I know I could easily flip these for all the supers I've missed over the years. I dare say every collector I've talked to would do the same.  The only time its really sad if the seller were to start selling them at $20 a pop online."
HotWheels,35m0qh,TwoproApps,2,Mon May 11 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"As much as we all want to say we would leave a super on the peg, I think we all know we would take what we could find if there were doubles or triples.    72 though, damn I dont have the money to drop $75+ on a bunch of cars.

HotWheels,35ekb2,iandoge,1 point,Sat May 9 16:09:26 2015 UTC,"What do you need to know? I can answer questions if you have any.   Just go to your local store with hotwheels and pick up what you like :) Blind bags/mystery modes (whatever you want to call them) are definitely a thing, there were some every year, dont think we have any YET this year though. You can still probably find some of the older ones somewhere, i've had some luck with blind cars here in the UK in smaller toy shops, and at Wilko (£2 a piece for blind packs there though)  EDIT: Apparently 2015 blind bags are a thing already!"
HotWheels,35ekb2,Helomyname,2,Sat May 9 20:03:40 2015 UTC,W00T for bling bag things. Do they sell at Walmart or target?
HotWheels,35ekb2,Helomyname,1 point,Sun May 10 04:19:33 2015 UTC,"Being in the UK i have no idea since we have neither of those stores. I suggest you just go and check out what every chain near you has, since i imagine it is different in every area of the US anyways."
HotWheels,35ekb2,Rorbotron,1 point,Sun May 10 12:29:16 2015 UTC,I've never seen the blind bags in the states and its been a long time since I've seen the mystery cars with the card.  As far as getting back in I would just start looking in stores and buying what you think looks cool.  You can also research which cars are treasure hunts for this run so you can see what to look for when searching.  I've been collecting the cool classics for the last year or so and buying the cars that I like while keeping an eye out for t hunts and t hunt supers.

HotWheels,35ah9u,canuslide,1 point,Fri May 8 14:04:20 2015 UTC,ok thanks but this is on a 1979 flying colors France card so it is an error then?
HotWheels,35ah9u,canuslide,2,Fri May 8 14:20:51 2015 UTC,right...something tells me that it's normal for cars back then; I'd look for other cars in the same 82 line and see what backs are common.  For some manufacturer to have that many leftover 1979 cards in 1982 to accidentally use them doesn't seem plausible.
HotWheels,35ah9u,canuslide,1 point,Fri May 8 14:23:24 2015 UTC,Right i have looked into it and there is nothing like it any idea on the value?
HotWheels,35ah9u,canuslide,2,Fri May 8 14:28:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I would just be guessing and I am kinda new to this but if I had to guess...I'd say that because it is easy to remove and reattach blister packs and because it's such an odd error (if it is an error) I would think that it is only worth a couple dollars over what the car is worth in it's original package and only if you find the right buyer-not everyone buys error cars and usually almost never having to do with the package and more with the tampos and paint.

HotWheels,34vgfz,SnideTheClyde,5,Mon May 4 22:03:29 2015 UTC,"By the sound of it, you're not interested in parting it out.  That means you're looking for someone who buys collections, and believe it or not there are people who part out diecast collections for a living.  You can find these people on various diecast buy/sell/trade websites and forums but finding a buyer greatly depends on where you're located.  The kind of buyer you're looking for is regional (""looking to buy collections in the upper pacific northwest area"" for example) but some will go the extra mile (quite literally) depending on what you have to sell.  Since ebay was a bust then you're going to be looking for someone to buy these in person.    Here are some websites you can check out in your search for a buyer.   Beware that some of these sites require registration and approval of your account by an administrator before you can join (too many scammers out there so they try to keep out the riff-raff).    Want/Trade ads at The Toy Peddler  TTP is a very well known diecast buy/sell/trade website.  That's your best bet.  Contact some of the folks with ""collections wanted"" ads and if they aren't interested in what you have, ask if they know someone who is.  Those kinds of buyers know people all around the country.    Diecastaway a busy and popular diecast B/S/T forum.  All accounts require approval to join but if you strike out at The Toy Peddler it's your next best bet.  CFR it not as popular as the sites listed above, and folks there are mostly looking for older diecast (pre-1980), but if all else fails it's worth a shot.    Also, you should know up front that your collection- assuming it is actually 10,000 cars- is worth somewhere between $1500 and $4,000 USD, depending on the condition of the cards (just so you know, some wear on the cardboard is OK, but mold and water damage can be a deal breaker when looking for someone to buy the lot as a whole).  If that number sounds low to you, keep in mind that parting out a collection that size is a shit-ton of work.    A shit-ton of work.  Pardon my language.  Also, cars from the 1990s and early 2000s in general are very low on the totem pole of diecast desirability.  The main exception to that rule are Treasure Hunts from the '90s.  1995 Treasure Hunt  ('95 was the first year of the treasure hunt cars)  I didn't see any treasure hunts in your photos but there might be some buried in there, maybe in a separate box.  A complete 1995 Treasure Hunt set (12 cars) fetches around $1,000 alone.  Just a little FYI.    Good luck!"
HotWheels,34vgfz,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Mon May 4 22:48:41 2015 UTC,"I actually would prefer to part it out, well that is the cars that are worth more than the average car. The problem is identifying those ones that are the rarities. I've already learned a little about how some cars have varying wheels, color interiors and tinted windows and how that that can increase the rarity.    Treasure hunts I'm aware of but I've only found 4 ('04 super smooth x4). There are still some cars in the shed so I may have better luck finding more in there.      Luckily, I haven't seen any mold or water damage whatsoever, just tears and bends in the card and plastic. :D     Also, I've been able to piece together about 25-30 of the 4 car series' from like '95 to about '99. I'm sure there are more complete series' from later dates but I already got my hands full with those at the moment. As I've asked another guy that replied, would it be frowned upon to sell these sets here on this subreddit or is there another one specifically for selling?   Thanks for your response."

HotWheels,34vgfz,bored-as-usual,1 point,Tue May 5 00:34:42 2015 UTC,I'm going to Pm you a list of things id pay for.
HotWheels,34vgfz,bored-as-usual,3,Tue May 5 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"Normally I would say for the most money ebay, for the quick sale craiglist and for people that love hot wheels here. Normally for the most money you gotta piece them our which I know is a crap ton of work. The next best thing would be to separate them by years, or series. For instance the WCW cars should be sold together, the Johnny lighting cars and so on. If you decide to post here don't be afraid to put a little at a time. Some will sale fast, some will sale slow. Normally the biggest shock to people is that quite a few hot wheels are worth less then $1 or less then they thought.  I know your uncle is need of money sooner then later but my biggest suggestion is to try to at least take your time the best you can for the most best price per car.   EDIT: I'm interested in cars that are odd or unique and exotic cars like ferrari and lamborghini and things like that."
HotWheels,34vgfz,Lancer007az,1 point,Mon May 4 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response. Is it allowed to sell hot wheels here on this subreddit or is there a seperate one for sales only? If that is the case then I think I would like to go that route or even sell to specific people like you or someone else. I'll write your name down and what cars you're looking for and I'll get back with you for sure. Again, thanks for the response. :D"
HotWheels,34vgfz,bored-as-usual,2,Tue May 5 00:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yea you can sale on here. Usually you put trade/sale on the title and people will look at whatever pics you have. I'm your case just put sale so everybody knows and people will go through your pics and let you know what they like. And no problem, 10k cars is a lot to organize so I know the stress involved, every bit of info helps when your starting out. Also any nissan gtr I would be interested in as well as the stuff I put in the first reply lol."

Don't ask me why, they don't say.  Personally I think if you are willing to spend the time properly photographing the items then you will likely do better on ebay for any items actually worth money.  Chances are most cars are worth about .50, but there may be some $50 bills in there."
HotWheels,34vgfz,PushcartPops,2,Tue May 5 06:02:19 2015 UTC,"I'd purchase most if not all of the Ferrari, Lamborghini, and other such exotics for $1.50 each."
HotWheels,34vgfz,ThaddeusJP,1 point,Mon May 4 22:46:51 2015 UTC,Noted. I'll get back with you if I find such cars.   Thanks!
HotWheels,34vgfz,Jawnzzz,2,Tue May 5 00:35:28 2015 UTC,"Echoing what a lot of the other guys have said if, you parted it out you might have a better chance on selling it or at least grouping similar series or types of cars. For example you could sell all the Camaros together all the Corvettes together.  I'm not sure if you're familiar with treasure hunt cars but many of them might be on a card that has a green stripe down the right hand side or says treasure hunt. They are worth more than a regular car.  One suggestion: take them to a hobby stores to see if they might be interested in purchasing any of them (or all of em) or maybe a flea market if you don't want to go the eBay or Craigslist route.  if you look over on the side bar there's a link for South Texas diecast. they have some suggestions of what pricing might be for some of the cars that you have. off the top of my head if you have any Bugatti Veyrons or final run cars they might be worth a little bit more than just a standard main line.  last option of course is to just throw the whole lot up on ebay as one gigantic set. you could just count them all out and do the math: maybe $0.75 a car times however many cars you got and see where that gets you.   Selling one car at a time would be a massive pain in the ass unless you're getting more than 5-7 bucks a car.  Good luck man."
HotWheels,34vgfz,Jawnzzz,2,Mon May 4 22:59:59 2015 UTC,"South Texas Diecast is great for identifying loose cars, pretty much useless when it comes to current market prices.  Best bet is to search for sold listings on ebay and place your value accordingly."

As for the collection, it might be a lot of work but sorting them out and selling them as smaller, $30-50 lots would probably give you the best success but ebay and paypal are gonna take a big cut of the money.  You might be better off looking for local Hot Wheels Clubs on forums and asking around if anyone wants to buy them but for a lot like that, collectors usually buy them for 33% of the original value sight unseen...so be careful."
HotWheels,34vgfz,hatersgonnhate,2,Tue May 5 00:56:14 2015 UTC,"I would be interested in some movie themed ones.   Ghost busters, back to the future, 90s batmobile, if you come across any.

This means there are no cards with 1992 or 1993 on the back of them (as far as I know).

HotWheels,347m8b,dallas_89,9,Tue Apr 28 23:02:24 2015 UTC,"These. Originally sold as jammers car cases but were then re-branded to thread organizers. They were re-branded because the plastic is brittle and can break fairly easily. Not a problem for a collector but for children it's an issue if they drop it or something onto it.  Great cases, you can fit two smaller vehicles into one slot. So for some cars the capacity is over 48.  Hot cases are currently unavailable but looked like amazing cases. They store 48 standard size carded vehicles or had foam inserts available for storing loose vehicles. They were also much more expensive than the ""Thread Organizers"" and even more expensive for loose cars if you bought foam inserts. If they ever figure out the shipping nonsense they'll probably come back.  A super cheap option is to buy small plastic bags and wrap the vehicles in paper towels or some other cloth material and drop those into a bin of ones choosing."

HotWheels,33pdq8,DrunkenFist,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"Most pharmacies (even mom & pop operations) carry Hot Wheels.    Most grocery stores, too (anything larger than a convenience store).  Auto Zone, Pep Boys, and Advance Auto Parts always (in my experience) have at least a small selection.    Discount stores like Dollar General, Dollar Tree, 5 Below, Big Lots, Rose's, Ollie's, etc.  These stores can have anywhere from a great selection to none at all.  Hot Wheels stock can vary depending on when you visit these discount stores, so check back often.  Dollar stores never (in my experience) carry anything other than mainlines, but the other discount stores I listed occasionally get garage and series cars.  I share this information with the hope that you're not a scalper.  Scalping has completely ruined the retail hunting hobby in my town of more than 50,000 people.  I don't even bother anymore.

HotWheels,33lg7y,MidgetMiles,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"Capped wheels. They are removable and don't have axle holes.  They were the wheels that were used for the spectraflame cars from 1970 to 1972. They started to faze them out in 1973 in favor of the open hole wheels. That is why almost all '73's are a mix of wheel types. In 1975 they came across some extra capped wheels and used them up, so there are a few 1975 cars (and some '74's issued in '75) that have capped wheels on them."

HotWheels,33hwvy,noodlepoops,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:31:39 2015 UTC,At the show I probably spent $30.  A couple $4 cars but the rest were $1-2 each.  Most of the ones in the pictures were from the past month.  I usually never pay more than $1.50-2 a car.

HotWheels,33hwvy,WitBeer,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:25:36 2015 UTC,I have the 77 dodge custom van. I am interested in the tumbler and the bat mobiles on the left side of your picture. I already have the one on the right.
HotWheels,33hwvy,TheGameboy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:48:11 2015 UTC,"I'm more of an exotic car kind of guy; if you had some older firebirds or older Lamborghinis or any Supers or T Hunts that were real life exotic cars I'd be for it but I have no need for the vans or trucks.

HotWheels,33hwvy,TheGameboy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:08:41 2015 UTC,I don't think there's a hot wheels miura. Matchbox did make a nice one though. The dukes set cost me $20 but that the cheapest I've ever seen it.

HotWheels,33689g,SpaceFace11,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:38:38 2015 UTC,How do u know if a car is a super or not?
HotWheels,33689g,pluto5963,2,Mon Apr 20 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"A couple things are sure tells. For one, there's usually a ""THunt"" decal on the body or card. It looks kinda like a flaming tire and it used to denote ""track star"" cars. The next obvious thing would be the paint. Last year and this year, the $uper THunts were done in the same tampos and decals as their mainline counterpart, but the premium ""spectraflame"" paint is very easy to spot compared to the main line. $upers also have real rider rubber tires. You could also check for lists of each $uper for all the batches. There's one $uper for each batch. I know this year has been the ae86, 599xx, evoX, mustang boss, and I suppose this one... I'm missing quite a few. A lot of the hot wheel blogs such ad t-hunted and lamley have pictures of both the mainline and $uper."
HotWheels,33689g,otakutaikun,2,Mon Apr 20 00:50:40 2015 UTC,"The circle flame logo doesn't appear on supers, only regular treasure hunts. Supers have the ""TH"" initials on the car. You can see them on the nose of the Pass'n Gasser, where a hood ornament might be.  Also, the tampos may be different depending on the car and what tampos were originally there. For example, the Toyota Corolla has a black hood with decals where the mainline has a plain red hood. The Rrroadster has an orange stripe down the top of the hood & trunk."
HotWheels,33689g,akeniscool,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"Ah that is correct. Haven't found a $uper in ages, the TH tampo escaped my mind. Thanks for the correction! I've always kinda just glanced at the main and super and thought they were close enough, apparently I'm wrong :)"
HotWheels,33689g,otakutaikun,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:36:21 2015 UTC,Thanks
HotWheels,33689g,pluto5963,2,Mon Apr 20 00:52:25 2015 UTC,"Some information on supers from a previous post of mine.  They've got rubber wheels and they have, usually darker, spectreflame paint than their mainline counterparts. In addition to that darker paint they sometimes have an additional tampo which is reflected on the card. An example where the tampos don't change but the card does on the super vs. the regular mainline. In addition to that most of the supers are marked with a small TH tampo somewhere on the vehicle.  They're somewhere along the along the lines of 1 in every 5-7 cases, from my observations. So this makes them exceptionally rare and rather desirable. Usually selling for around the $10-$15 mark, though the more desirable the casting the higher price can go.  Regular treasure hunts usually come one per case, it is possible for a case to not have one though unlikely. They sport unique colors and tampos. Since 2013 regular treasure hunts have been marked with a small flame logo."

HotWheels,32whbe,Rorbotron,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:10:56 2015 UTC,I really hope to find that cool classics pickup.  I've got a ways to go to finish off the cool classics.  I have I believe 20 total but they aren't all from the same year.

HotWheels,32urdf,pugaboy89,2,Thu Apr 16 21:46:51 2015 UTC,Oh man! Just when I thought I was satisfied with all my finds. Now I gotta get back out there and keep looking! I want that Silverado and Porsche!
HotWheels,32urdf,canuslide,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:18:54 2015 UTC,Lol that's how I feel everytime I find a new bin
HotWheels,32urdf,canuslide,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:24:24 2015 UTC,wow-looks great!  Good finds-I haven't seen that case cracked near me yet.
HotWheels,32urdf,canuslide,2,Thu Apr 16 21:51:39 2015 UTC,Yea they came in a dump bin. No treasures or supers from what I saw and I went through the whole thing
HotWheels,32urdf,canuslide,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:59:02 2015 UTC,"I will have to keep a look out for them, that green lambo looks awesome."
HotWheels,32urdf,thesnake87,2,Thu Apr 16 23:13:25 2015 UTC,It sticks out like crazy in the bin from the color.
HotWheels,32urdf,thesnake87,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:47:39 2015 UTC,Awesome
HotWheels,32urdf,DrunkenFist,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:01:25 2015 UTC,I found one on a peg this morning-woo-hoo!  thank you so much for the heads up!
HotWheels,32urdf,PushcartPops,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:49:26 2015 UTC,Love the P1 color variation. I need that Vette too.  Im lucky to even find any 2015 B case in my area yet. Sucks.
HotWheels,32urdf,akeniscool,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"Yea i was pretty thrilled with these, where are you located that there behind?"
HotWheels,32urdf,PushcartPops,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:47:14 2015 UTC,"Michigan. Ive been hearing at least in the US, since the ports are in California, that it takes time for cases to spread. So the Western US gets the cases first then they slowly work their way over East."
HotWheels,32urdf,HautWheels,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"We're only just getting the F cases here. Be a while before we see this, most likely."
HotWheels,32urdf,RangeRoverHSE,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:38:32 2015 UTC,"Dang, well your not the first person to say that."
HotWheels,32urdf,FiteMeIRLm8,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:46:31 2015 UTC,Interesting that the Invader has only 4 wheels and no missle. Used to have 4 front wheels and an orange projectile that would launch out if the turret.
HotWheels,32urdf,FiteMeIRLm8,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:06:09 2015 UTC,A launchable missile sounds like a choking hazard. That would be my guess as to why it was removed.
HotWheels,32sqy5,V8INT3RC3PTOR,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:31:02 2015 UTC,Is that a 2015? I'm only seeing the rs
HotWheels,32sqy5,bored-as-usual,2,Thu Apr 16 15:48:49 2015 UTC,Yeah that's the one
HotWheels,32sqy5,bored-as-usual,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:49:54 2015 UTC,I can check for you
HotWheels,32sqy5,akeniscool,0,Thu Apr 16 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"If you mean the F&F Escort, it hasn't hit stores yet. Some online dealers have started getting them, and are flipping for a crazy profit ($20 on eBay!).  Should be out within the month, though."
HotWheels,32sqy5,bored-as-usual,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"No its already out, since they had the dock strike happen. They are now playing catch up and the H and J case went out together so some places are getting both and some are getting one at a time."
HotWheels,32sqy5,akeniscool,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:41:44 2015 UTC,"Interesting. We just got H cases locally. I guess with the dock strikes and the after-holiday delay, things are more behind that I thought. I thought when no E case dump bins arrived with the first set of zamacs, that was the only thing that was really bypassed."
HotWheels,32rs3h,sgtpepper_21,3,Thu Apr 16 04:43:13 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite guilty pleasure cars from GTAV, the Cheval Surge, which is based on the real-life Chevrolet Volt! In the list of cars i loved, a hybrid certainly isn't on that list since it's trash to begin with, but i fell in love with the car so much that i tried to look everywhere for the 1/64 version to add into my collection, but at the time, only Maisto made one but the detailing on it was just okay.  Fast forward a couple of months later, Hotwheels announced that they were releasing the drag-modified version of the car called the Supervolt and i just had to buy a few of those cuz it looked so freakin' awesome! So here is a comparison between the three, i hope you could enjoy it as much as i do :)   Cheval Surge (GTAV) Chevrolet Volt (Maisto) Supervolt (Hot Wheels)"
HotWheels,32rs3h,himbimbly,2,Thu Apr 16 04:43:40 2015 UTC,"I find it awesome that of all the cars in GTA V, you love the Cheval Surge the most. Then again, my fave is the Merryweather Mesa, which no one else seems to like :/.   Great to see someone else who likes GTA and Hot Wheels!"
HotWheels,32rs3h,skeptoid79,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:14:39 2015 UTC,"Odd right? With the armored Kuruma a close second! Haha, the story was that i was playing online and picked up one of these for Simeon and i forgot that once you do steal one, cops will be swarming all over you. Me being a seasoned GTA player assumed driving into my personal garage could clear my wanted level, well it did, but it also made the stolen Cheval become my personal vehicle, so since then i sorta just stuck with it and modded everything i could with it. Turns out, it has excellent acceleration on par with some sports cars and the handling is excellent but if you don't install armor, the durability is terrible. It became my go-to mission car and after using it so much, i grew fond of it :D  Oh dayumn, the Merryweather Mesa is pretty awesome looking and is sweet off-road too! Would consider having it for missions in the future.  Here's a pic of it if you're interested! Cheval :D"
HotWheels,32rii6,canuslide,2,Thu Apr 16 03:11:40 2015 UTC,"I bloody love Murcielago, its my favourite car ever. Cant bring myself to pay the ebay prace tho haha"
HotWheels,32rii6,Helomyname,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you; I didn't pay more than $2 for any of these cars-I went to antique malls and flea markets-there are tons of guys that sell these if you look around.    I do have some extras, if you can find some Aventadors, I will totally trade."
HotWheels,32rii6,DrunkenFist,2,Thu Apr 16 14:58:42 2015 UTC,"Nice collection! I really wish they hadn't retired the Diablo and Countach. I really like to get cars that I enjoy driving in Forza, and those two see a lot of action."
HotWheels,32rii6,DrunkenFist,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:57:04 2015 UTC,You can still find them everywhere for a buck or two; those 2 countach cars I have came from flea markets.
HotWheels,32rii6,DrunkenFist,2,Thu Apr 16 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"Haven't had any luck around here. No flea markets in the area, and the thrift stores very rarely have anything worth buying. I'll probably wind up just picking up one of each online eventually."
HotWheels,32rii6,DrunkenFist,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, try local antique malls...I bet there are a few."
HotWheels,32rii6,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"Same story really, the ""antique"" shops here are basically glorified thrift stores without much of interest. It's a small city, there's just not a ton of stuff like that in the area."
HotWheels,32rii6,akeniscool,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, that sucks.  Well, I am going to a Hot Wheels show this sunday, If I get any extras, I will let you know and maybe we can set up a trade of some sort."
HotWheels,32rii6,DarkContractor,2,Thu Apr 16 21:18:31 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the offer, but it's cool. I don't really have any stuff to trade. From what I've seen online, most of them are pretty cheap, so I'll just grab a couple off ebay or something at some point."
HotWheels,32r8vr,canuslide,5,Thu Apr 16 01:50:52 2015 UTC,"I'd open 'em. That may be just me, though; I only leave stuff in the package if I wanna display it on the wall, and those won't really be worth displaying when you can't see what's inside. Plus, it would just bug me not knowing."
HotWheels,32r8vr,DrunkenFist,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:22:29 2015 UTC,That was exactly what I was thinking...
HotWheels,32r8vr,efficiens,3,Thu Apr 16 02:32:33 2015 UTC,I opened 2 of them... http://imgur.com/LMSlJ3x

HotWheels,32r8vr,Helomyname,2,Thu Apr 16 17:17:00 2015 UTC,I bought a loose one online a while back. I wasn't aware it was a mystery car.
HotWheels,32r8vr,milecoupe,2,Thu Apr 16 17:44:13 2015 UTC,Open more!!
HotWheels,32r8vr,sgtpepper_21,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:07:20 2015 UTC,I might open another later on when I get home.
HotWheels,32r8vr,PNDJ,2,Thu Apr 16 20:36:58 2015 UTC,"Open all of them, you have nothing to lose"
HotWheels,32r8vr,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:21:24 2015 UTC,Ha!  Maybe I will leave a few unopened and trade them off so someone else can open them...
HotWheels,32r8vr,ThaddeusJP,2,Thu Apr 16 21:24:31 2015 UTC,Just saying those are the Buggati Veyron case's so you I wouldn't trade them off as you may have some gold in them.I had around 300 from 07-08 that I kept sealed till this year and decided too open them and ended up with 15 Veyron's and got some good stuff in trade for them.  Check the bug though.It has a hard to find flame/paint.There is normal ones then there are like metal flake looking ones and I got 20 normal flames for every 1 flake one.  Also there is no way too tell what's in them unless you x ray them.When I opened mine I opened them by code and they were all random.
HotWheels,32r8vr,ThaddeusJP,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:10:16 2015 UTC,Oh wow...maybe I will open them then.
HotWheels,32r8vr,subtleamuzement,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:12:33 2015 UTC,Is there a way to tell what's in the blister?  Should I open them?  What do you think?
HotWheels,32r8vr,V8INT3RC3PTOR,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:51:30 2015 UTC,"You could use acetone to remove the blister from the card cleanly! Do let us know what's inside, a yellow/white Bugatti maybe? :D"
HotWheels,32r8vr,V8INT3RC3PTOR,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:40:56 2015 UTC,Look up the YouTube video of how to take the plastic of the blister card. Totally worth it in your case
HotWheels,32r8vr,TheGameboy,2,Thu Apr 16 03:52:51 2015 UTC,"Why? So he can reseal it and resell it as ""new""?  -_-"
HotWheels,32r8vr,TheGameboy,1 point,Thu Apr 16 07:29:27 2015 UTC,Not a bad idea...

HotWheels,32q84d,canuslide,2,Wed Apr 15 21:17:44 2015 UTC,I'm in the middle of customizing my first Hot Wheels cars and it's not easy...great job on the details.
HotWheels,32q84d,canuslide,2,Wed Apr 15 22:03:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks again! I wound up using a thumb tack, of all things, for the tiniest stuff. None of my brushes had small enough tips."
HotWheels,32ovnc,canuslide,7,Wed Apr 15 15:00:16 2015 UTC,"Big yes, is nice. Should include location and stuff, but i would like that."
HotWheels,32ovnc,Helomyname,3,Wed Apr 15 15:55:18 2015 UTC,I forgot about location; that would be great.
HotWheels,32ovnc,Rorbotron,3,Wed Apr 15 16:00:54 2015 UTC,I think this is a great idea personally.  A quick access point and easily accessed when out and about if you do come across something someone is looking to acquire via trade for example.
HotWheels,32ovnc,Rorbotron,2,Wed Apr 15 15:57:06 2015 UTC,I thought it would make hunting way easier...
HotWheels,32ovnc,ThaddeusJP,2,Wed Apr 15 16:01:37 2015 UTC,Absolutely because you know what people are looking for and those people may have something you are looking to acquire.  It certainly can't hurt that's for sure.  I like to hunt but sometimes I'm short on time and do a power skim if you will.  If you dont know what people are looking for you just jump on here and access it right away.
HotWheels,32ovnc,spark_knock,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:06:50 2015 UTC,exactly.
HotWheels,32ovnc,Mr_Dugan,2,Wed Apr 15 16:09:18 2015 UTC,I think it would be a good idea.  Keeps everything contained.
HotWheels,32ovnc,subtleamuzement,2,Wed Apr 15 17:08:20 2015 UTC,I like it. Things can get buried fast and forgotten!
HotWheels,32muoq,IcyOrio,0,Wed Apr 15 01:33:20 2015 UTC,"Speaking of which, is there anything I can do to improve my pictures?

HotWheels,32ianr,thegreendutch,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:01:22 2015 UTC,"Glad to meet you :) I'm gonna be around a lot.  My dad actually messed with customizing but never changed paint.  He would buy up clearanced stuff that had nice rubber wheels no matter the brand and swap them to other stuff.  I'd actually really like to get into customizing and after finding this sub and looking at some cool projects I'm definitely going to go that route.  Do you all have any preferences for places to hunt for old stock?  I check eBay on occasion and amazon does sometimes have stuff.

Personally, I don't worry about rarity at all, I just buy the cars I like. I recently came across this blog that shows breakdowns of new cases long before they show up in stores here, so that might be a pretty good indication of which cars are shortpacked in a particular case assortment."

Anyone that has to endure it themselves or with a family member is tested in a way that isn't fair.  Sorry for your losses.  I came home today with this 914--6 he and I talked about at one point and put it down in front of one of his pictures.  Diecast is something we've always shared and I'm looking forward to expanding on the collection with my son.    I also agree on buying the stuff you like, I do the same but I also like to look for specifics whether it be cool classics, treasure hunts or just the cool new 2015 stuff.  I really, really want that vw caddy.  My dad was a vw nut and I am as well.  I hope to find one soon, if not to amazon I go lol.  I will also check out that blog.  Thanks for the heads up."

The feeling of being utterly powerless to help is one of the worst parts.   That Caddy is pretty sweet, it was one of those I was on the fence about until I saw it in the store. I liked it so much I wound up customizing it a bit. It took a while to show up here, but it's been pretty easy to find since then, so hopefully you'll run across one soon without much trobule."

However on the left picture, right around where the bulb is being reflected and under the small bump, you can see how the paint is some what wavy. Where it goes from light to dark to light.  It would likely be much more noticeable in sunlight or if I had a decent lighting setup.   Also which wiki? The wikia one shows metal flake  Found another picture I took of the Chevelle SS super and regular. The Super on the left has smooth paint which is some what shiny. While the regular has metal flake paint which has noticeable spots that sparkle in it.  Wikia page for the Chevelle."

There won't be any more Veyrons. What's out there is out there and if you want one, you're probably buying it from someone who'd rather keep it so ya gotta pay."
HotWheels,32642n,wildfire405,3,Sat Apr 11 00:06:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is the reason. The supply is limited and will stay that way. The bugatti veyrons that go for a lot were walmart exclusives and etc so are very limited."
HotWheels,32642n,hatersgonnhate,2,Sat Apr 11 00:12:24 2015 UTC,No kidding. Well I'm glad I have one and guess I'll get a nice case for it.
HotWheels,32642n,tipnitty,2,Sat Apr 11 00:57:24 2015 UTC,"Are they really that expensive? I have quite a few of them, lol. Didn't think they were anything special at the time, mostly just liked the color."
HotWheels,32642n,afflikt3d,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:57:40 2015 UTC,the red and black one in loose condition is worth about $20
HotWheels,32642n,FiteMeIRLm8,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:46:11 2015 UTC,"Red and black was the First Edition and is the easiest to come by. You can find it for $20 carded.  The Satin Red was a Walmart exclusive, and is the most expensive mainline Veyron."
HotWheels,32642n,akeniscool,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:48:10 2015 UTC,"i've sold the red and black one loose for $20 on ebay awhile ago, it really depends what people will pay for it."

HotWheels,32642n,akeniscool,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:59:11 2015 UTC,Why is anything worth a lot? Because people are willing to pay for it.

HotWheels,321vt7,IcyOrio,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:24:37 2015 UTC,I didn't see them until I got home and thought they were dust marks as I opened the thing but was completely dismayed to learn they're marks on the paint. Is there ANYTHING I can do to fix them? It's the only one they had their and I can't really return it once opened..  If you look closely there two on the hood and a really tiny on one the back.  Update: Seems that they wiped off just fine and I feel like a total idiot. I swear I felt some indents but I suppose I was wrong; incredibly glad to have a shiny and perfect car now though even if the hoods a bit stiff. :D
HotWheels,321vt7,SpaceFace11,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:25:09 2015 UTC,Well since it is wal-mart and they have a pretty light return policy maybe you can exchange it for another one?
HotWheels,321vt7,SpaceFace11,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:52:11 2015 UTC,They actually had next to nothing there in terms of hotwheels and all of the realistic mainlines were snagged leaving only the crappy fantasy cars. <<; I can't exactly get this replaced.

If you're into other die casts, TRU usually has a good selection that caters to the collector.

HotWheels,31yl0f,JDM_HYPER_REV,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:46:56 2015 UTC,Yes and it's absolutely annoying because so far 8 out of the 10 Walmarts near me don't put these out.

HotWheels,31pbrx,FriendlyEnt,5,Tue Apr 7 02:32:13 2015 UTC,Really hated how these all sold out in under 10 mins. I'd love to get one of these at a normal price not a BS inflated scalpers rate.  Also I wish retail cards had these windows on the back. I know it would push the barcode to an odd place but for display it would be great.
HotWheels,31pbrx,BlitzWing1985,3,Tue Apr 7 21:10:58 2015 UTC,Wish that they got the wheels right.
HotWheels,31pbrx,Sylentbob,2,Tue Apr 7 04:57:14 2015 UTC,I don't think that Hot Wheels offers a 4 spoke wheel. Hot Wheels doesn't usually create a whole new wheel for most castings.  I'd like to see some of the custom guys make some custom American Racing Libre BRE wheels.
HotWheels,31pbrx,240ZT,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:35:10 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with you.

HotWheels,31o1ci,Hot_Wheels_guy,0,Mon Apr 6 21:16:15 2015 UTC,yes as its clearly meant to have a stripe so not having it is an error. But personally these errors dont add any value to me. Now if its missing its deco or had different wheels then I'd be interested.
HotWheels,31o1ci,BlitzWing1985,0,Tue Apr 7 21:13:32 2015 UTC,like a Copo camaro missing the hotwheels logo or the camaro emblem?

HotWheels,31jiki,mym180,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:21:59 2015 UTC,Found a BMW Z4 M in need of some TLC. Decided to remove the paint and also upgrade the wheels to bigger and wider tires. Made the axles myself and that's basically it.
HotWheels,31jiki,Helomyname,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:23:58 2015 UTC,It's not perfect and I'm not a fan of the wheels at all but it's pretty good if it's one of the first!

HotWheels,31jaay,bored-as-usual,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:39:08 2015 UTC,I didn't realize they got over there so late. Do you guys normally see none and then they all show up at once or is it in batches like here?
HotWheels,31jaay,FiteMeIRLm8,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:37:02 2015 UTC,yeah they all tend to show up all at once when they actually do get here
HotWheels,31jaay,skeptoid79,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:28:53 2015 UTC,Got 1 of all 8 today from the bin as well.  Always feels nice to get lucky at Wallyworld.  (still haven't found that damn red '52 Chevy though.)
HotWheels,31jaay,kxxstarr,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:10:56 2015 UTC,I'm convinced my local store didn't get any of the Buick. I could have left with at least ten 7/8 sets. Not a single Buick.

So I was pretty excited when I found out this casting existed. I pretty much own every style made of this casting. Even the Treasure Hunt and $uper.   Sweet! That's a nice one!
HotWheels,31i02o,manofconviction,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:47:29 2015 UTC,still looking for these if anyone has any leads:   2008 mainline - grey color shifter - peach red to yellow color shifter - silver w/ graphics to black color shifter - white to blue w/ graphics color shifters creatures - purple to pink fte - red w/ graphics fte - white w/ graphics 10 pack - orange w/ 'clone' graphics night burnerz - blue w/ 'clone' graphics speed machines - red/black hw tunerz - teal w/ 'hwr' graphics
HotWheels,31i02o,DarkContractor,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:49:02 2015 UTC,I have the grey mainline but it's beat up.  I've seen the peach to yellow color shifter one at my local Target so next time I swing by I can check for you as well as other egos you've listed.
HotWheels,31i02o,sgtpepper_21,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:07:01 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome, thanks!"
HotWheels,31i02o,FiteMeIRLm8,1 point,Tue Apr 7 06:19:53 2015 UTC,You'd go nuts when the new super and mainline coming out in a couple of cases
HotWheels,31i02o,BlitzWing1985,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:01:32 2015 UTC,In my opinion the new evo super is extremely ugly. Was looking forward to it until I saw it. The wheels just ruin the whole car. If it had the wheels off of the 2014 Chevy Silverado $th it would be gorgeous.
HotWheels,31i02o,FiteMeIRLm8,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:33:03 2015 UTC,I agree the wheels while a fitting style seem off being blue. But IMO its still one I'd love to own.

HotWheels,31i02o,subtleamuzement,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:31:49 2015 UTC,I guess I dont see it as being that crazy within the context of whats been done to the car IRL.

HotWheels,31chsj,FiteMeIRLm8,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:28:09 2015 UTC,is it true that employees sneak them out of the factory and that is why they are for sale from malaysia?   And if you don't mind my asking... how much?
HotWheels,31chsj,HautWheels,2,Mon Apr 6 03:10:36 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if that's the case but it would really explain how they get their hands on supers 4 months before they hit the actual stores. and the price was $35. which was good considering all the other auctions sold the car at $40-$70. It was really expensive when it first started showing up on ebay so i thought i got a good deal. It wasn't a good deal for me because i had to wait 3 months and have to deal with a seller who wouldn't help me or respond to me at all.   just don't buy from Malaysia lol.
HotWheels,31chsj,FiteMeIRLm8,2,Mon Apr 6 03:51:43 2015 UTC,Nice !!! how much did you pay for that ?

First is the S16 logo. I've got no clue what it means maybe someone can fill me in? Secondly its not really that black its more like a dark chrome finish.  I guess for a free car its not so bad but I'd rather have mail-in cars like the US.

HotWheels,3160iv,hollowgh0st,2,Thu Apr 2 10:05:19 2015 UTC,I'd say around 1:30. That's when they have a majority of their pallets stocked so if there is an unopened case it'll be easy to find or they just put it up.
HotWheels,3160iv,HautWheels,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:32:20 2015 UTC,I got very lucky recently when I went to Target on a Wednesday right at 8am (when they open).

HotWheels,313c4j,skeptoid79,3,Wed Apr 1 18:43:04 2015 UTC,I may have seen this but your pictures make it look way better. What's your setup?
HotWheels,313c4j,bored-as-usual,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:07:58 2015 UTC,"Cheap $20 lightbox off Amazon, two crappy $7 desk lamps from walmart (40w bulbs), a Nikon D5100, and free image editing software called Photoscape."

HotWheels,310c37,lunarcrusader,3,Wed Apr 1 04:24:12 2015 UTC,I went through the whole city and not a single super.. Not even a TH.
HotWheels,310c37,tealkid,1 point,Wed Apr 1 06:22:38 2015 UTC,This is actually the 2nd time I have found 2 supers at the same time. Found 2 Harley Fat Boys on the pegs right next to each other. The heart skips a beat when you find Supers in the wild.
HotWheels,310c37,bored-as-usual,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:28:32 2015 UTC,Are these both supers?

HotWheels,310c37,haloryder,2,Thu Apr 2 05:28:10 2015 UTC,And I mean tons of those Mastrettas. And a few Ferraris.
HotWheels,30zr7p,senojyesac,2,Wed Apr 1 00:26:18 2015 UTC,I just wish the black came with silver wheels instead of gold. I want to switch them up with the orange RSR. But I don't know if I can do it without damaging anything. Lol

HotWheels,30ufgh,Jawnzzz,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:22:52 2015 UTC,Awesome finds! I love that super. I got mine last week.
HotWheels,30ufgh,pugaboy89,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:34:02 2015 UTC,I've been VERY lucky.  Just started collecting right after valentines day... so I missed the last k-day.  But the first day I started looking I found a Fast Felion and a Jetson's bubble car.  And now this.
HotWheels,30ufgh,Gamerbrandona,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:08:32 2015 UTC,"Nice find! My target gets the same dang case since last year! Still getting those 370z's, it is almost sickening to me!   EDIT: looks like that super should be opened since the packaging is all bent! :)"
HotWheels,30ufgh,elliotrivfilms,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:59:26 2015 UTC,"yeah, it was bent coming out of the case.  I was there watching/helping stock the pegs.  I wonder if those supers get put in last or something and that is why is wasn't perfect.  EDIT: I've already got the non-super version opened so its tempting but I'm sure I'll keep it in the case regardless.   (That MBX '71 Olds Vista Cruiser wagon is one of my favorites)"
HotWheels,30uit9,Lancer007az,3,Mon Mar 30 20:41:44 2015 UTC,Found this at a grocery store when I got lunch today.
HotWheels,30uit9,efficiens,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:42:56 2015 UTC,"Nice. I bought the 512 and the Enzo from that pack once, but never had the whole pack. Love the wheels on the 308."

HotWheels,30uit9,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:15:44 2015 UTC,"The 512 and the GTS both have metal bases, too!"
HotWheels,30uit9,RedlineFan,2,Mon Mar 30 21:29:13 2015 UTC,The GTS has a plastic base.
HotWheels,30uit9,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:52:10 2015 UTC,I guess it's a variation.  My GTS has a metal base.
HotWheels,30vkxu,canuslide,2,Tue Mar 31 01:33:16 2015 UTC,Let me look in my stash and see what I have in the way of Lambos. Been collecting for 20 something years so I might have something older. I'm interested in the Batmobiles.

HotWheels,30vkxu,P8ntBal1551,1 point,Sat Apr 4 19:46:33 2015 UTC,"My current trade roster is; corvette c7, datsun 510 truck, skyline 2000gt-r, custom 71 el camino treasure hunt, and both angry birds cars, all carded. I want any or all of those batmobiles."

It's not fair for other people who already have what you want."
HotWheels,30ui86,spark_knock,3,Mon Mar 30 20:37:38 2015 UTC,If it's under 13 oz you can ship it across the country for like $4 tops via USPS First Class.  Just use a small box and pack it well of course.  Flat Rate is best for shipping groups of cars that are too heavy for First Class.
HotWheels,30ui86,Hot_Wheels_guy,2,Mon Mar 30 21:23:24 2015 UTC,Yup and you can fit 4 carded cars in a small flat rate box. It is also tracked and automatically insured for up to 50 dollars.
HotWheels,30ui86,Jawnzzz,2,Mon Mar 30 21:03:08 2015 UTC,"It's as if it was meant to be! For reals though, good to know!"
HotWheels,30ui86,PushcartPops,2,Mon Mar 30 21:09:12 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it got shipped overnight!  If you guys really needed to trade that fast, I understand, but I had an experience where AFTER I paid $2 for first class they went ahead and stuffed it in an overnight envelope and billed my customer $18. I wuz pist."
HotWheels,30ui86,PushcartPops,2,Tue Mar 31 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"I guess my first priority is keeping costs down for both sides. I'm just impressed that he was able to ship em faster and cheaper with a flat rate box. Btw, still have those Vettes? I sent you a message a few days ago :)"
HotWheels,30ui86,PushcartPops,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:21:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, still have them, sorry if I missed your message."
HotWheels,30ui86,MrSoul89,2,Wed Apr 1 01:14:46 2015 UTC,"It's all good, I just didn't want to leave you hanging! After my spring break and some other expenses, I'm curious as to what you'd sell just your Vettes for."
HotWheels,30ui86,PushcartPops,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:30:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sure we can work something out.  If I don't get back promptly, keep on me.  I have some family stuff that is keeping me preoccupied and it is good to have the distraction in the empty time."
HotWheels,30v2bx,Lancer007az,2,Mon Mar 30 23:04:09 2015 UTC,Stopped at Walmart in my way home and found some new case stuff. The El Camino and Camaro are zamacs finally and a gnarly tampo error on the 911

HotWheels,30u1ly,Jawnzzz,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:16:03 2015 UTC,Well if your cars are still in the pack then I use a shit load of tacks and line them all up on the wall. It wrecks your thumbs but it turns out nice. I also have a shelf that's about 5ft long attached to my wall where I display my loose cars. Yet I still have 500 loose cars in boxes that I can't display lol
HotWheels,30u1ly,CalculatorAmbassador,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:06:51 2015 UTC,Once I eventually open all my cars I want to put them all in plastic Carney cases in the garage.

HotWheels,30u1ly,PushcartPops,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:51:47 2015 UTC,"I use bookshelves with removable/adjustable shelves.  They're great for carded as well as loose cars.  Once I have a shelf at the level I want it, I pull it forward about 1/8th of an inch so I can stand carded cars along the back, with the bottom edge of the card tucked behind the shelf.  I even sanded my shelf edges down a little bit so I can do this along the sides of the shelves as well.  Then I added a few dozen little screws all over the place for hanging cards inside and out.  I can take some pics of my setup if you want.  Really easy and cheap (old wooden bookshelves can be found at any thrift store like salvation army or goodwill)."
HotWheels,30rrss,Yowomboo,2,Mon Mar 30 03:44:07 2015 UTC,Turns out I'm not a fan of any of them.

HotWheels,30rrss,windog,1 point,Mon Mar 30 04:39:18 2015 UTC,"Not particularly, though if I find another I'll let you know."
HotWheels,30rrss,windog,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:25:38 2015 UTC,Uh oh. Why is the Vette glowing?
HotWheels,30rrss,FR05TY14,2,Mon Mar 30 07:18:54 2015 UTC,"It's a ""chase"" piece, limited to one per box I think. I didn't notice it in the store but one the side of the box it has a picture of the vette with the words ""Can you find me?"""
HotWheels,30rrss,kxxstarr,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:18:36 2015 UTC,That's what I was worried about!
HotWheels,30rrss,FiteMeIRLm8,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:32:07 2015 UTC,I think that 'Vette is from the Tooned series they had a while ago. I'm not 100% sure though. I had the same one but it was silver with a pink racing stripe.

HotWheels,30qzyl,litl_e_fan,2,Sun Mar 29 23:33:54 2015 UTC,Repacking a treasure hunt into a 3 pack seems absolutely silly so maybe mattel just had way too many speedbox treasure hunts.

HotWheels,30rdmb,akeniscool,2,Mon Mar 30 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"It would probably add more value if Jun had designed that model (which I don't believe he did, but could be wrong)."
HotWheels,30rdmb,FiteMeIRLm8,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:44:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely adds value to the right buyer, the amount I'm not sure. I suggest you put it on ebay and see what you can get"

HotWheels,30khip,snowdrifts,3,Sat Mar 28 03:56:52 2015 UTC,"Ooooh I can answer this one :D  Hot Wheels designers normally come from actual car companies like Ford, BMW etc or from movie/game design studios,  so they come from all around the world. The studio is based in the states (California I think)  How to draw cars the Hot Wheels way Link is an excellent book showing the process Hot Wheels designers take (It's a few years old though) There's a few more books that focus on the cars themselves but not specifically the designers :D  Here's a tour of the studio  and another one here   And here's a talk by Larry Wood (one of the first Hot Wheels designers)"

HotWheels,30ig3n,bored-as-usual,2,Fri Mar 27 21:32:35 2015 UTC,I guess a little hard cause everyone wants them. I'm sure someone came and grabbed every one of them at this store cause I was only able to find one burried under a dump bin.
HotWheels,30ig3n,canuslide,2,Fri Mar 27 21:57:14 2015 UTC,"I just checked my area and found some bad ass cars, this being one. It sticks out in a dump bin with that bright yellow, I'm loving the new cars coming out"

I'm a huge Datsun fan and really enjoy giving them to my Datsun friends who don't collect Hot Wheels. I actually own two real Datsuns and a 370z, so I also buy as many as I can, but I also give 75% of them away."
HotWheels,30ig3n,240ZT,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:35:25 2015 UTC,"That's pretty awesome.  I actually found like 15 of them but only bought the bunch I did because I wanted to leave a few for other people looking and I also thought, there are no way that many lambos I need but they sure didn't seem rare."
HotWheels,30ig3n,canuslide,-2,Sat Mar 28 00:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, dump the ""COLLECTOR"" tag on your nick and put up ""HOARDER"". It's a dick move to clean out stores just to hand them out to people who may or may not care when actual fans just want one.  Dick move."
HotWheels,30ig3n,bored-as-usual,2,Mon Mar 30 00:02:01 2015 UTC,"Dude, I hoard like 3 specific models. I'm pretty sure if you feel entitled you deserve them that someone that owns that ACTUAL car in real life deserves one more than you. Don't get so butthurt. I usually can hardly find any and buy them from resellers on ebay."
HotWheels,30k41s,IcyOrio,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:38:49 2015 UTC,Could not making any more Ferraris lead to an increase in price for any older castings?
HotWheels,30k41s,JuanElPicudo,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:29:53 2015 UTC,"Hard to say.  Hot Wheels made an Alfa Bat 9 in 2005, never again. Current value? $5 on card.  Meanwhile they made a bunch more Veyrons (I guess, I mean, they did several issues) and those are far more expensive.  It's all about supply vs. demand. I imagine most won't increase that much because there are so many. Some obviously will, but others probably not.  Either way, I would not start hoarding Ferraris hoping to retire young. Modern toys are a stupid nest egg."
HotWheels,30k41s,thekozmicpig,1 point,Sat Mar 28 18:02:49 2015 UTC,"Five times increase on that Alfa is a fantastic return, irregardless of the Veyron. Anyone got some cases of Alfas, I'll buy them all for two bucks a car, double your investment, thanks."
HotWheels,30k41s,PhantomPhun,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"Anything is possible~~~~  but the way I look at it is the casting you want will never be the same year again. If you want it, go for it. It may be a very long time before they even try to get the license back. What casting are you wanting?"
HotWheels,30k41s,kxxstarr,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:38:53 2015 UTC,The unfinished metal version of the Hotwheels Garages Ferrari 250 gto. It's just so perfect.
HotWheels,30k41s,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Sat Mar 28 07:36:23 2015 UTC,"unfinished metal   I'm not sure if you know this but that car is actually painted silver.  ""unfinished metal"" implies ZAMAC (unpainted, bare metal with no base coat of paint)."
HotWheels,30k41s,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, I thought it looked like a Zamac finish. Still very badly wanting it though. >~<"

Hot Wheels are a great fun project since they're very cheap and very robust, and also pretty easy to take apart and customise.  American muscle cars are also fantastic fun to customise because of their naturally aggressive body shapes and grills. Modern cars are really awfully bland."

Painting it was mainly an experiment in trying to paint a convincing 'rust' effect with just paint and washes (no pigment powders or anything).   Actually had a lot of fun taking the Hot Wheel apart too. Never realised quite how robust the die cast alloy used is. Hot Wheels also look lovely once stripped. That bare metal is very nice."

They're free and fit a decent number of carded cars  in them.   They are also small enough to store easily.  Added bonus is you can order the boxes online from usps.Com and they'll deliver them right to your house with the mail.   I ordered a case of 25 large boxes and they arrived about a week later.

HotWheels,302xxl,Yowomboo,3,Tue Mar 24 01:32:17 2015 UTC,From what I've seen posted. Most stores in Canada are multiple cases behind the U.S/international releases. Some still putting out cases from 2014.

HotWheels,301a78,Yowomboo,2,Mon Mar 23 23:22:37 2015 UTC,Thrift stores and flea markets could help you out a bit past what retail stores are selling.  Also eBay can help out.
HotWheels,301a78,Yowomboo,2,Mon Mar 23 23:55:08 2015 UTC,I actually went to my first Hot Wheels toy show at this local church by me; it was pretty cool.  I talked to a bunch of the guys and they said that they would keep a look out for them and I should come back at the next show-so it's been kinda fun so far.    Thank you for the suggestions; it just seems like ebay doesn't have much different stuff than the store has as far as lambos go but I did by a few chevy's on there and a few dodge.
HotWheels,301a78,Lancer007az,2,Mon Mar 23 23:59:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah ebay is hit or miss. You would have to keep checking to see different listing. If you can catch some one liquidating a collection they've purchased you can probably score a deal.  You can out different sites dedicated to diecast vehicles. Diecastaway has a a great trading board. You can also makes trades here, instagram, and even through facebook groups.  You can check out craigslist and ebay classifieds for people selling bulk or large collections. Contact them and see if they have what you're looking for.  As always be cautious when meeting up with people from these sites."

HotWheels,2zznic,Helomyname,2,Mon Mar 23 07:21:00 2015 UTC,"The flame is like the ""regular"" treasure hunts, while the ""th"" is the actual super treasure hunts. Both are limited, one more than the other."
HotWheels,2zznic,fonzi182,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:32:05 2015 UTC,"I am aware, but it says the symbol on the card is also on the car, and that is not the case. The symbol on the card is a flame, but there is no flame on the car. Im just curious why mattel hasnt changed it."
HotWheels,2zznic,ragingduck,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:37:58 2015 UTC,Every treasure hunt I have found has the flame symbol like the card says. Super treasure hunts do not have a flame. They have a TH.
HotWheels,2zznic,ragingduck,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:25:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the card says ""this symbol on the car"". This symbol is not on the car. I know. There is a TH. But in that case, why wouldnt they put the TH on the card instead of the flame?"
HotWheels,2zznic,akeniscool,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:37:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see what you are saying.  This has more to do with the history of the Super TH.  As far as I can recall, there were only treasure hunts.  These had the flame logo on them and actually said TREASURE HUNTS on the card.  It was very obvious.  At one point Hot Wheels released these super secret treasure hunts, with no flame logo on the car.  The only way you would know that these were treasure hunts were the real rider wheels and special paint because the card also no longer had TREASURE HUNTS on them.  Instead of the designation on the card, the TH would be on the car, so it was less obvious. So customers had to be extra vigilant in their treasure hunts, hence the ""super"" secret.  Then at one another point the TREASURE HUNTS disappeared from the cards.  The message that now lives in back of the treasure hunts was created so that kids could find them and know what just happened.  Since ""supers"" are really ""super secret"" then there is no logo.  It's a flaw in logic, but consistent in the spirit of the supers being a secret and not obvious."

I wanna start a hotwheels-picture-a-day thing but I don't wanna end up flooding the subreddit or crowding out SpeedyCarz66 and his daily pictures.

Every time I go to WM, Target, etc., I always stop by to see if I can find something on a whim. I don't collect as hardcore as I used to back in the day as marriage, job and 3 kids will do that to you but I still enjoy picking up cars I think are cool to me, even if they are not Treasure Hunts. So today, I found The Homer and a  Batmobile. Was about to leave but I decided to go back and pick up a Backdrafter fire truck for my 3 year old son. As I was trying to find it again, I saw this TH that I didn't see before. So, I started looking at all the other Custom '77s they had and found another one! Pretty cool day and I feel like such a kid again."

Then I followed some advice given in this video. I didn't make custom axles i just used the ones from the donor car. After that i found that the rear wheels where to big so with a little help from the dremel/multitool i managed to open op the wheel arches. Made the arches as small as possible to get a nice and low look.  Donor car: Side Draft

HotWheels,2ywivs,IcyOrio,6,Fri Mar 13 12:22:02 2015 UTC,"People want them, people are willing to pay for them. Just how markets work. A lot of highly desired models have skyrocketed in value lately, for various reasons. Ferraris are becoming more popular due to Mattel's Ferrari license coming to an end. JDM has seen an explosion of growth lately (and will probably die down eventually, like most trends). Lots of reasons."
HotWheels,2ywivs,akeniscool,3,Fri Mar 13 15:42:13 2015 UTC,"On those ones it's because they are extremely popular castings so that's why the price.If anything they will go up if I've learned anything as there will be less too go around.  Why in my opinion though?Quite honestly this view is ""bs"" over at HWC too many but the Malaysians cherry picking case's.In years prior too 2012 when these guys showed up on ebay with tons of loose supers you'd find bins or fresh cases and be able too find super hunts and get at least 5-10 of the set for the year.Since then you can go years without finding 1 super hunt so with everyone having a much harder time finding them the demand is way up since we are all in the same boat.Untill this is stopped i only see super hunts getting more and more difficult too find because i've noticed alot more posts from guys in the united states finding cases of 71 cars and bins with nothing in them this year."

HotWheels,2ywivs,PhantomPhun,2,Sat Mar 14 20:55:56 2015 UTC,"Simple, hoarders and scalpers are going to initially ask a sky high price until things don't sell, then eventually reduce the price continually until they dump the stuff. Since STHs actually only cost a dollar at retail, it's no big detail to just sit on them for years until they sell.  That's why it's pointless to collect them right away, or waste time searching in stores for them. Many other lines are just as nice or better, (boulevards, cool classics, dragstrip demons, classic racers, retro entertainment etc) and are/were easily available, but of course at a $3.99 price point.  Buy what you like from the premium lines, and leave the silly marketing TH crap to the idiot hoarders."

HotWheels,2yq235,Yowomboo,2,Thu Mar 12 12:57:09 2015 UTC,Errors' value are based solely on what an individual is willing to pay for it.   If you can find that one guy who collects backwards windows errors he might be willing to pay more a decent bit more than it's retail price.  Most people probably wouldn't pay more than $2 or so for any given error unless it's something really unique.  Super treasure hunts with errors can fetch stupidly high prices. Many can go for over $100.  Fun super gasser error I have. No idea what it's worth though.

However you might be able to hand the store the UPC on the back of the '13 cool classics card and see how many of those they have in stock.  First though, check the UPC on the back of a '14 cool classics as well and see that they're not the same.   Second I'm reasonably certain that every '13 cool classics is going to have the same UPC, but please check if you have multiples.  Thirdly you need to find someone to willing to give you that information. If the person who answers the phone for that store is willing to look up a UPC then you're golden. Though you can try asking an employee walking around with one of those hand scanners. No guarantee that they'll take the time to look up a UPC. Downside to that is you have to physically be at the store."

Do stores have special databases? Should I include the spaces in the code?"

HotWheels,2yh9jr,asgeorge,1 point,Tue Mar 10 11:56:14 2015 UTC,They add up very quick. I had to sacrifice and reign in the collection by only getting casts I like or want to customize. I've even left regular treasure hunts behind at the store simply because I could care less and would rather have the space. I just bought about 4 Mclaren P1's and before that about 5 Datsun wagons. If I were to do that with all the castings I'd have to move into a new home.
HotWheels,2yel5b,taexi,3,Mon Mar 9 03:19:50 2015 UTC,"I have a few questions about possibly adding to the detail of the final product:   Are alternate paint-types available such as matte or colored chrome? Are fancier paints like spectraflame or spectrafrost possible? Is there a way to add details like lights, plates or fancy paintjobs/tampos? Can you custom paint wheels as well?"
HotWheels,2yel5b,IcyOrio,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:35:29 2015 UTC,"Those are some good questions. Thanks for bringing them up   I think you can use a satin paint for matte finishes. There are some brands that produce chrome paints such as VHT, but I've never tried them as I can't find them locally. Otherwise, you could simply stop after paint and not apply the clearcoat. Alternatively, you can use high-temperature paint, engine enamel or brake caliper paint. These all provide a matte finish that is durable to the elements and you won't need to apply any clearcoat on top of it. (I know this because I painted my brake calipers in a matte black finish and it's holding up very well) This one I'm not too sure on. If you go to a paint store and give them a car with Spectraflame paint, they will more than likely be able to mix and match a can of paint for you in the closest shade possible. I've had this done before for color-matching centrecaps for wheels. Yes. I personally don't have experience in doing this, but what some people do is they use hobby paints (the expensive ones that come in small tubs) used in applications such as figurines and Gundam. What you have to do, is before you apply the clearcoat, you hand-paint (using a brush) the details you want (headlights etc). Let it dry, THEN apply your clearcoat. From what I know, applying the paint details after clearcoat will not work as the surface of the clearcoat is too smooth for the paint to properly stick onto. Absolutely. Follow steps 5-7. I don't recommend using 2K clear on wheels as the gaps between the spokes are very small and it's easy for the clearcoat to fill those little crevices, since it is so thick.    Thanks again for bringing these questions up."

HotWheels,2y6ayt,kdryan,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"I'm at work right now but if you go to Google and search for the Wikia website for Hot Wheels, you can select a casting and it shows you every time it's been released since the first one."
HotWheels,2y6ayt,DarkContractor,1 point,Sat Mar 7 00:44:16 2015 UTC,"I love using this website to identify all of the different releases. The values aren't really accurate, but the archive of photos of all the different castings and all the different releases is amazing.  Do you have a particular year you collect?  Are you keeping your cars on the cards or are you displaying them loose?"
HotWheels,2y6ayt,PushcartPops,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:08:45 2015 UTC,"No particular year.  I figured going in this was going to be an Herculean task, so I'm in it for the long haul.  So far they're on the cards, but that is getting kind of inconvenient and I'm not doing it as an investment so I had considered opening them up and getting one of those big display cases you see on Ebay.  I also have Greenlights, Maistoes, etc, all in packages as well."
HotWheels,2y6ayt,PushcartPops,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:21:21 2015 UTC,Here are a few I have picked up. See anything you need? http://i.imgur.com/WsGSEUV.png

HotWheels,2y6ayt,WitBeer,1 point,Sat Mar 7 05:01:24 2015 UTC,This list isn't anywhere near complete but it is a start.  Also South Texas Diecast has casting lists. You might have to do a bit of searching and make your own list.   My goal at this moment is to collect every Hot Wheels Mustang made.   That's a lot of castings if you're going after every different variation of each individual casting.
HotWheels,2y6ayt,PushcartPops,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:09:50 2015 UTC,Are we talking hundreds or thousands?
HotWheels,2y6ayt,Yowomboo,2,Sat Mar 7 02:17:37 2015 UTC,Also remember that some of the really old castings cost a few thousand dollars each.

HotWheels,2y6tal,PushcartPops,1 point,Fri Mar 6 23:36:37 2015 UTC,"Can you take it back to the store? Fine print on the lifetime guarantee is they send you a voucher for a car, not necessarily the same casting."

HotWheels,2y3wrl,manofconviction,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:11:12 2015 UTC,Are they rare or just sought after due to being a brand new and unique modern casting?
HotWheels,2y3wrl,IcyOrio,1 point,Fri Mar 6 10:28:37 2015 UTC,"When they first came out only certain areas were getting them right away so they were hoarded like crazy, however now that most places have them they are not rare just a cool make."

HotWheels,2y2yz2,Lancer007az,1 point,Sun Mar 8 15:12:35 2015 UTC,"The generic fords are annoying, they claim to be 1:64 scale but really they are just random sizes like the one Ford GT is just really small and not to scale at all.

HotWheels,2y2t80,PushcartPops,2,Fri Mar 6 00:57:17 2015 UTC,You aren't going to find too many castings with metal bases in the mainline cars.
HotWheels,2y2t80,BlitzWing1985,1 point,Fri Mar 6 17:26:41 2015 UTC,this is one of those designs I know will see better paint jobs down the line.  I'm not crazy on  the paint job but its not without its charm. IMO a metal base and some classic style deco would really make it pop.

HotWheels,2y1tjp,JaquesNoir,4,Thu Mar 5 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"Most will have treads, but some real riders are slick. The biggest give away is that real riders are a two separate pieces, the rim and the tire, while mainlines have a one piece molded plastic wheel  The first two links below contain both the super and regular, though the wheels are not the clearest in them.  Some information on supers from a previous post of mine.  They've got rubber wheels and they have, usually darker, spectreflame paint than their mainline counterparts. In addition to that darker paint they sometimes have an additional tampo which is reflected on the card. Another example where the tampos don't change but the card does super vs. the regular mainline. In addition to that some of the supers are marked with a small TH tampo.  They're maybe somewhere along the along the lines of 1 in every 5-7 cases. So this makes them exceptionally rare and rather desirable. Usually selling for around the $10-$15 mark, the more desirable the casting the higher price can go.  Edit: Lamley has some great pictures of the 67 corvette super and mainline together.  Lamley post on the Ferrari 599xx  Lamley post about the 69 Boss 302, picture of regular vs mainline is down a bit."
HotWheels,2y1tjp,Yowomboo,2,Thu Mar 5 20:23:45 2015 UTC,I really like that 302 super.
HotWheels,2y1tjp,kxxstarr,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks man this is great.... I knew about the spectra flame difference. I think the wheels are just something I'm gonna have to see in person, or see a macro side by side.  Sometimes the difference between the rims and the wheels is very evident, like when they have the BF Goodrichs on with white or black rims, but the silver hubs or silver rims throw me off... I dunno... Perhaps it just something I gotta see in person, someday.  Thank you so much for the links, I though Lamely was doing custom HW work or prototyping."
HotWheels,2y1tjp,Yowomboo,2,Fri Mar 6 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"All I reallt know about Lamley is that they've got great pictures.  Also I grabbed a super and main line '70 Chevy Chevelle SS and took some photos of the wheels for you. Album of the wheels, the pictures are large so be sure to expand them.  I wouldn't really sweat the wheels though as the paint is so distinguishable you practically don't even have to know what the super is to find one."
HotWheels,2y1tjp,devensega,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"Oh wow! Thank you so much.... Okay I get the wheel difference now... Those real riders aren't near as smooth as the plastic ones.  Can the mods sticky this at the side, super helpful!  Thank you again!"

HotWheels,2xt9zm,gmc4x4truck,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:50:16 2015 UTC,What's the difference? I see the shorter boxed cars occasionally at my local store. I really don't understand this treasure hunt stuff.
HotWheels,2xt9zm,Lancer007az,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:11:23 2015 UTC,I don't see the short cards too often so they're still a novelty for me. The treasure hunts have a circular flame logo somewhere on them and they're less common than the regular mainline cars.
HotWheels,2xt9zm,WitBeer,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:30:53 2015 UTC,Good haul but I just don't get why anyone buys ugly regular thunts like the chicane.
HotWheels,2xt9zm,WitBeer,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:59:33 2015 UTC,you think the regular one is ugly or the TH?
HotWheels,2xt9zm,akeniscool,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:49:45 2015 UTC,both. but people actually buy the thunt because of some perceived rarity (it's not) or high value (it's not).

You have to have a Redline club membership to order in the first window which is necessary to get a car before they sell out, which is usually in minutes.  It's totally worth it though.  25 dollars for the year and you get a RLC car with the membership, however it seems that the drag dairy will be back-ordered forever.  But I digress."

HotWheels,2xni60,TheBigAndy,2,Mon Mar 2 08:52:18 2015 UTC,"Real big collectors would want the cards in good condition. The average person probably won't care, I've bought cards almost non existent on the car before. The biggest issue will probably be like you said shipping and making it worth the trouble to do it. You may get lucky on here, otherwise a lot on ebay for all 11 may work. Craiglist is super super slow in most areas for hot wheels."
HotWheels,2xni60,bored-as-usual,2,Mon Mar 2 13:48:29 2015 UTC,"I'd take the Enzo & Countach off of you, but it would depend on price shipped. Shoot me a PM if you're interested..."

They seem to sell for a few dollars each on ebay, but I figure shipping would kill the deal for most collectors, unless shipping them in bubble mailers is an acceptable practice, not sure how you collectors feel about condition of the cards. Would they sell in a lot, or are they going to be easier to sell individually?   Just looking for some advice."
HotWheels,2xni60,PushcartPops,1 point,Mon Mar 2 08:52:23 2015 UTC,I'm really not seeing anything in your lot that would make it worthwhile to purchase with a shipping cost. As a lot you could sell it but you won't get enough out of it to make it worth your time. That's just my thoughts.
HotWheels,2xni60,Hot_Wheels_guy,0,Mon Mar 2 17:14:24 2015 UTC,"First class padded envelope postage for up to one pound is right around $2.  Not disagreeing with you, just providing context."
HotWheels,2xni60,PushcartPops,2,Mon Mar 2 18:19:16 2015 UTC,Don't ship hot wheels in any kind of envelope.  The blisters get crushed.  Even loose cars can have their axles bent if another box lands on them during transit.
HotWheels,2xni60,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:15:49 2015 UTC,"USPS insure up to $100 on the value. I haven't shipped anything that would lessen Western Civilization if it were destroyed in transit.   That said, I do only sell loose cars right now, and I wrap them in 24x12 bubble wrap.  Using a cardboard box to ship adds another $1-$2 in costs. I get what you are saying, but buyers want cheap shipping.  Sure, if OP took a bunch of highly collectible MOMC cars and shipped them it would probably be worth it to box it, but nothing here is mint or particularly collectible."
HotWheels,2xni60,PushcartPops,2,Mon Mar 2 21:35:14 2015 UTC,"You're much better off playing it safe.  Buyers want to receive what they see (in the photos of the listing).  You could maybe get away with a bubble mailer for this card, but something like this one you wouldn't want to get any worse than it is.  You may assume a slightly bent or creased card is an automatic opener, but I've bought a few like that, that I put in protecto packs, which completely hides the creases and bends for display.  Now I'm pretty sure none of OP's cars are worth putting in protectos but you never know what is and isn't a super rare variation worth keeping carded.    And insurance only covers the price paid by the buyer.  If the item turns out to be worth $50 but the buyer only paid 5, and it's destroyed in shipment, they're only going to be reimbursed the 5 dollars.  Buyer will probably ding your feedback in that situation cuz they just missed out on a deal that would have saved them $45.     $1-$2   That's on the high end, assuming you actually buy your boxes new (which I've never needed to do)."

HotWheels,2xkzwt,thegreendutch,2,Sun Mar 1 20:55:59 2015 UTC,It definitely could be a side bar addition just like the quick rust job vid too. Customizing  hot wheels is like the next step in collecting these things. Makes it so much more fun when you think of these casts as a blank canvas. Thats why I love finding beaters to restore too.

HotWheels,2xhlhj,milecoupe,1 point,Sun Mar 1 18:28:35 2015 UTC,I understand that for the dollar cars but they do the exact same thing for the rlc and higher price cars also considering so many of those come damaged also.If it was just mainline it wouldn't bother me much but when you spend 20-30$ on 1 car I expect it too be mint from the source.

HotWheels,2x5t9j,bored-as-usual,0,Thu Feb 26 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"Was heading back to the office today and knew I would be passing by a couple of K-Marts on the way back.  I decided I was going to stop at both and see if any new cars had hit the racks as I'm waiting to see if I can find a few for the 20 needed for the mail-in El Camino.  I figure I need 20 from K-Mart, should look there first.  After the window to buy the 20 ends, I'll just make sure I have 20 then look elsewhere for the ones I really want.  Stopped by the first and found a Datsun and the black Porsche.  Off to the second.  The second one had nothing new.  But I've been to each of these places a couple times a week since the buying window started.  At this particular location, I've seen the same employee a couple of times.  Older gentlemen, very kind.  We chat a bit each time.  He sees me again today.  ""Not finding what you want?""  I replied, ""Not this time.  I'll keep coming and checking though.""  He asks me:  ""Want to open a couple of cases and restock the shelves?""  :O  ""Is that okay?""  ""Sure.  Be right back.""  ""Thank you!""  He comes back with two cases and several of the El Camino posters from K-Day (pictured in the link).  He gives me two posters and the two cases.  Then he says he'll be right back.  I open the first case, but wondering if this is really okay.  I pull out the first row and it's some I already have, but a couple I've been wanting!  The Lamborghini Huracan and the Custom 77 Dodge Van!  What else is in this case?  What about the second case?!  I'm so happy, I think I might actually find all the ones I want.  Suddenly, another K-Mart employee comes running over to me.  ""I'm sorry sir, but we are not supposed to open these.""  :/  I said I was sorry and handed them back to him.  Told him I already put some on the racks (the ones I already had) and showed them to him to put back in the box.  I again apologized and said I hope I didn't get anyone in trouble.  He said no, but that these cases were for a ""give away""  He took the boxes and left.  Saw the first employee a few minutes later.  He asked, ""Did they take them away from you?""  I said ""yeah""  He said, ""sorry about that.""  I said, ""No problem.  I just hope I didn't get you in trouble.""  He said not to worry about it.  But I was allowed to keep the two posters.  I'm not mad at either employee.  One was just trying to help me out, the other was just trying to do his job.  But it sucked to be so close just to have them taken away.  Oh well, the hunt continues..."

HotWheels,2x09un,IcyOrio,3,Tue Feb 24 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"because hot wheels collectors are insane apparently  i just started delving into it after a couple years of just randomly picking up cars at target/walmart each time i go in, now trying to find some older releases and seeing how much they go for on ebay and how much people want for them on the secondary market just kills me. why would someone pay $10,20,30+ for something that cost someone 99c, it just baffles my mind."
HotWheels,2x09un,manofconviction,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:18:20 2015 UTC,People pay $5000 for freaking Pokemon cards.  Smoke that in your pipe!
HotWheels,2x09un,PushcartPops,2,Tue Feb 24 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"Imagine the only casting you collect in the Fat Fendered '40.  You've been collecting Hot Wheels for the last 30 years but this casting is your favorite.  You have almost every variation Hot Wheels has ever released of this car.  In your mind, few other castings compare to this one.  You're only a couple variations away from being able to say ""I have every Fat Fendered '40 Hot Wheels ever released.""  At that point, what's 24 bucks?    Usually variation chasing has little to do with how cool a car looks and more to do with being able to say you have something rare."
HotWheels,2x09un,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:36:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it has to due with the desirability and scarcity of the wheels. I'm don't usually chase wheel variations, but wheels can make or break a car, so some people will go after a specific variation. It's really no different for why people will pay $30 for a $uper."
HotWheels,2x09un,efficiens,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:37:16 2015 UTC,Literally the only difference on the 1 dollar and 25 variation is that the wheel size looks to be very slightly larger with the rim size looking just a tad larger compared to the wheel than the other. It's not even something very noticeable.
HotWheels,2x09un,efficiens,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it makes sense, but people are willing to pay for errors, variations, etc. Supply and demand."

HotWheels,2x09un,PushcartPops,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:38:16 2015 UTC,I was going by a price guide: http://texashwcollectors.org/hwguide.html
HotWheels,2x09un,PushcartPops,2,Tue Feb 24 19:41:45 2015 UTC,Which versions were you looking at?
HotWheels,2x09un,RedlineFan,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:54:17 2015 UTC,"By the way, I wouldnt really use that website as much more then an excellent spotter's guide for identifying loose cars. It really isnt very accurate on prices. Sold auctions on eBay will give you a better idea of what they might be worth to a buyer looking for that particular casting."
HotWheels,2x1dvc,IcyOrio,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:58:48 2015 UTC,thanks for sharing. You have some cool stuff
HotWheels,2wzsee,IcyOrio,3,Tue Feb 24 14:58:57 2015 UTC,"Are you selling to have less stuff, or more money?  I am finding that some castings have a huge demand. Some castings have followings out to collect every variation of that casting.  Some cars have avid enthusiast followings that want a little version of the car they drive, and really don't collect outside that one car.  For those people you can get a nice price on that one car at a time, if you can find them.  I recently started selling loose cars from my collection on eBay and have seen some castings get some aggressive bidding, and some stuff gets ignored. But best bet is to go through your collection and compare them to Sold listings.  I have found that gives me a good idea of what to expect out of the market.  As far as loose items in the blister,  that is an ""error"".  Some people collect errors.  I doubt it adds value, but it does add interest and a bit of collectibility making it easier to sell. Regarding damaged cards, unless your car is really rare I would go ahead and rip it open.  I am finding that loose cars don't really lose much value provided they aren't chipped up.  It is a lot easier to get good pictures when it is out of the package, and good pictures are so important when selling online."
HotWheels,2wzsee,PushcartPops,3,Tue Feb 24 18:52:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't really call it an error just because a piece got jostled loose. Errors are better suited for when the car has something missing or wrong - something other than the norm.
HotWheels,2wzsee,akeniscool,2,Tue Feb 24 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, that sounds right, it all has to do with context of what is loose. A loose surfboard is different from a loose wheel."
HotWheels,2wzsee,PushcartPops,2,Tue Feb 24 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"Depending on when they are from and what cars. Could be some? If you have treasure hunts or super treasure hunts, or if you're talking like old old? Pics?"
HotWheels,2wzsee,Publius2jz,4,Tue Feb 24 15:15:03 2015 UTC,They're all fairly old. I believe the newest ones were from around 2009/2010 with the oldest being 1995. I'll try and unpack 'em later for a pic.

HotWheels,2wzsee,WitBeer,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:25:34 2015 UTC,"99% will be worth a dollar or less. A few really rare or desirable ones could be worth up to $50 in good condition.

HotWheels,2wyorh,IcyOrio,2,Wed Feb 25 00:52:20 2015 UTC,What kind of display case is that? I'm considering doing something similar if I'm unable to find anything of value in my collection to sell.
HotWheels,2wyorh,PushcartPops,2,Tue Feb 24 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"I bought mine on amazon since I had prime shipping, you can get it on ebay for 5 bucks less. My collection isn't worth any dollar value but they have sentimental value to me since I had a few of these since I was 5 years old.

HotWheels,2wyorh,efficiens,2,Tue Feb 24 18:41:50 2015 UTC,"You might be surprised to find out the dollar value on some of that stuff. JDM stuff is very hot right now.  Just today I sold a Corolla and a Skyline 2000 GTR for $13 shipped each.  I would say that if you sold all those there might be a few hundred dollars in it. Of course, you wouldnt be able to replace them without spending a lot more."

HotWheels,2wy6ld,XC_Stallion92,2,Tue Feb 24 03:20:34 2015 UTC,you wont rust a zamac just the wheel axle. Get 50% or 70 rubbing alcohol with a clean rag and wipe it gently. Acetone(nail polish remover) is what eats the tampos
HotWheels,2wy6ld,thegreendutch,2,Wed Feb 25 00:36:55 2015 UTC,"WD-40 works really well for removing adhesive gunk and has the bonus of not fogging clear acrylic. However I've not used WD-40 on tampos before so it's probably best to test it out on something you don't care about.   A dry erase marker works wells for removing adhesive crap as well. just rub the marker in the sticky mess and wipe with a soft cloth. Repeat the process until clean. Again, haven't done this on tampos so give it a try elsewhere."

HotWheels,2wtiyl,1994GTR,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:04:47 2015 UTC,good luck with the skyline hunt! I have most of those but none are for trade. The sweet rod is probably my most favorite in my collection
HotWheels,2wtiyl,thegreendutch,2,Mon Feb 23 16:02:12 2015 UTC,Thanks that one and the super treasure hunt versions are my 2 most wanted at the moment. I have some other good stuff I would pull out of my personal collection to trade for those 2.
HotWheels,2wtiyl,I_Are_Brown_Bear,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:16:19 2015 UTC,I have the super as well but again a no trade. part of my personal skyline collection. instagram has a huge community of hotwheels collectors for trades if you want to set up one up
HotWheels,2wtiyl,Clawkwork,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:42:34 2015 UTC,Nice trade bait.
HotWheels,2wtiyl,4th_Horseman,1 point,Tue Feb 24 01:41:13 2015 UTC,How much for F&F set and a P1?

HotWheels,2wu9ar,efficiens,2,Mon Feb 23 16:29:24 2015 UTC,Wow. Beautiful. I want one!
HotWheels,2wu9ar,PushcartPops,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:43:22 2015 UTC,I have the Hot Wheels Garage version of this.  Soooo pretty.
HotWheels,2wu9ar,HellaFreshem1,3,Mon Feb 23 17:11:33 2015 UTC,Porsche 993 gt2 or Porsche 934 turbo RSR
HotWheels,2wu9ar,PushcartPops,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:39:05 2015 UTC,That 934 is really cool.
HotWheels,2wu9ar,whyitsdone,3,Mon Feb 23 17:12:17 2015 UTC,Probably the GMC motorhome...I like wierd shit

HotWheels,2wu9ar,Hot_Wheels_guy,2,Mon Feb 23 07:10:49 2015 UTC,Ferrari Testarossa.  I love the 2-tone interior http://i.imgur.com/RTS6KsH.jpg
HotWheels,2wu9ar,efficiens,1 point,Mon Feb 23 07:48:55 2015 UTC,"I've always favored the Matchbox Testarossa. I feel like it better captured the proportions of the car. Still, that's a sweet collection you have there."
HotWheels,2wu9ar,Hot_Wheels_guy,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:48:38 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I have just 3 matchbox cars in my collection and one is a Testarossa http://i.imgur.com/gb4eAa6.jpg but I'm not a fan of the windows.
HotWheels,2wu9ar,efficiens,1 point,Mon Feb 23 20:49:33 2015 UTC,I see what you mean. I have the mainline version with clear windows. I never did like how the rubber tires MB does stick out past the side of the car.
HotWheels,2wu9ar,SpaceFace11,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:44:04 2015 UTC,I have one of these with black paint and gold wheels it is one of my favorites as well.
HotWheels,2wu9ar,jojowasher,2,Mon Feb 23 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"my favorite supercar casting is the 288 GTO, it is my favorite car in general, and I think they really nailed the casting, it looks great!"
HotWheels,2wu9ar,efficiens,2,Mon Feb 23 16:50:57 2015 UTC,That is a fantastic car.
HotWheels,2wu9ar,PushcartPops,2,Mon Feb 23 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"That is like picking my favorite kind if dogs.  Too tough, I love them all.  I love my Murcielago SV. I want a LaFerrari so much. The Venano is very nice.  I like the racing versions like the C6R and the SRT Viper and the Ford GT LM.  I like Ford GT from Matchbox a lot. So many."
HotWheels,2wu9ar,XC_Stallion92,3,Mon Feb 23 17:09:41 2015 UTC,I want a murcielago sv so bad
HotWheels,2wu9ar,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"They pop up on ebay occasionally if you've got $25-30 to put down for one, which, admittedly, is a little ridiculous."
HotWheels,2wu9ar,PushcartPops,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:23:27 2015 UTC,I have bought a few for that price. I hate myself until they arrive.
HotWheels,2wu9ar,litl_e_fan,2,Tue Feb 24 02:08:44 2015 UTC,Which SV do you have? I've got the white Cars of the Decades casting.

HotWheels,2wu9ar,Yowomboo,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:51:31 2015 UTC,I have too many. GMC Panel has been one of my favorites trying to acquire recently.
HotWheels,2wu9ar,WitBeer,1 point,Mon Feb 23 05:33:27 2015 UTC,"Either the Mclaren F1 or Lamborghini Murcielago LP670-4 SV. Had to spend a little bit to get both, but they're wonderful, rare castings that never made it to mainline.  Edit: Also I'm a big fan of the original 2003 Veyron casting."
HotWheels,2wu9ar,gorgon895,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:19:55 2015 UTC,It's a toss up between the 69/70 Mustang Boss 302/429 and the 2014 Custom Mustang.  The 2014 has only been released in the retro entertainment line and I'm not the biggest fan of silver/blue combo but the casting was just done so well. Hoping to see it again with different colors.  Would love to pick up the Super Boss 302 though.
HotWheels,2wsw29,PushcartPops,6,Sun Feb 22 21:58:07 2015 UTC,I noticed you got some downvotes earlier today and gave you ups. Not sure why anyone would downvote anyone on this sub. As a matter of fact I upvote everyone and their comments. You can't please them all I guess.
HotWheels,2wsw29,thegreendutch,2,Mon Feb 23 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"I'm on /r/gamesale too and some people literally post stuff like, ""looking for cheap games to flip."" That I would down vote. Luckily we don't seem to get a lot of that here."
HotWheels,2wsw29,WitBeer,1 point,Mon Feb 23 02:05:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure why anyone would downvote anyone on this sub   Totally agree. We're damn small. If anyone would do anything, just move along."
HotWheels,2wsw29,ThaddeusJP,1 point,Mon Feb 23 03:12:17 2015 UTC,Thanks man!
HotWheels,2wsw29,WitBeer,4,Mon Feb 23 03:31:59 2015 UTC,"Is it the $6 shipping for a single loose car?  Personally, if you want to sell here, just make one post with everything you have and post a price. If I wanted to deal with auctions, then I'd go to eBay, not here."
HotWheels,2wsw29,PlutoniumX,2,Sun Feb 22 22:34:46 2015 UTC,"Is it?  I don't know. I'm not really operating on a level where I can buy bulk shipping materials. I'm using about $1.50 to package it. First class postage is $2.24. I have discounted postage for a guy so he could do a BIN. I will combine shipping for up to 3 cars in one envelope.  It seems to be about on par with other sellers who roll their ""Free Shipping"" into higher starting prices. But Im new to doing this, and if people have feedback then it seems that this sub should have enough friendly cameraderie to give helpful and sensitive feedback like you have as opposed to trying to push my submissions down so others cant see them."
HotWheels,2wsw29,WitBeer,2,Sun Feb 22 22:46:49 2015 UTC,"Start saving boxes, packing stuff and bubble wrap you get in from other people.  I've got a ""shipping dept"" that I've developed.  That helps.  But yeah, shipping can be a pain, especially if you package well.    I'd not downvote you.  I don't see it as much, but I still see it where people have crazy shipping rates on Ebay.  Partially I think to sucker people who don't check and part to not pay a cut to Ebay.    I don't think yours is gouging like that, just a bit high.    I'd be happy to check out a mega post of your items.  I may have even bought from you at some point."
HotWheels,2wsw29,PlutoniumX,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:32:34 2015 UTC,There's no more loophole with eBay. They collect fees on shipping costs too.
HotWheels,2wsw29,WitBeer,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:55:30 2015 UTC,Good to know.  I don't think everyone does though.  :)
HotWheels,2wsw29,Helomyname,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:03:29 2015 UTC,"Not yet.   I have some mega posts of a bunch of different things, I wound up doing a LOT of PMs, and had two transactions. Not knocking the quality if those transactions, just trying to keep myself busy with more quantity."
HotWheels,2wsw29,WitBeer,1 point,Mon Feb 23 03:31:46 2015 UTC,"I have tons of free packaging from shipments I've received. I've never once bought a box or bubble mailer. You're honestly better off with a BIN price and free shipping. You'll get more for it. I wouldn't even look at your auctions because of the shipping price. What if I only win one because I get outbid on the others? Its still $6. You don't have hundreds or thousands of cars listed so I'd be concerned that you wouldn't have anything else I want to split the cost of shipping. Or if you're set on charging for shipping, go with something like $4 plus 50 cents per car."
HotWheels,2wsw29,WitBeer,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:54:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been trying some different set ups for the auctions. I'll take that under advisement."
HotWheels,2wsw29,ThaddeusJP,3,Mon Feb 23 03:27:15 2015 UTC,"On this subreddit it tends to be that id you want to sell/trade, you post everything you have in one post, and discuss the price or trade via pms. I think the reason for your downvotes is the fact it is a link to eBay, which is something people could check out either way.  (I dont downvote tho :3)"
HotWheels,2wsw29,Jawnzzz,2,Sun Feb 22 23:00:07 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the feedback.  I only posted these posts because they are cars that seem to be highly desirable. I think $7 for a Bugatti Veyron or Nissan Skyline shipped to your door isnt a bad starting point considering what they are going for.  But seriously, I have several hundred cars available to sell. Putting them in one post would take forever, and it would drop off the front page within days from people posting the new car they got at Target. Not that I dont appreciate those posts, i like to see new stuff. But i create an auction and I can keep relisting it until it sells, and thousands of people will see it. I can refrain from sharing my auctions in the future if it isn't welcome."
HotWheels,2wsv3q,x_driven_x,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:50:38 2015 UTC,I really like that Bone Shaker. Is there anything your looking for specifically?
HotWheels,2wsv3q,FR05TY14,1 point,Tue Feb 24 04:49:19 2015 UTC,"/u/x_driven_x is a very responsible seller. I purchased a handful of cars from him and they arrived quickly and safely, as described. Also, there was a bit of a mixup on which cars I was supposed to receive so to make up for it, he sent me the correct cars and let me keep the cars he shipped by mistake. This guy is a legit seller. Thanks again /u/x_driven_x !! A+"

HotWheels,2wozh5,ThaddeusJP,2,Sat Feb 21 23:09:59 2015 UTC,I went through the whole bin and found zero treasure hunts or supers. Had about 20+ mclaren though
HotWheels,2wok6x,whyitsdone,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:21:56 2015 UTC,Nice. I too scored my Snoopy at Target.
HotWheels,2wok6x,revolverevlover,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:49:57 2015 UTC,Saw these at our target today as well. Left them hanging up front. My wife had been picking up the Snoopy whenever she saw one...I found 5 in my bin where she throws the ones she finds.
HotWheels,2wnwxo,tg01millmorer,3,Sat Feb 21 16:03:18 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/Go3DLVC.png http://i.imgur.com/MBkAlan.png http://i.imgur.com/tFOGwpt.png http://i.imgur.com/AzeA7V9.png  They're selling them for about £2.50 each. There are roughly 30-40 of them. Most boxed, a few unboxed but with date stickers on them. Clearly a collector has either passed away, or their wife has taken them all to dump at the charity shop. Just wondered if they're worth buying and putting on eBay?"
HotWheels,2wnwxo,1994GTR,1 point,Sat Feb 21 16:06:50 2015 UTC,that short card t-hunt rodger dodger is worth 10-15
HotWheels,2wnwxo,1994GTR,-3,Sat Feb 21 16:28:50 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks. I might make them an offer for the lot, and sell them on eBay. But I doubt they'll go for it"
HotWheels,2wnwxo,Pinkd56,0,Sat Feb 21 17:04:48 2015 UTC,at least buy and t-hunts in the lot. typically those are worth a bit more than 2.50. especially all those older ones with rubber tires
HotWheels,2wnwxo,Pinkd56,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:05:51 2015 UTC,At that price point I don't see how you can turn them into profit. I would probably snag the treasure hunts to use as trade bait though. Some of the older blue cars may have a little value.

HotWheels,2wkdsa,thegreendutch,1 point,Fri Feb 20 22:18:30 2015 UTC,Saw this today and found a 599. Its a great idea though. There was other stuff inside too like a shampoo and a couple ripped up cards lol
HotWheels,2wkdsa,SpeedyCarz66,1 point,Mon Feb 23 05:22:25 2015 UTC,My target did this too but it looked like they put one case on the racks and dumped another into that bin. It was so hard to look through it.  Edit: Fuckin' autocorrect

HotWheels,2w5mj6,BruceAGMotorsports,1 point,Tue Feb 17 03:49:59 2015 UTC,dasAviator I also noticed that Target had the special going on and went through a few other stores as well. As for the models the only one that was actually a NEW MODEL was the SRT Viper GTS-R though they all are 2015 model year. Hope I didn't mislead. But they are all great for the collection with the Veneno coming only in the rare ZAMAC color scheme exclusive to WalMart. The COPO Camaro and the SRT Viper GTS-R also get another color for this year with the COPO in silver and the recently announced Viper in a black and red scheme. Will be looking for those of course so hopefully see those in  a future video. :)

HotWheels,2w3wn5,V8INT3RC3PTOR,1 point,Mon Feb 16 20:59:04 2015 UTC,well I've found I can get say 16 pop culture cars (real riders and metal on metal) for about $70 a case before shipping and tax cool classics and other plastic wheel lines are cheaper but I dont know if there is as much demand. If I get a few boxes the store will do a deal on shipping. Thats the problem shipping is a killer that many cars do add up so sadly its still not going to be super cheap but a great deal cheaper then the £10-£15 a car I see on Amazon/Ebay.  I might buy a box and sell what I don't want to start with. I don't want to start making commitments if I'm not %100 about ordering them

HotWheels,2vw3ur,Griffin99,3,Sat Feb 14 18:07:11 2015 UTC,"Some information on supers from a previous post of mine.  They've got rubber wheels and they have, usually darker, spectreflame paint than their mainline counterparts. In addition to that darker paint they sometimes have an additional tampo which is reflected on the card. Another example where the tampos don't change but the card does super vs. the regular mainline. In addition to that some of the supers are marked with a small TH tampo.  They're maybe somewhere along the along the lines of 1 in every 5-7 cases. So this makes them exceptionally rare and rather desirable. Usually selling for around the $10-$15 mark, the more desirable the casting the higher price can go.  Regular treasure hunts usually come one per case, it is possible for a case to not have one though unlikely. They sport unique colors and tampos. Since 2013 regular treasure hunts have been marked with a small flame logo."

Those codes are on the side of the cardboard boxes (or ""cases""). Collectors usually use them to as references to when certain cars come out. For example, the Datsun Wagon yellow variation will be coming out in the G case.  It helps keep an eye on what's being released in your area, as well as find certain cars or know what you're getting when you buy a case online.  Other lines also follow a similar scheme, including Retro Entertainment and Pop Culture."

I look for particular castings, like the go kart or the GMC Motorhomes.  I still want to collect, I have just gotten to the point where J can't make room for a few hundred cars per year.

HotWheels,2uwzz4,Len_Zefflin,2,Thu Feb 5 21:58:22 2015 UTC,All those cars are from the late '90's.  The '57 Chevy is the 30th Anniversary version from 1998. The actual redline from 1977 was made in Hong Kong and had embossed redline wheels instead of redline tampo's.  The Porsche came out in 1997 and is an old Corgi casting. I don't believe many if any of those had dates on their bases.
HotWheels,2uwzz4,TurboNarwhal,1 point,Fri Feb 6 02:43:54 2015 UTC,"wow much newer than I thought. is the date on the bottom of the car the date it was designed? I know on new ones it's the model year of the car, but on older ones it's not. like the bottom of the Chevy says 1976 but clearly it's not from 1976."

HotWheels,2upy3v,efficiens,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:10:08 2015 UTC,"Even though I love Hot Wheels Ferraris, It doesn't bother me much at all that they lost the rights to it.  The castings have been getting cheaper and cheaper, with less detail and too much plastic and not enough metal.  The stuff they've released in the last couple years in the way of Ferraris has been pretty ""meh"" compared to the previous 30 years."
HotWheels,2upy3v,Hot_Wheels_guy,7,Wed Feb 4 06:01:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry you're being downvoted for your opinion. However I'm not sure I agree with your statement. For instance, I think the LaFerrari, 458 Spider, F12 Berlinetta are wonderful, beautiful castings, as compared to older ones like the old 308's, F40, or 365 models which, to me, look fairly cheap. Which old ones do you think are better than the new ones?"
HotWheels,2upy3v,Hot_Wheels_guy,2,Wed Feb 4 16:58:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. The one thing I don't like on some of the newer ones is how loose the wheels are, so they stick out from the side of the car. The F12berlinetta and FF really have this issue."
HotWheels,2upy3v,FeltchingBlumpkin,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:11:43 2015 UTC,"For one, they'd stopped making my favorite casting- the Testarossa- a long time ago and replaced it with the 512M.  The Testarossa had a 2-tone interior, which is infinitely cooler than the single color interior of the 512M.  Secondly, the last F40 they released (a yellow 5-pack car) came in several variations, one of which had the rear hatch sealed shut, which was definitely a sign of things to come.  (The 2014 blue 5-pack '65 mustang convertible was also released with a closed hood variation (unlike the previous 20 years of that casting).)   I love the F40, 308, 365, and Testarossa.  I'm a sucker for the classics.  I'm not a fan of the F12 as it looks like it should have been offered with a 4-door option, and it even looks long enough to be a sedan.  The LaFerrari looks cool but the plastic base really really kills it for me.  It just feels too light in your hand, and that makes it feel cheap.  Same for the 458.  I have most of the Italia variations they released but they're packed away in a box.  They look cool but, again, plastic bases... And when it's a casting where you can see the edge of the base while looking at the car from the front or side (which is almost every Ferrari casting ever), the absence of that authentic metal look is glaring.  This one pic of one of my favorite Ferraris in my collection nicely sums it all up."

HotWheels,2ujxy5,manofconviction,3,Mon Feb 2 20:20:10 2015 UTC,Picked these up for $2 a piece from a local comic store earlier this year. The details on them are great and are slightly larger than standard Hot Wheels cars.
HotWheels,2ujxy5,bored-as-usual,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:21:14 2015 UTC,Never saw them before but they look pretty awesome.  I've been picking up things like these for a little bit due to the detail they add to them.
HotWheels,2ujxy5,Yowomboo,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"I just picked up a few different castings on the HW Collectible page of STD and the extra detail on these are really nice. They're also still in ~1:64 scale.  The ones I picked up have metal bases, detailed wheels (most were real riders), opening hoods, relatively detailed engines, painted drivetrain or exhaust, painted lights, and some nice trim paint.   They're not cheap though, most of the ones I picked up were between $6-$8. Even with the price I was rather pleased when I actually got a hold of them.   Here is an album of one of them.  Though I will say if you can find greenlight locally the quality is better than these and costs less, $5-6 per 1:64 casting. A 67' Eleanor I picked up for an example. Though I did pay more for this one online than the Boss 302."
HotWheels,2ujxy5,bored-as-usual,1 point,Mon Feb 2 22:52:40 2015 UTC,"Looks really good actually,  $6-8 isn't terrible at all.  Any car model is way more, but that looks great.  I've recently picked up vw gti and mercedes."
HotWheels,2ujxy5,Yowomboo,1 point,Mon Feb 2 23:17:21 2015 UTC,"I only mentioned the cost because I'd wager there's a fair number of people who don't consider spending more than the $1 that the mainlines cost. I feel it was definitely well worth it, especially from ebay.  Nice finds, any pictures of the gti or mercedes? The hot wheels Golf gti if a fairly nice looking casting."

People see Hot Wheels and they get inspired to make art correlating to it, but I don't think Hot Wheels does anything as a whole to really encourage that creativity out there to kids other than a few handfuls of merchandise such as the car maker."

In that time, they ran out of the GITD Grave Digger that I originally wanted the points for, so I ended up picking up the Mud Monster Mutt and a random car holiday pack. Hopefully they come in a box, when I received my first of the silver Max D's, it came in an envelope and the card and bubble were destroyed"
HotWheels,2tvxsq,PushcartPops,2,Tue Jan 27 21:34:58 2015 UTC,What are you asking for these?
HotWheels,2tvxsq,ScreamWithMe,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:13:34 2015 UTC,To be honest I would want to do research before I quoted a value.  Are you interested in a package deal or a particular car?
HotWheels,2tvxsq,rvsunp,2,Thu Jan 29 00:29:59 2015 UTC,Dragstrip Demons were so underrated. Awesome series.

HotWheels,2tsh7q,dylan424,1 point,Tue Jan 27 01:43:59 2015 UTC,I was going through some of my old Hotwheels from when I was a kid the other day. I found a red Veyron and a blue Skyline like yours. I got so excited haha.
HotWheels,2tsh7q,manofconviction,3,Tue Jan 27 04:13:44 2015 UTC,i need some veyron's in my collection

HotWheels,2tsh7q,MutantHamster,1 point,Tue Jan 27 03:49:15 2015 UTC,And some of these... http://i.imgur.com/NexN64E.png
HotWheels,2tsh7q,RangeRoverHSE,1 point,Tue Jan 27 01:46:22 2015 UTC,"Not too big of a fan of the Veyron, though the grey and blue one looks stellar. Same colors on a '65 Mustang Fastback I picked up. The reflective blue just looks so better in person too.  Loving the Ford GT with the gulf oil colors. Wouldn't mind seeing it on more castings. It looks great on the fast fish and 70 chevy chevelle ss."
HotWheels,2tsh7q,MutantHamster,1 point,Tue Jan 27 02:14:26 2015 UTC,I actually have the same Silver and Blue Veyron on my desk.

HotWheels,2toqln,Yowomboo,1 point,Mon Jan 26 07:51:11 2015 UTC,"Also, if you're a sucker for card variants, 2009 models (I believe the purple) came on cards with snowflakes on them.  The car is the same, so unless you need all card variants, you can skip this."
HotWheels,2tntyb,PushcartPops,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:09:40 2015 UTC,I have never seen those donks and bubbles before.  Willing to trade?
HotWheels,2tntyb,I_Are_Brown_Bear,1 point,Mon Jan 26 02:11:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, they aren't worth a huge amount so it would be more interesting if you picked out some other stuff you like. I still have a lot of cars to still post."
