Madden,3e58uw,thebochman,3,Wed Jul 22 01:35:32 2015 UTC,"As far as the passing game goes, man coverage is generally weak against any hard cuts (i.e. stick, slant, and dig routes). Cover 2 is weak deep down the outsides and deep middle. Cover 3 is weak along the seams and with flat and stick routes. Cover 4 is weak against pretty much anything underneath. Cover 6 is really just a combination of cover 2 and cover 4. As far as the run game goes, it's really as simple as saying that a stronger defense will have more players near the line of scrimmage."

However, the bucks in my CFM are super bowl contenders from year 1.   I'd like to see what teams need to put them over the hump. Bengals, Chargers, Texans, Colts. All decent teams that just can't get it done. I think I'll play as one of those and try to find that one missing piece."

Madden,3e34wc,Rfwill13,6,Tue Jul 21 23:03:33 2015 UTC,Interesting... IMO the Vikings are still in a rebuilding phase and their defense is stacked with talent. If I didn't hate them so much they would be my first choice.
Madden,3e34wc,ridemooses,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:48 2015 UTC,Agreed.  The Vikings have so much young talent.  I am not a Vikings fan at all but I can't wait to play with them in Madden 16.
Madden,3e34wc,switchn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:07 2015 UTC,Half the fun of rebuilding in Madden is finding a QB though. Teddy will probably have a low 80s rating and quick dev.

Madden,3e3j1m,jfuss04,11,Wed Jul 22 02:08:10 2015 UTC,"Wow, look at how they've nerfed speed in this Madden. I thought it was just them exaggerating when they were talking about blazing fast 92 SPD rookies like Amari Cooper, but Marshawn Lynch is 85? Adrian Peterson is 90? (He was like 97 last year.) Jamaal Charles is 92? (He was 97 last year.) DeMarco Murray went from 95 to 89?   That's some serious speed nerfing."
Madden,3e3j1m,Moruitelda,9,Tue Jul 21 18:25:27 2015 UTC,"But it's not across the board. Beasley is within a few speed of Charles, there's still absurdly fast lbs in the game. Mariota is almost 90 speed. It doesn't look so much that they nerfed speed as much as they nerfed rbs"
Madden,3e3j1m,tubabacon,3,Tue Jul 21 18:27:40 2015 UTC,"I did notice that. I think they did it to all skill position players though.  This will probably only increase the value of fast coverage linebackers, since if a guy has 75 MCV and 88 SPD, you can just stay in 4-3 and man him up on a receiver safely."
Madden,3e3j1m,Moruitelda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"It's looking like the draft champion videos showed the real stats instead of mut stats like people assumed, none of the other positions really seem changed at all besides hbs  Edit: some are different than they were in m15. The whole thing just seems inconsistent to me"
Madden,3e3j1m,tubabacon,5,Tue Jul 21 18:31:45 2015 UTC,At least the crappy draft class halfbacks will be consistent with the crappy real-life halfbacks.
Madden,3e3j1m,Moruitelda,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"lmao ""our running backs are way too slow to in drafts in M15, so lets just lower all running backs instead.""  I can't believe they've done this."
Madden,3e3j1m,Moruitelda,2,Tue Jul 21 18:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's bizarre. If Charles is only 92 SPD and you still have 90 SPD linebackers, there's no way that you're going to be running stretch plays or off-tackles anymore. The draw, trap and inside zone and MAYBE power are about the only plays you can run when your 4.3-running halfback is only 2 speed faster than your 4.55-running linebacker."
Madden,3e3j1m,Moruitelda,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:36 2015 UTC,"I've gone through draft champions videos and those cards are going to be slightly lowered compared to the regular roster, the thing is the cards ive been able to compare, leveon bell, demarco, and amari cooper speed is dead on for amari and demarco and leveon's card is one point slower than his base game one.   LBs on the other hand are just as fast as last years game as well as safeties. So CBs, WRs, HBs, TEs, all seem to have been nerfed speed wise. HBs and WRs taking the biggest hits, like for instance theres an 86 speed AJ Green an 87 speed randal cobb and an 83 speed vincent jackson."
Madden,3e3j1m,poopwho13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:09 2015 UTC,Just imagine how hilarious it's going to be when Vincent Jackson regresses at age 31. He'll be like 38 SPD.

Madden,3e3j1m,KastaJav,3,Wed Jul 22 00:14:34 2015 UTC,EA is killing me with these speed ratings. How is Bell worse than AP after his dominance last year both through the air and ground? I'm cool with Beastmode being number 1 tho...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHzhbqUVsIM
Madden,3e3j1m,fgoom,12,Tue Jul 21 22:48:37 2015 UTC,Can we talk about how absolutley fucked these speed ratings are?
Madden,3e3j1m,lookingforanOD,7,Tue Jul 21 18:24:00 2015 UTC,Melvin Gordon ran a 4.56 40 and they gave him 91 spd. Faster than AP and Murray. So messed up
Madden,3e3j1m,fgoom,8,Tue Jul 21 23:21:47 2015 UTC,God forbid they for once try to make it more realistic by having more of a rating spread instead of everyone being in the high 90s. I like the change.
Madden,3e3j1m,poopwho13,14,Tue Jul 21 19:29:18 2015 UTC,It doesn't work when you don't do it to EVERY position. LBs and DL are just as fast as last year.
Madden,3e3j1m,villepa26,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:48 2015 UTC,"For real, what is this"
Madden,3e3j1m,ReallyFnCleverName,2,Tue Jul 21 20:38:32 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. They need to do it across the board or not at all, I agree."
Madden,3e3j1m,danchan22,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:03:41 2015 UTC,What's the point if it's across the board? Then the speed radio is the same and they still burn the defense. They are that fast in real life. Fuck this change
Madden,3e3j1m,greatnessdc,9,Wed Jul 22 04:48:45 2015 UTC,The thing is that they didn't do it across the board. The top RBs have speeds from 85-92 but when you have linebackers and quarterbacks who are just as fast the running game will just go to shit because you can't hit the hole on the edge before the lb with 89 speed will already be there.
Madden,3e3j1m,TheVetNoob,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:44 2015 UTC,It has already been an issue for many generations that some slow ass dude would somehow catch up to me on a break away run with Jamaal..... or some 3rd stringer LB runs down De'Anthony Thomas on the ten yard line as I return a would be kickoff TD. Yeah because that happens
Madden,3e3j1m,ReallyFnCleverName,8,Wed Jul 22 02:28:37 2015 UTC,Vic Beasley 88 speed. Marcus Mariota 88 speed. Jamaal Charles 92 speed. Oh okay.
Madden,3e3j1m,Da_Baseball_Junkie,3,Tue Jul 21 22:21:06 2015 UTC,Didn't Vic run a crazy good 40 though?
Madden,3e3j1m,Samwise777,9,Tue Jul 21 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"Beasley ran a 4.53, but Jamaal Charles ran a 4.38 and was a literal track star."
Madden,3e3j1m,TheVetNoob,2,Tue Jul 21 23:23:16 2015 UTC,Yet even at 97/98 speed with Charles I still have some fat fuck LB catching up to me on a long run.... super realistic
Madden,3e3j1m,Samwise777,2,Wed Jul 22 02:26:27 2015 UTC,Bell should be rated higher
Madden,3e3j1m,Samwise777,2,Wed Jul 22 01:24:15 2015 UTC,After doing a little searching I saw that Kevin White has the same exact 40 time as Desean Jackson.  Jackson has been 98 speed for years and White this year is 94 speed.  Just from that I would assume WR speed has been nerfed.  I'm honestly pretty excited to have a lot less speed in the game.
Madden,3e3j1m,TheVetNoob,5,Tue Jul 21 19:12:31 2015 UTC,"""a lot less""  You mean none?"
Madden,3e3j1m,Poshmidget,5,Tue Jul 21 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if Jamaal Charles has 92 speed, then there are basically no speed backs at all this year. Maybe CJ Spiller?"

Madden,3e3j1m,switchn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:24 2015 UTC,"So here's another point: Ryan Shazier has the exact same 40 yard dash time as Jamaal Charles, 4.38 seconds.  Last year Charles was 98 speed and Shazier was 92.  Why is that fair?  Its much better to have it this way and have Charles and Shazier have identical speed stats because in the real world they are the exact same speed."
Madden,3e3j1m,jfuss04,4,Tue Jul 21 20:10:44 2015 UTC,"You're insane if you think in the real world that Ryan Shazier and Jamaal Charles are the exact same speed on the field.   Do you think De'Anthony Thomas (4.5 40) is slower than Tyler Gafney (4.49)? 40 times aren't an exact measurement of a players speed at all, especially when they're hand timed like Shazier's was."
Madden,3e3j1m,jfuss04,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:23:26 2015 UTC,"They should the same speed. Charles should have DRASTICALLY higher agility, elusiveness, and acceleration. Straight line speed should be the same."

Madden,3e3j1m,TheVetNoob,2,Wed Jul 22 02:38:30 2015 UTC,I just checked that site out and they somehow managed to create ratings even worse than EA's. Justin Houston at 75 but Tamba Hali at 98? Unless I'm seriously misunderstanding something.

Madden,3e3zdd,HoMeRjAy1323,-2,Tue Jul 21 22:37:14 2015 UTC,Simply put ps4 is a games first console. Xbone is an entertainment hub/console. Ps4 has a bigger install base which is why u are now seeing company's  show builds and other stuff on the ps4. I was gonna have both but decided to just get a ps4 as no games really impressed me enough to feel like i needed an xbone. In the end its really about what u want in a console

I say I prefer Xbox Live because I think it has a better interface and setup. Of course, that's just my preference.  Also, Xbox Live setup a ton of servers for Xbox One, which is why some games are seeing dedicated servers (i.e. Halo, Gears of War, Titanfall).

Madden,3dz10n,willfoxylove,5,Tue Jul 21 00:57:33 2015 UTC,I agree. Both him and Winston have a lot of proving to do.
Madden,3dz10n,JahstenC,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:01 2015 UTC,Yeah assuming the ratings work like previous years he's already an ELITE QB in game.
Madden,3dz10n,TadGhostal1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:38:54 2015 UTC,That's pretty accurate to his college game though. He couldn't really throw deep well but scrambling and short throws were his bread and butter.

Madden,3dz2et,switchn,2,Mon Jul 20 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"Great reply dude. Jameis ran something like 5 flat at the combine. He has wheels tho. In my opinion those stats for speed are spot on. He's not going to torch you with his legs, but he will pick up yards of they're there"
Madden,3dz2et,YoWarndog,2,Tue Jul 21 13:12:30 2015 UTC,That Jets D-line is going to be nasty
Madden,3dz2et,ewugoeags,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:23:06 2015 UTC,Who will be the best of their D-line to convert to a linebacker? Kinda have to fit 5 into 4 positions atm and I'm not a fan of having a star on the bench.
Madden,3dz2et,switchn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:17 2015 UTC,"You mean fit 4 into 3? The Jets run an Attacking 3-4.   Sheldon Richardson was suspended for four games so this won't be an issue in the early year, but when I comes back I think our best bet is to convert Wilkerson to Edge LB. If over the course of the next two season he lost some weight he could definitely get the speed he needs to play the edge like that."

Madden,3dz2et,YoWarndog,2,Tue Jul 21 13:13:59 2015 UTC,Vic with 88 speed. What up
Madden,3dz2et,wannaknowmyname,4,Tue Jul 21 02:42:30 2015 UTC,They shouldn't have any of the rookie QB's rated higher than last years rookie starters. None of them have shown what they are like in the NFL in an actual game.
Madden,3dz2et,sniperhare,13,Mon Jul 20 19:05:25 2015 UTC,Sounds like someone is mad that there's higher ratings at rookie year than Bortles is at his second year.
Madden,3dz2et,gatordude731,5,Mon Jul 20 20:35:56 2015 UTC,"I've always wanted the ratings to be a lot lower. To me, 95+ should be HOF caliber in their prime, not who is the current best and rookies should be low unless they prove otherwise.  But I don't even really want to see Overall ratings in game.  I'd be happy just seeing physical stats, scheme abilities and production.  Which kind of seems like I'm bitching at myself for what I'm complaining about. But in truth you're right. I don't think unproven rookies should be rated higher than players who have already been in the league at certain levels.  Maybe the Madden devs are spot on? Mariota could be another thorn in the side of the Jaguars for years, like Luck is turning into.  It can only bring about better football games and a more competitive division."
Madden,3dz2et,sniperhare,5,Mon Jul 20 22:12:33 2015 UTC,Agree with you 100%. The ratings system is so jank and really needs to be changed. I have a feeling Winston will be rated higher than a player like Carson Palmer and maybe even Jay Cutler which isn't right even in the slightest.
Madden,3dz2et,Ginix,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:45 2015 UTC,"There is zero chance that Winston is rated higher than Cutler, and a miniscule chance that Palmer is below him."
Madden,3dz2et,TheVetNoob,2,Tue Jul 21 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be too sure about that. Agreed that Cutler one is highly unlikely but I can almost guarentee Winston will be rated higher than QBs that have already proved they're viable starters. It's just the way Madden works, they want marketable players to be rated highly, just look at Manziel."
Madden,3dz2et,Ginix,4,Tue Jul 21 00:32:04 2015 UTC,"Manziel was a 77 OVR. Less than EJ Manuel, Matt Cassel, Case Keenum and only 2 points higher than Terrelle Pryor."

Not just QBs and OLs but also WRs.   Recently drafted a QB in the 4th who had 91 THP, 81 MED, 82 STA, and 71 DEEP, as well as 80s speed agility and accl.   also drafted a 6'5 238 pound WR with 97 SPD, 93 ACCL, and 90 AGL.   you can build a monster team through the draft. It's just about knowing what kind of players to get. Also pay attention to the age. 24 year old rookies aren't as valuable as 20 year olds."
Madden,3dz8b8,_FlyingPair_,3,Mon Jul 20 19:14:40 2015 UTC,Lol I drafted a WR just like yours but he was 6'6 265. He was unstoppable.

Madden,3dz8b8,reddit_on_my_phone,10,Wed Jul 22 04:31:41 2015 UTC,If you're playing madden 15 all the draft classes are randomized so it is near impossible to predict what players are in the draft.
Madden,3dz8b8,collitas,0,Mon Jul 20 19:07:17 2015 UTC,Do they have any signature players? I think it was Madden 13 that had some featured players who we're really good
Madden,3dz8b8,collitas,6,Mon Jul 20 19:25:27 2015 UTC,I don't think so. Pay attention during the season by using your scouting points. and age is king. I rarely draft players over 21
Madden,3dz8b8,SocalSurfer,4,Mon Jul 20 19:45:19 2015 UTC,It's randomized but I always find that linemen are the easiest to draft and there are some studs there.
Madden,3dz8b8,Tumbleweed420,3,Tue Jul 21 00:20:59 2015 UTC,"This is kind of cheating, but it works. I only draft players 22 or younger with an intangible rating of c or better. you can almost scout the entire draft if you only look at intangibles. The I only put enough experience points to get them to an 84 overall rating, and save the rest. In week one of the 4th year, I resign them on the cheap. Then I spend their experience. Yesterday, I resigned my 23yr old running back to a six year 30 mil contract. I had over 100k experience saved up. After I spent the experience, he went up to 99 overall. You can do this with every position and afford all of them if you plan it out right. Then in the final year of their contract, I trade them for draft picks and repeat the process. I havn't signed a free agent in 4 years. I'm in the 12th year of my franchise and my team has been 99 overall since year 6."
Madden,3dz8b8,backfatt,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:04 2015 UTC,Trade off your better players and picks for as many early first round picks as you can.  Simulate and tank the first season.  Draft and build your rookies through playing.
Madden,3dz8b8,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:01:06 2015 UTC,"Plenty of good players -- pay close attention to draft stories. If they are good they are basically a lock to have at least quick development.

If you want to use that roster in a CFM, you need to have it active when you start the CFM, and use the custom roster option.  I would imagine that it's going to be the same in 16.   If you're talking about editing players from within CFM mode, and editing rookies? Yeah, it sucks, but that's a no-go. Not sure exactly why. It might relate to multiplayer abuse concerns, or achievements, or something."

Keep playing and figure out the way you like to play. Learn the difference between a 3-4 and a 4-3. Just keep playing and you will eventually get it. For example I run the ball a lot on offense, and run a blitz heavy zone defense out of the 3-4 scheme. Play and do a ton of research and figure out what you like"
Madden,3dziuh,RAVENS17d,3,Mon Jul 20 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"Same thing you do with anything else to get better, just practice and play. If you have a general idea of how football works you'll be fine. I also dont recommend getting m16 on ps3.  Even M15 on last gen was pretty much the exact same as m25."
Madden,3dziuh,Knights_23,2,Mon Jul 20 21:19:43 2015 UTC,Try out lots of different playbooks and new plays. Don't run the same plays over an over again. Stay away from cheesy plays. Try changing to a pocket passing QB so you can learn to make reads and throw the right pass. Too many players have a run first attitude.
Madden,3dziuh,switchn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:37:31 2015 UTC,Nothing actually.  It's a totally different game with different features and a different game engine.   The defenses will react differently the offenses will react differently and in these maddens coverages can be called that are fakes (Cover 4 show 2).  So you see cover 2 presnap but it's actually a cover 4 call.    None of that was in M13.  So your best bet is just to get M16 and log the hours.
Madden,3dziuh,steach91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:46:26 2015 UTC,"1.) Don't get m16 on the ps3, it's just bad and not worth it unless you get next gen.  2.) As for your learning question, don't even practice, it'll take you 2 minutes to learn face catching once you get m16 anyways ."

Madden,3dv639,SmackMymelons,18,Mon Jul 20 09:13:35 2015 UTC,"As someone who buys madden games every few years, I'm completely content with just sticking with 15. Some of the new features look nice, but I think it'll be a similar game overall. It's just how they are."
Madden,3dv639,JahstenC,-40,Sun Jul 19 20:52:52 2015 UTC,15 was probably the worst game in a decade.  The game was fundamentally broken.  M13 was a close second only because franchises simply broke the game. You'd get irrecoverable errors and have to scrap your league.   M25 had been the best game in a decade. I'm hoping M16 breaks that.  But I'm doubtful as it's getting more and more Arcadish.
Madden,3dv639,steach91,4,Mon Jul 20 00:41:17 2015 UTC,"15 does have its flaws, especially with the rag doll. But it's better than what I had. 9 and 10 were decent, but 15 did up the difficulty for me."
Madden,3dv639,JahstenC,5,Mon Jul 20 04:30:55 2015 UTC,"M14 was actually the easiest game to play offensively.    Passing defense is atrocious, and running the ball is guaranteed to get 4-5 yards every snap of you run a zone play up the middle."
Madden,3dv639,steach91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:38:36 2015 UTC,I didn't play that one very much. All I knew was that 14 and 15 for the 360/PS3 were very similar. But that does sound like a realistic outcome.

Madden,3dv639,SwissyVictory,4,Mon Jul 20 18:44:10 2015 UTC,I do see slightly better graphics in 16. Also the improved Receiver/DB interactions look pretty good. I don't think it's an automatic buy if you own 15. Madden seems to be a buy once every 2 years type of game.

Madden,3dv639,Lexicon24,-20,Sun Jul 19 22:51:15 2015 UTC,"Your right, the new menu backgrounds made the $60 worth every penny. I actually wrote EA a love letter and said if they raised the price id still buy their roster update"

Madden,3dv639,clientnotfound,2,Mon Jul 20 06:28:34 2015 UTC,"M15 was one of the best updates in the series in a LONG time. The graphics were revolutionary and the new features like the cone and upgrades on defense helped to tone down the ridiculous offense in previous maddens. I think EA noticed that they did good, and are trying to ride that success into m16 like the bunch of dicks they are. Unfortunately EA has me by the balls and I'm going to buy it regardless."
Madden,3dv639,WeDemHawks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:27:02 2015 UTC,I'll wait at least a few weeks to see peer and website reviews. Right now I'm leaning towards the downloadable rosters from 15.

Madden,3dv639,strapt_nasty22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:04:19 2015 UTC,"Madden 25 still has downloadable community rosters, so I'd say you are safe for quite a while."

Madden,3dwu4h,Faltnor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:52:47 2015 UTC,"What is this FIFA Proclub?  On a more serious note, friends and I talked about this for years and would be an amazing upgrade."
Madden,3dwu4h,Youre-So-Smart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:09:46 2015 UTC,"Superstar on the same team would be amazing, I would love to spend a day with 4 friends all playing on the same defense.  Of course it will never happen, also if it does you will all have to play online."
Madden,3dun64,DunDerD,2,Sun Jul 19 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"1) In Owner Mode (assuming it's going to be similar to '15) you have all the abilities that you do as a coach, and you have control over the owner aspect. So yes, you can play the games.  2) & 3) Each team is limited to only 1 user total. So you can be an owner, coach or player, but you can't have more than one user in the same organization."
Madden,3dun64,oconnor9sean,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:06:01 2015 UTC,Ok thank you for the response.
Madden,3dun64,WeDemHawks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"You can be an owner and your friend can also be a safety on the other team, and you can play against him which is pretty cool."
Madden,3dt3ly,get_trashed,21,Sun Jul 19 04:50:42 2015 UTC,"I hate how the game ruins players like this. Okay, so he's converted positions in his storyline. Why not make him a 60 overall with SS Dev so at least he will be useful in a few years if you stick with him. Or, allow us to convert him back to his natural position. There's so many wasted storyline players and it's annoying. (I know they can't all be good, but there shouldn't be so many that are unusable).  A recent annoying one I had was a WR who was a beast pass blocker with SS dev but he had 70's speed and acc. Could have been somewhat useful as a TE but will never amount to much as a WR with that speed."
Madden,3dt3ly,switchn,6,Sun Jul 19 06:39:43 2015 UTC,You can change WR to TE can't you?
Madden,3dt3ly,gabers24,5,Sun Jul 19 12:32:53 2015 UTC,yes  EDIT: pretty sure they lose 10 spd and 10 acc
Madden,3dt3ly,mpg1846,3,Sun Jul 19 12:58:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry, as the guy below said it's possible but there are penalties, that in my opinion, are too heavy. They should make it so your speed stats are only reduced if they are 90+ or something, because my 70 speed guy ending up with 60 speed and acc would simply be ridiculous. His other stats aren't even close to being good enough to warrant that."
Madden,3dt3ly,switchn,2,Sun Jul 19 13:09:08 2015 UTC,"Had a prospect WR turned emergency QB for his team in college. He was going to be the next Vick with good mobility and a decent arm. He declared as a WR for draft and wasted all the potential. He could throw the ball, but couldn't catch it for crap."
Madden,3dt3ly,6982344,2,Sun Jul 19 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"I remember a storyline where there were two twin brothers who where dominant corners. Pretty much all I need was CBs on my team. I scouted both, they were 84 and 79 overall both with SS development. One was projected 9th overall and the other was 25th. I had pick 5 and pick 20. I traded up to have pick 5 and 12 just to make sure I could get both. Right before the draft one changed positions to safety. He dropped to a 65 overall though I didn't scout his speed or awareness so I don't know how those were affected. It was such a tease."
Madden,3dt3ly,McNuffin,3,Sun Jul 19 17:31:00 2015 UTC,You can convert safety back to corner with no (or minimal) penalty though.
Madden,3dt3ly,switchn,3,Mon Jul 20 01:07:44 2015 UTC,"Drafted a 25 OVR safety in the second round. I didn't realize I could switch him to WR until the year after, at which point he was a 66 and his career was fucked. Got one good season out of him as kick returner, thankfully."
Madden,3dt3ly,iamnotacola,9,Sun Jul 19 15:29:16 2015 UTC,"I simmed the season so I don't know if he had a story or something. With 80 impact blocking, 71 pass blocking, 91 run blocking, and ""Vertical Offense"" scheme, though, I assume he was an OL turned into a DE."
Madden,3dt3ly,alexFlopez,6,Sun Jul 19 04:58:27 2015 UTC,Maybe try converting him back to OL then? Clearly you're not going to get any good production out of him with that OVR
Madden,3dt3ly,Moruitelda,10,Sun Jul 19 05:33:49 2015 UTC,Maybe try converting him back to OL then?   Game won't let you.
Madden,3dt3ly,theBrineySeaMan,13,Sun Jul 19 05:41:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe try converting him back to OL then?   Game won't let you.   The most Bullshit part. I want to be able to move anyone anywhere, and play anyone anywhere. Megatron plays both ways, Why not Madden?"
Madden,3dt3ly,Moruitelda,6,Sun Jul 19 06:17:58 2015 UTC,"Megatron plays both ways   I mean, yeah, guys like Megatron and A.J. Green play defense on Hail Mary defense, but they don't really ""play both ways.""   With that said, I don't understand the reasoning between not just listing an acceptable breakdown of positions for each player (i.e. a 6'3"", 300 pound guy can play DE, DT, OT, G, C) rather than just giving groups that you can switch between."
Madden,3dt3ly,mgmfa,7,Sun Jul 19 13:45:52 2015 UTC,"This is probably one of the few subreddits this is absolutely unneeded, given that in madden measurements are in lbs"
Madden,3dt3ly,WhyYesImCaucasian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"I think you can. The screen folloring the draft that let's you look at signed players you can go to roster management and edit a player on defense to corner and accept the change, then edit him again and move him to half back and accept again, then edit again to change to o-line"
Madden,3dt3ly,hyperbolical,6,Sun Jul 19 15:50:10 2015 UTC,"You can't get from defensive front seven to secondary, and you can't get from half back to O-line."
Madden,3dt3ly,switchn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:15:34 2015 UTC,"I think he is trying to say on the screen following the draft you are able to, and that's the only time you are able to do this. Not sure if he's correct, though."
Madden,3dt3ly,Moruitelda,5,Sun Jul 19 10:34:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure if he's correct, though.   Unfortunately, he's not."
Madden,3dt3ly,Moruitelda,5,Sun Jul 19 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"I think you can.   You can't. There are four position groups that you cannot move players between:   QB, HB, FB, TE, WR, CB, FS, SS OLB, MLB, DE, DT OT, G, C K, P"
Madden,3dt3ly,alexFlopez,0,Sun Jul 19 13:48:17 2015 UTC,"If you choose edit player, it lets you move their position around"

Madden,3dt3ly,SwissyVictory,3,Sun Jul 19 14:43:21 2015 UTC,"This happens from time to time.  He should have star dev as well.  He is a story line player, who converted from Oline to Dline for the draft.  He is probably not worth developing, and I don't think you can convert them back."
Madden,3dt3ly,Moruitelda,2,Mon Jul 20 01:16:25 2015 UTC,"He is probably not worth developing, and I don't think you can convert them back.   Bingo."
Madden,3dt3ly,FollowDasFUhrer,2,Sun Jul 19 05:38:07 2015 UTC,"I once drafted an 11 overall DT. He had A strength and B Acceleration & Agility. Turns out he also had F block shedding, tackling and pass rush moves.  The real bummer was he had good blocking traits, but it wouldn't let me convert him to oline, only other defensive line positions..."
Madden,3dw50p,CTSawxfan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:58:37 2015 UTC,It is a known issue. This happens when you log in and play a solo immediately. To get around it play a H2H game first. If you don't want to do that back out of ultimate team and go to practice mode. Play 2 snaps and you get the EA logo and then you are good to play any solos without the Panthers/Seahawks intro that eats up contracts. Good luck and I hope this helps!
Madden,3dxdzv,SmackMymelons,10,Mon Jul 20 09:16:18 2015 UTC,A lot of us do buy it every year because we can't help ourselves.  We do feel used and abused by EA through.  We also love NFL Football.  EA does not do enough to the game year to year and does not do a good job listening to fans on what they want in the game.  If their licence ever expires and competition is allowed it will be a whole new ball game... literally.
Madden,3dxdzv,shrike3000,3,Mon Jul 20 12:21:54 2015 UTC,"The Madden cycle is something like:   Great Madden game. Last year's game with new gimmick to exploit. Lazy rehash with new gimmick and less features than before. Rehash touting new graphics or tackling engine, more features removed. Great Madden game.   I thought 15 was the best improvement in years so I honestly don't expect another major upgrade for like 3 years. 2004 to 2005 is the last time I can remember that Madden was really good back-to-back. I haven't played FIFA in a bit but I feel like at worst you get a lazy rehash with better graphics and Madden fans are used to the game taking steps backwards.  Bring back user celebrations, dammit."
Madden,3dxdzv,MechaZain,4,Mon Jul 20 17:57:51 2015 UTC,"The removing of features is the thing that just blows my mind. I mean this is a game that was touting the fact that players had dreadlocks a couple years ago. Dreadlocks were on the old games, they never should have been removed. I feel like they just yank features outta the games so they can come back a couple years later and say ""NEW FEATURE: PLAYERS NOW WEAR CLEATS!"" I don't know. To answer the OP's question, I really haven't been a fan of Madden for quite a long time, but I just buy it because there's literally no other choice."
Madden,3dxdzv,_LilSebastian_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:30:44 2015 UTC,"2004-2007 on PS2 was great, but by that time they'd maxed out what the machine could do so it wasn't really impressive."
Madden,3dxdzv,KiDeVerclear,4,Tue Jul 21 01:31:40 2015 UTC,"Madden users are generally less happy with the game than Fifa users. The community often feels little changes year to year (and rightfully so) and so they ask others if they think it's worth upgrading.  As a general rule, I'd buy the new Madden every second year unless there is a major update."
Madden,3dxdzv,switchn,3,Mon Jul 20 09:31:46 2015 UTC,I would say its harder to be more upset with EA than FIFA users especially with what they did to FUT this year. Also there has been no career mode updates in about 5 years and they have removed features that were a staple on old FIFA's
Madden,3dxdzv,word2k,3,Mon Jul 20 10:10:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like removed features should now be a part of every game review.  It seems like for every new feature that gets added, 3 get removed."
Madden,3dxdzv,danhatab,3,Mon Jul 20 11:05:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just bought F1 2015 and there is no split screen mode or online seasons. No were online said this before release and if I had known I wouldn't have bought"
Madden,3dxdzv,BatmanDavey1986,2,Mon Jul 20 11:57:03 2015 UTC,"Just like fifa, madden doesn't really get improved too much yearly. And most of the community here knows this and bashes on them (including myself). But I've been playing these games since almost the beginning, not everyone has, and not everyone has played more then one or two maddens or fifa. They don't know it's the same game every year even with the ""new features"". That's why some people ask, cause they really don't know, they read the game getting bashed on all the time but for new gamers in the franchise they may have enjoyed the game but not sure whether or not to get the next one since there is always negativity. I usually try to explain to the people who ask these questions cause if they gotta ask then they clearly don't know how EA puts out the same game each year."
Madden,3dxdzv,walterpinkman45,2,Mon Jul 20 13:06:44 2015 UTC,Madden isn't half the game Fifa is. However it's the only game in town. Fucking sucks.

Madden,3dqfku,waterbuffalo750,-1,Sat Jul 18 19:31:57 2015 UTC,The gameplay from 15 and 25 is pretty awful though.

Madden,3dpppg,WeathermanKumke,9,Sat Jul 18 06:27:27 2015 UTC,"No, I always rush at least 3. The only time I have linemen in coverage is if its a zone blitz and someone else is rushing."
Madden,3dpppg,SGOTheNatural,9,Sat Jul 18 07:35:54 2015 UTC,"Always rush 3, I prefer to stick to sim-style play even if my opponent cheeses it up"
Madden,3dpppg,anotherred,5,Sat Jul 18 07:52:15 2015 UTC,A lot of leagues make you rush 3 guys minimum.  And Contain isn't a rush.  So in most leagues you would have to bring heat from LB or DB if you dropped the DL back.  It's essentially a zone blitz in result.  But I do like to drop linemen back for sure.
Madden,3dpppg,TheHeisenbergger,2,Sat Jul 18 06:42:12 2015 UTC,Why do leagues make you rush 3+?
Madden,3dpppg,switchn,7,Sat Jul 18 07:39:20 2015 UTC,Probably sim leagues.
Madden,3dpppg,tipacow,5,Sat Jul 18 08:07:30 2015 UTC,Sim leagues usually do.  A Sim league is just another way of saying no cheesers.  It's to keep the game as close to real life as you can.  For instance:  No going for it on 4th down.  Exceptions exist though like if it's 4th and 1 from beyond the 50 you can go for it.  No onside kicks unless down with under two minutes to go.   No exploit plays.  The QB Wrap is one that sticks out.
Madden,3dpppg,TheHeisenbergger,-18,Sat Jul 18 17:23:23 2015 UTC,Thats also an nfl rule to have at least 3 pass rushers i believe
Madden,3dpppg,Ryanv1601,13,Sat Jul 18 12:13:14 2015 UTC,It's not.
Madden,3dpppg,gtcgabe,4,Sat Jul 18 13:39:10 2015 UTC,Ill drop a lineman in coverage when I want to bring in someone else to blitz
Madden,3dpppg,tehcw,4,Sat Jul 18 09:45:06 2015 UTC,"When I'm feeling tricky, I'll drop my two DT'S into hooks and user the MLB right behind them in his own hook. Makes this little triangle in the middle of the field and discourages my friends from passing across the middle."
Madden,3dpppg,SawzeBawse,2,Sat Jul 18 11:33:37 2015 UTC,I played in a lot of online franchises. I threw a pick six to a DE this week cause they dropped him into coverage. He baited me out by pulling his cb into deep coverage. Completely did not expect it. Linemen are not good in coverage compared to LB but if you run a play that catches the opponent off guard it can definitely work.
Madden,3dpppg,Misterymoon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:45:20 2015 UTC,"I like to use 3-4 zone blitz defenses and quite a few plays have dt's, de's, or olb's dropping into coverage and having another player like a db or mlb blitz instead."
Madden,3dpppg,thejamaicaterror,0,Sun Jul 19 22:16:38 2015 UTC,"Nope, I think it's cheese to rush less than 3"

Madden,3dmzak,JahstenC,3,Sat Jul 18 04:35:15 2015 UTC,I just meant it as a joke since the deal we gave him is for way less money than the madden contract you posted.
Madden,3dmzak,blackgallagher1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:40:21 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Bradford is going to put up ridiculous numbers in Kelly's system.  I mean I liked Foles a lot but his college tape wasn't anything special and when you watch him in game he has glaring holes.  Bradford on the other hand was a stud in college and has been really good when he hasn't been injured imho

Madden,3dndsu,WeDemHawks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"Well they fixed the throwing. You can now purposefully over throw a guy. You physically couldn't in 15 unless you really messed with the sliders. Those guys are on PRO on every video, throwing high body throws to OBJ who can make those catches.   On all madden it probably won't work that consistently. Hell on pro, it will only work maybe 50% of the time.   Add in that good sliders will be out within a week of release and the game's gonna be pretty balanced. Especially if they tweak the pass reaction slider"
Madden,3dndsu,tipacow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:43:23 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, I'm sick of having to fix the game for EA, we shouldn't have to me sliders just to get the game more realistic. It should come tweaked to where it already is realistic. Plus I play h2h and mut too."
Madden,3dndsu,WeDemHawks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:32:43 2015 UTC,"Well they have to appeal to a base that wants a more Arcady experience.

Madden,3dkb44,switchn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:19:52 2015 UTC,THIS! Whenever I give out a huge contract to a WR they always get injured. It's ironic because all those plebs from the FA rejects never miss a down. I had the same problem as you with Julio Jones.
Madden,3dkb44,headrush46n2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:45:04 2015 UTC,"Similarly, I just picked up a 28 year old 88-OVR QB for like 25mil a year because mine was like 32 and only had 88-THP. Second game of the season he tears his rotator cuff and is out for the season.  ...or so I thought. I checked after the game and he wasn't on the injury list. Checked my depth chart, and he isn't even injured. I know there is a bug that if you only have 2 QBs on your roster, that this type of thing happens, but I had three. I suspect the game was glitched as my defense never got rested between drives, timeouts, or half time."
Madden,3dkb44,Gkredd2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:39:03 2015 UTC,Not really the same thing but my rookie 2nd overall pick qb got injured half way through the season and my backup was terrible. There wasn't really anybody I liked in free agency or on the trade block. I ended up trading a 4th and a 5th for Colt McCoy in an attempt to keep my playoff hopes alive. Ended up throwing 10 int's 0 td's with him for the remainder of the season. I usually average about 2:1 td to int ratio or slightly better.  Though the next season he made up for it in the playoffs when my QB got concusses he was clutch as fuck and won me the game.

Madden,3dii31,get_trashed,3,Thu Jul 16 17:21:33 2015 UTC,Don't waste your money. Play the 2014 version first (which is free) and see if its worth it. I linked it down in the thread.

Madden,3dii31,jktmstokes1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:20:09 2015 UTC,I am loving it too. Good game and I'm glad to support the release if that means they release another one down the line that's even better.  Plus I just hope the pc community shows football is viable on the pc.

Madden,3dimb3,Tjacks12,4,Thu Jul 16 15:56:44 2015 UTC,"You're lucky you didn't play the previous iterations if you were tired of the 99 ovr players at the end of the season. This season was relatively tame with the 99's until the end. I was alright with the scaling, but hopefully they'll do a better job with 16."
Madden,3dimb3,Walkerg2011,3,Thu Jul 16 16:06:08 2015 UTC,Remember M13's MUT and how many goddamn 99ovr players there were? I was able to make an entire team of 99 overall guys.
Madden,3dimb3,Twistify804,2,Thu Jul 16 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"I played some of the older ones and it was relatively easy to get 99 teams.  This game frustrated me that they would have like 5 Bo Jackson's and keep calling them all 99, but give them stats in the 100's. You grind the game get a Bo and then boom, new one is out and you  lose 500K coins...   And the way some of the sets went was a joke. You might have to give up 40 cards to get something that will be 300k in a week.  I was overall satisfied, but the mode died quick for me.  Any updates on MUT 16 yet?  Edit: When bundles came out that gave collectibles that made my Vick (who i grinded hard for) drop from 1.7 million to 900K, I was just like, wow... 100% pay to win."
Madden,3dimb3,Walkerg2011,2,Thu Jul 16 16:09:18 2015 UTC,"Yeahhh, it's always best to wait when those new things come out, as they drop quickly.

I just keep checking back here. lol"

New comers can pick from any of these teams to play with us thru rest of madden 15. However, for Madden 16, we reward our long time owners who stuck around all season ( as this was something our owners voted for ) first. They get to either keep their current teams, or throw their current teams in the ""open team pool"" . Then there are two ""rounds"" of a draft for picking teams.All those who stuck around all year long, get in 1st round and pick from open teams.Then in the second round, any new comers since may, and those who left and are coming back, will be placed in the 2nd round . We use a random draft order generator to set up the order each person gets to pick in the round they are in.It is a ""draft style"" pick of what team you get for madden 16.   We do this as a means to reward our owners who stick around all year. As they deserve first dibs on open teams."

Madden,3dha17,Lucky_Tyro,3,Thu Jul 16 07:02:16 2015 UTC,Don't pre-order the game. Buy it once it's been out for a couple days and we know the game is in good condition and there isn't some game breaking bug. (See Arkham Knight release on PC)  This is advice that I give out no matter what game but especially if you're going to buy it digitally. There is literally no reason to pre-order if you are buying digitally unless you're dying to get that pre-order bonus.
Madden,3dha17,zooropa93,2,Thu Jul 16 10:43:33 2015 UTC,I'll be pre ordering for the benefit of pre loading the game so I can play as soon as it unlocks. And I can also play the EA Access trial to make sure the game works!

The only problem is passing interference because, as you know I don't have any arms, I don't have anything to stop me from falling on to the ground. So sometimes people guarding me just push me to the ground to make sure I can't catch it."

Madden,3d9gnh,danhatab,8,Tue Jul 14 18:31:35 2015 UTC,Why I hate playing online. You not only get an accelerated clock but everyone goes for it on 4th down. This is one thing I'd wish they fix by implementing something so ppl don't always go for it. An easy fix is to make the offense more realistic where it's actuslly harder to gain yards on offense
Madden,3d9gnh,The_Chrononaut,2,Tue Jul 14 16:43:15 2015 UTC,Ya know if they ever actually fix the blocking assignments and running physics (getting caught up on the line because of minimal contact) offense would be so fucking unstoppable.
Madden,3d9gnh,danhatab,8,Tue Jul 14 20:08:30 2015 UTC,Unless they fix the defensive blocking as well. Guys getting warped into blocks when they clearly have the offense guy beat.

Madden,3d9gnh,platocplx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:54:41 2015 UTC,I know exactly what you mean. I'll slack throughout games while doing other shit against people I know Im safe to go down by a few tds.
Madden,3d9gnh,waterbuffalo750,0,Tue Jul 14 22:41:02 2015 UTC,Yep. I had a crazy comeback here beacuse they were a jackass.
Madden,3d9gnh,BlackoutMurray,7,Wed Jul 15 00:06:20 2015 UTC,This is why I very seldom play online.
Madden,3d9gnh,TheBeardedMarxist,8,Tue Jul 14 15:35:41 2015 UTC,There are few places to go for a game where a strategy or scheme are actually used.
Madden,3d9gnh,waterbuffalo750,2,Tue Jul 14 15:48:26 2015 UTC,Why? Because it's just too easy to win when people play like that? I get that. I still enjoy punishing people for being stupid. If somebody beating you by going for it on 4th.... that's on you.
Madden,3d9gnh,cyberst0rm,3,Tue Jul 14 17:11:08 2015 UTC,"The way they play, it's not even football as we know it any more. I find single player to be more fun, or playing against people I know."
Madden,3d9gnh,TheBeardedMarxist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"Eh, there's too many  bugs online to pretend this is the primary issue.  How bout fix the random timing and lag? Or how even play selection lags for no logical reason.  Im surprised anyone puts up with how shoddy the online play is before you factor in shitty player strats."
Madden,3d9gnh,Philliefan12,0,Wed Jul 15 03:52:35 2015 UTC,Well it was the start of the 2nd qtr it was on me. I wasn't really paying attention and trying to do something else while playing during the first quarter. He was only up by a possession and after he failed on 4th and 9 he rage quit. That's what made it infuriating to me.
Madden,3d9gnh,TheBeardedMarxist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:48:11 2015 UTC,Sounds like a quick win.
Madden,3d9gnh,Philliefan12,3,Tue Jul 14 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"But anyone that is still playing madden this late in the year isn't going to be caring about a ""quick win"".

Madden,3da2n8,mastererrl,-10,Wed Jul 15 14:46:05 2015 UTC,Yes they will. The first thing JPP and Wilson did after their injuries was go to Madden's studios and get a body scan done so they will be accurate in game. /s  Why the fuck are people this goddamn stupid

Madden,3d904b,ancienthunter,2,Tue Jul 14 13:08:17 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you are asking for. I would like to help but could you give a bit more detail. Are you looking for a guide? Suggestions vs specific formations? What do you mean you are doing the pre snap stuff right?  It sounds like you are looking for a one size fits all play/cheese/glitch.
Madden,3d904b,BlackoutMurray,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:53:19 2015 UTC,"Specifically?  A defensive guide that works on the 360, I suppose a 1 fits all size play would be nice but I doubt one exist.  I'm mainly looking for some 3-4 / 3-3-5 blitzes that are fun to execute but can actually work. As I said I tried a few a looked up on youtube but no matter how I played the offense I could not get the blitzes to work effectively."
Madden,3d904b,BlackoutMurray,3,Tue Jul 14 16:00:55 2015 UTC,I can give you the playbook (jets - 80% of the blitzes work) but your success depends on two factors you control. 1) knowing what blitz to use against what formation and 2) identifying the weak link on the CPU or opponent OL and adjusting pre snap to send the blitz there.
Madden,3d904b,BlackoutMurray,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:10:42 2015 UTC,"Gotcha,   again I havent played in over a year (not at all with 15) so im just getting back into the swing of things. Any blitzes in that playbook you enjoy more than others, and any general tips with using those blitzes?"
Madden,3d904b,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jul 14 16:13:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I enjoy a weak side olb blitz vs play action.   Or nickel string cb blitz vs a 5 step drop

Madden,3d9sm6,Angelispro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:08:43 2015 UTC,10 min is fine with accelerated clock. If it's sim then it's ok for players to get tired that tends to happen IRL too

Madden,3d62ji,Angelispro,2,Tue Jul 14 12:45:41 2015 UTC,The free agents they got...
Madden,3d62ji,StraightToYourDome,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:23:11 2015 UTC,"Important pickups: Stud LB and Stud CB  Every other pickup is pretty much a wash. Except QB, which is a loss (in madden terms) since you can't rate a QB who has been on his ass for two years higher than NF with a sane mind.  Accounting for the bad play last year, everyone else will be a 3-5 overall drop in points, which having a couple studs come in won't make up for.  Shady vs Murray is pretty much a wash, but DM will probably come in a point or two above shady."
Madden,3d62ji,StraightToYourDome,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:25:27 2015 UTC,"Also, by ""bad play"" I don't mean a horrible record. I mean losing by 33 to GB (remember, Atlanta lost by only 6 a few weeks later) and the Skins in week 16."
Madden,3d62ji,Angelispro,0,Tue Jul 14 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"1: Eagles recruited 2 stud madden backs. Making them have 3 studs in the backfield.  2: Who cares about the falcons? Kinda serious about that. It is impossible to compare team to team, on how they dealt with another team.. Records matter more. 3:Eagles are good."
Madden,3d62ji,StraightToYourDome,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:50:54 2015 UTC,"Having more than one stud HB does you absolutely no good in modern madden.  It sucks to say this, but a stud WR3 or WR4 is better than a stud HB2, at least in Madden 15.  Back in the day that they had split back formations in most play books, OMG Madden 04. THOSE were the days that that would kill it."
Madden,3d5z7x,modrewgnu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:04:41 2015 UTC,Falcons have interesting key pieces on both sides of the ball. Any idea what Tevin Coleman's stats will look like. I think he could be the key to the offense.
Madden,3d5z7x,greatnessdc,0,Mon Jul 13 20:30:28 2015 UTC,I posted over in /r/Falcons on this.  Beasley will probably be overrated at 87 and Hardy will be underrated at 69.  I bet you there is a small chance Coleman is 2nd in rating to TG3 or 3rd (among rooks). Probably 76-82 range.
Madden,3d5z7x,StraightToYourDome,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:35:15 2015 UTC,what do you think his speed will look like?   do you really think beasley will be that high?
Madden,3d5z7x,greatnessdc,0,Mon Jul 13 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"(VB first) I really do. I think he will rate out in the top 5 of the incoming rookies, at the very least. His speed will be insane for a LB.  As for TC, I expect his spin/juke moves and elusiveness to be pretty good. His speed will probably be somewhere in the high 80's and maybe (just maybe) crack the 90's.  That being said... Madden has really screwed up the ratings of rookie RBs in the past. I don't expect that to end any time soon. I put my money on him being underrated and being a couple points lower than Freeman. Like a 78 and 80 kind of deal, which IMHO is BS. I would hope for a 82 overall for Coleman and a 78-80 for Freeman. But we will see."
Madden,3d5z7x,StraightToYourDome,2,Mon Jul 13 20:43:55 2015 UTC,I just feel like 87 is way to high for a rookie. I was thinking more around 82 for beasley.  His physical attributes should be through the roof

Madden,3d5eml,RAVENS17d,5,Mon Jul 13 17:41:24 2015 UTC,Dat wide-9 doe.   I don't know what it is about that package. It just KILLS it every play.
Madden,3d5eml,StraightToYourDome,3,Mon Jul 13 20:37:50 2015 UTC,I take my time in scoring. So I always get a little bit shell shocked when I'm in a situation where I must score very quickly.
Madden,3d5eml,LalienX,2,Mon Jul 13 20:56:21 2015 UTC,All my MUT games end like 7-3 lol I feel you.
Madden,3d5eml,WeDemHawks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:18:01 2015 UTC,Sometimes I can feel the frustration of my opponent when I rack up 15+ play drives on the regular.  I don't have a good set of big play players but everything just works in my system. I'll take a deep ball once in a while. But I like my balance.
Madden,3d5eml,LalienX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:28:31 2015 UTC,"I love it! Because when you do a long ass drive with 15+ plays and like 5 3rd down conversions, your opponent comes out on his drive and tries to force stuff, leading to a turnover. It's just so much more fun, plus if you do long drives it'll lead to more opportunities to go on game winning drives since the end score is always like 14-3 or something."
Madden,3d5eml,WeDemHawks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:23:37 2015 UTC,I'm definitely the opposite. I go for the long passes and frequently make mistakes when I'm in the red zone or I need to convert on 3rd down.

Madden,3d4jtn,rebelrowzer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:47:06 2015 UTC,"I run that play if they are passing and are inside the 10 -- the endzone becomes a de-facto defender for me! But otherwise, I wouldn't run it ever. But something like a 2 and goal from the 9 it works well for me."
Madden,3d4jtn,mcorcoran3,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:31:49 2015 UTC,Interesting? On all-madden? What's your speed threshold?
Madden,3d4jtn,BlackoutMurray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:08:28 2015 UTC,"All-pro, I think the speed threshold is at 38? That wouldn't matter though, my guy is WIDE fucking open, nobody within 20 yards.   Whenever I do play on all-madden, they never call that blitz, ever."
Madden,3d4jtn,drain_patience,4,Mon Jul 13 14:11:46 2015 UTC,"The play only works in a passing situation if you have great corners all across the field to play man coverage and beat their receiver one on one.  Man coverage is pretty crippled this madden, so it isn't a very good playcall unless it's a very big surprise.  Worked better last year."
Madden,3d4jtn,drain_patience,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:29:36 2015 UTC,"Well every team runs it, and they do it at least once a game, I think it's broken, but I don't see teams in real life using a double safety blitz? seems quite risky."
Madden,3d4jtn,drain_patience,4,Mon Jul 13 14:30:29 2015 UTC,"It is quite risky. It's a legit play, but only guys like Rex Ryan or other blitz happy coordinators would run it.   If you don't get pressure, you're dead. In real life or madden.  But it did work better last year because man coverage was the best coverage last year, so if you got pressure, you had a good chance to make a play.  But I don't play all pro for reasons such as this."
Madden,3d4jtn,Crathsor,2,Mon Jul 13 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"I don't play on all madden because it's actually too hard for me, no matter what slider I use, I was returning a kick with D'Anthony Thomas and Pat MaCafee chased me down and tackled me, not possible."
Madden,3d4jtn,lucentcb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:35:39 2015 UTC,It is if he is tired. There's a circular bar that tracks sprint stamina.  Bet you fifty bucks Thomas was out of sprint stamina.
Madden,3d4jtn,Crathsor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:47:09 2015 UTC,...I broke contain at my own 30.
Madden,3d4jtn,BlackoutMurray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:49:17 2015 UTC,"I play on AM and regularly have Cordarrelle Patterson run down from behind by linebackers, and my defensive backs are commonly chased down by the QB when returning interceptions.  It's definitely a thing that happens regardless of sliders (have tried 50 and 0.)  And there is no sprint button this year; it's an acceleration boost.  Once you're at top speed, that button isn't doing anything."
Madden,3d4j91,willfoxylove,2,Mon Jul 13 13:41:52 2015 UTC,"Custom Playbooks aren't an issue, the players who are in the league are the ones who you should have an issue with."
Madden,3d4j91,Angelispro,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"Nothing works every time. I run a custom playbook and have lost, and quite a few weren't flukey losses.  I've never run into anything I couldn't stop(eventually) and every single play in madden works, if done at the right time. Most people run the same type of shit, so therefore it follows the same type of shit beats a lot of people."
Madden,3d4j91,drain_patience,3,Mon Jul 13 14:27:34 2015 UTC,"Nothing works every time but there are some plays that work too well against a wide variety of defenses, so if you aren't shutting those plays down specifically, they are game-winners.  01Trap is an example of this.  If you don't run plays that shut that play down, it will gain 4-5 yards all day long and you will only win if they decide not to call it a lot.  Run plays that will stop 01Trap, you're stuck with a small subset of all plays, so your choices are to get beat or lose most of your defensive playbook.  It's not automatic but it is overpowered, in the sense that this is true regardless of difficulty setting or personnel; if you needed the Cowboys line and DeMarco Murray to pull it off, or it only worked on Pro, that would be one thing, but you can do it with a bunch of 75 OVR players on AM, too."
Madden,3d4j91,Crathsor,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:46:43 2015 UTC,"But this play is recognizeable, and from what I've seen, almost every ""overpowered"" play is in a playcalling subset which limits the offense's other options.  PA HB swing screen is a perfect example. Once you recognize that formation, that is what you HAVE to stop. No other play out of that set will destroy you as badly, and stopping the runs and short passes out of that are much easier. But if know that set, you know the down field passing in that set sucks ass. So you accommodate your defense to the set. If anything, this argues for custom playbooks because you can audible to a preset playcall you have to stop overdone plays.  Every single offensive play limits your defensive playbook. Every single one. They work against most defensive plays. It's just when you pick a play that can only be stopped by cover 3, it's not viewed as overpowered because fucking everyone uses cover 3. Run a play that can only be stopped using a man press blitz with single coverage everywhere, and you will frustrate your opponent until they begin to acclimate and start knowing when to pick the defenses they normally shun.  If your offense is built around a junk play people call cheese, you're gonna get crushed by people who don't limit themselves to only defenses that work against ""most shit""."
Madden,3d4j91,drain_patience,2,Mon Jul 13 14:54:38 2015 UTC,"The 01Trap can be run from multiple formations:  different 2 TE sets, some Pro/I sets, I think there's even a Pistol version.  You can't see it automatically.  You can guess, but if you guess wrong you're probably in trouble, because the only ways to reliably stop it are to stop your DE's initial rush or to crowd the middle of the line to replace him once he gets erased (and he will get erased; the problem with the play is that the trap works to perfection 90% of the time, even on players with reasonably high AWR/PRC/BSH.)  That (obviously) leaves you vulnerable to lots of stuff.  Yes, you will beat the pants off an 8-year-old who literally spams 01Trap all day.  Sure.  But against a competent cheesy player who calls a bunch of 01Trap plays a game with some play action, z spot, and 4 verts thrown in out of the same formation, the game is reduced to Tecmo Super Bowl:  guess right and crush him, or get some variation of burned."

Madden,3d2lnp,thekingswitness,6,Mon Jul 13 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"It's Easy. Just use Gun Trey open Offset and Use Inside Zone, Counter, and Wide Trap. Just read how the front seven lines up and then boom."
Madden,3d2lnp,Casedogg311,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:05:38 2015 UTC,That with that PA to the slot receiver across he the middle is killer
Madden,3d2lnp,Casedogg311,0,Mon Jul 13 01:07:53 2015 UTC,Oh yes. Especially rolling with those 4 plays in your audibles. And then go to Gun Trio Offset for a Trap play.
Madden,3d2lnp,LiquidFrost,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:37:04 2015 UTC,Haha sounds like we run the same playbook. Those plays with the Lions are great. Two good running backs and move CJ to the slot for that PA play. I can play with my eyes closed haha
Madden,3d2lnp,LiquidFrost,2,Mon Jul 13 01:58:31 2015 UTC,What playbook are we talking about guys.
Madden,3d2lnp,medfly03,3,Mon Jul 13 07:26:21 2015 UTC,"Oh I just randomly added plays to the Chiefs playbook and reshuffled the offensive style. Got rid of a few formations I would never use and just went straight for what works best with my style.   As far as the front 7. Key would be on DE and DT/NT positions. If the Linebacker on the left is outside of the tackle/TE, then Inside zone would be great. If it's just straight man coverage, Counter or Wide trap will be your friend. Just learn to read how they line up and what type of defensive format they run. Beating that is key"
Madden,3d2lnp,Casedogg311,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:43:44 2015 UTC,Thanks! lots of good info  Do the playbooks save for H2H?
Madden,3d2lnp,ancienthunter,2,Wed Jul 15 02:48:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. Once you enter an online game with a custom playbook, picking a team and going to advanced settings should automatically have it as your last playbook used. If it isn't, then select the proper playbook and it will save that playbook for your usage until you turn off the game or play with another playbook in another game mode (Mut, exhibition, CFM ect)"

Madden,3d17c5,CanadaQB5,10,Sun Jul 12 17:54:09 2015 UTC,"I think this perspective paints people a little too much as mindless drones who simply can't resist buying packs/bundles/etc. As far as kids buying packs with their parents' money, it's really up to the parents to monitor how much their children are spending. And for adults spending money, I completely agree that way too many people spend ridiculous amounts on MUT. I spent $20 and that was $20 too much tbh. With that being said, you're not just buying the cards but also the increased satisfaction from playing with them in game.   Gambling has been a problem for hundreds of years, but I agree EA takes advantage of people's tendencies to want the newest and best players. EA is also a company so profit is the bottom line. This video is a good PSA to make people think about how much they're really willing to spend on MUT, but saying we should stop playing MUT altogether is too extreme."
Madden,3d17c5,blaine64,4,Sun Jul 12 18:20:02 2015 UTC,"I think this perspective paints people a little too much as mindless drones who simply can't resist buying packs/bundles/etc.   Games like MUT and other microtransaction model games are specifically designed in consultation with psychologists to be as addictive as possible. The reason it paints them that way is that it's set up to draw you in, give you enjoyment, and then draw the money out of you by using psychological pleasure triggers to draw money out of you a little bit at a time.   It's the same as slots. It's the same as Farmville. It's intentionally made to be as addictive as possible, and the psychologists who have been developing these techniques over the past couple of decades have gotten very, very good at their jobs.    EA takes advantage   And that's the point he's making. EA is taking advantage of natural psychological flaws inherent in the human psyche, and it's absolutely despicable. Don't make excuses for them by saying it's their jobs to make money and people should be more responsible.  People won't be more responsible. Many of them can't be. Because we're electrochemical computers, not Randian supermen."
Madden,3d17c5,Moruitelda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you're saying, but let's acknowledge that the entire consumer market takes advantage of natural psychological flaws inherent in the human psyche; it's not at all isolated to MUT or micro-transactions.    People won't be more responsible. Many of them can't be.   This is the vibe I got from the video and I can't agree with this. I think many players can definitely be more responsible with how much they're spending; saying otherwise is just an attempt to use EA as a scapegoat. This video does a good job in pushing players toward the responsible side of the spectrum."
Madden,3d17c5,blaine64,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"You think that because you seem to like to think that we have more ability to control our psychological impulses than we do. What you're saying is basically the equivalent of saying, ""Why is it so hard to quit smoking? All you have to do is not do it.""   That's great, but it acts like it's simply a voluntary act."

I'm pretty sure MUT addicts don't go through physiological withdrawal the way smokers do.  Link me some PubMed if I'm wrong."
Madden,3d17c5,FeroxCarnivore,2,Sun Jul 12 23:35:44 2015 UTC,"It's a physiological process that leads to gambling, gaming, and communication addictions, even though the level of withdrawal is much less. With that said, depression symptoms are a common experience for most people recovering from those addictions, and it's typically considered a sign of withdrawal."
Madden,3d17c5,Moruitelda,2,Mon Jul 13 00:48:48 2015 UTC,"You're dead right, and I agree with you.  My point is that willpower is a finite resource, and it's generally much harder to deal with physiological withdrawal symptoms at the same time as you're breaking a psychological addiction; for example, smokers who break the ""smoke a cigarette when you get stressed"" habit with a patch while they replace tobacco with NRT.  I'm not saying gambling (and &c.) addictions ""aren't real"" or don't suck; I'm just bitching that they're not on the same physiological spectrum as stuff like nicotine habituation."
Madden,3d17c5,FeroxCarnivore,4,Mon Jul 13 03:52:53 2015 UTC,"If people hate mut then that's totally fine.  If you hate MUT then don't play it.  It's that simple.  Why do we have to make it this huge deal?  I like MUT and I also like CFM.  I've never spent money on MUT and I never will.  Sure I wish people wouldn't spend money but is it really so bad that they do?  It's their money, so they can spend it how they want."

Madden,3d17c5,NarcolepticLlama,5,Mon Jul 13 03:36:10 2015 UTC,I disagree with the points raised but agree with the end point. The reason UT is breaking Madden and Fifa is the devs are getting lazy and not innovating other modes. As a FIFA player science 98 I will talk about this as I have more experience in that and what I can gather the trend is similar in madden. Career mode has not been update sconce FIFA 10 when UT was introduced. What I gather is it is very similar with GM mode. They see how much they can make from UT and. even if they call 10000 less games a year because of not updating offline modes they make that back easily with money spent on packs. The reason UT is breaking madden is the lazy devs who release it is more profitable and not updating key offline modes.
Madden,3d17c5,SmackMymelons,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:22:23 2015 UTC,"This x1 million  It's bad because now anywhere between 60-90% of the playerbase just plays Ultimate Team, as such the devs don't really give a shit about the other modes since that's not their cash cow."
Madden,3d17c5,punchoutlanddragons,2,Tue Jul 14 07:53:13 2015 UTC,MUT is just awful.
Madden,3d17c5,Moruitelda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:19:17 2015 UTC,Spend money on mut if you want. I got a 92 ovr team in the 2 months I've played mut then got bored. Didn't spend a penny but I did have to work hard.   Other people don't have as much time or devotion. I know a guy who spends $200 on mut a month but it gives him satisfaction. Everybody has their own distinct hobbies and utility curve. This guy has a full time job and likes to spend $200 on a video game. On the flip side my other friend spent $4000 on Diablo 3 items when it first came out. And in my case I just spent $3500 on a trip to Asia. Spend money however u want to. It's your money you earned it. Now if you're a kid stealing your parents money then there is a parenting issue. EA is a for profit company. Let's stop treating them like they are evil money hungry bastards. They operate as any for profit business would.

Madden,3d1f5p,taurosmaster,2,Sun Jul 12 19:27:46 2015 UTC,"I had that issue when I started in 15. As soon as I broke away from standard man and zone coverage schemes and threw in some hybrids with blitzes, it began working a bit better."
Madden,3d1f5p,Gimaad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:35:32 2015 UTC,You talking sim stats or in games? Sim stats are too difficult for madden devs. In game's can be tweaked a bit with sliders.
Madden,3d1f5p,NarcolepticLlama,2,Sun Jul 12 19:42:10 2015 UTC,Sliders don't do anything. Unless I set cpu receiving to 0 and watch them drop a million passes. But the coverage is for shit
Madden,3d1f5p,tipacow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:12:01 2015 UTC,Look up the pass defense sliders. It makes it way more realistic.

You could be competitive good, and you would deserve props for that.  But there are two types of good. Good against humans, and good against CPU, and in CFM especially, you see the disparity. And then the super bowl winner is who is the best at both."

Vikes drafted a qb who broke every passing record in the game and took them to 4 SBs. Keenan Allen is the only WR I remember having any significant records.

Then we only player each other, so it was kinda only once every three/four years. We let the owner run everything, we just coached. So they never resigned anyone, never signed anyone. Could only rely on drafts. Whenever we played we never looked at our roster, just played. By 2040 our top players really just terrible. It was the Shit Bowl."

Madden,3cxwne,Yung_Negger,28,Sat Jul 11 19:47:44 2015 UTC,Speed and Acceleration should be hard to upgrade.  Not many players improve their speed once they get to the league and if it was cheaper people would be developing players with 99 speed too often.
Madden,3cxwne,jjw771,2,Sat Jul 11 20:12:40 2015 UTC,"True, but he can probably bring him up to 99 power moves, 99 tackle, 99 awareness, 99 block shed."
Madden,3cxwne,mcorcoran3,9,Sun Jul 12 13:59:05 2015 UTC,"Game is so broken.  Tap ""A"" and get instant separation from the OL and go in for an easy sack.  Way too many times in my Online CFM people spam this and get way too many sacks"
Madden,3cxwne,thaddeusblunt,2,Sat Jul 11 22:16:10 2015 UTC,I tweaked sliders and don't have nearly as much success getting to the passer and evening out the sack rates. Makes it much more rewarding when I do get the sack.
Madden,3cxwne,Thor_2099,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:15:19 2015 UTC,I have CPU pass blocking up to 100 and almost all my sliders down to 15 or less -- still get way too many sacks. The game is just broken.

Madden,3cxwne,Slinger17,3,Sun Jul 12 03:41:45 2015 UTC,I definitely agree. You can play on all-madden with cpu blocking on 100 and still dominate their O-line.

Madden,3cyoaw,GoFrontYourself,5,Sat Jul 11 23:50:41 2015 UTC,"Usually mid August, about a week or two before release. They usually like to release the info very slowly, first showing the top rookies and then each day the top 5 players or so at every position (all just OVR ratings) but only a couple positions a day. Then they start to release a few whole teams ratings everyday. They like to make it run a couple weeks or so.   As far as they differentiate, I'm not quite sure but one thing I do know is that this year there is a new penalty rating for the players that determines how often they commit penalties. That's one I looking forward to.  edit: poor wording"
Madden,3cyoaw,zooropa93,3,Sun Jul 12 04:27:04 2015 UTC,"The ratings typically remain about the same as the 2015 post-Super Bowl roster, with a few tweaks for game balancing or any changes in the preseason.

Madden,3czmgu,rkwittem,7,Sun Jul 12 07:43:59 2015 UTC,"I think it was a great addition. Stops people from abusing money plays, or just running the same play over and over. In the NFL, the teams often have snapshots they're showing the QB or Defense the different looks they're seeing. It improves everyone's game. I've found some great plays because of it as well.   *gets beat by a play *takes screenshot of previous play *add to custom playbook"
Madden,3czmgu,dabottom305,6,Sun Jul 12 06:23:04 2015 UTC,"They won't, it's a great addition. You should mandate streaming in your leagues if it's that important to you that both teams have it off."
Madden,3czmgu,SGOTheNatural,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:29:28 2015 UTC,"I think you guys are missing the big picture, I don't think he hates the concept of a previous play, he just wants an option in franchise mode for it to stay off if the commish turns it off."
Madden,3czmgu,rebelrowzer,0,Sun Jul 12 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks: rebelrowzer That is what I mean..... I also am just for figuring things out yourself... Besides I look at it like this. If a person can you tube and come up with a strong scheme and win, but never could play Defense now they are a better player.. The didn't get better they just know what's coming....  To be honest that's spygate.... But if it is contro;ed by the commish I can live with it. but if players can turn there's on and the commish setting is off that's clearly an unfair advantage.....

I'm thinking maybe WR or CB would be the top seed. CB would be decent enough on offense but have the advantage on coverage D  Edit: Fuck it. I'm already doing a QB team since OP hasn't posted a roster so I think I just might make one of each position team. It's probably going to take a while to get done though lol.

Madden,3ct6h0,get_trashed,2,Fri Jul 10 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"Those cards were giveaways from EA. EA used to give out one 90+ card a week to every player but then after the week ended, the card would get demoted to an 80 and they would give out a new card."
Madden,3ct6h0,The_Bearded_Juan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:23:52 2015 UTC,Then what's the point of letting the person keep the card?  I mean its not even really the same player at that point

Madden,3cu9dh,rebelrowzer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:32:04 2015 UTC,You clear up space in those trades. Plus the amount of picks especially 1st rounders have a direct effect on your cap

Madden,3cu9dh,rebelrowzer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:45:20 2015 UTC,Im just saying there is reasons why you have those players and are reasonably capped.  The trade/contract system is flawed but nowhere near as bad as before. 5 years ago it was so much worse

Madden,3ctrp8,mcdom89,2,Fri Jul 10 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"No, hit power only increases the percentage of the time a player triggers a ""big hit"". In fact, the trucking rating itself doesn't really do anything, as the trucking animation is rarely triggered (and when it is, I'm not even sure it has anything to do with the trucking attribute). The only rating that you should be concerned about with power runners is Strength."
Madden,3ctrp8,Philliefan12,4,Fri Jul 10 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"You're right, except for the fact that trucking does matter; the trucking rating is compared against the defender's tackle rating (and both players' strength ratings) in determining whether to trigger the truck animation."
Madden,3ctrp8,Moruitelda,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"This. Even though the trucking animations (insofar as actually running over defenders) are rare, strength and trucking both are compared against the defender's strength and tackle rating to determine who ""wins"" the tackle."
Madden,3ctrp8,bryan66wilson,2,Sat Jul 11 02:18:48 2015 UTC,Doesn't Hit Power matter for Defenders only? I was under the impression that it increases chance to cause fumbles and injuries when you hit a ball carrier.

Madden,3csm4t,papap0st,2,Fri Jul 10 13:10:16 2015 UTC,"Question: What keeps even a ""Sim"" league from being just about user skill rather than a realistic, football experience?  For example, if I play with the Jaguars I probably shouldn't expect to make the playoffs this year, but all these leagues I see have Bills vs. Redskins Super Bowls or something ridiculous. This is why I can't ever get into one of these leagues even though part of me wants to really badly as I think 32 users would be a ton of fun."
Madden,3csm4t,NateDogPack12,3,Fri Jul 10 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"The purpose of a ""sim"" league isn't to limit user skill as a winning factor but rather to (attempt to) regulate the type of gameplay you'll see.  Ex: no repetitive play-calling, (when applicable) limit reliance on ""money"" plays/routes, adjust sliders to keep stats & game scores realistic.  But none of that is directly designed to limit user skill as a factor.  But you hope that ""skill"" is more about playcalling, reading the opponent, pre-snap adjustments, etc than it is about abusing weaknesses in the game code."
Madden,3csm4t,rollinff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:47:13 2015 UTC,"Very good definition. I think the best part about being a ""sim"" league also is that anyone can really win. I've had people who are 2-12 beat someone who is 12-2 before. If you play smart football, then you should win.   Not to mention, everyone is always improving by playing each other. You learn the coaches in your division and if you lose the first 6 games... You can learn their play style and win the next 4 or 6.   Online leagues are the only reason I buy this game. Of you can find a good one that is managed well with a nice community it really makes the overall experience better."
Madden,3csm4t,NateDogPack12,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:58:58 2015 UTC,I think I'm going to apply when I make it home in an hour or so.

Madden,3csm4t,NateDogPack12,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:55:09 2015 UTC,There's so much more than you can see just by looking at the website too. My favorite part is telling people all of the extra stuff behind the scenes after they get in. :)
Madden,3csm4t,rollinff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:13:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. This is really why I can't get into a league like this. Yeah, surprises happen in the NFL all the time... but as a general rule we can peg 6-8 teams that will ultimately compete for a championship. In leagues like this the users overshadow their teams, so a QB like Tyrod Taylor is suddenly an All-Pro.  It's tough to create an authentic ""sim"" experience that mirrors the real NFL."
Madden,3csm4t,AdmiralLobstero,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"There are a couple leagues that sim all games.  Different meaning of the word ""sim,"" of course.  One means a playstyle and the other literally means the games are not played by users--can get confusing.  But they do exist, and this of course removes user skill as a factor and instead places a premium on player development, drafting, player acquisition, etc.  That's where year 1-2, the results should very closely mirror the NFL, but by year 3-6, your moves will have transformed your team for the better or otherwise.  I'm not actually in this or any league, so I have no horse in this race, but sounds like you may enjoy a completely simulated league.  When I did play in a well-run 32-person (sim playstyle) league for about 9 months, my favorite part by far was the stuff that happened while not actually playing the games.  Live drafting, trading, free agency, etc. with 31 other humans is really fun."

Madden,3co6id,AdmiralLobstero,24,Thu Jul 9 12:53:27 2015 UTC,"I was playing my brother probably 10 years ago. I rarely beat him, but this game I was leading by 4, with the ball and around 10 seconds left. We had a rule where we never ran out clock. So I ran one last play, a deep pass, which was caught at the 10 and I was about to score with no time left. Well I dove into the endzone at the exact time a defender dove at me. He didn't really even touch me, but I fumbled into the back of the end zone. 2 of my players ran to grab it and both dove right over. Somehow he had his fastest guy pick it up and stay in bounds. He proceeded to take it back 109 yards for a game winning TD with no time remaining. I was shocked and stunned and couldn't believe it."

Madden,3co6id,Watuhmelons,3,Thu Jul 9 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"Manziel is no joke. I drafted him in a fantasy draft and won NFL MVP, QBOY, and ROY with him. After that, I had like 50,000 points to spend. He was unstoppable already, but after that he was a god."
Madden,3co6id,Johopo,7,Fri Jul 10 13:16:22 2015 UTC,Eli Manning got hurt
Madden,3co6id,TheGodOfThings17,3,Thu Jul 9 13:28:13 2015 UTC,"Up by 12 with 5 minutes left and my ball after I just picked off the other team. Run ball a few times, but 3 and out and forced to punt. Other team becomes unstoppable and drives down field in like a minute and scores a touchdown. Oh well, still up 5. Team onside kicks. Bounces off my guys hands and right to the other team. Stupid Madden cheese/ EAids. They still need a TD, I'll be okay. Their stupid running back just runs over my defense breaking tackles left and right for a touchdown. They then go for 2 and get that too! Alright, still have a little over a minute. Drive down and get a FG to send to OT. Lose the coin toss, team drives down for TD to lose the game. But it's alright, they went on to lose in the Super Bowl."
Madden,3co6id,Misterymoon,3,Thu Jul 9 16:18:48 2015 UTC,"mike glennon always, and i mean always, ends up as a 99 overall after a season or two. in real life, he's probably a career back up.  also, the lions haven't lost a game in 4 seasons, matthew stafford is a quadruple mvp/superbowl mvp."
Madden,3co6id,KingCardinal17,3,Thu Jul 9 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"Mike Glennon should not be a career back up. He just doesn't get played. Last season, he came in and out performed McCown every time, but they kept going with McCown. If someone would actually give him a chance, he will be a good QB. Not a Brady, but a Dalton."
Madden,3co6id,TheBoss6183,4,Thu Jul 9 19:13:26 2015 UTC,mike glennon is the best type of career back up; the reliable kind. i see a matt hasselbeck/matt flynn type of career for him.

Madden,3cqeqv,Black_Suit_Matty,2,Fri Jul 10 00:27:06 2015 UTC,You pay an extra $30 to get the game a little sooner and play he old game no one will play..? Lol. No thanks. I'd just buy a madden 15 off craigslist for $30 and then buy the new madden and stick with ps4. There is a reason ps4 blew Xbox out of the water in sales.
Madden,3cqeqv,3windy1city2,-2,Fri Jul 10 01:37:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not really concerned with what other people play, I was just suggesting there's a giant amount of value in EA access. It's been great."
Madden,3cqeqv,Black_Suit_Matty,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:18:26 2015 UTC,"Lol. It's garbage. You get the same thing with psn and its added with the $50 yearly subscription which is already $10 less then Xbox gold. No one is gonna want to go back and play madden 25 and other dated games they add to the ""vault"". lol su. What are there, only 6 games you game at for free? You get 10% off of every purchase you buy of an EA product but you have to make how many purchases to even save what you paid for the subscription. Lol. Just saying ps4 is the way to go and EA access is garbage."
Madden,3cqeqv,3windy1city2,0,Sat Jul 11 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, you type about as well as I imagine you speak. Also, I think the vault is up to thirteen games now. Dragon Age is releasing soon as well. You have to be willfully lying, or an idiot to pretend that Sony didn't mess up when they passed on Access. There's no reason that the awesome service needed to be Xbox only. Thirty bucks a year for (right now) twelve games, plus the ability to play them up to five days early, plus ten percent discount... I mean really dude, you already type like an idiot, you don't need to sound like one too. I think the reason Sony people sit on the internet all day and try to ""take down"" Xbox is because they've got nothing to play. On top of that, EA Access is a particularly great deal FOR people who play their sports titles."
Madden,3cqeqv,Black_Suit_Matty,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:39:09 2015 UTC,Do you realize you have buy SIX games from EA a year to even be getting your money's worth for EA access?? The average person buys 3 MAYBE 4 of EA's games. Again. Junk. Who cares that you get the game 5 days sooner.. That's 5 days of playing a game with out any of your friends.. FUN.   EDIT: they could have 50 games on there. They're all just gonna be dated games that no one plays like the old sports games.
Madden,3cqeqv,3windy1city2,0,Sat Jul 11 18:32:30 2015 UTC,"wut. It costs thirty dollars a year. Lol, settle down about video games bro. Try to get out a little bit in general."

Then you say it's just a video game.. But are the one paying and extra $30 to play it 5 days sooner. Haha. You get out more.. Buying extra shit just so you can play madden 5 days sooner with no one."

Madden,3cpgez,mcorcoran3,-2,Thu Jul 9 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"Not really, they are just adding stuff they took away in the past -- it is two steps backwards, one step forward, which takes you in the wrong direction overall."
Madden,3cpgez,mcorcoran3,-3,Thu Jul 9 21:45:24 2015 UTC,The fact that why wont bother with new broadcasters is reason enough to pass on this game and evidence that just want to please newbies since they no veterans gamers have no alternative.

(I hope) we have pretty much a brand new d-line and Trent murphy, perry riley, Keenan Robinson are all still prospects as well.. either way. The team is still getting upgraded and I can't complain. Let's just hope they don't drop griffins injury to like an 80 god damnit."
Madden,3cllzu,Mr_Thongzilla,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:16:56 2015 UTC,"They probably consider the Redskins front seven lackluster, because of the lack of LBs and Dlinemen that will have a madden rating above 85. I envision several of the front seven players ratings hovering around 80 but I'm optimistic that a strong season will help boot some of those ratings up."

Madden,3cgb78,JMLeblanc23,7,Tue Jul 7 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"There are no truly elite halfbacks or tight ends in Madden 15. I've never seen a drafted halfback with speed over 91. Most have carrying in the 50s and 60s. At best, you'll find a guy kind of like Willis McGahee with 90 SPD and 80+ TRK and ELU. Tight ends never have above 70 strength, so the idea of getting a balanced tight end like Rob Gronkowski or Vernon Davis is pretty much out.   Back when they designed draft classes (which were worse, by the way), they'd give you once in a generation players like J.J. Smoke, Leon Sandcastle, and the like.   But in Madden 15, their random player generator seems predisposed to giving you decent but not spectacular players with a few epic busts sprinkled in."
Madden,3cgb78,Moruitelda,3,Tue Jul 7 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"JJ Smoke. That guy was a beast.   Yeah, it's become clear that each position stays in relatively the same area regarding attributes.  I've come across a HB with like 91 SPD 79 STR and was 5'11 240, he was fun to use. I've also seen on here, someone talking about a gigantic HB with A SPD A HPW, so I was wondering if anyone else had discovered a similar beast.  From playing in an online league, one of the best HB's in the lg came out as a CB but with 99 SPD 38 STR 96 AGI 97 ACC 94 ELU 80 CTH, and was just like 20 years old.  However, knowing what I know now, your best bet at building a stud HB would be to find one of those 6'0+, 200+ WR's that have blazing speed with not completely awful strength and build them.  Exhibit A (Started at 56 STR, 97 SPD/ACC, normal dev; WR to HB):  http://daddyleagues.com/nefl/player/2412347/attributes  Exhibit B (WR to HB):  http://daddyleagues.com/nefl/player/3231505/attributes  As far as building a great TE, those come in the form of 6'5-6, 240 WR's that you move from WR - HB - FB - TE.   Exhibit C (WR to TE):  http://daddyleagues.com/nefl/player/3231494/attributes  tl;dr Some of the best players you can have on your team often come out of the draft at the wrong position."
Madden,3cgb78,Moruitelda,3,Tue Jul 7 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"It's true that position changes were a vitally important part of this game this year, but people in the leagues I was in really didn't seem to appreciate that fully.   But even so, the tight end that you posted isn't a great tight end. He's a tall, fast one. Rob Gronkowski has like 85 STR and solid run blocking; you just can't get that from any position combination."
Madden,3cgb78,dirty_drawlz21,3,Tue Jul 7 19:20:37 2015 UTC,the league I was in outright banned moving WR to HB feeling it was cheating the system
Madden,3cgb78,Moruitelda,2,Tue Jul 7 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"Mine too, and I disagreed vehemently with the decision. There was no advantaged gained from that that you didn't have from just somehow acquiring C.J. Spiller or Jeff Demps or Jamaal Charles. I thought it was a bad system that didn't need defending."
Madden,3cgb78,dirty_drawlz21,2,Tue Jul 7 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"exactly, the only explanation would be all 32 owners wouldn't know about it so you have an unfair advantage while some guys are still drafting running backs in the first round   but  you had to do it because 99.9% of the rbs were garbage"
Madden,3cgb78,Moruitelda,2,Tue Jul 7 20:15:04 2015 UTC,the only explanation would be all 32 owners wouldn't know about it    This was a highly sophisticated league. Everyone knew. The commissioners were concerned about a slippery slope for player movement.
Madden,3cgb78,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:12:19 2015 UTC,"But it's not impossible to turn a 91 speed RB into a stud -- 99 speed, 99 acc etc... that is the challenge, right? It takes more time to develop. Otherwise, everybody can just draft the fastest WR possible and make him a RB. It is annoying in leagues when Tavon Austin in a RB"
Madden,3cgb78,dirty_drawlz21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:40:21 2015 UTC,I dont mind the people that move real life guys out of position  yea it ruins the realism but in CFM it's their team....
Madden,3cgb78,mcorcoran3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:29:36 2015 UTC,"See, the way I feel about it is this: If the player is in the first three years of their career, it's much more plausible that a position change could happen. Although I'll never recommend nor vouch for Tavon moving to HB. It's more for the players that clearly weren't going to be a consistently effective option at WR, or any former position at that."
Madden,3cgb78,mcorcoran3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:22:21 2015 UTC,Ignorance is bliss. Let's cripple the innovative owners because others are too lazy to make the same moves on their own. Love those leagues.

Madden,3cgb78,Samwise777,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"I liked them precisely because there weren't too many stud, but my complaints are:  *Only Tackles seemed to be awesome right away -- they should have the occasional, once or twice a year great safety, or end.  *It's real easy to get great WRs, ('6'5, 95 speed, star development) and Corners, but too hard to get good RBs, or TEs * Linebackers are too fast  I do think QBs are good. I am in year 2026 and have only seen 3 QBs come out with A speed, A acc, which is cool. They are a real prize when you find one and it takes years of waiting to find one."
Madden,3cgb78,rebelrowzer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:43:55 2015 UTC,I learned you can build your offensive line up real quick because their A Grades do not fake you out as much as the other positions  after Year 2 I had 5 beast all under 23 starting
Madden,3cgb78,mcorcoran3,3,Thu Jul 9 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"Does taking that path to move a WR to TE help with the ridiculous stat penalties?  I get the awareness, even route running or release, but why do I lose like 10 speed for going straight WR to TE?"
Madden,3cgb78,hyperbolical,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:41:49 2015 UTC,Because a 96 speed TE would be a joke.
Madden,3cgb78,mcorcoran3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:25:37 2015 UTC,Vernon Davis ran a 4.36
Madden,3cgb78,Ryksos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:07:06 2015 UTC,"To keep some level of immersion. It is really not realistic or fair to have a 96 speed TE. In real life if you have that much speed, you wouldn't be a TE."
Madden,3cgb78,Ryksos,2,Wed Jul 8 19:38:22 2015 UTC,"This guy had 88 speed and got nerfed to 79. I don't buy the immersion angle, because I could have just left him at WR and slotted him in as a TE on the depth chart without penalty. A guy forgetting how to run after a position change is way more immersion breaking.  And Vernon Davis has 90 speed, and had 95 speed in the game just a few years ago."
Madden,3cgb78,mcorcoran3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:42:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most leagues I am in ban putting TEs at WR on the depth chart or otherwise (in fact by rule their must be three TEs on the roster to avoid WRs coming in even in goal line situations. I have seen some leagues that allow changes but max TE speed to 89, which is reasonable.   Vernon Davis is the exception, but his stats are an outlier, to be sure."
Madden,3cgb78,TastyDonutHD,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:44:40 2015 UTC,"VD was never higher than 92 SPD. But I agree with this. Players should actually look like a tight end if you want to make the switch, not just solely based on the fact that they're not a burner."
Madden,3cgb78,mcorcoran3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:24:15 2015 UTC,I thought attributes got adjusted when you shifted a player's position?

Madden,3cgb78,mcorcoran3,4,Wed Jul 8 19:37:20 2015 UTC,i hate that all the drafted players are built retarded proportionally and they all wear the exact same equipment.

Madden,3ch5qd,Exocraze,2,Tue Jul 7 21:42:18 2015 UTC,"What's the best way to find a league? I know that you can search the leagues in game, but how do you know if those are active?   Stick around here. There are a lot of good leagues around here, and (from November to July or thereabouts) they're usually looking for new members. If you're a good enough player to not get frustrated, and a good enough sport to get along with everyone and follow the rules, you can find all the leagues you could possibly want right here.    How common are coach only leagues? Correct me if I'm wrong, but in a coach only league, people pretty much run a team with trades/signings and all that from the coach perspective? Sorry if I'm way off base here.   Pretty much the only way that people do things in Madden 15 because owner mode was broken."
Madden,3ch5qd,Moruitelda,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:58:37 2015 UTC,This sub and sites like operation sports will have league recruiting threads.  You aren't way off but coach mode isn't that literal. You'll notice CFM has 3 main modes. Player (usually for solo at home playing) and coach / owner. These are essentially the same mode with one caveat: if you like to manage money and player salaries owner mode is for you. If you prefer to focus on playing games then stick to coach mode.
Madden,3ch5qd,BlackoutMurray,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:29:27 2015 UTC,1) see how many teams the league has -- you can search for leagues with a minimum number of teams to weed out inactive ones.  2) tons of leagues are coach only
Madden,3ch5qd,mcorcoran3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:02:49 2015 UTC,Try to stick with a league that has been around for a while and it at least 70% full. Unless you enjoy playing the CPU.

Moving Minnesota to Mexico City without mentioning it in an online league with a few buddies mixed of Packer and Viking fans was great.   The funds issue just killed it this year.
Madden,3cc9je,dubblechzburger,3,Tue Jul 7 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"When initially playing owner mode, I got super fucked up because of how little money I made.

Madden,3cf2u9,JohnnieBoah,2,Thu Jul 9 18:12:18 2015 UTC,Always nice to meet good leaguers. Sad to say I didn't find any here except Lip.
Madden,3cf2u9,WindwardZeus,3,Mon Jul 13 16:43:33 2015 UTC,Lmao. Your league is shit... Its not even 1/10th of the league pure is. Nice try though...

Pure Madden and AL2 are the only other leagues that can compete with us...and even they are going downhill with SIM rules and crazy trade stipulations. We are the best league out, better jump on board before you get left behind!"

Madden,3cdam7,SGOTheNatural,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:06:01 2015 UTC,Thanks! So does my team just suck bc I have a rookie coach? Not sure exactly the best way to start out...I picked the Colts so I feel like I should be at least and 85 or something
Madden,3cdam7,SGOTheNatural,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:21:50 2015 UTC,Once your player's confidence goes up the team overall will. Make sure you are wisely using your exp as well.
Madden,3cdam7,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:00:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think your coach rating would effect the team overall -- I think that is just a composite of overall rankings or something. Probably just weighted down by the Colts defense. You will build it up though. My advice, follow the draft stories and write the names down of any player who had a positive story (the stories disappear after a week or 2). Those players all have either quick or star development -- easiest way to scout development trait, which is important."
Madden,3cdam7,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jul 7 02:26:41 2015 UTC,"Operationsports.com is a forum with lots of people who live and breathe CfM, preach realism, hate on MUT etc... my kind of gamers, honestly."

Joe Flacco is number five, but his jersey number is 24, which would lead one to believe that other statistics have been messed with. Also, Johnny Manziel is the kicker.

Madden,3cciut,bizN,2,Tue Jul 7 22:58:29 2015 UTC,"I knew id get down voted for that last statement. I agree with you 100 %. With that being said, if EA took Madden 15 and just put a Madden 16 sticker on it and sold it for $60 and you buy it, you are stupid. You just paid $60 for the same game. Stupid. To each his own."
Madden,3cciut,bizN,6,Wed Jul 8 02:18:05 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, you're not the only one whose skipping it this year. I feel the same exact way. They added a ton of new plays and tweaked a couple things. Now if it was a DLC and set at say, $19.99, I'd most likely buy it."
Madden,3cciut,waterbuffalo750,-1,Mon Jul 6 21:25:45 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this is one of those ""im crying because I'm not getting what I want"" threads. I've bought this game on release day every year since 04 though, and this is the first time its pissed me off."
Madden,3cciut,waterbuffalo750,2,Mon Jul 6 22:11:10 2015 UTC,"I've also done the same. I've been a devoted Madden fan and to simply push out Madden 15 and rebrand it Madden 16 with coverage upgrades, bug fixes, and new plays doesn't cut it for me. I'm not asking for ground breaking changes here but it looks like the same damn game. I just can't justify paying $60 for minor dlc upgrades."
Madden,3cciut,WeDemHawks,7,Mon Jul 6 23:37:13 2015 UTC,"I skipped it last year, upgraded to ps4 recently, so I'm definitely buying it this year. But I agree with skipping it from time to time."
Madden,3cciut,paperllamasunited,9,Mon Jul 6 21:29:48 2015 UTC,"If you skipped it last year, DEFINITLEY buy it this year. The jump from 25 to 15 was outstanding."
Madden,3cciut,SGOTheNatural,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:19:20 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that's what I was hoping to hear, lol. I'm guessing the jump from ps3 to ps4 will be significant as well"
Madden,3cciut,MPVahalik,3,Mon Jul 6 22:44:59 2015 UTC,You won't believe how well the next Gen experience is in madden 15.
Madden,3cciut,mwf86,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"Let's put it this way; Madden 15 on my PS3 was total crap, I played maybe 5 games. Madden 15 on my XB1 I've had for 2 months, and I play at least one game per day."
Madden,3cciut,MPVahalik,5,Tue Jul 7 07:02:58 2015 UTC,"Madden 16 is a great game and you definitely would be missing out. Did they reinvent the wheel? No, but every single portion of the gameplay has been improved."
Madden,3cciut,Misterymoon,6,Tue Jul 7 01:07:55 2015 UTC,"As someone who play tested Madden 16 a couple of weeks ago, I wouldn't skip it. There was a massive leap from 25 to 15 and there's an equally massive leap between 15 and 16"
Madden,3cciut,robbyross,6,Tue Jul 7 00:48:43 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion. There is also a video up where a guy play tested it an said exactly the opposite, saying the passing game is the area of focus, but other then that its essentially the same. To each his own. Thanks for the comment!"
Madden,3cciut,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:26:25 2015 UTC,can you elaborate on the improvements from your experience?
Madden,3cciut,Kodyak77,3,Tue Jul 7 19:22:02 2015 UTC,"I played Draft Champions and MUT. Every aspect of gameplay is improved. No more suction tackles, the physics felt more realistic, running the ball was incredibly smooth, total control passing is a game changer but it's not overpowered so you can actually play defense. The WR/DB interactions are the best in the franchise."
Madden,3cciut,Crathsor,3,Tue Jul 7 20:25:47 2015 UTC,15 to 16 changes look minor. 25 to 15 was a big difference (at least for madden) and was great. I'll buy 16 just for online franchises.
Madden,3cciut,Crathsor,3,Mon Jul 6 21:56:33 2015 UTC,I hear that. I just refuse to spend a full 60 on it.
Madden,3cciut,wowcomma,3,Mon Jul 6 22:18:35 2015 UTC,I'm skeptical about buying it.. I've been buying it since Eddie George was on the cover in 2001..
Madden,3cciut,that_guy_you_kno,5,Tue Jul 7 00:21:00 2015 UTC,"I am not buying 16 this year either -- and I play Madden a ton. But I can't justify this shit. I am more pissed about the regression of CFM than the gameplay, but in any event, Madden is going in the wrong direction."
Madden,3cciut,that_guy_you_kno,5,Tue Jul 7 01:31:09 2015 UTC,... Both of you will still end up buying it.
Madden,3cciut,vearson26,-2,Tue Jul 7 13:30:28 2015 UTC,I'm that guy that ALWAYS NO MATTER WHAT buys Madden every year. It's like a holiday to me. This one I as well can't justify spending a full 60 on.
Madden,3cciut,Beelzebot44,2,Tue Jul 7 02:28:21 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I think there are a hundred things wrong with Madden NFL 15, but the graphics aren't one of them.  I'll take the same graphics if it means a whole bunch of other fixes, which is apparently what we're being offered.  We'll see what people say when it's being purchased and opinions aren't advertisements."
Madden,3cciut,Squidward-Tentpoles,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:53:12 2015 UTC,I never said graphics were a problem in madden 15. I said they improved dramatically from 25 to 15.
Madden,3cciut,Pennalty,3,Tue Jul 7 02:24:51 2015 UTC,"And that's true; but your criticism of 16 seems to be primarily rooted in the fact that the graphics are the same, right?  That's what I'm talking about.  I'm saying that they didn't improve the graphics, but to me they were already good enough (for now.)"
Madden,3cciut,WeDemHawks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:43:58 2015 UTC,"Ahh, my mistake. My point was not that they needed to improve the graphics, rather that the game entirely looks identical to last years game. With that being said, presentation is essentially identical to last years, a few very subtle changes. Players on the sideline still don't have names on the back of their jerseys, crowd looks like they walked out of a Sega Dreamcast etc. Just shows lazyness to me at $60. For like $20? Then it would be worth it to me. Not trying to bash the game, I love madden. Bought everyone since 04 on release date, can't justify spending a full $60 on this one."
Madden,3cciut,WeDemHawks,2,Tue Jul 7 11:21:59 2015 UTC,It doesn't look like as big of an improvement but I'll still play enough to get my money's worth.
Madden,3c9kj4,Beelzebot44,4,Mon Jul 6 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"I don't have sources, but I'd be willing to bet that there's no change. I'm also sure that we won't be able to use our old teams jerseys. Or have decent looking stadiums."
Madden,3caqmp,morphd_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:03:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but they said they have added hundreds of plays, and they've changed the AI and animations, so most likely some plays aren't going to work the same.  It will probably behoove you to make a new one anyway."
Madden,3caqmp,Crathsor,2,Mon Jul 6 13:28:30 2015 UTC,"Which I'll probably end up doing, but it would be nice to see what does and doesn't work from my current playbook.  I wasn't one to exploit the AI (playing on All Madden I feel like I'm being exploited half the time), but I'm sure the new AI will take a little getting used to."
Madden,3capp0,JaiOhBe,2,Mon Jul 6 12:54:45 2015 UTC,"In theory he should, but it doesn't always work out. Also, make sure he has the predictability trait -- it costs less than 2000k xp and makes him more likely to accept his asking price or below."
Madden,3capp0,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:28:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input.
Madden,3capp0,willfoxylove,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:38:12 2015 UTC,"That's a good question, and I'm not sure if that will work or not, my guess is that your QB is not gonna budge on that 24m a year. What I do is just find a new qb every 4-5 years once my guy's contract is up and let the other guys in my league overpay for him. I'll just draft another/sign a cheaper alternative in FA and make him to a stud. You could also franchise your qb to get him one more year. You'll pay around 12-13 mil for that year I think."
Madden,3capp0,willfoxylove,2,Mon Jul 6 13:17:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. My only issue with letting him walk is he's I'd need another young, speedy QB to replace him. Those can be difficult to come by. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have to tag him for a year, maybe get these other big contracts out of the way this year and hopefully make room for him next year. Still might take a shot on that contract package and see what happens."
Madden,3capp0,mcorcoran3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:36:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah but there's always a mobile qb every two years you can trade up for and grab, if your league allows it."
Madden,3capp0,willfoxylove,2,Mon Jul 6 14:25:46 2015 UTC,"I am in the year 2026 and only 3 A speed QBs have been generated. B speed QBs are pretty common, but 90+ speed for a QB is, so far, happens infrequently. The good news, though, is that these guys always seem to be projected to go late (6th, even 7th round).   I found a 93 speed QB in 2016 and again in 2023. The Browns got one too in that time (2015 I think). That is it so far and I already checked the 2027 draft class -- no A speed QBs at all."

Madden,3caj24,premierplayer,2,Mon Jul 6 14:06:46 2015 UTC,To put cards in the game you need to have the players rights. Since he has retired he isn't techniquely part of the NFL Players Association so they have to go to him to get them. They didn't. Most of the legends are getting paid for their name to be in the game.
Madden,3caj24,RAVENS17d,-11,Mon Jul 6 11:43:29 2015 UTC,whatever bro its just disappointing one of the best of all time isn't in the game
Madden,3caj24,RAVENS17d,3,Mon Jul 6 12:33:29 2015 UTC,"Its very disappointing. Based off the footage of the new mode in Madden 16, it looks like they have added a few new ones such as Okoye, Terrell Davis, and Joe Horn."
Madden,3caj24,RAVENS17d,-6,Mon Jul 6 12:44:08 2015 UTC,"I just hope we see him one day, he was an amazing player, and madden wants to be the most realistic game then they should have all the players (legends). And considering the fact EA is a multi-billion dollar company they have enough money to pay for licensing."
Madden,3caj24,RAVENS17d,5,Mon Jul 6 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"That really isn't up to them. They have a budget that they are allowed to use every year for acquiring naming rights. Don't forget that the guys who make Madden weren't originally part of EA. In 1998 EA bought them out. EA is their parent company. They throw a few bucks their way with the incentive to upgrade the game every year and when its done they slap their name all over the package. The company was called Tiburon Entertainment, and now its called EA Tiburon. The only way EA was going to get Madden was by buying out the entire company and thats exactly what they did. Since then they have slowly relied on them for more sports titles such as NBA Live, and the PGA Tour games."

Madden,3c7rg5,thatdudedizz,3,Sun Jul 5 18:13:09 2015 UTC,Coach mode in CFM mode is my choice -- owner mode has too many trivialities that I don't care about (concession prices) and I here the revenue is messed up. Although at this point I ought to try it since I am trying to keep the game fresh.
Madden,3c7rg5,mcorcoran3,3,Sun Jul 5 21:10:49 2015 UTC,"Start in skills trainer or you will get frustrated early. Pass all the drills then start as a coach of a young, up and coming franchise. Look for teams like the vikings, eagles, dolphins, etc.."

Madden,3c7rg5,rebelrowzer,2,Tue Jul 7 14:45:21 2015 UTC,"start out with connected franchise. coach mode is probably the most accessible, since you don't just control one player and don't have to deal with the ""owner funds"" bullshit. play on pro difficulty to start off, and adjust it accordingly as you get more comfortable with the game."
Madden,3c7rg5,Watuhmelons,2,Sun Jul 5 19:50:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a real big fan of franchise mode, though it's not called that anymore. I'll take a team that's down on it's luck and try my best, through trading, drafting, and signing free agents to build them up to greatness. In the connected careers mode, you can choose to be a player, coach, or owner. As a player, you just play games and improve yourself. As a coach, you have control over your whole team, and you draft people, sign free agents, and try to win as many games as possible on your way to the Super Bowl. I don't know much about Owner mode, because I haven't played it yet, but I know you control the more minute things like ticket and concession prices.  I'd recommend you start just in Play Now mode against the AI to get the hang of how it controls. If you already have a good knowledge of football, it shouldn't take too long to get decent at the game.  I'd recommend starting on Pro difficulty so you have an actual challenge, and once you get good enough at that, move it up to All-Pro for a fair and challenging experience. All-Madden is more challenging, but it isn't totally fair, so you should be happy with All-Pro.  If you know the game of football, feel free to skip these next paragraphs as I'm just going to suggest some strategic tips.  First off, know the players on your team. If you play as someone like the Packers, you won't have to worry too much about this, but if you play as one of the weaker teams, you'll need to know whose good and who sucks. If your team has a good runningback, obviously you should run the ball more, but if your team has a good QB, pass more. It's good to be balanced, but play to your strengths.  Your main goal is to score touchdowns, but you're not going to have much success or fun if you only bomb it down the field every play. You need situational awareness. On 1st and 10, choose a play that gives you a good chance of picking up some yards, but don't be too conservative or you'll become predictable. On second down, if you got 6 or so yards on first down, try going deep because you won't have much to lose. If you didn't get any, choose a safe play like a run up the gut or a short pass like slants or curls. On third and short, go for the safe option and just try to get the first down. Third and long (5+ yards) choose a medium distance passing play to give yourself the best option. On fourth down, you should probably punt or go for a field goal, but in some instances you might want to go for it. Those instances are if you're losing without much time left to go, or if your close your own endzone so you won't have much to lose if you don't get any points that drive. That is a basic template to follow, but don't follow it too closely, or you'll be easy to beat. Formulate your own strategy and you'll find yourself successful.  Apologies for the wall of text. If you have anything else you'd like to know about, feel free to ask."
Madden,3c7rg5,NerdyOrDirty,2,Sun Jul 5 20:02:09 2015 UTC,"Connected Franchise Mode (CFM) and pick your favourite team as coach. If you don't have a fav team, I'm a fan of doing the fantasy draft (where the entire league re-drafts) and picking a few players and letting it auto-draft the rest."

Madden,3c7phc,craighowser,4,Sun Jul 5 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"I found that once you get to the year 2020 or so the game freshens up because you have new players and new rivalries. I also keep upping the difficulty level although I am not at the point where I have 0 QB accuracy so not many other places to go. For instance I am in 2026 and the Broncos and Cowboys, Browns and Steelers have awesome QBs and that adds some fun (ie, I will have to face Denver's Hudson McKnight again).   I might try being a ""scouting director"" where I sim all or most of the games and let the CPU handle re-signings and I just draft -- that is the best part of the game for me and it will be impossible to cheese that way if I have no control over what picks we have and such."
Madden,3c7phc,mcorcoran3,3,Sun Jul 5 21:06:45 2015 UTC,"If you want some short term fun you should create a team using players playing out of position to add difficulty. I recently created a team using only QB's, I did my best to get players in a position where their size and physical attributes are ideal. O-line and D-line were obviously difficult, I'd recommend using actual offensive linesmen because it's a bit of a joke otherwise. Up to you though. Tebow and Luck were really good linebackers, Luck forced 2 fumbles in my first 6 games and Tebow racked up a heap of tackles and an interception. Russell Wilson got a few picks playing Corner too.  If you want a less difficult one, you could do a team using a heap of positional converts, but convert them to positions that would actually suit them. E.g, Kam Chancellor and Taylor Mays as linebackers, Tavon Austin and Golden Tate at HB."

So you pick a team and then you go the manage players thing in the settings and trade players for other players. Also you can edit players and change their position and beef their stats. So I had Jamaal Charles as my QB, Colin Kap as my WR, Calvin Johnson as my WR and Drew Bree's as my RE. It was so fun, Kap was a monster at WR."

I think it's some people being bitter about the game not being what they want it to be but also others just hating and downvoting because they can.

Madden,3c5n33,SGOTheNatural,0,Sun Jul 5 11:28:29 2015 UTC,"Frankly, this sub has the most strangely toxic environment of any that I frequent on reddit. I know a ton of really solid people here, but a lot of people who are super negative and just downvote everything. It's sad."

Madden,3c5n33,PolishMartyr,-5,Sun Jul 5 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't noticed anything like that and it doesn't seem to be the case when viewing new posts. There's definitely a pattern - generic league posts get downvoted and posts that belong to a series such as ""Roster breakdown: Denver Broncos edition"" get downvoted - but I'm just not seeing the claimed 90%. Considering we get fewer than 25 posts per day, I'd rather not see anything get downvoted to 0, but that's beyond my control.  Unfortunately, even if you were correct, there would be nothing I could do about it. I would guess that someone just doesn't like you and downvotes everything you post. I believe that will eventually result in a shadowban, so it shouldn't happen forever unless /r/madden as a whole just really dislikes you."

Madden,3c0soo,wowcomma,8,Fri Jul 3 18:50:24 2015 UTC,Do you think think a better deal is gonna come along or should I just pull the trigger now?
Madden,3c0soo,Red_Stevens,5,Fri Jul 3 20:10:49 2015 UTC,Amazon has a price guarantee I believe. However I don't know the details
Madden,3c0soo,thekingswitness,3,Fri Jul 3 20:14:17 2015 UTC,I took screen shots on this ($47.83 after tax) and call of duty ($53.11 after tax) in case these prime savings don't get automatically guaranteed. Better safe than sorry. Typically the price drops closer to release date online as people want to get their last minute copies in stores. With Amazon's newly offered release day delivery (now for free) with prime pricing I'm finally happy to save a few bucks. The last few years I've gotten games 2 to 6 days late to save tax and a couple dollars.
Madden,3c0soo,Machinegun_Pete,4,Sat Jul 4 03:49:53 2015 UTC,I'm on PS4 and the price comes to about $53 (tax).   I plan on waiting for a better deal.
Madden,3c0soo,ab__,3,Fri Jul 3 20:31:35 2015 UTC,Amazon has price match so you can buy it and if the price drops between now and 7 days after release you get the difference back. They also don't take any money until its shipped if you find it elsewhere and have to cancel.
Madden,3c0soo,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:41:33 2015 UTC,"Where did you get ""7 days after release"" from? I don't see it in the fine print and haven't heard that yet. http://www.amazon.com/gp/promotions/details/popup/AWT354OR7BM1U"
Madden,3c0soo,Machinegun_Pete,2,Sat Jul 4 03:55:12 2015 UTC,I think it's one of those unspoken things with companies. That's the longest I've been affected by a price drop in my favor.
Madden,3c0soo,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:03:12 2015 UTC,So I can't legally hold them to it or expect it but shouldn't be surprised by it?   Call of Duty is usually released around veterans' day which has delayed the receivement date to 6 days after release and I've noticed the price guarantee be the price 6 days later. I figured that was based off when I received the game more so than a 7 day guarantee. I'm not sure that since same day delivery is now free that we will continue to get that 7 day window but would appreciate it.
Madden,3c0soo,Machinegun_Pete,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:09:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I've had probably 10 items adjusted after I have received them. Usually not for a big amount. Most was like $6 on a game and $3 on a CD.
Madden,3c0soo,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:53:15 2015 UTC,"I think the ""7 days after release"" falls under their general price drop guarantee. If anything you purchase drops within a week, they'll refund the difference."

Madden,3c2gic,WaterWalkers,5,Sun Jul 5 13:38:40 2015 UTC,Jabal Sheard. I did nothing with him. When I traded him he became defensive player of the year (or a close runner up) every year for the chiefs.
Madden,3c2gic,mcorcoran3,7,Sat Jul 4 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"Not really. You've just got to learn to play to a player's strengths. Sure, if I run a read option offense with Tom Brady, he's gonna suck. If I use Darren Sproles for a bunch of run plays up the middle, he's gonna fumble a lot. So it goes."
Madden,3c2gic,TheRealPeteWheeler,5,Sat Jul 4 05:13:18 2015 UTC,"JJ Watt.    I don't know why but he's been super ineffective for me.  Jadeveon Clowney and the other LB, Green, have been MONSTERS in my CFM with the Texans.  But JJ has been mediocre at best.  I can never shed blocks when I user him, when he's CPU controlled the QB sheds his sacks more often than not, and generally he is just ineffective.  It's so frikkin weird!  Clowney or Green seem to be the ones who are getting Sacks and blowing up run plays, while JJ gets bowled over by the OLineman."

Madden,3c1qt9,mcorcoran3,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can find regarding player weight is this:    There’s a concept called “Conservation of Momentum” where we take weight, center of gravity, and momentum into consideration.

Madden,3c1qt9,SnakexBombs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:27:37 2015 UTC,"I think it only matters in so much as bigger players take up more space and might make contact where a smaller player wouldn't.

Madden,3bzx74,roogug,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:55:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty sure this is right; go into your team schemes and you'll probably find your OL preferences set to Run or Mauler.  Set them to Pass Blocking and their goals should change.  Note that their OVR will probably change too, because you're weighting attributes differently.  In your case they may well go up."
Madden,3bvrrl,danchan22,24,Thu Jul 2 15:34:11 2015 UTC,Hopefully they get a team of people to do them now.  One man cannot accurately rate about 60 players for 32 teams.
Madden,3bvrrl,supaB,2,Thu Jul 2 22:26:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I never got how some players would have a good game and drop 3 points but because of one highlight play other players would go up 4 points.
Madden,3bvrrl,DunDerD,54,Fri Jul 3 16:23:57 2015 UTC,will they ever make their rating system better like fifa? I don't want a player to be 99 unless they are literally the perfect player. Madden gives out that rating way too liberally.
Madden,3bvrrl,chogunrua,20,Thu Jul 2 18:14:25 2015 UTC,I agree the system is scaled way too far towards the top end. I want 50 to be an ACTUAL average... It will give a better idea of player performance of each skill was re-measured that way. Only pro bowl guys should be 88+ with the MVP as the only 99
Madden,3bvrrl,sleetx,16,Thu Jul 2 19:38:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think that'd be great to have real diversity. Someone is the fastest player in the league...no way we could have several players who run at the exact same speed.  Though, I have to say Pro Bowl is an absolutely horrendous metric to use. Please don't"
Madden,3bvrrl,Ohuma,6,Fri Jul 3 02:48:46 2015 UTC,Agree 100%
Madden,3bvrrl,TD-Eagles,6,Thu Jul 2 18:42:27 2015 UTC,It only matters in relation to other players and... it's 99 not 100.
Madden,3bvrrl,KiDeVerclear,7,Thu Jul 2 18:50:01 2015 UTC,but rating richard sherman or JJ watt a 99 makes me think they are maxed out in every attribute and the best possible football player at their position. but we know that isn't true because 99 rated players still can improve A LOT in this game. I've played FIFA for 10 years and only ever had one player reach 99 in a career mode and that was messi who started at like 94 (highest rated player in the game)
Madden,3bvrrl,chogunrua,2,Thu Jul 2 18:57:07 2015 UTC,And even if you're a 99 in Madden doesn't necessarily mean he is going to be a great Madden player.  There are several key attributes which are most important for different positions. A DE could have great acceleration and dominate the game the same way JJ Watt does
Madden,3bvrrl,Ohuma,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:50:08 2015 UTC,"I know FIFA and 2K do it differently, and I guess I understand what you mean then. Just that they can ""improve"" not that they've hit their ceiling. That's a great way to think of it."
Madden,3bvrrl,KiDeVerclear,2,Thu Jul 2 18:58:32 2015 UTC,"I don't understand it, either. I remember reading on espn how he uses many different metrics. However, it always bugged me that after comparing combine times for every event that two players who performed differently could be the same exact speed!   Doesn't matter, though. Your 99 speed WR will get chased down by the MLB every time"
Madden,3bvrrl,Ohuma,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:47:15 2015 UTC,"To add on...  Does anyone else have receivers get chased down by DTs? I throw a lot of 12 yard passes over the middle, and it seems that by the time the ball gets to the receiver, the DT disengaged his OL and dove and tackled my guy 12 yards downfield."
Madden,3bvrrl,paperllamasunited,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:45:23 2015 UTC,"Go in to your sliders and change ""Min Speed Threshold"". If you lower it then you can really see the difference in speed. I recommend playing on 1- 10, I usually play with 1 for maximum realism but if I have a fast QB I put it on 5-10 depending on his stats. It's too easy when DL's can't even get close to touching him."
Madden,3bvrrl,switchn,2,Fri Jul 3 06:17:02 2015 UTC,"Wouldnt even be that hard, just scale everyone back 10"
Madden,3bvrrl,tgr31,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:08:57 2015 UTC,Would need to be % based to keep it accurate.

Madden,3bvrrl,Teves3D,18,Fri Jul 3 01:01:36 2015 UTC,"i hope in the future they allow us the ability to have players shed weight and gain weight.  Use the xp system on the player, have him spend X number of points to bulk up fast, add strength, run stopping, but he loses a little agility by simulaing him just bulking up by eating a ton. Useful for undersized linemen, not the best choice for skilled players but it would give him time to do other offseason tasks.  Or he could spend more and dedicate his offseason to adding muscle and keeping his fat down. Gain strength and not lose as much agility and speed.  This to me would allow us to more accurately move players around and change their positions.  You draft a 6'5 WR with decent blocking, who weighs 230 and want him to switch to TE and bulk up in his first off season you can do so.  The harder working players will be more dedicated to their bodies, can improve with better body fat percentages, the lazier players will just eat a ton and get bulky."
Madden,3bvrrl,sniperhare,13,Thu Jul 2 19:35:03 2015 UTC,We still can't even see combine stats yet. Don't hold your breath.

Madden,3bvrrl,ralphyb0b,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:37:14 2015 UTC,"i hope in the future they allow us the ability to have players shed weight and gain weight.   That's pretty cool, actually. It would get super complicated, though. How would it impact their stats? If a RB gains weight, will he lose speed and gain strength? Weight doesn't have a strong impact on that unless it is an absurd change. A RB can gain 10 pounds, but it could be all muscle, which really shouldn't compromise his speed.  But it'd be cool to use XP to have players shed weight or gain weight in an impactful way"
Madden,3bvrrl,Ohuma,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:53:52 2015 UTC,"They have a size rating for that, though. I don't think you'd need to just drop their speed or whatever, but rather calculate their size into it. So, say you make Clarence BEEFTANK at 5'0 400lbs, and give him 99 speed. That weight will slow him down, so a 99 speed DeSean Jackson would still outrun him."
Madden,3bvrrl,Skarmotastic,7,Fri Jul 3 07:28:55 2015 UTC,Probably a good thing. Madden could use some new blood and a ratings system overhaul.
Madden,3bvrrl,KosmosBOOM,10,Thu Jul 2 20:18:33 2015 UTC,"Is his title actually ""Ratings Czar""? That's absurd."

I always wanted a de-facto waiver system (or at least a cap on free agency pickups, especially in pre-season week1), a limit of cap penalties etc... but when I broached these subjects most of the users seemed to think I was insane for wanting a hundred rules."

Use his rookie contract to boost his dev rating then sign him to a six year deal for chump change. Then after one season it's easy to get them from 65 to 80ovr.   Like on the Texans right now I had this back with 97 speed, 96 accel, 92 agil, and trash intangibles. Just boosted his moves and bcv and he is now a solid back.   In 15 I found no need to boost carrying ability if you manually brace before hits. A 60 carry back fumbles as often as a 90 if you manually brace. Those that Sim don't have this luxury though."

Madden,3bu29a,rebelrowzer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:20:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks. Do you have any go-to formations/audibles to protect the inside? I find that's where I usually fail. Seems like I can play as the 49ers or another team with quality defensive players and run a basic Cover 3 to stop just about every run (since their players are excellent at blowing up blocks), but the Packers defensive front tend to get glued to their blockers. It's probably because I'm misusing the personnel or lining them up incorrectly."
Madden,3bu29a,rebelrowzer,2,Thu Jul 2 15:52:41 2015 UTC,"What I usually do if they are going to run up the middle is go cover one robber, bring Burnett down and just time the snap count and rush him right down the a gap, I've blown a lot of plays up and caused a lot of fumbles, but you are vulnerable on the outside off of play action, so you better trade for some good corners, haha."
Madden,3bu29a,PolishMartyr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:58:34 2015 UTC,See Im a 4-3 guy. I dont mind giving up a yard of three. You really need strong LBs with good PRC and AWR to contain the outsides and pinch the line/stack the line when you see the direction.

Madden,3bnk3z,jtreezy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:45:08 2015 UTC,"Depends. If you don't try to game the system I've found it impossible to keep all of my great players. I've had to let a few 99 OVR players walk to keep others around. On the other hand if you give players most of their money as a bonus, they will accept like 50% of the total money. The real problem is that ALL contracts are back loaded as far as I can tell, so if you give your QB a big contract, he'll end up taking a huge chunk of your cap his last year."

Madden,3bra5d,muhalphabuild,8,Wed Jul 1 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"Put him as the #3 WR on the depth chart. The downside is that he won't play in 1-2 WR sets.  Use formations that put the WR1/WR2 in the slot. They exist, you just have to find them. The downside is that you're seriously limited in the sets that you can use.  Use the RB button to do manual subs for every formation in every game. The downside for this is that this is very time consuming."
Madden,3bra5d,Moruitelda,5,Wed Jul 1 14:49:26 2015 UTC,"oh I didn't know about #3. thank you !  I'm hoping soon EA adds that as another position, slot receiver and slot corner."
Madden,3bra5d,External12,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:52:17 2015 UTC,"You can also set him in the slot per formation.  But that's very tedious. For example,  I have RB2 always in backfield for shotgun formations encase I wanna pass to my scat back."
Madden,3bra5d,rebelrowzer,2,Wed Jul 1 19:00:25 2015 UTC,"Lots in the packers play book, gun trips right smash has the no.1 in the slot."
Madden,3bra5d,sleetx,6,Wed Jul 1 14:53:09 2015 UTC,"One of my biggest pet peeves with the game - it always put guys like Welker and Edelman as the #2 based on rating, and they never played in the slot unless you demoted them to #3 on the depth chart (removing them from all 2WR sets completely)"
Madden,3bra5d,Tricky_j,6,Wed Jul 1 17:22:21 2015 UTC,Flipping the right stick also has sub package strong slot which is usually putting the  #1wr in the slot. Also manual subs work great if you like to move players around the field he can be a slot in one formation and flanker in another.
Madden,3bra5d,_quicksand,4,Wed Jul 1 16:46:06 2015 UTC,We have 3D RB as a situational position. I can't understand why slot WR can't function the same way.
Madden,3bra5d,Jr12785,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"It's been the same for years lmao. Either make him the #3 guy on the depth chart, formation sub or switch positions on the play call screen"
Madden,3bra5d,AdmiralLobstero,0,Wed Jul 1 15:41:16 2015 UTC,"I know other people have said it, but I am going to say it again. Let's say we are working with the Colts. I am running three receivers and want Hilton in the slot, Johnson on the right, and Moncrief on the left. In the depth chart, it reads Johnson, Hilton, Moncrief. I keep this because I want Hilton and Johnson in on two receiver sets. On three receiver sets, I go to Hilton (who is on the outside left) and put in Dorsett. Now I go to Moncrief and put Hilton in. Then go back to Dorsett and put Moncrief back. Now only in that set, Hilton will be in the slot. You just have to do it for every one you want to run. And don't try to do it all at once, you will never have time. Just when you head to run a play out of a set you haven't fixed, fix it. Or play Beckham in the slot if you like throwing there because he's better than Cruz. I know it sounds like a lot and would be helpful if EA made it so you could put them at the slot, but do this a few times, and it's second nature. After a game starts, the first time I go to that formation it less than five seconds I have my receivers set up."
Madden,3br9ue,Twittr,4,Wed Jul 1 14:44:38 2015 UTC,I don't know how many times my kick returner will run into the end zone on his own and let the ball hit him in the head and the other team will come down and pick it up and score.
Madden,3br9ue,rebelrowzer,3,Wed Jul 1 14:51:43 2015 UTC,Those both sound like a broken/glitchy analog stick. Have you tried a different controller?
Madden,3br9ue,hyperbolical,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:58:38 2015 UTC,The two that really annoy me are when the game crashes to main menu when exiting a game and when the play clock starts up (due to accelerated clock) even when you run the ball out of play. Makes managing the clock bloody difficult.
Madden,3br9ue,jg8809,2,Wed Jul 1 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"The second one is actually realistic: outside of the final two minutes before half and before the end of the game, the refs start the clock up when they deem fit after a receiver steps out of bounds. This happens in real NFL games."
Madden,3br9ue,muhalphabuild,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:36:27 2015 UTC,Do they? I know they start the play clock but didn't realise they started the game clock as well???
Madden,3br9ue,jg8809,0,Wed Jul 1 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"It's been an NFL rule for a long time, in order to tighten up game times."
Madden,3br9ue,drain_patience,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:00:57 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I've been watching for around 15 years and can honestly say I've never noticed. I do not claim to be an expert of the rules mind you, definitely a casual.  Surely if the ball goes out of bounds, there is an incomplete pass etc. it stops the clock as it is a dead ball. This is then only restarted when the ball is snapped. Obviously the 40 second play clock resets per play but surely this defies the point of stopping the clock?   Edit - I realise that I have stayed play clock originally, maybe this has caused some confusion. I meant the overall game clock, I know the play clock resets every play. I am finding on madden that the game clock is counting down when the ball is 'dead'. Is this a glitch or am I still wrong??"
Madden,3br9ue,jg8809,0,Thu Jul 2 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"The game clock does not wind down while the ball is 'dead'. Fumble out of bounds, incomplete pass, turnover, clock doesn't wind."
Madden,3br9ue,drain_patience,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:24:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's right, going out of bounds only stops the clock in the final 2 min of each half"

Madden,3bmkr0,bjkman,7,Tue Jun 30 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"Warning! Wall of text incoming:  I created a first-round West Coast gunslinger QB for the Vikings. I lead them to sweep and win the division at 13-3, grab the 2nd seed, beat the 49ers in the Divisional, beat the Panthers in the NFC, then lost to Denver in the SB 24-21. Second season, I end up winning MVP with 48 TD passes, 8 INTs, and 5,213 yards passing. We go into the playoffs 13-3 once again, to find ourselves facing off against the Chargers in the Superbowl lead by Cam Newton, who was traded off the Panthers for Philip Rivers and a 1st. We defeat San Diego in a blowout, 28-6. I go into the next season, and I find myself a 1st stringer... for the Chargers!? I check out the news and it was a 1 for 1 trade. Cam Newton for Timothy Redwater. I shrug it off after realizing I make more money here, and lead the Chargers to a 11-5 record, and defeat my former Vikings team in Minnesota Week 16, 14-3. We lead the division, but we only snag the 4th seed in the AFC, and our first game is @ Denver, who sweeped us during the season with the help of Brock Osweiler, Superbowl MVP against the Vikings. We lose the game in double overtime 9-6, and then in the offseason I developed my skills further, and we won the AFC Championship (now 2017) against 2016 AFC Champion Bengals 21-10. We head into the Superbowl, and I am finally ranked 93 overall, and I see my opponent. The. Minnesota. Vikings. Needless to say, I went ALL OUT. I threw it every time, I had over 600 yards passing, shredding their defense. I threw for 8 TD passes, and 3 picks. We won 68-14, with me becoming the Superbowl MVP.  TL;DR: Lost Superbowl year one, won it year two with the Vikings, traded to the Chargers and after two years threw for 8 TDs against the Vikings in the Superbowl."

Assuming your playing on the default rosters, here's some suggestions for you:  Do you like having a strong run game with short passes here and there? Try the Seahawks, Chiefs, and Vikings.   Do you like having a strong receiving corp with some runs if nessecary? Try the Patriots, Ravens, and Bengals.  Do you like a balanced team that can run and pass? Try the Packers, Cowboys, and Saints.   Do you like a team that is insanely fun to use and mostly relies on mobile quarterbacks and the option? Try the Eagles, Panthers, and Seahawks.    EDIT: Also the Redskins are great for the option as well."

Madden,3bj4ef,maddenfan,15,Mon Jun 29 17:25:03 2015 UTC,Pass interference was ridiculous last year. Messed up your coverage or route? Just run into the other player and knock him off his pursuit of the ball.
Madden,3bj4ef,StuntzMcKenzy,11,Mon Jun 29 18:23:36 2015 UTC,"Indeed it is/was. Slant over the middle? Linebacker just trucks him while the ball is in the air and no penalty called. I think while playing my CF i would see maybe one or two PI calls a season, which is insane."
Madden,3bj4ef,destroyer96FBI,4,Mon Jun 29 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"My CFM player was like Brandon Browner times 5, but I still didn't get flagged. Literally press them until they let go and then bump them 15 times during the route, if they do end up getting it i'll dive head first at them hahaha. I didn't get 1 PI"
Madden,3bj4ef,mastererrl,2,Mon Jun 29 23:04:27 2015 UTC,I have seen a defensive PI maybe once in countless games-- I see offensive Pass interference every 5 or 6 games but they never make any sense.
Madden,3bj4ef,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jun 30 10:33:42 2015 UTC,Seriously. The top guys strategy is swerve a bit to bump you off because the penalty won't be called.
Madden,3bj4ef,KiDeVerclear,4,Tue Jun 30 12:54:28 2015 UTC,...But it rarely gets called.
Madden,3bj4ef,StuntzMcKenzy,4,Mon Jun 29 19:16:45 2015 UTC,The only way I could actually get it called on me was outright tackling the guy.
Madden,3bj4ef,owlstronaut,5,Mon Jun 29 19:44:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of this idea. Using Fifa as an example, they removed hand balls from the latest edition. What was happening prior was that possession was changing due to a random event that was out of the control of both players. While some obvious hand balls don't get called now, I'll take that over the volume of shit calls that happened the previous year.  I worry that Madden will turn the same way - it's a genuine attempt by EA to resolve via including penalty ratings but at the end of the day, I think it's going to make the game a bit worse."
Madden,3bj4ef,Waldinator,23,Mon Jun 29 19:59:15 2015 UTC,"Not a big fan of this, if I'm being honest. Madden penalties are historically bullshit. I think they should work on getting pass interference right before delving into having three offensive holding calls a game, which is what I would predict."
Madden,3bj4ef,TheRealPeteWheeler,6,Mon Jun 29 21:37:27 2015 UTC,"Have you watched any videos/read any articles about penalties? The entire point was to overhaul it so that penalties would be realistically called. They're using real world statistics to give players ratings for penalties, giving them certain tendencies. One of the major changes is to DPI and defensive holding."
Madden,3bj4ef,MrFace1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"Very true, you can almost always do offensive pass interference with your WR if you want to"
Madden,3bj4ef,TheRealClutch18,4,Tue Jun 30 03:54:16 2015 UTC,Brandon Browner is going to be cut every year by every player who has him.
Madden,3bj4ef,mcorcoran3,3,Tue Jun 30 13:31:10 2015 UTC,"Still no fucking horsecollar, wow"
Madden,3bj4ef,BackstageChip,3,Tue Jun 30 10:34:39 2015 UTC,Every player in Madden 16 will have a penalty rating which determines how often they are penalized.  That will be based on real world data collected each week from the NFL.   that makes sense
Madden,3bj4ef,johnnynutman,2,Tue Jun 30 04:37:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, fix ""funds"" as well."
Madden,3bj4ef,NorthBlizzard,2,Tue Jun 30 04:52:54 2015 UTC,I thought half of those were already in the game.
Madden,3bj4ef,hrdcrnwo,2,Tue Jun 30 02:23:32 2015 UTC,"Also, wouldn't it make sense for them to call helmet-to-helmet penalties to make the hit-stick forced fumbles a more risky play? That is probably the most important penalty in the modern NFL."
Madden,3bj4ef,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jun 30 05:25:33 2015 UTC,Yes but the NFL would never let them.
Madden,3bj4ef,KiDeVerclear,2,Tue Jun 30 10:42:27 2015 UTC,"I wish they'd get rid of the false start penalty when I'm trying to get the other team to jump offsides. ""Alright guys it's 4th and 2. I'm gonna go up there and yell hut 60 times. DON'T FUCKING MOVE. If this doesn't work we'll just call a timeout"".  8 seconds later "" false start number 69. Still 4th down"""
Madden,3bj4ef,eyememine,3,Tue Jun 30 12:51:11 2015 UTC,"yes, this basically makes the ""draw someone offsides feature useless"" -- it is almost never worth the risk unless you plan on punting if it fails."
Madden,3bj4ef,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:51:25 2015 UTC,I am a Bills fan. I recall a couple instances where we have retardedly false started in that situation
Madden,3bj4ef,Ohuma,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:30:54 2015 UTC,"Of all the penalties they list, the only ones they don't currently have, to  my knowledge, is unnecessary roughness and defensive holding (though they have defensive PI)  •Encroachment •False Start •Offensive Holding •Facemask •Defensive Pass Interference •Illegal Block in the Back •Neutral Zone Infraction •Defensive Holding •Illegal Forward Pass •Illegal Touching •Delay of Game •Kick Catch Interference •Running into the Kicker •Unnecessary Roughness •Roughing the Passer  I have seen all of these, though admittedly they never call Defensive PI. Madden seems to be selling this as a much more radical change than it actually is."
Madden,3bj4ef,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:36:19 2015 UTC,penalty rating is dumb
Madden,3bj4ef,Ed_Reed_20,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:37:38 2015 UTC,"We want Madden to be as realistic as possible, but what we lose in the process is the arcade element, which for me is really fun. I take a lot of pride in being able to have success when I user control a player, whether it is my WR or safety. The worst thing that can happen is I make a good play only for it to be called back on a cpu holding. It's ridiculous.  Games should not be decided by the computer. CPU forced fumbles are another thing (hate those, too). Penalties should only be because of a user.  For example: When you user a WR and or a DB and blatantly pass interfere with the cpu or other user. Or when you're trying to strip the ball the user grabs the cpu's or user's facemask. Or when you get a great jump off the LOS to rush the passer the cpu could sometimes hold you.  I just want the CPU committing a penalty against other cpus. This has been my biggest pet peeve in this game for a while."

Madden,3bj4ef,newtothelyte,6,Tue Jun 30 10:37:51 2015 UTC,"I prefer more of a truly sim experience. Realistic stats, penalties, etc. It immerses me  more in the game. I appreciate people who want more of an arcade experience. Wish EA would just implement an easy toggle in game mode from SIM to Arcade."
Madden,3bj4ef,safetydance,2,Tue Jun 30 03:55:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of people do on this sub. Elsewhere a lot of people seek more of an arcade style game. There has to be some balance because if you have too much of one, you're going to alienate an entire fan base or the game will simply just become unplayable all together."
Madden,3bj4ef,Ohuma,2,Tue Jun 30 06:07:21 2015 UTC,"I am sure you can tweak them. I prefer realism, but I wouldn't expect too much of it from Madden. They tend to cater to fans like you and not sim-types, generally (see MUT, weak AI etc...)"

Madden,3bk473,bigtalkingbird,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"I have seen curiositys as well -- offensive lineman with Star development making almost no money -- cut. This one guy, Rakin Lamb, age 23 gets cut with 20k in xp, Quick development, 98 speed, as a corner. I don't get it. I signed Lamb and then felt it was too cheesy to I cut him and let someone else take him. But then he went through all of free agency with no offer!  I don't recall when he was drafted, but I will check."

I drafted the one who ended up being a superstar dev because the other was picked right before my pick. He ended up being cut and was a 74 overall with slow development. In fact, there were 2 other TEs who were 20 and 74 with slow development cut. So I assume if it does happen it's because they are slow. I think I am at year 2022"
Madden,3bk473,scottw5150,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, teams often cut rookies with relatively high rankings and slow development. You can actually find decent backups by picking them up."

Madden,3bh9cx,Twistify804,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:54:18 2015 UTC,"you can do less then that.  Send a bid of 0k, and it will tell you the minimum you can sign them for, then multiply that by 7, and give them a 7 year deal with the minimum salary.  The added beauty is if salary scales each year with the first 3 years being below well below the minimum and the later years being above the minimum.  If their contracts get out of hands, they regress, or you just don't want them anymore just drop them because they don't have any salary."
Madden,3bh9cx,SwissyVictory,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:48:56 2015 UTC,"I like to look at the salaies screen for other teams and see who has 1 year left  -- but you have to do this before the off-season -- so I can see speed, acc, strength, hit power etc...  Otherwise, unless you have some green bar love you just need to outbid teams which is easy enough to do since they tell you when it happens. I prefer to build through the draft, but I often let my fringe players go to market and am able to get them for less than their asking in re-sign period."
Madden,3bh9cx,mcorcoran3,0,Mon Jun 29 13:35:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% positive but I know that bonus is more important to a player then salary, and salary and bonus are more important then contract length.  I'd assume location, coaching ability, and need are all less important then that.    So its most likely they all add up to one invisible total interest bar, so if someone else has bid a little more money, but didn't have any of the other bars, but you did you'd probably win.  If someone has ALOT more money and no other bars, they would probably win."

Went to the Patriots where I led the team to a 13-3 record, where we lost to the Steelers in the Divisional Round. I threw for 3600 yards, 35 TDs, and 5 INT's in my first season. My second season I led the Patriots to a 15-1 record, throwing for 4700 yards, 51 TD's and 2 INT's. We played the Packers in the SB where I fumbled it with 2:50 left and they took the lead. I ended up engineering a game winning drive. My third season I left the Patriots and went to the Vikings. We ended up going 16-0 and beating the Tom Brady led Broncos in the SB. I threw for 4000 yards, 38 TD's, and 5 INT's. I spammed Peterson on the goal line and got him 1900 yards, and 39 total TD's.    Madden 13: SS Made a run stuff strong safety on the Jets. My first season was a blast. We went 15-1 and went to the SB. We ended up losing to the 49ers because of a Mark Sanchez interception though. I had 71 tackles, 6 INT's, and 5 FF. I won DROY and DPOY. I decided to leave the Jets and went to play for the Texans. We ended up going 7-9 missing the playoffs, but I had 95 tackles, 6 INT's and 4 FF. I stopped after that season.    Madden 25: QB online I made a running QB on the saints in an online league. Ended up throwing for 5000 yards, 49 TD's, and rushing for 2000 yards and 25 TD's.

Madden,3bdiw4,Tamsin72,25,Sun Jun 28 04:55:15 2015 UTC,Absolutely. My cousin has a very similar problem. He won't stop wasting money on crappy Ultimate Team packs and other similar RNG bullshit like supply drops in Call of Duty. I'm glad you as a parent are trying to prevent things like this from happening to your child. They may scream and fuss now but it is helping in the long term that you are limiting them.
Madden,3bdiw4,not1fuk,16,Sun Jun 28 05:20:41 2015 UTC,That's MUT for ya. Just tell him to stay off MUT and play other modes such as regular H2H or CFM. A lot of young kids want to get 99 overall players to do the work for them instead of actually improving their user skills and football IQ.
Madden,3bdiw4,emotionalgoldmine,2,Sun Jun 28 05:26:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks just to clarify, he was playing the Madden 15 game, is that the same thing as MUT?  Also what is H2H and CFM? If I tell him to play those instead will he still have access to the Madden 15? I'm afraid if he still has access to it he will use it anyway as an addict he can't stop himself."
Madden,3bdiw4,ethereal_pDot,9,Sun Jun 28 11:21:52 2015 UTC,"MUT or Madden Ultimate Team has been a mode included in the Madden game since Madden 12 or 13.   It's essentially a pay-for-content mode aimed at the collector gamer type.  In MUT you compile a roster of players from a collection of cards found in packs or purchased outright in the auction house.   These cards can be earned and not bought but the drip rate of the currency makes this a frustratingly long experience.  Your basic MUT team consists of players rated in the 60s.  The compulsion loop comes from the desire to have 99 rated players at each position which costs time and money....time if your patient, money if you're not. H2H stands for head to head and is a different, more traditional way to play madden using the actual teams' rosters.  CFM is the career franchise mode which also uses the real rosters and mimics a 30 year timeframe where you act as a player, coach, owner, or all three.  Both h2h and CFM are completely free to play and exist within Madden 15.    Both of these modes can be played online or offline, with friends or alone.  They also announced Draft Champions this year which looks like a free version of MUT that leans toward fantasy football drafting to acquire cards to build the team instead of purchasing and opening packs.  In short, maybe Madden 16s new mode called Draft Champions can curb his spending appetite while still satisfying his MUT card itch.  Otherwise there are plenty of ways to interact with Madden 15, or any year for that matter, without forking over ccard numbers and blowing wads of cash. I recommend you learn to play the game and start a CFM league with him where you each own teams in opposite conferences.  Then play out the season and compete for a Super Bowl run and hopefully meet in the big game.   Alternatively, start careers at the same position on different teams and compete for all time records and make the Hall of Fame.  Hope this helps!"
Madden,3bdiw4,avalonzero9,8,Sun Jun 28 11:44:01 2015 UTC,Take away his online access to the console and then he can't do that stuff but can still play offline
Madden,3bdiw4,mcorcoran3,4,Sun Jun 28 18:25:29 2015 UTC,"MUT stands for Madden Ultimate Team and is one of several modes in Madden. It happens to be a mode where spending for extras is possible and is a major source of revenue for EA. If he played Connected Franchise Mode, he would not have to pay for extras (yet, who knows when EA will start to suck up more revenue that way)"
Madden,3bdiw4,Moruitelda,5,Sun Jun 28 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I wrote a lengthy post about this to someone whose son got scammed a few months back:    You need to talk to your son about returns on investment, and possibly about gambling. People enjoy Madden Ultimate Team, but ultimately it's something he's going to spend all that money on and have absolutely nothing. The next Madden comes out in August. As the next few months pass, the value of his team is going to evaporate until they have almost no value. In August, most people abandon the old version of the game. Regardless, EA typically discontinues online support after a few years.   When I was a kid, I played stuff like Magic - I get the appeal, and almost none of it is going to be an investment. But then, most fun things that you buy don't literally disappear.   You don't need to spend a serious amount of real money to build a successful MUT team. You need to think strategically and be clever. There are some valuable lessons that you can learn by trying to play MUT without spending real money. But spending real money can quickly develop into a gambling/gaming addiction. EA (and other microtransaction game companies) devotes a lot of time and money into researching the most effective ways of programming people into buying more and more in an obsessive manner. They're good at it. But it's very unhealthy for the people who are buying.   I'd be very concerned for your son with that kind of behavior, and you really should impress upon him the fact that it will not only have no value, but it will literally disappear, before long.   Now, with that said, I hate that kids like him get taken advantage of by unscrupulous people. I am really sorry to hear that it happened to him. If he knows the Gamertag that the scammers used, you should call Microsoft and EA and report that person for the fraud that they're committing. But can you get it all back?   No. Unfortunately, it's pretty much gone. Your son is unfortunately going to have nothing to show for those hundreds of dollars he spent now, instead of in a few months. As a fellow father, I don't envy you the conversation that you'll have to have with him about that."
Madden,3bdiw4,switchn,4,Sun Jun 28 23:06:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sadly a lot of games thesedays get kids addicted to gambling. It's pretty fucking horrible that they get away with it on a technicality (I believe that because you always win SOMETHING it's not considered gambling, though I'm not 100% sure).   Yes, there is a Madden Ultimate Team app on the iPad with the same gambling feature. If you are looking for suggestions, perhaps change the Apple ID password so he can no longer download apps and will need to get your permission for any app he wants to download."
Madden,3bdiw4,switchn,2,Sun Jun 28 08:02:13 2015 UTC,"I don't buy violent game for my kids, basically they just play sports games like NBA2k15 and Madden15 and some soccer one. Does the NBA2k game have the same ""buy"" feature? That one has never given us a problem before. Are there other sports related games that have this gambling propensity that I should watch out for?"
Madden,3bdiw4,mcorcoran3,3,Sun Jun 28 11:26:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all sports games have a similar feature to what your son spent your money on. Fifa, NBA, NHL, MLB all have pretty much the same thing. It's sad that so many games are now doing this but they do what makes them money.  It's still only a secondary feature and you can still very much have fun on these games without spending money. Madden Ultimate Team to my knowledge is the hardest one to be competitive without spending money. Note that this is only for one game mode and you can still do stuff like career mode/franchise mode without any troubles."
Madden,3bdiw4,Rampantlion513,2,Sun Jun 28 11:32:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, NBA2k does have a strong feature where you can buy extras. In addition to the parenting issues, I would consider writing a letter to EA, or something -- this microtransactions are not only bad for parents having to deal with the costs of keeping their kids satisfied with their video games, but are bad for all consumers.   There is no reason why a child who gets a game should not be able to use all the games features without paying for special ""sneakers' or players."
Madden,3bdiw4,SomedaySeattle,-5,Sun Jun 28 20:54:24 2015 UTC,"So you're one of 'those' parents? The ""my kid can't play violent games because they make them violent"" bullshitters?"

Madden,3bdiw4,mcorcoran3,11,Mon Jun 29 20:07:30 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound harsh   But if your 14 year old son stole your credit card for any reason what the fuck are you doing on a forum creating a discussion about a game for?  The game is not the source of the issue.  You need a professional counselor, for him and you."
Madden,3bdiw4,Raider6601,20,Sun Jun 28 18:35:36 2015 UTC,Oh c'mon -- why not spend a few minutes asking for perspective? For all you know the OP is also looking into professional help. This is a reasonable post from a concerned parent and your scorn is unwarranted and unhelpful.

Madden,3bdiw4,Taxxorrak,-2,Mon Jun 29 09:04:07 2015 UTC,It's not scorn.  This is not the appropriate place to ask for parenting help. I'd be willing to bet that 98% of the users here do not have teenage children. I'd also be willing to bet that more than 50% of the users in this forum actually ARE teenagers.  The OP isn't even asking the right questions.
Madden,3bdiw4,kylerm42,4,Sun Jun 28 21:47:54 2015 UTC,You are sort of right. This is r/madden. People don't nescessarily have any understanding of parenting here.
Madden,3bdiw4,Raider6601,6,Sun Jun 28 22:22:42 2015 UTC,"This wasn't a thread about parenting. It was a thread asking about the game, game modes, and ability to buy MUT things on multiple platforms. /r/Madden seems like the perfect place for those questions."

Madden,3bdiw4,cejmp,2,Mon Jun 29 09:04:52 2015 UTC,And here we have a perfect example of why choosing a video game reddit as a forum for this sort of discussion is an exercise in futility.
Madden,3bdiw4,Die4MyTiggers,5,Mon Jun 29 22:45:47 2015 UTC,Your post implies there is only one way attack the problem.  I am of the belief the best way to attack this problem is from all sides.  I'm here because if a middle aged mom wants to understand the Madden game where else would she find the best source of information then the Reddit Madden forum?
Madden,3bdiw4,Milo_TheLegend,-3,Mon Jun 29 20:34:01 2015 UTC,"Why is understanding of the game needed? The compulsion is the issue. The poor judgement and devious behavior are the results of that behavior. The game is only a trigger. It's no different than behavior triggered by gambling, narcotics, or sex. Knowing how to play poker or what the chemical formula for THC is won't change the compulsion nor will it help solve the behavior issues.  Understanding the game won't change anything. The game didn't cause this boys problems.  Edit: I also noted 3 or 4 responses to this behavior in the OP that creates several questions for me regarding the response of the OP to this behavior:  1) Why did this young man still have access to any video games in the home after stealing from his parents?  A ban on the game while the game is still there seems spurious.    2) Instead of selling the game to recoup the losses, I would tender that it would be more appropriate to dispose of the game and add it's original cost to the amount of money stolen from the credit card, then establish a consequential behavior to pay that loss. Something the boy would not normally be inclined to do, such as mowing yards or community volunteer work.  3) The OP is worried that this young man can still access the game on his phone...why does he still have a phone? The console and phones would be the first things I would take."
Madden,3bdiw4,CorneliusHelius,3,Mon Jun 29 22:30:59 2015 UTC,Massive fucking overreaction. If the kid really doesn't have any other issues their parents could probably stop this problem quickly with a little discipline. Not everything needs to be done with professional help.
Madden,3bdiw4,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jun 30 07:19:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's a ""gambling"" problem exactly. But almost all video games now come with micro transactions sothese companies can milk every cent out of their customers. To be honest, the problem lies in his education. He's not yet learned to understand why he wants things. I would try to find a way to teach him opportunity costs. Does he have an allowance? If not, give him one and let him buy whatever he wants. Over time he will learn value. Numbers on a credit card account mean nothing to him."
Madden,3bdiw4,mcorcoran3,2,Sun Jun 28 20:04:54 2015 UTC,He needs to learn the value of money. Stop paying for his shit and take away whatever privileges he has now for stealing your credit card. Your son could fuck you over financially. Tell him that.
Madden,3bdiw4,grimofkings,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:33:11 2015 UTC,"Man, this is the problem with the ""micro-transactions"" system they use for MUT. It used to be you paid for a game once and then you had access to all its features. Now they try to add revenue in some modes by offering extras with give people competitive advantages (or a chance to compete with those who have more money).  To be honest, I am not a parent but I wouldn't assume this would indicate addictive tendencies. Again, a psychologist would know better than me, but this sounds to me like a 14-year old wanting to impress people. It is not a good sign that he stole from you but if there is a correlation between Madden and gambling, I don't know of it.   I would be more worried about gaming addiction than gambling addiction, but it might just be a 14-year old kid making a mistake. A strong misdemeanor, but hopefully a teaching moment for him. You are right to sell the game and be concerned, but I wouldn't assume the worst. Just keep an eye on him and if future moral problems occur (more stealing etc...) then consider asking a professional if this is a deep-rooted problem or just typical adolescent problems."
Madden,3bdiw4,Foxborough,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:50:26 2015 UTC,"Also, I am not an expert on the Madden version for mobile apps, but I know they are more limited in what they can do than the consule game. I would do some googing to see if there is a micro-transaction component, but my hunch is that there would be less incentive (or even perhaps no option) of microtransactions on the mobile game. But again, I would look this up. It may be the mobile games have no feature and could be safer.   Of course if he waking up in the middle of the night you could be dealing with a gaming compulsion and not a gambling compulsion (although it is not rare for kids to love games a lot so I wouldn't jump to conclusions yet). In which case, the issue might be his compulsion for gaming and not spending/gambling."
Madden,3bdiw4,wahmeister,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:02:31 2015 UTC,"Madden mobile has more financial risk involved, but more pay walls.  You have to buy ""cash"" through the online bank (which then you need an Apple ID or Google account), then with that cash buy boxes of cards.  Some of the boxes of cards cost about $40 to $99 USD.  Madden mobile is definitely more insidious with the ""easy reward"" of buying cards (and MUT is the ONLY feature), but you can build a good team with just coins if you have patience, which most 14 year olds don't unfortunately have."
Madden,3bdiw4,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:07:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty much any game your child can play on a console or on an iPad will likely result in some sort of incentive if money is put in.   If you're afraid of him spending money, you should consult with him about money management. If your child is willing to steal your credit card, I don't think it will be the last time he steals it unless if you sit down and talk to him about it and ensure that he understands.  As for addiction to the game, I do believe that there is an addiction just because of how Madden and other games are built. Your son must've been purchasing card packs in Madden Ultimate Team which is pretty much just luck of the pack. You just open packs and hope you get good players. Most of the time, you don't. You repeat the process until you get the card you expected. Couple weeks later and there's a brand new set of cards that are the hottest thing on the block and everybody tries to get them by purchasing more packs. It's just a continual cycle. This is also done on NBA 2K, FIFA, NHL, etc. Every sport game has the game mode where you build a team with packs.  Can you spend absolutely no money and build a great team? Of course. But it's a much slower process because you have to earn it and some of the packs do not let you buy them with in-game coins but only with real money."
Madden,3bdiw4,spoiLs7,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, it could. Everytime you buy a pack is a gamble and as most of the time with an electronically decided outcome, the game wins most of the time and gives you a bad deal for your money."
Madden,3bdiw4,EvilAbed1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:36:44 2015 UTC,I am curious since I don't play MUT and never will - how money do these packs cost?
Madden,3bdiw4,lookingforanOD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"I honestly wouldn't call it a gambling addiction. However, I think it is an issue you need to taken care of. Here are some things to consider.  I don't know all the details but one thing you have to consider is that at least on xbox one/xbox 360(maybe someone can confirm for ps3/ps4) if you perhaps buy him a gold membership or any game with your credit card, all the information is stored on the device for future use. I am in no way defending your son, but lets face it, he is 14... and it is pretty easy to push the purchase button knowing your parents card number is on there footing the bill without even having to enter the name, number, security code, ect. It takes a bit more to actually go into a wallet during the night, pull out the card, charge it, and put it back without feeling some regret... as you said he is a great kid. I'm not trying to defend or attack your son, im just trying to put it in a different light for you to see.  My advice to fix the problem... First, make sure that your credit card is not saved on the device for future use. Second, in order to keep it that way, any time he needs to purchase anything, go out of your way to purchase ""point cards"" which can be found almost anywhere, 711, target, walmart, ect. and give him those rather than your card number, this way your card isn't saved on the device. Third, If you really want to take it this far you could just keep him from having a gold membership, if he happens to be on xbox and that way he will really have no need for micro-transactions. Playstation is a bit more difficult given that the network is free. Worst case you could deny internet access from your router?"

Madden,3b7fz7,YoWarndog,6,Fri Jun 26 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm.    I'm not impressed at all with the look of the new game. If anything, I feel they are taking yet another step toward making it more of an arcade game than a simulation type game.   Rest assured Joe Montana football did not impact, even the slightest, anything to do with EA though.  That game was always known to be a mobile game.  One.... Just 1 single anonymous Operation Sports post said he was an insider and leaked this ridiculously impossible idea, and for some reason everyone on the planet lost common sense and bought into it.   It's like a Madden Rick Roll.     But back to development.  Madden 16 was conceptualized as Madden 15 was released. So the game was already story boarded.  Also, EA is always under attack by people regarding 2K, and that doesn't change anything, and that is a much louder voice.   Now for the really bad news.  EA won't, and shouldn't change anything about what they are currently doing.  They own the market, and have owned the football video game market since LONG before the exclusivity contract rolled out.  Even when 2K was a player in the genre, their game was a 2nd to buy.   In other words people bought Madden, and then later would buy 2K for a change of pace, or to check it out.    Even in 2K's price war of $19.99, they didn't even come close to Maddens sales.  People seem to forget that 2K had been in the market for 5+ years already. 2K5 wasn't something new. It was a known and developed product.   Anyway, EA and Madden have a renewable fan base. Every year, kids turn 13.  Most of us are not the target market.  EA could not possible care less what the <5% of the user base says on any Internet forum.  75-85% of their market is males aged 13-21 who buy the most games, and their parents buy the game for them.     And madden had been the best football game on the market.... Forever.  2K was the closest, and while they did presentation really well using the ESPN tie in, they did a lot of things horribly.  People like to point out the things they did better than Madden, which they definitely did.  But they also neglect the shit they did awful.    I run a very large madden website, but personally don't know that I'll play this year.   TL/DR:   Just kidding, read the whole damn thing.  I can't sum it up."

Madden,3b7fz7,lak3y,2,Sat Jun 27 00:54:14 2015 UTC,"I think the game will have issues, but I'm still looking forward to playing it, i definitely think they took steps in the right direction this year , and hopefully they will build upon this edition."
Madden,3b7fz7,kkimball,2,Fri Jun 26 16:15:08 2015 UTC,"People say every year that defense is better, ai is better, less cheese etc... there are some gameplay improvements over the years but not that much ...  Also, the Madden team wouldn't have been prompted into action by the threat of Joe Montana -- had Montana been a real game maybe future editions of Madden may have reacted to it, but I doubt it had any impact of Madden16. All I know is franchise mode gets worse every year."
Madden,3b7fz7,mcorcoran3,4,Sat Jun 27 03:31:36 2015 UTC,"TBH The only thing I dislike about Madden's core gameplay this year was :  Interceptions were too common, caused by the fact that receivers would not ever contest passes, EA clearly made defense waay stronger this year and Mobile QB's are too strong but they've been too strong even back in the Michael Vick days so I don't see that changing any time soon.  My biggest gripe with the game is the lack of polish and attention to detail that EA gives the game. Right now the game feels like a 5/10 for me but could really be an 8/10 if they paid attention to the little things, like giving me realistic games in MUT instead of a 20 min shitflinging fest that ends 10-7, making CFM main menu more navigable instead of waiting 5 mins for every screen to load, bring back more customisation in both player and team creation, and for god's sake, take Phil Simms and Jim Nantz out of the commetary booth, the commentary is atrocious and makes me consider gouging my ears out. Phil Simms sounds like he's literally brain dead and Jim Nantz's line are robotic and out of context.  Overall, the core gameplay is more or less there, and that's why I've sunk so much hours into, but as someone who plays alot of other sports games as well (mainly FIFA and 2k) the polish is just not there and I feel like Madden does not do Football, my favorite game, justice as a video game, and hasn't in quite some while."

The NFL official license is all that matters to me.  I've seen the videos.  Everything they added seems gimmicky and the graphics look the same to me.  I do like the new tackle mechanics, but isn't the one of the fundamental aspects a football game should have??  Why are they being praised for ""fixing"" this when it shouldn't of ever been a problem to begin with??  That being said, it's almost insane how slow EA moves to be innovative.  They've had ten years competition free to make the best football game in the world.  But, what do we get year after year?  Contentment."

Madden,3b8978,modrewgnu,11,Fri Jun 26 19:38:13 2015 UTC,Having Brady on this list is really dumb.
Madden,3b8978,Bad_Decision_Penguin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:56:56 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Madden,3b8978,PackersMadden,-5,Sat Jun 27 15:36:37 2015 UTC,Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  Which quarterbacks would you want on your team over Tom Brady?
Madden,3b8978,Bad_Decision_Penguin,10,Fri Jun 26 20:01:12 2015 UTC,It goes against the premise of the title which is 5 QBs to build your team around in a franchise.  You can't build around Brady if he retires in year 3.  To start a new franchise I'd take in roughly this order:  Wilson  Luck  Cam  Bridgewater  Mariota  Winston  Tannehill  ARog should be right about here   Carr  Ryan  RGIII  Geno  EJ Manuel  Foles  Bortles   Kaep  Osweiler  Brady is too old (costly) to develop and a year or two in starts to decline.  Plus he's incredibly slow and mobility is key for QBs in Madden.  I'd much prefer a younger player to mold and play with for many season.
Madden,3b8978,Bad_Decision_Penguin,-4,Fri Jun 26 20:34:33 2015 UTC,Russell Wilson should absolutely be on the list.  I think you have Bridgewater and Foles a little too high when you could go with someone who is a little older but still elite like Aaron Rodgers.
Madden,3b8978,Bad_Decision_Penguin,5,Fri Jun 26 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"RW is #1?  I agree, Foles is probably a bit to high so I edited my list.  And A Rog should be on there but... He's not really my favorite player...  Personal Opinion.  If you've played a franchise with Bridgewater or watched his development on the right team if you don't snag him it takes him only a year or two to get to 99 overall.  The last Madden 15 roster updates really pumped Bridgewater up."
Madden,3b8978,Ed_Reed_20,-1,Fri Jun 26 20:52:23 2015 UTC,In my opinion it would either by Cam Newton or RW at #1
Madden,3b8978,officiakimkardashian,2,Fri Jun 26 20:52:59 2015 UTC,I'm currently 7 seasons in with Cam in my online franchise with my buddy.    I've gotten lucky and have had RW and Cam as my two QBs in online franchises.

It was a feature in Madden a few years ago but its not a feature they're bringing back.  The title of the article is click bait, but none of you clicked it.

EDIT: > The ability to assign a specific player on defense to another team’s star receiver was something that many fans requested.  That being said, it isn’t something that should have been expected.  EA Sports removed that ability a while ago.

Madden,3b4alb,motel08,0,Fri Jun 26 16:24:50 2015 UTC,"Seriously, why do they take out basic and crucial gameplay aspects every single year? The game is not completely revamped to this years game, so why take out gameplay options? Oh right, to boast about it being ""New"" in a future game.   Madden will contnue to stagnate on innovation if we continue to buy the game. Until EA takes a hit to their wallets they will continue to pump out regurgitated garbage over and over again. To be honest, not only is EA at fault, WE are at fault because we continue to give them our money."

Sometimes Madden fans are the harshest critics of the game, but I think everyone would be a little happier to know that someone at EA is listening to us.   If I remember correctly, I saw that you relayed the pause glitch to someone who has the power to fix it, which is huge since it's been a huge problem for years. People like you are what Madden needs, and I think I speak for everyone when I say that we appreciate you going above and beyond by involving yourself in the community."

As for the pause glitches - yes - we've been working on ensuring these are fixed for 16. If you encounter any bugs of this nature please feel free to message me with any details you might have. It is a lot easier to troubleshoot these kind of issues when we have the assistance of the community behind us!

Madden,3b59f5,GPM640,-1,Fri Jun 26 04:48:09 2015 UTC,Should of been fixed for this version....
Madden,3b59f5,TheCard,0,Fri Jun 26 08:33:35 2015 UTC,An EA rep said that they wouldn't be able to push it this year effectively.
Madden,3b59f5,GPM640,0,Fri Jun 26 15:51:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, why?  What was the reason?  One of the biggest game developers in the world can't figure out how to fix the pause glitch effectively?"
Madden,3b59f5,TheCard,2,Fri Jun 26 20:57:11 2015 UTC,"Something with the existing netcode interfering delayed the fix. Then by the time they made the fix it was too late to update the game.  I don't think you realize how hard it is to find a bug in such a massive codebase. Plus they also have a lot of their team working on M16 every year, so that's a setback as well."
Madden,3b59f5,GPM640,0,Fri Jun 26 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not buying it.  Sounds like a cop out to me.  ""Too late to update the game?""  What?  The better excuse is that EA is lazy and is perfectly content letting a broken product ride for a year and just fix the broken stuff in the next version.  You're pretty bold to make assumptions like that.  I do realize how big a codebase for any game is and how pesky some bugs can be to fix.  But, on the flip side, EA is one of the biggest game devs in the world with an almost unlimited amount of resources.  It's silly to think EA couldn't fix this bug in a timely fashion.  But, hey, if my product was one of the top selling video games year after year despite it's lack of innovation, I wouldn't care either."

Madden,3b4j7o,Moruitelda,5,Thu Jun 25 22:24:47 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. Friends and I tried that out last year. All picked shit teams and just simmed the games. We only lasted I think 3 seasons before stopping.
Madden,3b4j7o,Rfwill13,2,Fri Jun 26 00:31:39 2015 UTC,Why did you stop? Because the mode isn't expansive enough?
Madden,3b4j7o,Rfwill13,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:36:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. After the first couple weeks into the season, we'd run out of FAs to sign then sim the season. Our teams sucked so we never made the playoffs (we had a rule that whoever made the playoffs got to play their games). We'd sim to the draft and then that's it. After 3 seasons none of our teams were really making any progress so we just said fuck it."
Madden,3b4j7o,vearson26,2,Fri Jun 26 01:48:16 2015 UTC,"Simming games is messed up. I have a CFM where I rebuilt a team, and sim all the games, they're up to a 94 overall and still can't even finish .500 because of their confidence."

I'm in the same boat here as many of the people and think CFM mode could be really great with some effort from EA, a few tweaks, and some bug fixes.   I really can't say that I gave FOF7 much of a chance but its mainly due to the fact that it was too complicated. You can customized everything and see complex stats of all of your players and opposing teams strengths and weaknesses and prepare gameplans accordingly. I think if I have the time I will go back to it at some point... But id rather be overly optimistic that EA will come through on the new game this fall."

Madden,3b4j7o,drain_patience,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:48:41 2015 UTC,"Okay. I agree that that is just another MUT with fantasy draft.  So you're telling me that the future of madden which took a year of development to accomplish is... Candy crush madden with a fantasy draft?  I just don't buy it. I have no doubt whatsoever MUT and the like exists solely for money and stupid people. But I also know they added way more than a fantasy draft to CFM as well as just the gameplay improvements.  It's as if so many people on here believe CFM hasn't changed since madden 13. It has. A lot. It is still playing catch up on what things they had to abandon on the wake of overhauling the entire game but it's literally only been three years.   In video game time, that's nothing. As in not much time to accomplish much. Just because they ""did it before"" does not mean they can ""do it again"" by simply copying what they did before. They have to rebuild everything back up.  I really do hate MUT and will probably never touch draft champions.  But CFM's particularly online ones have gotten better with each year.  Yearly releases truly hamper the franchise. If they only made a new game every four years and just released updates or even shitty downloadable content, it would be a much better situation for the consumer.  But I seriously doubt the NFL has any interest in that."

Madden,3b4j7o,jjw771,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:15:10 2015 UTC,"And after watching the video, nostalgia in waves. But honestly, we are missing coordinators, we're missing restricted free agents, and some iteration of training camp.  If they bring back training back, it will have to be underpowered. As fun as training camp was, it was ridiculous. It took a year or two to max players out.   The other two, we just plain need back. But did you see the gameplay? Do you remember playing that game? It was extremely simple.   Tony Bruno was nifty for a couple weeks. After a while, memorizing entire radio shows is nauseating. Something like that, only less repetitive and annoying would be nice.  Custom jerseys, especially for relocation, needs to come back before relocation even fucking matters.  And that's just what we are missing from that game. There's so much more we could sit here and mull over implementation into the game.  And have. And so has ea's development team. They're playing a massive game of catch up brought on by ea's own failure for like six years.  But it has taken very big strides toward being where we want it to be, all the while getting a simple cash cow and gameplay improving dramstically.  I have no qualms with being critical of madden. Or ea. Has a long way to go. But it seems like many in this subreddit retain anger from 2010 and I don't understand it.   I've been playing madden since super nintendo. It's had its ups and downs. We are in the midst of an up that hopefully doesn't crash.  They actually anticipated next gen systems well and that's a great sign. Ps3 and its fellow systems, they fucked it up. Bad."

Madden,3b5hy7,dabottom305,6,Fri Jun 26 03:23:23 2015 UTC,"Age is one of the biggest factors I account for. In my drafts I aim for younger players, and look for better development when I can find it. I do NOT upgrade their development using XP, the cost vs reward is usually marginal - I play as HC and use my points there to get bigger XP rewards for milestones and game prep for a player's position, and I only develop one or two players per season. I spend all my hours of game prep on those players, upgrading consistency to 60 first and then getting their key stats for that position to ~85+. I usually develop awareness last, because it's cheap to develop but heavily impacts overall, and I like to keep players around 85 overall until I negotiate them into a cheap contract that expires as they reach age 30-32. Once they're locked into said contract, if I still need to (I usually have a LOT of XP sitting as they hover at ~85 OVR) I up their consistency to 80, pad their key stats a bit, and dump points into awareness usually bringing them to a 95-99 OVR that's cheap and underpaid until they regress or retire."
Madden,3b5hy7,megahurt5,2,Fri Jun 26 13:00:35 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a good idea. I always have trouble figuring out who I'd like to develop and I end up spending a few weeks on different positions. I try not to spend on XP on AWR for my offensive players since I'm usually the one controlling them. This current Madden I was able to resign Lamar Miller in 2 leagues for dirt cheap, the other owners thought I put in some could, lol.. I'm going to be using Dolphins and Jaguars this year. I'm probably going to be run heavy this year to get my o line their XP then switch it up 2nd season, not sure yet."
Madden,3b5hy7,megahurt5,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"Awareness helps for certain positions, at least offensive line. I don't bother for my QB or RB usually, though. I typically start with defense myself, and developing offense through weekly milestones or XP from games. For example, I started with the 49ers and immediately subbed in a lot of younger guys - replaced Gore with Hyde, and younger guys at o-line, and put Aaron Lynch in at LOLB and game prepped him the whole first year. Then played a run first offense, where Hyde and my offensive line racked up XP and developed from milestones, yardage, TDs, etc... And Lynch turned in to a monster through game prep. After the first year, with Aldon Smith at ROLB and a developed Lynch at LOLB, they just trade sacks game after game. Though 49ers start off rather strong to begin with, it's the same concept for other teams. I ran a Raiders franchise the same way - stack your defense through the draft and solid game prep, and your offense will develop as you reach milestones and win games. One thing I did too in the beginning was sign some veteran or older free agents to fill gaps and offer some strength while the little guys grow. Another example was signing Revis for a year or two - you have to pay them, but you can easily afford it. Especially with teams who have the cap space to start (OAK), if you're smart and sign your younger or lower OVR guys to the cheap contracts you end up with a really unfair team in the long run."
Madden,3b5hy7,switchn,3,Fri Jun 26 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"I always upgrade development first. I rarely upgrade their stats until they have superstar dev. This is only for rookies, 28 and older I spend it all on upgrades, 27 is fifty-fifty."
Madden,3b5hy7,mcorcoran3,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:45:27 2015 UTC,This year depending on how attributes are set up I  think I'm going to spend the first half of the season on consistency.

Madden,3b5hy7,CopyCenterPhil,2,Fri Jun 26 04:10:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on position but I try to get stats like Mcov, Tack, Block shedding etc... If it is a WR I often add ACC which costs a few thousand but does't impact the overall much.   if it is a bench player and I ignore awareness (for the most part) until they re-sign, as it has the greatest impact on overall, and thus salary."
Madden,3b36wq,mcorcoran3,19,Thu Jun 25 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"Because EA doesn't really care about CFM in favor of MUT.   So many bugs like this have been carried over since they first brought in CFM.   AI in CFM sucks, on top of that you can barely run owner mode without going bankrupt in a few years. Relocation uniforms/names are horrible.   TL;DR CFM recieves no love. They have no motivation to improve it drastically, just change barely enough so you want it."
Madden,3b36wq,RaandyMarsh,3,Thu Jun 25 16:37:13 2015 UTC,I agree with you about CFM being neglected. I guess this is just another broken part of the game on the list.
Madden,3b36wq,CopyCenterPhil,4,Thu Jun 25 19:06:42 2015 UTC,I tried owner mode a few times. It was so dumb. Like I care how much hotdogs cost. Coach mode all the way.   The bears in my CFM always give up all their top picks. I sign the top two aging cbs in FA and trade them to the Bears for their picks every year. You think they would learn. JustBearsthings
Madden,3b36wq,makeplayz,5,Thu Jun 25 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"Coaching mode is stupid. I agree. MUT has ruined Madden. Micro-transactions are all they care about, thus MUT."
Madden,3b36wq,a0wner1,4,Thu Jun 25 20:33:41 2015 UTC,well you could do that to any a.i.
Madden,3b36wq,lucentcb,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"This has been around for a long time, so I doubt it's because of MUT. I've seen the PC be very conservative with cap since at least Madden 11; they always try to keep a lot of cap space available, which leads to some unrealistic offseason moves.  I like to rebuild terrible teams after several years of simming, and often times a 2-14 team is sitting on $50M of cap space and ignoring free agents who could turn their team around because they don't want to risk the cap space."
Madden,3b36wq,iamnotacola,2,Fri Jun 26 04:10:16 2015 UTC,My CFM was hilarious. I got 5 first round picks including the #1 overall. 5 years in and every single punter except mine (McAfee) had an OVR below 60.  My favorite was when Randall Cobb signed with me on a 1 year deal and refused a year 5 year $25 million deal. He later signed on a 1 year $2 million deal after not getting signed in free agency. I got Revis for I think $1 million.

Biggest move I made was trading Kendall Wright & a first for Josh Gordon. It's fun because Pryor has terrible accuracy at first. Summed first season (this actual season), went 1-15. Drafted LT & RB Rnd 1. Filled out roster with other guys (lotta OL). Went 7-9. Next year 9-7, made playoffs, lost the first game. Wanted to win, so made a huge trade: 2, 3, & 79 WR for Adrian Peterson & his huge contract. Currently 3-1 in Year 4. OL is amazing.   All in all, it's all about patience."

Madden,3b32ti,kolbel,4,Thu Jun 25 21:23:02 2015 UTC,I can't see any reason to think that the stats would be zeroes. Sims have produced stats for every Madden I've ever seen. I'd expect it to either:    Generate stats to support the desired outcome; OR Keep generating random games until the desired outcome is reached.
Madden,3b32ti,Moruitelda,2,Thu Jun 25 16:08:14 2015 UTC,I agree this is likely.

Really glad to see the Combine back in this year's scouting. Since I have you here, I'll say that my pet idea for CFM for years has been a hidden and variable development trait that makes it harder to value players so that trading becomes a lot more interesting (and projecting rookies' value becomes a lot harder).   Anyway, I digress. Thanks!"

Madden,3b294w,punchoutlanddragons,2,Thu Jun 25 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"Also, why do they have that weird 5 box loading icon that seems to jump around randomly?  I know it is small but damn, that seems to lag unless it is programmed to randomly light up different boxes.  I'm going with the latter ;)"
Madden,3b294w,wowcomma,7,Thu Jun 25 19:10:17 2015 UTC,So they can advertise ultimate team on the main menu.
Madden,3b294w,Crathsor,8,Thu Jun 25 19:46:18 2015 UTC,I think the UI is the worst thing about modern Madden; it is very pretty but it is full of very basic mistakes from a usability standpoint.  Seems designed more to sell the game than to play it.
Madden,3b294w,maxk299,2,Thu Jun 25 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah it looks great but even then, I have a hard time navigating to what I want.  It's like trying to find a specific link on a website that is just cluttered full of stuff with no good rhyme or reason to the layout.  But the UI and the attention to detail in the game/presentation are the two big downfalls to the modern Madden.  Just give us a text based menu that takes you to yet another text based sub menu.  They can add all the fancy graphics as the background.. just don't over do it!"
Madden,3b294w,maxk299,2,Thu Jun 25 19:08:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't know why there are animations on every menu screen that make it lag. I mean there is no excuse for the amount of lag they have and everytime the game has frozen for me I've been trying to move through a menu quickly.
Madden,3b294w,SGOTheNatural,2,Thu Jun 25 18:13:34 2015 UTC,Supposedly they read this Reddit. This would seem to be one of the easiest design changes and would make the game like twice as good.

I used to put hundreds of hours into franchise mode every year but ever since MUT came into play it seems like their just trying to get CFM swept under the rug.

Madden,3az742,ralphyb0b,0,Thu Jun 25 02:00:47 2015 UTC,"5 bucks for how many people? That shit adds up. Not to mention, I play on PS3 and the first screen is all about MUT, the second has a small box for CFM.   I bought this game without reading up on the ""new"" features after skipping last years game, and the year before I played for about one season in franchise. I read the reviews and they were generally positive. Instead of finding ""Superstar"" mode and ""Franchise"" mode I had to search for them.   I understand how business works, but the price gouging is a fucking abomination.   If I break my arm, and I get it fixed at a hospital I have to pay the bill of getting it fixed. I don't have to send payments every time I bend it or pick something up.  MUT is no different than any ""freemium"" game on mobile. They give you enough to let you play and have some fun, then you either have to grind and work patiently at getting a good team, or you pay for it. All it takes is one group of people to drop 20-30 bucks and have good teams, then it is harder to beat them online. So what is the alternative? You pay to compete with these guys. Its a cycle that is sickening.   Instead of having ""classic teams"" like they used to, they dangle your favorite legends in front of you on the front page of Madden 15. How else are you going to play as Dan Marino? Play mut and play mut and play mut and hope you get him in a pack, or wait and wait and wait and hope you get a deal in the auction. In which you'll need coins, so you play and play and play.   Then you'll see Progressive ads on loading screens, your coach in front of a HD gatorade display on the sideline(while all your other players are generic players), Players brought to you by snickers, head and shoulders and whatever other dumbass product.   I get the NFL is based around ads, but bring the realism to the game, not the ad presentation.   We aren't stupid, we see these ads and know that EA and the Madden team get paid for them being there, then they'll want you to pay for coins to have the best team(how else are you going to hold up against other players?) and of course, pay 60 bucks for the game.   So what is the upside? NEW PASSING CONTROLS!!! ALL NEW LIFELIKE TACKLES NO MORE PLAYERS ICE SKATING ACROSS THE FIELD!!  Madden has been around for over 20 years...you'd figure they'd get this shit fixed all in one game...Hell, 2k did it 10 years ago and they got blocked out of the market..  Its bullshit to be treated this way. And before I get, well just don't fucking buy it Ok. Got it. I've skipped years before and I will again. Every now and then I get an itch to play some NFL football and have nowhere else to turn."
Madden,3az742,one_pump_dave,0,Thu Jun 25 07:54:12 2015 UTC,"I generally agree, but they should just release it as a totally different game and not take away from development of the core football game. There are still lots of elements missing from this franchise that we had in games from 2005."
Madden,3az742,TD-Eagles,0,Thu Jun 25 00:07:18 2015 UTC,"Haha, I love when people get butt hurt over upvotes. Hey guys what a queer right!"
Madden,3az742,jazdk4,11,Thu Jun 25 04:40:41 2015 UTC,I hate it. I hate that it's taken away from legends being in rosters for offline use. I hate that it takes away from career mode since they don't make any changes to it. It's just a big cash cow.
Madden,3az742,captainsciencepants,10,Wed Jun 24 21:29:36 2015 UTC,"Aside from it being a money grab, MUT is terrible for playing actual games. I played for a few years and a vast majority of the games I played were 2-3 possession per team because the quarters are so short. Stopping people on defense was few and far between so clock management was most of the game and all the good teams could pretty much run the ball or throw short passes 100% of the time and crawl down the field for an entire quarter. Just wasn't a fun way to play. The allure of making your own team is the only reason it was cool at the beginning."
Madden,3az742,gd1230,5,Wed Jun 24 20:58:46 2015 UTC,MUT SUCKKSSSS
Madden,3az742,taydev1225,9,Wed Jun 24 20:52:43 2015 UTC,MUT fucking sucks. 100% designed for EA to make money. CFM is way more fun.
Madden,3az742,dr_superman,3,Wed Jun 24 22:58:57 2015 UTC,Tried MUT for 5 minutes and have never played since. CFM is the only way to play!
Madden,3az742,wowcomma,3,Wed Jun 24 20:46:52 2015 UTC,"Not alone. I was into it a little when it first came out, but I paid $60 for the game and was not interested in putting more $$."
Madden,3az742,LanePratley,2,Wed Jun 24 23:40:16 2015 UTC,I don't like it either.  It's way too monetized.  Cfm is the main mode I play with some regular online head to head.  I might like ultimate team if it wasn't so monetized.  I don't understand the appeal behind buying packs with real money.
Madden,3az742,SGOTheNatural,2,Wed Jun 24 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"Played every madden, never even tried MUT"
Madden,3az742,jp1704,2,Thu Jun 25 14:00:51 2015 UTC,Not a fan of MUT but I'm a HUGE fan of draft Champions. It will probably ease people into trying MUT out.
Madden,3az742,Ridid,3,Thu Jun 25 18:33:50 2015 UTC,Nowhere near the quality of FIFA's FUT mode. Like you said sadly it's going to be the mode that gets the most attention from now on
Madden,3az742,switchn,6,Wed Jun 24 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"FUT is great, I just think since madden has one league it will never be as good and personally can't stand it."
Madden,3az742,Ridid,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:25:55 2015 UTC,I've never played FUT. Why is it an advantage to have multiple leagues?
Madden,3az742,upallnighttogetLUC-y,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:08:43 2015 UTC,"there are just thousands of players and hundreds of teams of players you can build teams with to make FUT really interesting.  With madden its just the 32 teams and 1 league.  So you can make like 4 league hybrid teams based on how the chemistry system works and keep things interesting, where as with madden its just the same guys without the intricate chemistry system."
Madden,3az742,Philliefan12,3,Thu Jun 25 13:43:39 2015 UTC,"MUT has a lot of potential and I do enjoy it as it is, but it could be so much better. It's biggest problem (imo) is that everyone's team basically ends up being the same because you can play 99 overalls at every single position.   If there was a system that forced you to choose strengths and weaknesses of your team (ie you could only have a certain number of players of a certain quality, something like that) then there would be a lot more interesting choices. Do I want a superstar RB and good safeties or a great oline and good linebackers? As is if you spend enough time on the mode you have superstars everywhere, and so does everyone else. Great players stop feeling great if every single other player is exactly as good as them."
Madden,3az742,upallnighttogetLUC-y,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:03:10 2015 UTC,So... I assume that you will like draft champions?
Madden,3az742,drain_patience,2,Thu Jun 25 00:45:14 2015 UTC,It definitely seems interesting.
Madden,3az742,TheRealClutch18,0,Thu Jun 25 00:59:52 2015 UTC,"They know that cfm is what keeps this franchise alive. They have brought a lot of changes to it, they just had to strip it down when they overhauled the new game engine.  New users are easy money. But without cfm being the stud it is, this franchise becomes just another sports game and they know it.  MUT was really easy to install and run on top of the game engine they overhauled as to what you see today, and clearly with most of the e3 interviews mentioning ""football simulation"" a ton of times and with the additions of Sim a win and the like, madden is focused on cfm.  You guys just don't add technological context to what you say. MUT is candy crush on madden. It's fucking super easy to build and sustain. So it has progressed quickly as far as advances, but that's because the advances are stupid easy to get accomplished. Whereas in cfm, it is so much more complex and every new idea has to be intertwined with the current cfm set up, it takes s lot more time and work to innovate for cfm.  Also, they're playing catch up with cfm. And still trying to introduce new features. When they overhauled the entire game engine, they had to dump a ton of awesome features to make it work, on time for the release. They've brought back a handful each year, because on the programming end they are brand new ideas, even though they have been done with the old engine.   It is also hard to sell a new madden by just saying ""hey we brought back all the shit we got rid of"". So they bring completely unique ideas to cfm, very few but one must acknowledge that they do in fact bring one or two a year, and then also one or two things they had to drop in the past.  These guys make a game. Every. Single. Year. FIFA had a huge head start because the development on ps2 generation sucked for madden. And FIFA is the closest game there is in sports to madden, and it's fucking soccer. No playbooks. No audibles. No sub packages. No a LOT of shit the NFL has.  I get the frustration. I really do. Cfm doesn't advance nearly as quickly as the MUT mode. But MUT's advances are fucking child's play and easy to program. Cfm is so much more complex and in depth that every new idea and accomplishment, as far as the implementation, takes a long time to achieve.  As for answering the question, MUT is the candy crush version of madden.  Edit: TL;DR It's easy to have ideas for cfm. Hell, the development guys for madden listed off the same shit we want and even more ideas they are working on. It's a lot harder to implement them when you also have to find new things for gameplay(receiver And db interactions this year) AND come up with new ideas for stupid shit like MUT, or ""gametrax"" . Like we all didn't absolutely fucking hate gametrax and every single song on it every single year within a couple months. I can't wait to customize so I don't have to listen to popular garbage music, and make it just NFL films songs again."
Madden,3az742,andjuan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"People love making super teams on MUT, and since EA always releases new players like every week a lot of people are drawn to it. Trying to complete the never ending quest of creating the ""Ultimate Team."""
Madden,3az742,paperllamasunited,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:36:39 2015 UTC,I like the collecting aspect of it.  But actually playing games to earn those collectibles is pretty meh.  I wish you earned coins just playing franchise mode.  Then I could just collect the cards.  I pretty much want the old card collection system from the old PS1 versions.
Madden,3az742,kylerm42,2,Wed Jun 24 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"But can't you just buy football cards in real life? They aren't going anywhere when the new models come out, and as time goes on, they become more valuable, compared to ultimate team becoming practically worthless after one new model."
Madden,3az742,paperllamasunited,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:33:02 2015 UTC,"Shit, do sports cards still have value? All the card shops I knew growing up have long been closed, and the one trading card shop about an hour away is all Magic and Pokemon and that kind of thing.

Madden,3az742,switchn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:48:08 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, I was basing it on when I last got them about 10 years ago. I know you can still get them at Target, but I don't know about anywhere else. I suppose a market could be eBay."
Madden,3az742,paperllamasunited,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:59:56 2015 UTC,"I can't see why you'd want football cards in real life over MUT. That's about the only reason I can see people justifying spending so much on it. Who would want to collect cards you can only look at when you could collect cards and make a fucking team out of them that you can actually play with? It'd be awesome for collectors.  As you mentioned though, the fact that they become worthless after a year is a huge downfall."
Madden,3az742,switchn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:01:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you, but I used to have pretty epic battles with football cards when I was about 10. All the shitty players I didn't want to keep in great condition got used as football players; id often end up playing 5 on 5, and all you need is a small piece of paper to simulate the ""ball.""   Your idea of liking it because you can ""collect a team and play with them virtually"" seems off to me; you can do the same thing in normal CFM, especially since the trading is so wonky; I just don't get why anyone would spend any more money on an already expensive game to buy virtual players who are worthless within 12 months."
Madden,3az742,paperllamasunited,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:05:02 2015 UTC,"Well I guess the main appeal is that your fantasy team can go up against other peoples fantasy collections.   Can you imagine people actually still doing that paper ball thing? It's not really something people would do anymore. I'm not trying to defend MUT or anything, I don't even play it because the pay wall is ridiculous. I'm just trying to say I can see the appeal."
Madden,3az742,andjuan,0,Thu Jun 25 05:37:20 2015 UTC,"...wouldn't an online league be better than ultimate team? You're still building a fantasy team, it's ""free"", and the goal is still to make an ultimate team."
Madden,3az742,paperllamasunited,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:14:09 2015 UTC,I don't spend real money on MUT and I don't collect real sports cards anymore.  I just like in game collectibles.  It was fun on the PS1 to open a virtual pack after each game just to see who you'd get.
Madden,3az742,andjuan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:00:45 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh, so sort of like Madden 04 when yould  ""buy""a pack and get like a hidden team and stuff?  Edit: ""buying"" without spending any real money"

Also I would much rather play CFM than MUT, mostly because I think it's stupid.  Also, when I play a season or in CFM I want to play with the Jets, or with a fantasy drafted team.  FIFA's seems so much better, maybe if Madden made it like that it'd be better."
Madden,3az742,outrajeous21,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:27:08 2015 UTC,Not alone at all.  These shitty modes are killing sports games.  Edit: I also don't get the appeal.  I can just do a fantasy draft in franchise mode if I want something like that.

Madden,3az742,Ponder_Puddle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:24:18 2015 UTC,MUT used to be cool until you started playing against teams rated 83 and then the next thing you knew when they started the game everyone was fucking rated 99
Madden,3az742,switchn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:34:32 2015 UTC,"I use to dislike it and think it was stupid just like everyone here is saying. Then last year I tried it and ending up liking it so much that I gave my team away because I was spending too much time on it.  If you just want to play games, then MUT isn't very good and CFM is far superior, but MUT if fun for its other aspects.   Collecting and team building. If you like cards, card games, and collecting, then opening packs and working on your collection/building your team up is a lot of fun. MUT is also like an RPG. There are lots of challenges to grind out and achievements to work towards.  It's like any game where you do quests, save up coin, buy what you want, and then try out your new player in the game.  Slowing building your team up brings the same satisfaction as leveling up your character in an RPG.(Which is why it's different from a fantasy draft). So if you like shit like that, its fun. The auction house is another game in itself. Getting good at buying cards low and selling them high and making str8 cash hom'e can become very fun and addicting. Then after all of that comes the actual h2h gameplay, which is the smallest part of MUT for me. The quarters are like 3 minutes long and you have to face people who spend money on the game, so the teams are not fair.   TL;DR   MUT gameplay isn't good, you play MUT for the other aspects it has to offer. It does suck that it has become the main focus of Madden though."
Madden,3az742,LiquidFrost,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:04:17 2015 UTC,"If they removed the paywall (or heavily nerfed it) I'd agree completely. MUT definitely has its appeals but I'm not really interested in grinding to get blown out of the water by people who blow $100's on it. The RPG, Collection, and economic side of it are really enjoyable though."
Madden,3az742,LiquidFrost,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:11:40 2015 UTC,I ended up getting sucked in and ended up spending nearly 600 dollars to get a 95 overall team.   Played like 50 mut seasons but still not worth it at all.

Madden,3b2q23,CorneliusHelius,3,Thu Jun 25 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"I literally just signed him in 2017. Teddy had a season ending injury in Week 3, so I was left with two 3rd round rookies, a big-armed but slow lefty, and a mobile but weak athlete. I signed an Undrafted QB, and he seems better than the other two for my play style, but I decided I'd get a veteran insurance policy. I signed Manning, and I had him play in the 4th quarter of a blowout. 5/9 for 37 yards. I hope to never start him, but he's not a bad closer."
Madden,3b2q23,paperllamasunited,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:40:53 2015 UTC,"I signed him in 2017 as well, only much earlier, I think in preseason.

Luckily I didn't need him, but I got to the Super Bowl and was winning in a blowout so I took Luck off the field and put Manning in during the 4th Quarter. He went 4/4 and both my QBs got a perfect passer rating in the Super Bowl."

Agree that it would be better if it weren't true, but honestly there are about a hundred other things I'd prefer the devs work on.  Maybe once we have best-on-best, substitution packages, variable weather, and a playcalling system that doesn't lag and isn't held up by replays and other broadcast mechanics that are meaningless to the people on the sidelines, this could become a higher priority.  I imagine it's a resource problem; I don't think they want to spend much memory/processing time for the crowd, and this would add to that."
Madden,3b1fq1,A166524,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:13:11 2015 UTC,"I never noticed this but the crowd is a shit-show. NBA crowds have better animations, but it is still stupid because the same 10 animations are just multiplied a million times.   The worst is the sideline players during the game re-plays, where random players with random numbers (sometimes 400 lb guys wearing single-digit numbers) all over the place. Kills immersion because several people have the same numbers as each other or players in the field. It is a shame too, because on the cut screen shots they show your actual players."

I would love to see old draft boards, too -- see who was a bust, which teams had good drafts etc... Now the only way to see how another team drafted is to go to roster, check on the player card, look at awards. Then, the screen automatically goes back to the user team so it literally takes an hour to see a few draft classes worth of picks for a team.   Also, it is really lame we can't have trades documented beyond one season. It is still relevant to see how a team got an extra first -- I guess the only way to see this stuff is (offline) to load an old version."
Madden,3b0hwk,mcorcoran3,2,Thu Jun 25 16:30:42 2015 UTC,I actually write down the draft storylines because I need to remember who had a positive story (positive story = fast or star development). I am in the champsionship game and so far there are 15 stories. There will be 3 or 4 more in the offseason. I do with the storylines lasted longer (into their rookie seasons) and varied more. Now it is basically this: good story = strong development. It does save me money because I don't need to use scouting point to scourt development on the story guys.

Madden,3azcjs,6enericUsername,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:57:41 2015 UTC,"All I know - Is I hate the catching in M15.  Unless the ball was directly on target and in line with your current speed/line taken it was difficult to catch.   I miss the days where you could strafe as a WR - it allowed me to adjust to poor throws.  If a deep throw is off target, or it ends up being a 1:1 jump ball, I almost ALWAYS lose."
Madden,3azcjs,Realistik84,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"Watched a good video where they showed the risk/reward of the new catch mechanics. Basically, aggressive catch means that YAC are always going to be limited."

Madden,3azcjs,GrapeRello,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:53:38 2015 UTC,When did you start playing Madden? I don't think deep TD passes are nearly as bad as it used to be. The deep ball is pretty tough in Madden 15 in my opinion. But the agressive interceptions is really bad. I had to turn that slider way down
Madden,3azcjs,WeDemHawks,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:08:54 2015 UTC,I played 08 and skipped until 13 and have played all those.
Madden,3azcjs,sportsfan56,0,Sun Jun 28 03:20:41 2015 UTC,Umm yeah aggressive catching will be the worst thing to happen to madden for a while. At least Spec catching was reserved for the elite since it wasn't well known about. Being built right into the game makes more people know about it.
Madden,3azcjs,dej2gp3,2,Thu Jun 25 03:55:34 2015 UTC,When I went to Madden Tournaments back in 2008 the way we countered against spec and rocket catches was by putting our hard hitting safties at CB. We would let the WR catch it and then hit stick him in mid air to force a drop lol. Maybe that might work this year
Madden,3azcjs,switchn,0,Thu Jun 25 13:03:08 2015 UTC,It seems like YAC will be severely cut by it based off the gameplay. But I also expect to be able to user my DB more effectively. I can shut down most deep passing this year with user swat. People who are getting burned hard by 9 routes this year will probably continue to get burned because they don't play the ball right or will always go for the pick.
Madden,3azcjs,dej2gp3,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:07:17 2015 UTC,Hopefully batting the ball down is improved. I don't even bother with it anymore because for the INT seems to have a better chance of an incompletion anyway.

With the improvements and upgrades to the O-line, Yeldon and Robinson leading the RB's , the WR group continuing to progress, adding Thomas as a TE and Bortles having a full offseason as the starter things are bound to be better.  That's not even factoring in the defense, even if the first update will put Fowler on the IR for the year, they were in the top 10 in sacks last year that should give them a pretty good front 7. Telvin Smith is going to once again be a highly sought after player as he's now put on some more weight to help him against the run."

Young receiving corp is only going to get better, Tavon Austin is dangerous in the slot with his speed, Kenny Britt and Brian Quick are both solid on the perimeter, and we have Jared Cook as the red zone threat at tight end. We've got two young running backs in Tre Mason and Todd Gurley and plenty of young potential on the o line. The defensive line is monstrous with five first rounders up front, Lauranitis and Ogletree are solid at linebacker. Janoris Jenkins is the only legitimate playmaker in the secondary, but the pressure the d line can cause without blitzing linebackers and corners can afford more people to drop back into coverage to make up for it.

Madden,3aycid,slipnslide89,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:55:59 2015 UTC,Seahawks tragically. They will have 2 very tall CB's to counter act any aggressive catching that will go on.

Plus speed at LB and DL plus they have great pass rushers and also I am not even mentioning Marshawn and Russell.
Madden,3aycid,sportsfan56,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"Bears should be a lot better.  Better Oline, Recievers, and the entire defense is better.  Bills will be way better with McCoy & Harvin.    Browns will decline.  Johnny Football, and Gordon will probably take a development hit.  They lost their best receiver in Jordon Cameron.  Their young playmakers like Mingo, Kirksey, Benjamin are all getting older without any signs of improvement irl so I can't imagine them getting better stats.  Only noticeable additions are Danny Shelton, and Dwayne Bowe.    Saints are a completely different team trading away their top two receivers in stills/graham, picking up a new oline, and linebacker core.

Madden,3b11fy,SergeantFartbox,2,Thu Jun 25 03:09:04 2015 UTC,"Ok guys, here is what happened: I used my scouting points and discovered a 6th round guy who had virtually identical attributes and STAR development as Hardy. So I figured I could take a chance on the monster, knowing that I can get a capable, normal size back later -- so I did.   I still have yet to see a RB with speed above 92, although there was a 5'6 (!) guy who went 9th to the Texans who had 91 speed and 96 Accel. I chose not to draft him because his limited size made me think he would get crushed in short-yardage situations, but he seems like an amazing third down back.  -- but I could not justify spending a top 5 pick on a 5'6 guy."

Madden,3az6l1,BlackoutMurray,2,Fri Jun 26 00:31:07 2015 UTC,You don't remember potential ratings? Players use to have a hard cap as to how far they use to develop. For instance Madden 08 Aaron Rodgers use to have a C potential grade so no matter how well he played he'd never progress past a 79
Madden,3az6l1,SwissyVictory,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:21:47 2015 UTC,I remember. The way it was written it seemed like a current feature for 16.
Madden,3az6l1,SwissyVictory,0,Fri Jun 26 10:46:03 2015 UTC,"What are potential grades?  Do you mean the development trait?  A player with slow development can still progress and get 99 in every stat.  You get points to spend depending on how well your player does, which is basically the same thing but you choose how he grows instead of the computer doing it.    If you're just nostalgic of how it was done when you were a kid that's one thing, but its not like the new system is bad(other then confidence, confidence is bad)."
Madden,3az6l1,switchn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"I was referring to back when they tried to ""fix"" progression by adding a potential rating, you're right though that has been fixed. I'll admit progression has gotten a bit better, but it's also so easy to develop a player by upgrading their consistency and player growth trait, it just doesn't feel realistic imo, I had Mettenberger at 99 by year two, and now they're adding this new dynamic goals element, it just seems like they're getting too complicated for no reason."

Madden,3awcu4,DTaylor1x,35,Wed Jun 24 01:01:25 2015 UTC,"Look, Madden causes me a lot of joy, but I disagree they are ""going in the right direction."" To me, they are catering to more casual fans at the expense of hardcaore types who want time and effort spent on realism, roster-building etc.. For CFM they adding yet, more goals -- including dynamic drive goals -- where they tell me if Joe Smith gets  5 catches and a TD I get XP/confidence -- so instead of running plays that makes sense, you force feed it to a guy to meet a goal. And, instead of a ticker showing scores in other games, they have a ticker telling you how far away you are from goals.   To me, I want a game about football and the goal should be to play something close to football, not padding stats for XP. And now they are simplifying scouting to the point where one can see the ""real rating"" of 85 percent of the entire draft class.   They have made some fixes (random draft classes in 15, for instance). But it is usually one step forward, two steps back. I mean, we can't even get a customizable draft boards, player cards with team names, a way to look at league history (who won SB in 2017, when was Joe SMith traded etc...), new commentators or the ability to assign one corner to one WR (which they used to have). They are using their resources to attract new customers not please loyalists: they have loyalists by the balls because it is the only game in town. It is the same reason why Democrat's never have to placate the progressive base -- who else are they going to vote for.   I would not be stunned if, in a few years you can in CFM spend money for XP or special shoes of whatever. The game is not designed for hardcore fans but, as the creative director suggested, ""people who play the game 40 times a year."""
Madden,3awcu4,mcorcoran3,5,Wed Jun 24 02:36:56 2015 UTC,My understanding of in game goals are that they offer small amounts of XP and confidence and help balence out some of the sting of a loss. In addition I think if implemented well they could offer an incentive not to engadge in super repetitive play styles which make the game less fun. On the question of catering to hardcore fans a huge portion of the changes are aimed at mixing up how stale the game is at high levels. They literally have a list of money plays that the AI has been improved at dealing with. These include the pistol runs and PA end around. They also strengthened some of the lesser used runs and made the o-line AI not bug out against A gap blitzes and make offensive players play the flats better to fight the over blitzing at high levels.They supposedly have killed face catching wile allowing usering a WR to be more fluid.  It seems like they have targeted so much of the cheese that casual fans probably barely pick up on but make high level play frustrating and stale.
Madden,3awcu4,maxk299,9,Wed Jun 24 04:22:23 2015 UTC,"And now they are simplifying scouting to the point where one can see the ""real rating"" of 85 percent of the entire draft class.    That's WAY better than the current system.  If an NFL team went into a draft knowing as little about the players as you do currently, they would be racing to fire every scout in the organization.  The amount of time spent on film, workouts, drills, and interviews prior to the NFL draft is astounding.  Finally opening up things like the combine numbers is LONG overdue.  I'm a fan and I have that info, it's absurd to think that a team that might be giving a guy millions wouldn't."
Madden,3awcu4,Beelzebot44,2,Wed Jun 24 03:28:43 2015 UTC,"No, it shouldn't that would mean that NFL GMs would never pick bad players since ""The amount of time spent on film, workouts, drills, and interviews prior to the NFL draft is astounding"". 85% is way unrealistic. 15 had it done well just a few changes would make it perfect."
Madden,3awcu4,spies4,7,Wed Jun 24 06:47:16 2015 UTC,"When they pick bad players it isn't because they don't know how good they will be, it's because they were wrong about it.  They should give the ratings, but have some of them be wrong depending on how good your scout is."
Madden,3awcu4,Beelzebot44,3,Wed Jun 24 10:54:42 2015 UTC,A range would be cool. At this point you'd think we'd have the combine in the game.

Madden,3awcu4,SwissyVictory,2,Wed Jun 24 19:46:00 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel. While something's are slowly improving from madden to madden, there are so much they could do to please loyal fans but they won't since they have no competition and it won't change until we get a competitor. We either have to keep buying the new madden and hope that eventually they'll change (spoiler: they won't) or we don't buy the new one and vote with the only thing that EA will listen to, our wallets. But let's be honest, there isn't going to be enough of people willing to do the second option so we pretty much have to resign ourselves to option one. It's frustrating."
Madden,3awcu4,pdiz8133,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:23:08 2015 UTC,"I think they needed to re work scouting.   It makes no sense why I should have to scout a players speed, jumping, acceleration, strength, etc...If its measured at the combine why would I need to scout it?"
Madden,3awcu4,Redskinsthebestskins,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:26:37 2015 UTC,"I guess in real life if a team was able to feed a guy without big consequences they probably would and he would get a lot better.  It sounds like they are trying to add in better consequences for feeding one guy in 16 but even if they don't the easy answer is to just not do it.  Play the game the way you think it should be played, or join a league that forces you not to."

Madden,3awcu4,I_Am_Hank_Hill_AMA,8,Wed Jun 24 06:02:55 2015 UTC,Since 25 it seems like they are making the right moves. 15 is far from perfect but was a massive improvement over 25. It seems like with 16 they are being more responsive to the community's requests then I have ever seen them. They seem to have a vision that was lacking in the last few entries. I am causiously optimistic.

Both had A Throwing Power and both had Star development. And both were projected to go in late rounds -- its like they wanted these guys to be otherwise perfect.   They were both, 24, however, and I usually try to move on when players get to 30, so I think I only got 7 or 7 seasons out of the first. Am on my third season with the new one. I don't know what it's like to have a QB who was not A speed, A acc in the CFM other than year 2015 with Brady.

I don't even play online head to head, but often I am subjected to developments aimed to curbing their excesses  -- oh well, I do like that they are trying to eliminate glitches, but it does suck that totally realistic hot routes can't be called. I basically won't ever call an auto motion play."

Madden,3aufnj,emokneegrow,-3,Tue Jun 23 17:00:52 2015 UTC,how? if the QB wants to hot route he should be allowed to
Madden,3aufnj,kyojin25,17,Tue Jun 23 18:48:25 2015 UTC,Because madden isn't real life where things can abuse player AI.
Madden,3aufnj,Samwise777,0,Tue Jun 23 20:57:15 2015 UTC,"This is true, but the line between cheese and effective can be thin. I think players who roll out every play to find open men are cheesy, but you can't really ban rolling out ... . I also think players who use WRs as TE or even WRs as RBs are cheesy, though in most leagues I play WR as RBs are allowed."
Madden,3aufnj,mcorcoran3,3,Wed Jun 24 15:41:39 2015 UTC,Becasuse doing stuff like TE zig routes or slot WR drags exploits AI in a completely unrealistic play.

Madden,3auuer,wafflestoompa,2,Tue Jun 23 21:40:57 2015 UTC,"Yep it looks extremely similar to the current game.  He did mention that running and cutting seems smoother so that's nice to hear; and it appears that the stupid animations after the play are now done in a way that allows you to still call your play, instead of being stuck watching it so that seems like a nice change.  But if it weren't for those ""Possession Catch"" graphics popping up, you wouldn't be able to tell at all that it's a different game."
Madden,3auuer,Phrystile,3,Wed Jun 24 14:32:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly the same kickoff animations, same jump & clap animations, same kickoff sweeping camera angle, same menus, etc.    The ONLY thing that looks different is that I think the animations look smoother, maybe?

Madden,3aw9fu,bigtalkingbird,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:31:47 2015 UTC,"I traded a 99 QB who had 99 everything (except 92 speed, 92 accerlation, ?? consistency), because I found a rookie with A spd, A ACC A Throwing Power, 93 speed and 90 acc, A throwing power and Star Development.   I don't have a verdict yet -- still in progress. I will, however, need to make a big decision on if, and how to re-sign this new QB. He is up to a 99 and is killing it, but he was a 24 year old rookie, so he will be 28 when his second contract starts. If I game him a 6 year deal he will start to decline half-way into his second deal. I could franchise him, twice.   Also, I am 11 years in and have only seen A spd, A acc QBs twice -- drafted them both times -- so who knows if I can replace him."
Madden,3aw9fu,mcorcoran3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:45:50 2015 UTC,"My 1st overall QB was out for the season in his rookie year after getting injured in his 3rd game, the backup got a semi long term injury a few weeks later (5+ week injury). There was nobody I wanted in FA or on the block, I ended up trading 2 4th's and a 6 for Colt McCoy to keep my playoff hopes alive... Threw 1 td and 14 int's and I missed out on the playoffs... The next season he made up for it when my starter got concussed in the conference game, Colt threw 3 td's and was clutch as fuck."
Madden,3autdv,ralphyb0b,5,Tue Jun 23 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"I often do the same thing with CFM. Sliders do not matter as the game has its own sim engine. As far as strategy goes, I almost never pick up OL in free agency. Save it for the draft because it is definitely the position with the best prospects. You can easily get an OT wit 90 run block and 80 pass block in the first round, or a guard with similar stats in the 3rd round. Awareness is now a huge stat in the game so be sure to upgrade it on young players. Just FYI, there are going to be some unrealistic stats when you sim. For some reason, the game thinks that only top 10 running backs can get 4 ypc"

I was planning on playing every game, but as soon as Teddy went down during the 1st season, I simmed the rest. He's proceeded to get injured every year, so it's really turned into a sim franchise.   Building a team that should win the Super Bowl is easy. During the last stage of free agency, any players without offers will typically sign any deal, so I've signed guys like Desmond Trufant and Alex Ogletree to one year deals with no bonus; best scenario, I have to cough up cash the following year to pay them. Worst scenario, I cut them if no trade partner is there. Then I scout only intangibles, and can scout a good chunk of the prospects.   On paper, I should be going 13-3, but I usually end up losing 4 games due to sim conditions. Also, from simulation, I've never reached a Super Bowl, always a loss in the divisional round."
Madden,3autdv,CopyCenterPhil,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"Sign every cheap DB in Free agency and trade them to terrible teams for draft picks. For some reason the computer drastically overvalues cbs. Also, if you feel you have a good group and they just aren't winning, you may need to intervene. Sometimes, I will start the game and supersim till the end, if they are losing in the 3rd I take over and get the W. This will boost everyone's confidence and ratings. When scouting, scout INT. Only draft Bs and Cs. QB / RB / OL / DE / DT / CB / FS and SS - Bs are the studs (usually) - WR / MLB Cs are the studs (Bs are rare at these positions) ROLB / LOLB are tough, I haven't figured out how to find a stud.... Just draft OLBs high and hope for the best."

Madden,3aryri,Danterandal,22,Tue Jun 23 03:19:01 2015 UTC,Comments like this are hilarious to me. Everyone on the 2k subreddit is begging for EA to bring NBA Live back to full force because they are sick of 2k's basketball games. Everyone on the madden sub wants 2k to be making the football games.  The grass is always fucking greener.
Madden,3aryri,Die4MyTiggers,6,Tue Jun 23 04:21:45 2015 UTC,"The problem  is the lack of competition. Both madden and 2k bball games are fun, but they could very easily be much, much better."
Madden,3aryri,huisinga24,4,Tue Jun 23 15:57:01 2015 UTC,The fact is Madden has gone fucking stale. NBA2k has gone fucking stale. They both need to compete against each other like the old days.
Madden,3aryri,TD-Eagles,2,Tue Jun 23 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"People want competition which keeps developers on their toes -- its not about the color of the grass, it is about developers having incentive to grow and develop."
Madden,3aryri,mcorcoran3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:53:33 2015 UTC,"Well said. In general I don't think people grasp the difficulty of game development. People were hoping JM16 would swoop in and save the day only to realize that making a quality football game is incredibly hard. People forget how many terrible gam ebreaking glitches that used to be in the game (WR motion glitches, juke glitch, freeze glitch, etc) that EA has fixed. The game is so much better than in years past. When they improved the graphics...people complained about the gameplay, they work on the gameplay now people are complaining it, ""looks the same"". There is only so much you can do in 8 months of development."
Madden,3aryri,SGOTheNatural,3,Wed Jun 24 12:43:20 2015 UTC,It's not a simple thing to implement. Devs discuss it in this interview here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myPj6VM-w8Q They are working on it.
Madden,3aryri,SGOTheNatural,3,Tue Jun 23 02:19:37 2015 UTC,"They mastered this technology over a decade ago. You can't tell me that 2 consoles later, they still haven't figured out how to recreate items they had back in the early 2000's."
Madden,3aryri,ralphyb0b,0,Tue Jun 23 19:29:12 2015 UTC,"They had it in the game on PS2. Maybe instead of implementing a broken physics engine they could have focused on fundamental things, like blocking and AI."
Madden,3aryri,Tubbier-Wombat,14,Tue Jun 23 03:27:13 2015 UTC,"How is blocking and AI more ""fundamental"" than physics itself?"
Madden,3aryri,SGOTheNatural,-11,Tue Jun 23 04:14:39 2015 UTC,It's more that the physics are broken. They don't work and it's hardly a physics system. Good blocking and AI would more positively impact the game than physics.
Madden,3aryri,Tubbier-Wombat,2,Tue Jun 23 04:36:15 2015 UTC,"You're saying that blocking and AI are worse now than they were on the PS2?  I complain along with most guys about the hundred little things wrong with Madden, but I don't think I'd go that far.  I think it's way better now on both counts, especially since we're actually seeing AI now instead of scripted animations."

On the 360, games like Red Dead, Skyrim, Witcher 2, and GTA 5 have released.   The blocking wasn't an issue in All-pro 2k8, a game released 7 years ago. To say that it's okay they don't have one of the most important things in football at a decent spot isn't nitpicking."
Madden,3aryri,Tubbier-Wombat,3,Tue Jun 23 13:09:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Madden supporter. I only seem that way because of how much you hate it. It's a mediocre game through and through.    And other than Red Dead, the other games were poor in gameplay and had a lot of bugs, while being propped up by great stories. On top of that, a few of those games had a huge budget.     Either way, I just feel sympathetic towards devs because they're taking the brunt of the hate even though the root cause is by the management."

Madden,3aryri,drain_patience,-1,Wed Jun 24 15:51:55 2015 UTC,"They were able to do it within the old system because it was within the old physics engine. Which was simple and was changed because it wasn't as realistic as it could be, which it is in fact much better now.  If you watch the video, the fact that it's a yearly release and they have a huge list of things to implement has hindered their ability to put the bonus, little things in. Such as a lock on option.   Why you think the lock on option is so simple is beyond me. Before I even heard ea respond to the question, it seemed it would be difficult to accomplish with just auto hot routing the defensive player every play and fucking up the defensive playbooks and plays where it'd be ridiculous easy to force defenses into having NO secondary on one side of the field.  Explain to me or anyone how they should do it, since you believe it is so simple. And how you would perfect it within a year.  It does make you a douchebag: You've ignored that the game was completely overhauled, physics and all when they brought in the connected careers aspect. You've ignored all the features that they had to bring back after the overhaul, as well as all the major changes that were dreamed up years ago when they first implemented the new physics engine that took years to develop.  You're a douchebag because you don't understand context. What're you comparing Madden's development to? Some RPG? Gets put out once every five years, with a sole focus on developing the new game. They don't have to worry about putting out a new game next year with some minor overhauls to keep it from being a simple roster update. They don't dedicate any time to that. And they still won't have 22 fucking integral characters with around 1000 unique animations for each every one. They will have two or three and every other character will either exist in cut scenes only or have two or three lines of repeated dialogue.  Would you like to compare sports games? You mean drive to the hoop with the best player and hit an easy shot ball? Or pitch and hit ball with a bunch of super far away shots with every other part of the sport? Or maybe hockey/soccer, where there's a handful of defensive alignments, and everyone just chases an object and tries to slam it into a net?  By the way? All those sports games go years wwithout major overhauls, and the two or three years they do overhaul it they literally add nothing new because their sales don't matter. NBA, MLB, NHL, FIFA, all just happy to have a video game. The NFL demands one and knows their brand alone would sell more than any of those other games, in the biggest markets.  So yes: you're a douchebag because instead of enjoying the game and wishing it had a feature you like, you bitch like you're entitled to madden being light years ahead of the entire industry and being a perfect simulation of football when we can't even master simple fucking RPGs."
Madden,3aryri,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:24:35 2015 UTC,"So, someone disagrees with you on a game and you call them a ""douchebag""? Way to encourage critical dialogue.  Look, since you are a sycophant for the game doesn't mean people should stop clamoring to make the game better -- yours and others complacency is one of the reasons Madden has regressed so much since 2005 or so."
Madden,3aryri,mcorcoran3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"Further, he isn't asking Madden to be light years ahead, he is asking them not to remove stuff they have done for years. That is not being entitled, it is being a thoughtful consumer."

Madden,3aryri,SGOTheNatural,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:52:01 2015 UTC,It was incredibly broken. DB followed the WR in a twins/trips set and left gaping holes on the other side or broke the other defensive assignments.

Scenario: I run the ball and regain control of the team with 12 seconds left in the game in field goal range. I intend to call a time out with 3 seconds left to kick a game ending field goal. A replay starts and I can't see the game clock. I don't know when to call the time out so I err early and end up calling it with 7 seconds left. Field goal is good. Now I have to kick off and if some miracle of a KR TD happens I'd have been furious, luckily it didn't.   Madden pls.   Also, what happened to the wind indicator? Sometimes I'm on the edge of FG range and have no clue if the wind is at my back...

I really wish 2K would make an NCAA game."
Madden,3arw0s,kylerm42,2,Wed Jun 24 00:04:41 2015 UTC,I'm with you dude. It's been the exact same boring commentary year in and year out. It's just so dull now I can't even stand it. And I can just keep going on about how this franchize sucks but I don't feel like writing a dictionary sized book right now. There's no originality anymore and seeing this gameplay helped me realize this is the last staw.

I mean they could at least change that so it at least looks like a new game. The only thing that seems to have changed is the QB intro presentation. Other than that, it's Madden 15. I will probably still get it though, so I will quit my whining, at least we are getting Trax back. Finally...."

Madden,3apnsu,weaksauce85,8,Mon Jun 22 16:09:22 2015 UTC,A draft board would allow you to rank. It would be ideal to set your board to pick highest ranked as well since not all 32 can make each draft.

Madden,3apwtm,modrewgnu,2,Mon Jun 22 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"There are actually a million money plays to beat cover 3. The reason why cover 3 can seem so dominant is because people don't try hard enough to understand the concepts and logic behind plays, relying on so called ""money plays"" instead.  For example, a good flood concept should kill cover 3. Slant flats ruin cover 3. Drive concepts ruin cover 3. Texas concepts ruin cover 3. Smash concepts ruin cover 3. You just have to realize that Dinking and dunking can easily win you games, and most of these concepts will do this.   In fact, the patriots abused the shit out of the slant flat concept because of how effective it is against cover 3 in the super bowl , that's why Brady kept throwing so many short passes. It just works. The Seahawks failing to adjust and over-relying on this was their downfall.  /rant"
Madden,3apwtm,v66fender66v,0,Mon Jun 22 22:29:15 2015 UTC,"Best zone beater play I've ever found in madden is the shotgun Corner Strike.  Both outside Receivers run the corner strike, slot runs the post and your running back and tight end are offset on each side of the QB.   I set the TE and RB to block so you have the time for the play to develop and then I hit whichever outside guy breaks the best at the top of the Go route portion of the route.  Sometimes if the safety's cheat your slot can split and be wide open down the middle.  It's almost always open for a clean 15 yard gain minimum."
Madden,3ap756,mcorcoran3,4,Mon Jun 22 11:14:12 2015 UTC,It's for breaking tackles. Trucking is for running through defenders for an extra yard or two.

Madden,3ap756,GangBangMountain,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:27:18 2015 UTC,"Good idea, although I still think the physical will be A for both of them as most RBs clock out at 92 speed (for CPU generated drafts) and they both have A for almost everything (accept HB A has B agility, D elusiveness , while B has A agility, B elusiveness.   I really would love to have this 6'5 monster with A spd A ACC, but it is a risk because 1) he goes early so I will have to trade a lot of draft capital to get him; 2) he only has D elusiveness and B agility; and 3) he is 23, as opposed to 21."

Madden,3am5zs,switchn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way. Bonus money is guaranteed, even if you cut him the day after the contract is accepted. The base salary is not.

Madden,3am5zs,dirty_drawlz21,2,Sun Jun 21 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"The wording always confused me when I first started. You'd think that the bonus is the one that's given if they manage to stay on the team, and the base salary is guaranteed."

Even after the season starts and they remain unsigned, they won't take the risk of making their money by staying on the team. They would rather get paid for accepting a contract.  I'm waiting for Madden to let us designate when bonus' come out. OTA's, First day of season, day after last day of season, etc.... Would be interesting in structuring."
Madden,3am5zs,External12,2,Sun Jun 21 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, another thing they need to fix is guaranteed salary vs dollars. Its only a big deal with existing contracts, but in Madden you can cut Jay Cutler with no cap penalty, yet in real life has tons of dead money.   Lastly, they should allow some type of restructure/hold-out scenario. Old Madden's had hold-out, but it was basically nothing more than a player sitting out until you caved. But it would be cool if in the off-season there was a stage ""the following players want are threatening to hold out if you don't restructure,"" and you can play a game of chicken. Maybe they miss training camp and lose confidence .. maybe they sit out all year etc...  Probably asking too much though .. we can't even get new color analyst"

Madden,3apwls,danhatab,9,Mon Jun 22 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"This is the most talked about topic on this subreddit. Odds are, nobody is going to make a game that isn't NFL licensed. Backbreaker, Blitz, and 2k AP-2008 all tried and nobody bought them. The cost of making the product isn't worth it if nobody is going to buy.   The truth is, the money making market for Madden are the 13 year olds who want to play with THIER team and the players they know.   Madden 15 was a huge step in the right direction. Does it have its flaws? Of course. But graphically and even gameplay wise it's the most fun I've had in a long time.  15 was the groundwork for the next few upcoming maddens and that's fine for me. They made a big step and I'll let them make little ones to improve it, which they're doing so already."
Madden,3apwls,JohnnieBoah,2,Mon Jun 22 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong madden is a fun game is just there's too many flaws and every year they only fix and introduce very little when they can easily add more. The problem that everyone has is that they release the same game every year with small improvements and it's not worth the money.   Blitz is just a arcade game, the NFL eventually wanted it stop being made because how violent it was. 2k all pro was good too but there was no customization and no one like to play without NFL teams.  Backbreaker was a great football game I thought personally, for a first build of course, I always wished madden would buy them out and use there gameplay. The physics is great, literally no plays and tackles are going to be the same. And the passing was much more realistic, highlight a player before being able to throw was great, it's how passing should be. Yeh it was difficult to pass, but passing is difficult and football is a difficult sport, madden likes to make things easier each year for beginner players. Backbreaker could have had a real bright future if they made a second football game added and fixing the flaws in the first game, because the realism they had gameplay wise of football was very good"
Madden,3apwls,drain_patience,4,Mon Jun 22 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"What you want is two maddens; one that focuses on improving players' experiences from the quarter century of gaming they've already experienced and making it challenging and more in depth every single year.  And another that dumbs it down so 13 yo kids don't rage quit after two days of playing because they're 25 years behind the learning curve.  That will never happen, and so madden is a compromise.  The older gamers have plenty of new tweaks to master each year, and the newest members aren't completely incompetent so much so they never play the game ever again.  I want to live in a perfect world, too, my friend. But I don't make post after post bitching that I don't."

Madden,3apwls,drain_patience,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:19:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe but probably not unless someone else competes. The NFL doesn't care about football gamers, they care about money which madden brings in yearly. Until madden gets competition and starts losing some money, the NFL will then reconsider expanding the license or madden will have to eventually have to put out top notch football games"
Madden,3apwls,JohnnieBoah,2,Mon Jun 22 19:28:31 2015 UTC,"Yearly release was his biggest point. Madden isn't a bad game, it's just not as good as many hope it to be, especially seeing games that seem better.   I would argue there isn't a better sports game around, considering other sports are much simpler in scope. Soccer? Literally program a bunch of guys to run around and kick a ball. Basketball? Five guys per team, and EVERY SINGLE basketball game ever is take your best player, drive to the hoop, hit an easy shot. Hockey? Soccer with less players. Baseball? Throw all your programming into hitting and pitching, because everything else is moving a generic and tiny stickman to where the ball will land.  Granted, each of these games is slightly more complex. You can choose between two or three different alignments in soccer and hockey. Basketball? Pick and roll and zone or man defense. Baseball? Literally change how your outfield lines up.  Now compare that with football. I don't even have to for you. I could write a three page article on just audibles and hot routes.  The graphics and mechanics are overhauled every three or four years. Because it takes that long to even come close to perfecting them within all the schematic necessities of the sport.   While RPGs, or any other type of game, takes two or three years before they even come out with a new game.  And most of the shit this subreddit thinks madden needs is absolutely stupid shit. Sim-a-win for cfm's was much needed. It got fixed. A lot of stuff gets fixed. The running game is light years ahead of where it used to be, but still needs to be perfected. The receiving animations got better in M16.  That's not even talking about the stupid nonsense we see here daily. Like how for years, everyone claimed that the game was too easy, defense was pathetic, etc. So they overhaul it and at least make zone coverages effective. Players in coverage are much more realistic and anticipatory. And now every fucking day on here people bitch that players in coverage are 'god moding' and they can't play a game without throwing 5 interceptions.  In reality half of the passing game is mental and people like Peyton dominate. But he physivally gets pressured, has to physically throw the ball, has to find space in the pocket, has to find the open guy. If you play this game with any regularity, you should be able to figure out the mental aspect within a few months and dominate through the air, if you want realistic attributes for your players.  CPU qbs who throw 20/21 on you, every single game? Yeah, you're on all madden or some other level you aren't good enough for. That shit doesn't happen to me or most madden players I know. Only you Wendy whiners.  I personally hope it stays as just madden as the franchise has carried the NFL name more than adequately. Are there flaws? Yeah. Which get fixed. Not every fucking year. Because that is impossible.  This idea that madden developers just lay back and collect cash completely ignores two important things: Madden has dramatically improved every three or four years. Which is the normal timeline for most games. The NFL puts way more pressure on ea than a competitor ever could, being insanely wealth-thirsty.  Madden can't just say fuck it, let's overhaul our entire game system anytime it wants like baseball or hockey or other games, they have to implement their changes over time whilest still offering quality products, unlike other sports games which don't sell nearly as much and can afford to put out complete duds to buy time for true innovation because no one consistently buys that shit anyway.  TL;DR This is a long, rambling rant about how this whole subreddit is almost entirely compiled of gaming hipsters who don't appreciate the fact that madden is the best sports game there is. And because it is, they can only complain that the game isn't lightyears ahead of the entire fucking industry, despite being plagued with having to put out yearly releases that all you hypocrite douchebags buy just to bitch about."

Madden,3apwls,CM_Hooe,2,Mon Jun 22 21:37:29 2015 UTC,"I've had to do that rant more times than I'd like, but it really infuriates me that the bulk of the posts in this subreddit are just people shitting all over madden as if there is any game remotely better.  Even the most in depth RPGs struggle to make more than two or three characters integral to gameplay. Literally over 50% of NPC's in every fucking game just repeat one or two lines of communication and need cut scenes to do anything else, if they even do anything else.  I really don't understand where these people expect madden to be at this point. I've gotten hardcore gamers who never play sports games to try a few out. Literally every single one of them had no issues being at least decent at every other sports game in a short period of time, but when they play madden I've been told repeatedly that it's one of the most complicated games they've ever attempted to play and if they didn't hate sports, would be really intrigued to figure out the gameplay and etc.  It's just nothing's ever good enough. In spite of it always being good enough to subscribe to their subreddit, dedicate a large portion of their lives playing it, and definitely purchasing it."
Madden,3apwls,drain_patience,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:46:52 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand where these people expect madden to be at this point.   They want Madden to be what they remember NFL 2K5 being, notwithstanding that NFL 2K5 is the most overrated football video game of all-time.  Now before the pitch-forks and down votes come out - NFL 2K5 was a fantastic game. I played the heck out of it. It is not a seminal classic, however. The game had plenty of its own gameplay quirks, and franchise mode was an absolute mess all around (this is what caused me to ultimately put the game down).  The way the exclusivity license went down created a ton of vitriol against EA Tiburon which sadly a small and loud contingent of people still haven't let go of over a decade later. This is exacerbated by how poorly Tiburon handled the transition from PS2 / XBOX to XBOX 360 / PS3; the first few Madden games on those consoles were dire. It took until around Madden NFL 10 for the series to begin to recover.  Would I prefer it if NFL 2K was still around? Absolutely, I enjoyed both Madden and NFL 2K's takes on football and would have purchased both games each year. However, I've moved on, and I enjoy Madden NFL.  P.S. - I was at E3 this year, Madden NFL 16 is a blast on the field, we're getting a really fun game this year. :-)"

Madden,3an3he,Moruitelda,5,Sun Jun 21 21:19:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, I have never seen a player recover early. I don't doubt it happens. I remember in old Maddens I used to be able to play guys who had 1 week left if the injury wasn't serious, though their skill would sometimes be diminished.

I lost a guy for 4 weeks in the ACFCG and used XP on toughness hoping it would shrink so he could play -- I saw no change.

Madden,3ak7zz,mcorcoran3,3,Sun Jun 21 00:34:25 2015 UTC,"I really haven't fully understood the production rating... What I do know is that it seems to be loosely tied to intangible rating. If you notice there is always that guy (or many) thats projected as a high pick but has lower production, often times in my experience they often have D or F intangible ratings. I really only use it in the later rounds on guys I wasn't able to scout.  As for Personality, it has to do with jersey and merchandise sales within your stadium. The higher the personality trait the more your fans will want to buy their jerseys. You can only sell I think 4 different players jerseys at a time though so on a full roster you shouldn't have much of an issue...and if you do its really not going to net you a lot of money anyway."
Madden,3ak7zz,spoiLs7,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:41:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't use owner's mode, so maybe personality means less to me (though some say a lower personality makes players harder to negotiate with.   I tend to think of production for college prospects as their Stats in college (ie some excellent prospects have physical skills, but didn't play much and thus have low production, or vice versa) but still not sure how it works exactly. I have drafted low productions guys who have been Star Development and good picks, although the bust rate is much higher on low production guys. Maybe it is just there so you have some metric on guys you didn't scout.   It was neat seeing a 103. I don't really need a CB, but he is 21 so I will consider taking him."
Madden,3ak7zz,Dooberss13,2,Sun Jun 21 21:17:11 2015 UTC,"Get him. I had a 6'2 recievers who had 102 production rating. He had basic stats, about 93 spd, 93 Acc, basically all the WR traits were low A to high B. But with the 102 production he also had maxed out traits. He was a true superstar. After his first year he was a 97 OVR. 4 years in on my Online franchise, he is like the new coming of Randy Moss. He is the only guy I've ever see with 100+ production and he was the best draft pick I ever made."
Madden,3ak7zz,jesuslovesurmom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:54:21 2015 UTC,"I have seen about 4 or 5 players with over 99 production in my CFM drafting, everytime they have been super star development with very good stats."
Madden,3ak7zz,CM_Hooe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:51:32 2015 UTC,"Production grade is related to that guy's statistical output over the course of the season. A high production grade will bump up a guy's OVR a few points, and a low Production grade will decrease a guy's OVR value a few points. Production always resets to zero for every player at the start of every preseason and increases as the season goes on. In this way, the game can simulate a mid-level player having a breakout season and earning a big contract even if his individual ratings are not really as good as his stats output indicates, and also a big-name player having a down year and getting cut because the AI GM sees him ""declining"".  Personality trait I believe affects contract negotiations. One of them (Unpredictable, I think?) increases the likelihood of a player outright refusing to negotiate with you during the Re-Sign Players step, forcing you to either use the franchise tag on that player or let him enter offseason free agency."
Madden,3ak7zz,CM_Hooe,2,Sun Jun 21 06:26:59 2015 UTC,I see. I always use XP on predictability trait before contract negotiations. Doesn't always seem to help. But some players already have predictability trait when they arrive -- maybe personality is correlated. I figured production grade was what you mentioned -- although in college prospects it is a bit more ambigious.
Madden,3akf27,a979871,3,Sun Jun 21 01:50:18 2015 UTC,"As players get older physical attributes such as Speed, and Strength decrease just as they do in real life.  This happens for all positions and usually begins around age 30(though some positions are hit harder then others such as WR and HB).    I don't think you can turn it off, and its an important part of the game."
Madden,3akf27,SwissyVictory,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:39:00 2015 UTC,"In addition to this, if you're losing, they're taking an additional hit to attributes due to low Confidence.  Both problems are instantly solved with draft picks.  And to be fair, Calvin Johnson and Adrian Peterson are so good that even with a SPD in the high 70s they can be effective.  You lose the surprise TDs but you can hit Megatron on crossing patterns all day long and AP stays hard to tackle."
Madden,3akf27,Crathsor,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:21:03 2015 UTC,"Confidence can be fixed easily though.  Either by winning or spending training points on the player.  If you have a star player with low confidence you should work on fixing confidence rather then finding their replacement.    Once a player like Calvin Johnson/AP loses their speed(below 80ish) its often better to find a replacement.  However they can still make an impact on your team.  For example, move Calvin Johnson to TE when he cant compete with the faster CBs.  TEs generally don't need to be as fast and he will tear it up."

Madden,3akf27,colswn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a way to decrease it (besides them hitting goals and having high production which I hear helps slow regression). I will say Calvin Johnson is still a top WR in my CFM in 2025 at age 39 and AP retired in 2023 or 24 -- both were still productive but had slowed. For some reason D Thomas seems immune to the drop.   NOTE: I don't use Owner mode so I can't hire trainers -- maybe that helps. I notice WRs lose speed at 30 (say from a 96 to an 83) or 31 and it gets worse as time goes on. CBs, in my experience don't lose speed until at least 31, but they drop fast when it happens. Joe Haden is a 56 speed in 2025 for my CFM. He is still a 94 overall, go figure."

Madden,3ajr5i,mcorcoran3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"Despite only being a 70 OV, I just discovered the earlier drafted SS has superstar development, while the 80 OV is only ""Normal.""  Also, I just traded one of my 10 stockpiled 1st rounders, a young DE who wouldn't make the team, and aging AJ Hawk to the Panthers for 96 OV Luke Kuechly. This game is flawed."
Madden,3ajr5i,paperllamasunited,5,Sun Jun 21 22:43:07 2015 UTC,"I drafted a 5th round Linebacker who was only a 69 MLB, but an 80 ROLB. He had 92 speed, 90 accel and Star Development. He sucks with some stuff -- injury, awareness, etc... but his speed is amazing -- fastest linebacker I ever have had. He is tiny though - less than 240 lbs. Almost like a LB/Safety hybrid"

Madden,3ajr5i,etjacobson3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:14:03 2015 UTC,"Took a shot at the dark with a 5th round QB named Bruce Maggit all because he was a mobile QB, apparently he had superstar development and was 78 overall. Safe to say he was my starter VERY soon after that"

Madden,3afxij,hyperbolical,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:10:02 2015 UTC,I drafted a TE in my third season as a coach and by the end of his sophomore season he is a 95 overall.
Madden,3afxij,CorneliusHelius,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:40:30 2015 UTC,What are his agility and strength?
Madden,3afxij,hyperbolical,4,Sat Jun 20 01:35:45 2015 UTC,Strength is 58 lol and agility is 73
Madden,3afxij,CorneliusHelius,6,Sat Jun 20 01:45:43 2015 UTC,"What did you put his development points into to get to 95? I always struggle with TEs because there's catch, CIT, spec catch, route running, release, awareness, so many options to put points and it rarely increases his overall. Plus every TE I scout in the draft looks terrible, very few As if any"
Madden,3afxij,Septembers,2,Sat Jun 20 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"Look at your scheme's TE preference.  It will tell you what ratings you are valuing.  If you're having trouble raising their OVR, it may be that you need to change that preference to what you actually want, e.g., the team may be preferring blockers when you're making receivers.  Swapping that preference will sometimes change their OVR right away, since you change the weighting of ratings."

Madden,3ahe4k,Haminthepaint,4,Sat Jun 20 05:01:09 2015 UTC,"And because I knew I wasn't going to get the team I wanted by taking stabs in the dark with the next drafts I did look ahead to the next year to see who was going to be good, and then went back and scouted which ones of those guys had Star Development   What? You skipped ahead to make sure you didn't draft any busts? And you turned off injuries so progression wasn't stunted? But other than that ""I stuck to the rules, I swear!!"" -- the only way to cheat more than that would be to edit all your players to 99 OVRL.   It isn't that hard to get a lot of 99 players without cheating. It's a video game so I am not telling you not to cheat -- your not hurting anyone so if its fun, by all means do it. But seeing the future before a draft is a ridiculous advantage"
Madden,3ahe4k,mcorcoran3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, it is a huge advantage, but the goal was more to see how good an all 99 ovr team would be. And this team is pretty fun to play with (in a laughably dominant type of way). Also with the salary cap on, you can't keep every 99ovr player you get when it comes time for resignings, so you pretty much get 4 years (1 original draft and 3 other ones) to fill all of your holes with star players before. I get that what a lot of people might not enjoy playing the game this way, but I thought it added a fun challenge to offline CFM. Especially when playing on all-Madden, even with an average team, is getting pretty easy for me and getting boring."
Madden,3ahe4k,hyperbolical,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:17:30 2015 UTC,"As long as you're having fun cheating, you can totally keep all your 99's.   When they have one year left on their contract, sim to the third week of free agency and cut them. The AI doesn't make any contract offers during this week, and any player who has an offer will accept it, so you can re-sign them for 7 years at league minimum."
Madden,3ahe4k,mcorcoran3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if you do this make sure you don't offer the 99 guys big signing bonuses first. Ideally, if they are up to 99 before the rookie deal is out you would cut them in the third year before the even start talking contracts. I wouldn't do this, but like I said, if you pay for the game, and are playing alone --then who is getting hurt besides CPU generated players and opposing GMs?  I do think its possible to get 22 99 Overalls without skipping ahead or doing this re-sign trick. If you load up on awareness, adjust your scheme and use the scouting stories to make sure you get guys with fast or Star development, you can do it. As long as you win a lot."
Madden,3ahe4k,mcorcoran3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:24:34 2015 UTC,"Also, if you win a lot many players (not all) will accept ridiculously low-ball offers -- like 5 years 12.5 million for a guy asking for 5/60."
Madden,3ahe4k,switchn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"May aswell turn salary cap off. This is blatant cheating, why bother?"
Madden,3ahe4k,hyperbolical,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:10:25 2015 UTC,Because with my way the AI still has a cap to deal with.
Madden,3ahe4k,legaljoker,2,Mon Jun 22 13:09:35 2015 UTC,How'd you see the draft class?
Madden,3ahe4k,switchn,0,Sun Jun 21 15:28:09 2015 UTC,"Saved, simulated the draft, went to the rookie signings tab and went through team by team looking at overall, physical, and intangible numbers. I make a list of prospects and then go back and scout their development and see who's a star.  I think it would be a cool way for madden to do scouting in the future (besides the being able to go and see who has the star development trait). If you could see all of a players college ratings and then the things you scout are things like how certain traits will translate to the nfl or how badly a players lack of a certain skill will hurt him in the NFL. But set it up so you can only scout one trait per player (but scout as many players as you want) so it's more like a guessing game that the NFL draft really is, but you can at least figure out who can fit your scheme."
Madden,3ahe4k,LeGi123,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:41:59 2015 UTC,The M16 draft system looks way better tbh. You get given combine results and you can scout their top 3 traits. Would be nice if you could see a few weaknesses too though.

It makes perfect sense, considering they don't seem to do much for updates year by year...in EA Sports terms, it wouldn't be that expensive for them."
Madden,3afs33,Bizzlebomb,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"Yo dude! I'm about to check your article out on mobile, but wanted to give you a heads up that the menu of the site makes it difficult.  http://i.imgur.com/Sfm9g3j.jpg  Hope you're right about this mode replacing MUT, only for the reason (like you said) MUT gets old after the market tanks. What I am curious about though, you say you can re-draft every night? Would this mean your team is never permanent and resets daily? Am I drafting live against other people? And is this a 'Leauge' type mode, or is it open like MUT?   Enjoyed the article and info!"
Madden,3afs33,ncsuckit,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"""The first thing our team did was take a look at the traditional Fantasy Football experience: a 12-16 round snake draft spread out over a few hours. While this can be a lot of fun with friends, it can be a really long event. Also, without the pizza, wings and trash talk, the experience loses something.  That format also has two downsides from a Madden point of view. Not only is it tough to organize that many people for a large event (just ask your Commissioner), but the actual time spent drafting players is very small...  Having identified the challenges, we asked ourselves “What is the core fun of Fantasy Football that will work for Madden?” It is pretty obvious: Making the pick. Choosing the player that is going to carry your team. Draft night is the best part of Fantasy Football. The goal of Draft Champions was giving players draft night over and over again.  Draft Champions adds to the Fantasy Football experience by paying off draft night immediately. As soon as the draft is over, players can take the new squad onto the field. The result? A very tight draft experience that distills the best parts of Fantasy Football, and combining it with an exciting Madden event that can be completed in an evening.  Anyone who gets through a head-to -head gauntlet will truly be worthy of the title “Draft Champion.”  This is from the EA article describing the game mode. Based off of that, I am sure you can just choose to start over, but your team doesnt just reset.  I also have a feeling its both open like MUT but it has the option to be a league type mode, which is ideal. This is all based on speculation as the game has not come out yet but based on logical reasoning it makes sense.  Also fixed it for mobile. Glad you liked it! If you are willing to advertise the site it would help a lot :)"

Madden,3afs33,mcorcoran3,0,Fri Jun 19 21:41:04 2015 UTC,"I don't see much to be excited about for this mode. (This is not about your article, which I didn't read). I would've rather they just fixed the stuff that was broken that add yet another quasi-fantasy draft.  They do all of this but they can't come up with a organizable draft board or add new commentators?  They already have MUT and fantasy draft CFMs -- so you play games by choosing players from all over the league. Now they just make it so you can only choose 1/3 players and it is some great new mode?  I don't get it."

Madden,3af3mo,punchoutlanddragons,9,Fri Jun 19 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"I will say CFM is one of the saving graces of Madden, their online franchises are done well and the changes coming w/ 16 are pretty welcome from other commissioners I've talked to.  And you can even play by yourself in an online franchise, cuts down on the load times substantially.  In comparison to nba 2k's online franchise, which is just atrocious, I'd say it's solid.    With that said, I would like to see more variation between the coach, owner, and player modes.  Right now it just feels like every step down the org is just taking away franchise features rather than being a game mode in their own right.  Coach is owner lite and there's nothing to do as a player outside of playing the games."
Madden,3af3mo,ColeBlooded11,3,Fri Jun 19 18:29:31 2015 UTC,The gauntlet is actually pretty fun. One of the things EA did right. Hope they bring it back for 16.
Madden,3af3mo,JohnnieBoah,3,Fri Jun 19 17:55:12 2015 UTC,"I grew up on Madden. I am quite a bit older than you so, in the sense, that have played almost every installment. What is most maddening to me (no pun intended) is how they remove very functional, important thing (the ability to shadow WRs with one CB; formations subs on the pause menu; player cards that have team names on them; the ability to see league history etc...)  It seems they keep regressing. Hell, sometimes the first-down markers don't even show up on replay -- that was not a problem in 1993, but it is now? My rage is mostly on how CFM gets slighted though."
Madden,3af3mo,mcorcoran3,3,Fri Jun 19 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"I do agree, however, that the draft/scouting is the funnest part, although many people on here at the scouting/draft on 15.

Madden,3aarhp,stevyjohny,3,Fri Jun 19 03:58:01 2015 UTC,It means to me the commentary is tied to the type of ball thrown (high pass) and not anything else going on on the field.

Madden,3aarhp,MrFace1,19,Thu Jun 18 18:32:31 2015 UTC,You misunderstood me. I was commenting on commentary that is irrelevant to the play that just happened. The receiver was wide open the commentary referenced a jump ball that never happened.

If there is one thing we have learned over all this time it's Madden over powers new features every single year.  Everyone. Without exception.     They've moved back to more of an arcade style game. Which is fine for their business model, it sells games, and their target audience renews every single year.   They target 13-21 year old males.  It's just how the game is made, and those players are not necessarily into Simulation football.   But Madden no longer strives to be simulation football. That's not what they do.

Madden 92, 93 were more simulation-style than Montana (though I liked Montana's replay better and camera angles). I just want a game that is more like NFL2k5 or Madden 2005 and I would be mostly happy. The problem is that Madden isn't even as good as it was at its peak -- I don't thin Joe Montana football is the answer. They royally pissed off fans by allowing all sorts of speculation to fester without once saying, ""oh by the way, its a mobile game, might be on PC in two years and might never be on a console.""

Madden,3abws1,mcorcoran3,2,Thu Jun 18 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have low speed high acceleration for slot corners and high speed with moderate acceleration for outside corners, but I'd never take a guy who had under 89 ACC or 88 SPD."

Madden,3a9eo5,oobydoob,4,Thu Jun 18 11:48:43 2015 UTC,Oh joy. Maybe the game should come with a pencil and a piece of paper and I could write the names down!. Because that is basically what this new function amounts to.
Madden,3a9eo5,mcorcoran3,7,Thu Jun 18 20:52:59 2015 UTC,Except it's super convenient not to need to do that.
Madden,3a9eo5,justintree77,2,Fri Jun 19 01:19:50 2015 UTC,It is a little convenient. Might save someone 5 seconds per player. But it isn't a draft board -- at least not the kind people have been clamoring for.
Madden,3a9eo5,mcorcoran3,10,Fri Jun 19 03:50:15 2015 UTC,They listen to reddit?
Madden,3a9eo5,nanapuss,2,Thu Jun 18 15:21:49 2015 UTC,Doubt it. I don't think they listen to many requests on the internet. If they did we would have an awesome football game year in and out
Madden,3a9eo5,newtothelyte,7,Thu Jun 18 16:41:22 2015 UTC,What I think this means is that you can safely say for Madden 17 is that the full draft board experience will be in.  For M16 this is welcome but ultimately isn't a huge deal. Most people that are running multiple seasons in large CFM's are using Excel or something of that sort anyway so this doesn't offer a ton of value to them.
Madden,3a9eo5,mkeller25,2,Thu Jun 18 14:48:02 2015 UTC,I think the problem is people who miss the draft -- they want to able to pre-sort their draft board for the auto draft -- Excel doesn't help in that instance. And so people miss the draft (because they have to work or whatever) the CPU fucks up the draft and they lose interest.
Madden,3a9eo5,mcorcoran3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"I also don't think we can safely say that. The guy seemed really skeptical and his answer was ""I don't know when we will have time to get to that, but I would love to."""

Madden,3a9eo5,supaB,-1,Fri Jun 19 05:43:18 2015 UTC,"This is a horse shit explanation. There is no draft board. You can essentially ""highlight"" players you are interested in, which is the equivalent of you writing a player's name down on a piece of paper.   Also, these dynamic drive goals sound so stupid. Allow MUT players to pad stats. I want my opponent to play a realistic game -- not force feed a WR to gain extra XP/confidence when he should be running out the clock.   I don't know what Madden's end game is for sure but it seems to me they care more about the casual fans -- who he referenced as guy who play the game 40 times a year. They want more guys buying the game, and they figure if they lose hardcore CFMers they new casuals will make up for it.   They are probably right financially -- few CFMers will boycott since Madden is the only game in town and they want active online leagues. So if 5 percent of harcore CFMers quit maybe these stupid goals will attract an increase in casuals to make up for it.   Soon enough we will be paying for XP coins or special sneakers or shit. Madden might be doing right for EA's botton line, but simulation style CFMers are, I suspect, only going to be increasingly frustrated that realism will be sacrificed for attracting casuals.   I am likely just to keep Madden15 this year, if only just because they seemingly ruined the best part of the game, which is scouting."
Madden,3a9eo5,mcorcoran3,2,Thu Jun 18 20:50:28 2015 UTC,Madden 15 scouting is pants on head retarded. I would have a hard time designing a system that less resembled how scouting actually works. At least 16 is bringing back combine numbers.
Madden,3a9eo5,hyperbolical,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:02:46 2015 UTC,"You can only scout 3 traits and you have no control over what traits they are. And you can scout 85 percent of the actual draft class, which is absurd. Further, after scouting the third trait, it tells you his ""real grade."" How is that realistic -- at least in Madden15 you won't know if someone is a bust ahead of time unless you pay the 500 points for development."
Madden,3a9eo5,mcorcoran3,2,Fri Jun 19 03:49:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah it gives you a ""true"" grade but that's only if he'll be close to being a good player or not.   In real life drafts it's obvious who the first round talent is. This year there were only about 20 prospects worthy of a first round grade and everyone knew who they were. So it's not that different.   With the three random stats and the combine numbers you'll still have a decent draft experience. Calm down bro."
Madden,3a9eo5,tipacow,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:50:19 2015 UTC,"I just feel like scouting/draft was one of the least broken things about Madden (it was far from perfect) and they didn't need to simplify it. Also, it will be very hard to draft for scheme. If you need LBs that are excellent at zone coverage because you are in Tampa 2, you will have no idea what zone coverage is for many of the LBs, because you have no control over that trait (and combine numbers won't indicate a skill like that).   I mean, I would've of rather them fixed the broadcasting, or the player cards, or the ability to customize formations subs, than retool scouting."

So it's more real then?   Also, they're fixing player cards thankfully.   I'm pumped about the catching mechanics. Last game you couldn't over throw the receiver for a jump ball ever, it would always go towards their chest. This year they're fixing that. Which was my biggest complaint."

Madden,3a9okw,roxzt,3,Thu Jun 18 11:29:50 2015 UTC,I forgot about Demps-- I played in a CFM where Demps was killing everyone for the COlts.
Madden,3a9okw,mcorcoran3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:08:46 2015 UTC,"I just picked him up with the Jets in my CFM. I use him as the outside back in the wild cat. When the defenders ambush Geno on the triple option, I pitch it and Demps is gone. His agility is also like a 96 so if there's one defender left to beat, a juke easily does it."
Madden,3a9okw,AdmiralLobstero,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:01:59 2015 UTC,Any CFM where the speed threshold is played with can become a playground for speed backs like Demps. It's fairly common.

Madden,3a9okw,Marzman315,3,Thu Jun 18 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"A lot of bad mixed in too, like the fact he still can't take snaps under center over a year after being drafted. Three fumbles on snaps at a practice in front of the media earlier this week.  That's not including his little incident with a heckler that showed just how immature he still is."
Madden,3a9okw,Warmaster91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:20:45 2015 UTC,"Well that's a lot of cherry picking. Coach Pettine blamed the fumbles partially on bad snapping, player leaders including Haden and Thomas have praised him both on and off the field and his student/mentor relation with McCown is working exactly as hoped.  And literally every single person present for the water bottle incident said it was extremely overblown and not a big deal. He's still got some improvement to do on the field, but there have been absolutely no criticisms of his maturity. In fact, it's been universally positive. I think Thomas said it was ""night and day from last year"".   So it sounds like you're either imagining things or hanging on to negative stereotypes for the sake of rooting against him and being negative. Or maybe you haven't followed any news at all and you're just assuming?"

Madden,3a9okw,CC333,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:28:10 2015 UTC,"Teammates are almost always either or say positive things about team members or not going to say anything if all they have to say is negative. You know why? Because it makes them pariahs if they speak out against other players.  Do you know what speaks volumes about Manziel's standing in Cleveland? The fact that Josh McCown not only was signed for pretty decent money, but is also the odds-on favorite to start after his depressingly bad play in TB and unceremonious demotion behind Mike Glennon before being cut.  Manziel might be getting first team snaps in training camp, but that's because the team is trying to figure out if he's worth keeping or if they should jettison him like Richardson."

Madden,3aafwh,Redskinsthebestskins,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:20:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah... one model that could work is target a game for sim-style players with a lot of Head Coach elements to it and charge more for it to justify not getting the casuals. The one thing about CFMers is they play more Madden hours than anyone, but still only pay 60 bucks. If you could capitalize on that -- say charge by the month -- maybe the revenue could be enough to justify shunning the casuals with realistic game play as the focus.   IT will never happen but in theory it could work, if only because Sim-style players play more Madden hours than anyone, but probably only account for 15 percent of Madden revenue."
Madden,3aafwh,mcorcoran3,2,Thu Jun 18 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like most cfmers have no issues with madden(as a whole). Even with a competitor that had better realism, etc., most of us would stick with madden and just hope that the new competition spurs madden to improve much more quickly than their current pace.  And that's probably what a game company sees from this market. A bunch of cultist gamers(myself included) who only want a competitor around to scare madden into digging deep into development and improvements.  I don't want a new game. I love madden. I just wish it would get much better each year than it currently does.  A competitor would make that likely, but that just means someone would be sinking costs into a sacrificial lamb for the purpose of us enjoying madden even more than we used to."
Madden,3aafwh,drain_patience,5,Fri Jun 19 05:22:51 2015 UTC,"IMO 2k8 was very well done, unforunately they limited the customization to only 13 or so players. But you could customize Uniforms and there were plenty of ways to make it look like the real thing.   if they came along and made another game like that, but allowed full customization, release it for $40, they would take a bite out of madden sales."
Madden,3aafwh,goddammnick,3,Thu Jun 18 19:22:19 2015 UTC,It takes years to make a decent console football game from scratch.  Madden has a head start in that regard.  Very difficult to make that football game and have it sell against Madden.
Madden,3aafwh,PhantomFullForce,3,Thu Jun 18 16:03:12 2015 UTC,"Bingo. It's extremely unlikely a game is going to top Madden without at least a couple of years of dev time, and no studio is willing to take that kind of financial risk on a game when they know that no matter how good it is, if it can't actually dethrone Madden, they're sunk."
Madden,3aafwh,lucentcb,2,Thu Jun 18 20:33:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. Especially since it such a huge risk since there is no track record of a game without naming rights to have success since Joe Montana SPortstalk football in 93."
Madden,3aafwh,mcorcoran3,3,Thu Jun 18 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"Nobody really wants to play a football game with fake teams, unless it will really blow them away.   A game company will not devote its resources into a game knowing that people probably won't buy their game because it doesn't have NFL teams"
Madden,3aafwh,cush2push,2,Thu Jun 18 16:17:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the lack of NFL cooperation is the reason, but if someone made a super realistic game -- designed with CFMers in mind who care about realism, roster building etc... -- and allowed for USER-edited rosters, I would buy it in two seconds. But, I don't know if there is enough sim-style players to justify it. Maybe if they charged us 10 bucks a month instead of 60 bugs a pop...since there is less of us sim=style people than there is casuals, Madden has incentive to screw us. But if we were willing to pay more for a game with realism and replayability, maybe it could be economically feasible for an game without naming rights could survive."
Madden,3aafwh,mcorcoran3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:15:46 2015 UTC,The problem with Joe Montana (besides the obvious fact it is a mobile game) is that all the people than want new football options are players who think Madden is shunning realism. So the only thing that will suffice is a game that focuses to those players -- but clearly it seems developers want games that are even more aimed at casuals.
Madden,3aafwh,mcorcoran3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:22:30 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like most cfmers have no issues with madden(as a whole).

If people are interested originally enough to buy the first, they'll come back. Someone just needs something that will grab our attention like JMF did."
Madden,3aafwh,WeDemHawks,2,Thu Jun 18 15:29:52 2015 UTC,"Even then, would it be enough? Backbreaker was supposed to be the game to blow Madden out of the water with its physics engine, but it was a bust."
Madden,3aafwh,switchn,-1,Thu Jun 18 16:16:48 2015 UTC,Backbreaker was a joke mobile game

Madden,3a6ctf,stevyjohny,2,Fri Jun 19 04:23:55 2015 UTC,People were expecting this game to compete with Madden. You can't compete with a game by not even being in the same market as them.
Madden,3a6ctf,ljstreet,60,Sat Jun 20 21:10:06 2015 UTC,you have got to be fucking kidding me
Madden,3a6ctf,rs71,55,Wed Jun 17 16:38:07 2015 UTC,this dude comes off like hes embarrassed to say it haha
Madden,3a6ctf,gipson10,36,Wed Jun 17 17:00:41 2015 UTC,"Because they never gave any real information. So the ""fanbase"" built up a huge amount of hype that they couldn't live up to. Instead of giving information he let the hype build. Then felt stupid when the game is just a nothing mobile game."
Madden,3a6ctf,bonerjohnson,13,Wed Jun 17 17:26:47 2015 UTC,"So the ""fanbase"" built up a huge amount of hype that they couldn't live up to.   They should seriously fire their marketing manager. It's one thing to play the hype game like this (they never should have if their plan was mobile all along), but once the hype outpaced the reality, they should have came out and said, ""MONTANA FOOTBALL, COMING TO IOS AND ANDROID, Q3 2015."" Instead, they let rumors swirl for months and now everyone's furious."
Madden,3a6ctf,Moruitelda,3,Wed Jun 17 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, their dishonest marketing did make them somewhat famous.  If they can live past all the death threats, their shitty android app will definitely make more money."

Madden,3a6ctf,switchn,6,Thu Jun 18 02:15:13 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. People are pissed off because they promised a wedding cake and just unloaded a Twinkie off the truck. I was on board the hype train. Now I'm definitely not going to buy it, even though I might have been inclined to if it had been originally announced as a mobile game.   This is awful attention."
Madden,3a6ctf,Moruitelda,-4,Thu Jun 18 02:19:04 2015 UTC,A few salty fans won't matter with all the extra attention the game got. It was great work by the marketing team.
Madden,3a6ctf,switchn,6,Thu Jun 18 02:24:34 2015 UTC,"It's not ""a few salty fans."" There's a huge uproar. The extra viral attention it's getting is, ""Fuck these incompetent guys, they have no idea what they're doing."""
Madden,3a6ctf,Moruitelda,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:33:37 2015 UTC,Where is this uproar you speak of?  Should I Google it?  Just a casual user of the internet probably doesn't even know about this.
Madden,3a6ctf,BaconisComing,3,Thu Jun 18 03:37:29 2015 UTC,Yeah except the whole target demographic seemed to be people who play football games...aka Madden fans...aka gamers who have been BEGGING for a a new game to compete because of EA's constant fuckery. I think I can speak for at least 90% of this sub when I say I'm not playing that fucking game on my phone. Someone finally had a chance to offer this demographic something new and they've let the majority of us down. Bullshit.

Madden,3a6ctf,IDontLikeUsernamez,16,Thu Jun 18 02:07:47 2015 UTC,He actually cringes before saying mobile. His discomfort alone would scare off most people.

Madden,3a6ctf,cookster123,7,Wed Jun 17 18:52:50 2015 UTC,"We have literally been waiting a decade for an alternate football experience. Finally, this game looked to be the first legitimate football game besides madden in years. And they release it on mobile, with a potential PC release which depends on the success of the mobile game?????? Just kill me please"
Madden,3a6ctf,stevyjohny,65,Fri Jun 19 04:22:07 2015 UTC,This kills the game.
Madden,3a6ctf,seniorgoon,13,Wed Jun 17 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"For us console fans? Absolutely. I think it will make a killing on mobile though. We're in an unfortunate time when most casual gamers are on mobile platforms, and casual gamers = money. That's why EA had a significant amount of time devoted to mobile in their conference. It's unfortunate that we won't see a Madden competitor or a real football sim, but business is about making money, and mobile seems to be the direction a lot of companies are heading."
Madden,3a6ctf,browndudeman,7,Wed Jun 17 17:45:27 2015 UTC,"From the looks of it. This looks way better than the Madden mobile games. This hype will kill it for console fans but you're right. This hype is gonna give it the spotlight needed for people to go ""Oh I remember hearing about this. Oh this looks really good. I'm gonna get it."""
Madden,3a6ctf,Rfwill13,11,Wed Jun 17 17:53:16 2015 UTC,The madden mobile game is literally just mut on a phone. They only made it to get a quick buck off of you
Madden,3a6ctf,HiImFlapDragon,4,Wed Jun 17 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was mostly hoping for a decent PC game. Even though this is supposedly coming to PC, my expectations are rock-bottom because it will obviously be a mobile game first. Oh well."
Madden,3a6ctf,seniorgoon,3,Wed Jun 17 17:57:50 2015 UTC,I would have been fine with a PC game as well. If there was any type of mod support we could have seen an NFL mod or roster

Madden,3a6ctf,Taliesen81Madden,6,Wed Jun 17 23:32:50 2015 UTC,...I thought Madden 15 was fun...
Madden,3a6ctf,KevinMcCallister,2,Wed Jun 17 19:01:35 2015 UTC,Madden 15 was the most fun Madden in a long time. But it's still disappointing considering what EA could be doing with the game. It could definitely be so much better and have so many fewer bugs.
Madden,3a6ctf,kylerm42,0,Wed Jun 17 23:05:12 2015 UTC,"It is fun, without a doubt. I love playing madden and have for years (I'm 14, the first madden I played regularly was 04 on the gamecube, so much fun. But madden has fallen far since then..."

Well I've pretty much phased my ps3 out over the past year moving to gaming on my PC (though I bought Madden 15).   I think this is it. I won't have another football game until Madden goes to PC or, preferably 2k starts making football games again. Which won't be until 2020 at the earliest, right?"
Madden,3a6ctf,DontBendYourVita,2,Wed Jun 17 16:43:06 2015 UTC,And that's if EA doesn't extend their exclusivity rights - which is unlikely. The only way it would happen is if the NFL realizes the amount of money it could make offering various video game products with licensing more than the exclusivity contract. It'd have to be substantial.
Madden,3a6ctf,RedSweed,3,Wed Jun 17 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"And from what I remember reading, the NFL prefers to have one exclusive licensing partner, rather than multiple. (Like Nike or verizon). They can probably make it a bigger contract, and only have to manage one relationship."

Madden,3a6ctf,Taliesen81Madden,5,Wed Jun 17 16:46:46 2015 UTC,"but as a football fan I'm forced to play EA's garbage.   See, that's the exactly why Madden is the way it is.. You're not forced to play their garbage. Instead of buying and playing a football game which you don't even really enjoy, you could just not do that. If more people stopped spending money on Madden, EA would actually be forced to either do more than roster updates and pseudo-innovations or, failing that, they'd have to stop making the games if they think that doing actual work cuts into their ROI too much."
Madden,3a6ctf,badlyjester,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:30:24 2015 UTC,"Good points, I totally agree, but like I said, I'm a huge football fan, and seeing that there' no more NCAA, Madden's pretty much my only option. By the way, I didn't say I don't enjoy Madden, I love playing it, it's tons of fun. It's just that it's terrible lol."
Madden,3a6ctf,Taliesen81Madden,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:25:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, of course my advice only applies to people who don't enjoy Madden all that much. Personally, I didn't have a console for many years since I'm a pc gamer, so when I finally got a PS3 to play some of the exclusives I'd missed, I was really excited and picked up Madden 15 as soon as it came out. The one thing about it that stops me from enjoying it more than anything else is the presentation. When I sit down to play a football game, I really, really want to play it, but they seem to be going for the full football experience, where I spend as much time watching replays (complete with goofy physics and absolutely dreadful and repetitive commentary) as I actually play the game. I know it doesn't bother most people, but I absolutely can't get over the fact that these replays can't be skipped."
Madden,3a6ctf,badlyjester,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:54:32 2015 UTC,"Yes the presentation is horrendous, although for me it's not that i dont want the full football experience, I do very much, it's that the presentation is terrible! The commentary gets stale after playing the game for 45 minutes lol, and the commentary is also just plain WRONG (Phil Simms says cover 3 when you played cover 2, and so on and so forth). The in-game stats updates are weak, they feel un-realistic and they're very poorly designed. Throughout madden 15, there are grammatical errors. And the list goes on and on and on."
Madden,3a6ctf,Taliesen81Madden,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I too think it's garbage. But I actually stopped buying it. These other people who buy it don't walk the walk. If it really is that terrible, which I think it is, then it's not even fun to play (which I also think it is). The people who buy it must be satisfied with sub-par performance."
Madden,3a6ctf,stevyjohny,3,Fri Jun 19 04:07:47 2015 UTC,"I feel this suits the casual gamer a lot more than anyone serious about gaming/football mainly because the mobile platform aspect. This game could turn out to be something great but starting off they way they are is simply going to kill it. I don't think they realize that an easy way to ""get it out there"" would have been directly to the PC, rather than straight to mobile. This all seems ass backwards to me. Almost like they're afraid to dump a ton of money/time into it in case it fails so they take the easy route."

Madden,3a6ctf,Jack_Burton_the_2nd,2,Wed Jun 17 20:58:49 2015 UTC,Hahahaha I really can't believe this. Even though the rumors were that it was going to be XBox/PC only and I have a PS4 I was looking forward to this game. Unreal.
Madden,3a6ctf,thekingswitness,2,Wed Jun 17 22:46:20 2015 UTC,Dammit. His look was priceless. Wonder how much we will be able to play before the freemium kicks in. Would you like to play the next game of your season?  $.99
Madden,3a6ctf,falcor00,2,Wed Jun 17 23:54:55 2015 UTC,"A crushing blow. I have zero interest in mobile gaming. Unfortunately, it is a thing now. It sucks that somehow this group has become big enough to actually thwart progress.   I'm still amazed as well that the most popular sport in America has such a difficult time getting out in the market. The NFL license is so restrictive; it is live or die on Madden. If you like it, great. If you don't you're screwed forever. Even when an attempt is made to make football outside of the NFL, this happens. I guess we can't blame them for following the money. However, I'm also thinking, is there not a stronger demographic on pc and console?   It's nice they are planning on releasing it for pc, but that seems like it will take forever. It would have to be an entirely different game from the mobile version which I assume would be a lot more simple."
Madden,3a6ctf,stevyjohny,2,Fri Jun 19 04:15:09 2015 UTC,I could have sworn they said it would be an Xbox One exclusive.

Madden,3a6ctf,spideralex90,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:59:16 2015 UTC,"Entering the market to go up against a title which has 100% market share is a risky move. Yes this isn't the ideal scenario for fans, but as a business decision - it makes the most sense. Lower risk, lower cost and a great barometer to see if there is enough interest to launch a console competitor to Madden in 17/18. It's less than ideal, granted, but it's also better than having one shot at a console game that could bomb."

Madden,3a7vxc,mcorcoran3,6,Wed Jun 17 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"Take the power back. He's at least 89 SPD. In Madden 15, no running backs in the draft classes have higher speed than 91/92."
Madden,3a7vxc,Moruitelda,2,Thu Jun 18 01:01:58 2015 UTC,That is a good point. A speed means you are going to be close to that (and game prep them to faster speeds as well). So even if the 5'6 guy is a couple points higher it wouldn't be enough to justify having a guy who won't exactly be a force in short-yardage situations.
Madden,3a7vxc,Moruitelda,5,Thu Jun 18 01:39:12 2015 UTC,Not that either guy will be; STR also caps out at about 65 for draft class HBs.   This is the most ridiculous problem for a game to ever have. I can't conceive of how they screwed up attributes for so many positions the way they did.
Madden,3a7vxc,rebelrowzer,2,Thu Jun 18 01:56:47 2015 UTC,Yeah. TE are messed up too for run blocking. I have not seen any generated player with runblocking higher than 69 (unless it was a guy I put xp into).
Madden,3a7vxc,Warmaster91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:57:22 2015 UTC,"This guy ended up having 72 strength. In all honesty though, I can't tell the difference between him and a 228 lb back I have in terms of size and if anything, the smaller guys seems better since he is a little faster (91 - 89) and has much better elusiveness. The big guy had 80 pass block which is miles better than I am used to seeing. But that is not an expensive attribute"
Madden,3a7vxc,supaB,3,Sun Jul 5 21:21:09 2015 UTC,You drafted Brandon Jacobs 2.0!
Madden,3a7vxc,TombaFan123,2,Fri Jun 19 06:27:07 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen these 250 lb HBs fall forward and trigger different animations that help them fall forward more than lighter HBs even with similar strength and if both have the fights for yards trait.  I don't usually go with a big RB as my starter because I'll use a stock roster guy with better speed, but they're great for short yardage."
Madden,3a7vxc,switchn,2,Thu Jun 18 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"I've actually had good success with drafting a route runner WR with A Spd, Acc, Elu, Juk, and Spin.  Move him to Hb and set your scheme to recieving back.  If your team is set up and you just need a hb for the future, set him as your second back since they seem to hawk all of the TDs when you sim.  Should get ROY and loads of xp.  The WRs typically come in with higher carrying than the HBs too"
Madden,3a7vxc,switchn,2,Fri Jun 19 05:54:29 2015 UTC,Power back sounds excellent... I would go with him imo
Madden,3a7vxc,scottw5150,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he does sound excellent -- I hope he has at least quick development (I will scout it eventually since RB is my top need)."
Madden,3a7vxc,JMLeblanc23,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:37:41 2015 UTC,"Big backs don't ""feel"" as good. It's hard to explain but even when their stats are high they don't feel as fast or as easy to control as a little back does. In saying that, is trading up into the first to pick 2 of them a possibility? Even if the big guy doesn't turn out to be a great back you could convert him to TE or something."
Madden,3a7vxc,Gkredd2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:07:31 2015 UTC,"There is another guy, expected to go 1.21 or something who has all the same scouting attributes, but is only 5'11, 217 lbs. He is 21. The guy mentioned above is 23. The older, heavier guy has quick development, haven't scouted development on the others ones.   I did wonder if the guy would be ""too big"" to be a real useful everydown HB, one of the reasons I posted. I am intriqued by his size. My current RB is probably 225 and he is excellent. I like the idea of having a bruiser with A speed, but I could go for the normal size guy (if his development checks out).   I could trade up to get two of them, though it would be costly. But I have two firsts (mine and the Giants) and several 2nd as well. But I have no idea where the Giants pick will be since I am in week 3. To get the 250 lb guy I would have to trade up right near the top (maybe even 1st) since a guy projected to go 6th could well go first."
Madden,3a8rd3,Derrickg525,2,Thu Jun 18 03:07:56 2015 UTC,PS3 or PS4?
Madden,3a8m8c,NerdyOrDirty,2,Thu Jun 18 02:20:44 2015 UTC,They are also more likely to fumble
Madden,3a8m8c,HoldenL9,2,Thu Jun 18 03:42:28 2015 UTC,"They fumble, can't celebrate, their speed drops too I don't know how much but it does. Juke moves are a death sentence."
Madden,3a8m8c,WeDemHawks,2,Thu Jun 18 15:31:11 2015 UTC,Good question. The only thing I seem to notice is a drop in speed and an increase in fumbles and drops. I assume it might make d-lineman and o-lineman weaker and less likely to win battles on the line of scrimmage.

Madden,3a74da,Waldinator,2,Thu Jun 18 02:35:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it essentially is the same system. But it's a very good system nonetheless I think. I also feel like 15 rounds might be a little short but they have to find a number of rounds that keeps players interested without being overwhelming, so maybe it's fine."

I think if executed well this could be an incredibly fun mode."
Madden,3a74da,deRoyLight,2,Thu Jun 18 02:17:36 2015 UTC,"Yes EA clearly took the idea from you, you sir are an inspiration."
Madden,3a74da,switchn,0,Thu Jun 18 09:53:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't really mean it to come across like that. I think it's a natural progression for MUT so I think there was probably some convergent thought there. Plus, Draft Duels was a thing in M13 and this is really just a different approach to that and I'm sure they've had the hope to overhaul it and bring it back at some point. But I do expect the article was brought up. They invited me to the Madden Bowl this past offseason which they don't typically do but maybe that's a red herring. I'm just really excited to see it. It was one of those things I had really hoped they'd work to introduce, but wasn't sure they would ever get around to it. I think people will enjoy this mode much more than they think (judging by comments from people on Pastapadre, the reception seems to be mixed at best)."

Very comfortable running in the pistol scheme and there are a TON of pistol plays where you can get that empty side look.  I've gone a little crazy with my custom playbooks, so I can audible to a play that runs the other direction if the user starts to cheat to the empty side.    I'm still surprised there is a good amount of Madden players that still try to win by passing the ball almost exclusively.  Madden 15 is so biased towards the run, people should learn that running is the way to win effectively in Madden 15"

Madden,3a5p38,lookingforanOD,2,Wed Jun 17 21:28:53 2015 UTC,"Why is it ""so whack""?  I'm controlling clock and limiting your chances on offense, while keeping my defense off the field.  In doing so, I force people to play outside their comfort zone because they usually have a plan going in to have the ball at the end of the half.  If I score a TD and your first possession bleeds into the 2nd quarter, now you're trying to figure out how to keep the ball long enough, because once I get it, the quarter will finish with my possession.  That's just strategy, and good strategy.  It's NFL strategy as well, so when people whine about ""they don't do that in the NFL"", well I'm actually doing what they do in the NFL.  Time of possession usually favors the winner."

Madden,3a3n3g,CoweedandCannibus,5,Wed Jun 17 03:28:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Blitz was supposed to be cartoony and a fun, unrealistic game. If Montana is going for a game to compete with madden's graphics, physics, etc, I would prefer to play as people I recognize and am a fan of. Imagine if Madden for some reason just decided to strip its game of all team logos, player names, etc and sold it separately from Madden. Hell maybe the even dumb down madden's physics a bit and give ""Generic Football '16"" all the super fluid animations and shit. Wouldn't you still prefer to play Madden? Now Montana isn't even going to be close to Madden in terms of gameplay. I guess I can't say that for sure, but if we take NBA Live resurfacing to compete with NBA2k as an example, we see that Live's gameplay was miles behind 2k's even though Live had a successful franchise just a 5 or 6 years ago. Has the Montana crew ever had success making NFL games?   Maybe I'm being pessimistic but I strongly feel that Montana is going to have to put out several years worth of games before they are close to Madden's gameplay. Even then, the popularity may still be a problem. Madden is e-normous."

We are the only people at fault if the game is any good and it bombs. The whole mobile game thing earlier was bullshit so we still just need to wait and be patient for tomorrows (hopefully) reveal.  edit: Of course if the game sucks then it deserves to fail but why are people giving up on it when we knew it was almost impossible to legally get their hands on the NFL license? I just don't get it. I hope people stop bitching about how Madden and EA run their shitty business practice because you all just give into and help it continue.  Edit 2: Welp, now that we have the information that it is a mobile game (then PC), I think it's safe to assume Waterbuffalo was right. I just thought it would be good for people to be optimistic until the real info was released. Pretty disappointed that they let all of this hype grow up."
Madden,3a3n3g,not1fuk,-4,Wed Jun 17 03:56:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not assuming it's going to bomb. I'm predicting that it's going to suck, in which case I'm predicting it will bomb."
Madden,3a3n3g,waterbuffalo750,2,Wed Jun 17 12:38:51 2015 UTC,Predicting and assuming have a pretty vague difference
Madden,3a3n3g,Chriiiiiiiiisss,2,Wed Jun 17 13:21:59 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty significant difference. A prediction is just a guess. An assumption implies it's the only option. The game might be good, and I hope it is. But I don't think it will be.  Example: I can predict that the Vikings will win the Super Bowl, but it's not an assumption, I'm not buying my plane tickets and booking my hotel for the game just yet."

Madden,3a3n3g,tipacow,5,Wed Jun 17 06:48:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will be better than Madden, though. But if it is, it won't have staying power to be an annual game like Madden."

Madden,3a3n3g,btener412,2,Wed Jun 17 03:02:33 2015 UTC,I wonder if it's possible to get teams and players in the game now that Xbox supports mods. Not sure how that would work.
Madden,3a3n3g,Hoooooooar,7,Wed Jun 17 00:33:42 2015 UTC,Just like 4chans PES games

Madden,3a3n3g,danhatab,4,Wed Jun 17 00:58:16 2015 UTC,Xbox doesn't support mods they're only support fallout 4 use of mods. Though if this game has a player/team creator with community share I'm sure we'll definitely see NFL teams and players
Madden,3a3n3g,btener412,2,Wed Jun 17 01:02:37 2015 UTC,Oh my mistake. I thought it was all mods.

Madden,3a714v,Trainwrek,2,Wed Jun 17 20:13:20 2015 UTC,"You can just download new rosters -- OBJ will be there. I am unlikely to buy Madden 16 because I prefer the Madden 15 scouting. You could buy 15 for like 15 bucks once 16 comes out (maybe less). That way you would have some new features (random drafts, game prep etc... though those are mostly franchise mode stuff)."

Madden,3a714v,lucentcb,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:07:14 2015 UTC,"The 360 has been a last-gen console for a year and a half now--how long did you expect them to keep developing for it?  It's scummy that they'll keep releasing the game to grab as much cash as they can from 360/PS3 owners, but it's also naive to expect the last-gen versions to be able to keep up."

Madden,3a457e,mmfootball927,3,Wed Jun 17 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or does it look like they added a lot in the way of gameplay mechanics? I know EA is historically terrible with this, but the wr/cb interactions are on another level, as well as WR catching in general."
Madden,3a457e,Tucker4President,9,Wed Jun 17 16:24:59 2015 UTC,"That was so hard to watch. Ugh the game mode looked great, but the host was annoying"
Madden,3a457e,RAVENS17d,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"Holy crap yes. If that guy would just go in another fucking room, and let the 3 guys who know what they're doing present the game, it would've been so much better."
Madden,3a457e,Skarmotastic,2,Thu Jun 18 08:16:45 2015 UTC,Glad to see WRs and DBs actually look like they're fighting for the ball now.
Madden,3a457e,Trainwrek,2,Wed Jun 17 17:49:40 2015 UTC,"Looks better so far but hard to judge by two scrubs playing. The gameplay mechanics looked better, seems like they fixed up some things, gang tackle is nice, running looks better, and cb/dB looks better but still looks suspect. But there some things that are just bad, still looks easy to move the ball on offense, the crowd/sideline is still lifeless along with the single player td celebrations. But what I didn't like was the interception by Wilson. The cb/dB play was great fighting for the ball, but Wilson wasn't even looking at the ball, there's no why he could acknowledge that the ball was right behind him like that to turn around and pick it off. These are the little bullshit things in Madden that make the game so flawed. Those type of plays need to get fixed if this game wants to continue to get better. If the players had realistic awareness in this game, Wilson never turns around like that to pick the ball off, instead it hits the ground, and that play looks very great"
Madden,3a457e,danhatab,3,Thu Jun 18 04:57:03 2015 UTC,"Anyone else notice at 10:12 he makes it sound like looking at the WR/DB match up stats was a new thing this year? No its not. I know he technically said ""one of the things we are doing this year is..."" but come on now... that's pretty egregious."

Madden,3a457e,mastererrl,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or was Jordy untouched when he went up and came down with the ball around the ~20 yard line? It looked like he caught it but fell down and the play ended there. That would be true by college rules, but a defender needs to touch him while he is down in the NFL. It could be that I missed the contact though."

Madden,3a6mj2,modrewgnu,4,Wed Jun 17 17:14:47 2015 UTC,That's what they always say and then somebody finds out a new glitch where the outside WR comes down with all jump balls or a new D-line setup leads to instant pressure because the stupid guards choose to block an OLB while leaving the DT an open lane to the QB.
Madden,3a6mj2,kksred,2,Wed Jun 17 18:42:28 2015 UTC,How often will we see the OBJ catch become the default catch animation like David Tyree's was in 08.

The email sign up is for Alpha access, which means, imo, this game isn't even close to being ready. EA also confirmed they hold all exclusive licensing for NFL and that this game would not have it. My hope and expectations for this game have gone way down. Nothing to show and alpha build and no license......"
Madden,3a0w6q,Mottso,8,Tue Jun 16 12:46:19 2015 UTC,"I am not big into NFL but i would play it even with no licenses, that is why i like that Pro Evo does have the licenses for the Premier League as you are able to edit the kits and can make them how you like. Would be cool to edit the NFL strips to something different (be it there is an edit mode for it in the game)"
Madden,3a0w6q,Galgenfrist,0,Tue Jun 16 14:57:43 2015 UTC,No license if it's on all platforms because that's how EA's license works. think like The show for MLB
Madden,3a0w6q,This-Is-My-Moment,0,Tue Jun 16 13:53:05 2015 UTC,"That's a completely different type of license. the NFL licensed EA only to make NFL games, on any platform (not including mobile though they do have some rights for that as well)"
Madden,3a0w6q,mastererrl,0,Tue Jun 16 15:35:20 2015 UTC,That's not how the show works. The show has a first party license which means sony can make it for their console. They third party license is not being used after 2k didn't renew it.

In contrast, the only source this article has is a mysterious post on Operation Sports by a burner account, and the information in that post has been refuted repeatedly.

Madden,3a4sbq,Find_the_Door,8,Wed Jun 17 16:17:09 2015 UTC,Ok. Now we can be pissed. What the actual fuck.
Madden,3a4sbq,steach91,-1,Wed Jun 17 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"It was always expected to be mobile.   One guy, literally one unknown OS poster made a post claiming inside information.   Everyone got punked when they should have known better.  I feel for you guys. But seriously, common sense here."
Madden,3a4sbq,mbcowner,5,Fri Jun 19 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"i agree, To me , its more about Football than names. Which is all people who say they they wont play it cause its not NFL, are those only stuck on nothing more than names. At the same time those same people have cried for years about how un-authentic madden gameplay is . So the question becomes, which is it your care more about? Names, or gameplay? This game sounds like it will be very customizable, and who knows where that could lead us. Id give it a shot at least and see. We see how hard NBA Live has had to try each year to try and catch up with 2K . We need competition back in football gaming , reguardless of if you want to play an non NFL game or not, you want your NFL game to be the best it can be. So that being the case and this being the ONLY shot at any type of comp to make EA step up their game... we all need to support this in every way we can."
Madden,3a4sbq,derrtybird,3,Wed Jun 17 12:56:28 2015 UTC,"All we need is one football game other than Madden to sell.  It doesn't matter if it has NFL players.  If it sells well, the NFL would see this and not give EA exclusivity.  Even if you don't like having generic players, buy it anyway so we get the competition going."
Madden,3a4sbq,DWolford32,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:54:33 2015 UTC,"See the thing is, the NFL couldn't care less about anything other than money when it comes to Madden. If EA pay up for exclusivity, they will get it. That's exactly what happened with NFL 2K. They released a better product for only $20, and then Madden bought out the rights and killed the competition. It's sad but they need to make a game with a great editor software so we the players can make custom rosters with real names. Like what Pro Evolution Soccer and NCAA did."
Madden,3a4sbq,steach91,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:51:01 2015 UTC,2k was not a better product.  It WAS better at some things.  And TERRIBLE at others.
Madden,3a4sbq,DWolford32,2,Fri Jun 19 21:30:51 2015 UTC,"I remember nfl 2k5 being far ahead of madden 2005, while being $20 vs $40. The gameplay was great and the features like the house made if feel like a great experience. I believe it even had first person play which was pretty far ahead of its time."
Madden,3a4sbq,steach91,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:35:24 2015 UTC,"2k5 was good with some features, better than madden. But, due to the console limitations at the time it compromised other areas.  Presentation and gameplay as a whole Madden was light years ahead.  (Minus the halftime show if you care about those things).   2k5 was far superior in physics at the time, maybe to this day.  But the players on the field ice skated, a lot of the animations weren't as fluid.  Impacts, weight, and physics were awesome though, as was the commentary. 2k gets major kudos for their sideline/reporting portion as the simply duplicated ESPN's format (aka Berman)   2k had already been around the football players worlds since the Sega dreamcast days.  The were never able to replicate Madden's success.  Because they were not able to take the lead in the football gaming wars, they reduced their price point to $19.99 which was $30 less than Madden, in an attempt to win over the wallet of consumers.  2k Football had been always the 2nd game purchased.    Both Madden & 2k's largest target market is 13-21 year old males, the majority of which parents buy the game for them. It was a brilliant strategy at the time, but backfired a little. 2k had always been more of a 2nd football game purchase.  People tended to purchase Madden first, and then purchase 2k later in the year, mainly around Xmas.   Madden dramatically outsold 2k, despite their monstrous upgrades in the 2k5 release, but the $20 purchase price left initial consumers feeling it was a game of less quality, and pushed it to a 2nd to buy purchase even more.    2k's trophy system is probably far superior to the current trophy system even today.  The crib (I hated) but most people enjoyed decorating.  And the first person viewpoint was mostly an unplayable flop, but it was a revolutionary idea at the time.   So don't get me wrong. 2k did a lot of things right, mostly the physics and cut scene graphics.  But madden was a far superior game overall.  The sales support that.    2k has gotten a much greater cult following in recent years more because of people tired of the exclusive license, and wanting a 2nd quality game to play.  Kind of like some movies that aren't great success at the box office, but become cult following that everyone has to watch."

I'm more pissed about all of the build up and hype of it just for it to end up being a mobile game with a later PC release. They deliberately let the hype train build up, not saying a word about the platform, and then legitimately seemed embarrassed when the dev had to say it was a mobile game during the interview."

Madden,39yftz,mastererrl,16,Tue Jun 16 03:59:03 2015 UTC,Gang tackling? Separated catch types? Actual DB interaction? For once I actually believe they went in depth into upgrading the gameplay because of how meh the graphics look. Getting pretty hyped for this game.
Madden,39yftz,Dropthatbass13,14,Mon Jun 15 22:19:30 2015 UTC,"Thus is Madden MO forever. They have already had these things in the game, but take the  out and rename them.

Madden,39yftz,goddammnick,6,Mon Jun 15 23:57:20 2015 UTC,"I understand they already had these features in the game, but what they did, hold on to your ass, is improve on the mechanics of it.

Madden,39yftz,cookster123,-2,Tue Jun 16 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"You're right, they had more catches before."
Madden,39yftz,goddammnick,21,Tue Jun 16 00:09:25 2015 UTC,I honestly thought Madden easily had the worst preformence of the EA Sports games. Every game mentioned pushing advances in gameplay and what do we get? A fucking Ultimate Team mode where you can draft 3 guys and play a few quick games. Couple that with the terrible player models that still are somehow sticking around and I could see Madden's sales dropping dramatically this year. Absolutely pathetic.  Edit: How can they still have Aaron Rodgers's model look that bad? Not like he's the MVP of the league or anything.
Madden,39yftz,cookster123,9,Mon Jun 15 21:30:57 2015 UTC,"if done right, the WR/DB interaction can be good. But absolutely agree, visuals look like trash in motion edit: and that draft mode is pointless like you mentioned. Instead of focusing on gameplay, they add a feature like that which probably took all of 20 minutes"
Madden,39yftz,lookingforanOD,2,Mon Jun 15 22:25:18 2015 UTC,"A lack of competition will do that to a mega sports franchise. Madden feels lazy as fuck compared to FIFA or 2K, because they've had real competition over the years."
Madden,39yftz,ENKC,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:13:36 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you, let's be honest. The average consumer probably will not know or care about any of this and it's still going to sell very well. Even if Montana Football ends up being very solid, I don't think Madden's sales will drop dramatically. A good number of people would switch but most of the people who play high school or younger will probably still get Madden because A. JM16 is a new game while Madden has been there bread and butter, and B. I bet a decent amount of that same demographic really doesn't know Montana that well so his name won't make them switch over."
Madden,39yftz,dubblechzburger,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:17:37 2015 UTC,You'd be surprised Madden has actually made advances in the last few years. Doesn't seem like that is the case this year and I think sales will reflect that.
Madden,39yftz,cookster123,8,Tue Jun 16 04:00:14 2015 UTC,Well....I like where this is going. I'm okay with the graphics not looking too different as long as the physics are awesome.

Madden,3a1u5v,legaljoker,2,Tue Jun 16 15:58:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, but this is madden   If you don't give any safety help over top and start pressing, for example, you're going to get abused deep.  Furthermore, Sherman does get beaten playing man coverage a good deal in real life. Several teams will stack WR's and force Sherman to play off man, before running an underneath route. So depending on what you're running, those short throws beating Sherman aren't that shocking, it happens to everyone. Then you have curl routes/ double move routes (post-corners) and what not. Coupled with the qb being able to roll out into these throws as well, there are endless number of ways for you to lose playing man. Why don't teams just do that to Sherman all day long? Well, because it's also stupid to run man all game long. That's why zone coverage exists, and the best defense occurs when you can confuse the offense. For example, cover 3 looks almost identical to cover 1 robber. If they're expecting a flood concept/ slant-flat/ smash/ any other zone beating coverage to work and then you jump out in man, especially with the linebacker dropping into a hook zone, you cause chaos. Conversely, if you're running cover 1 robber a lot and drop into cover 3 zone, that slant route that may have just been audibled to will not do a thing.  Point being, you need to balance what you're running. Sticking to man alone isn't going to win you games."
Madden,3a1u5v,v66fender66v,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"Ik, I hardly run man I'm just annoyed that I can never run man."
Madden,3a1u5v,v66fender66v,3,Tue Jun 16 17:53:04 2015 UTC,"You can run man! You just have to mix in zone. I'll often come out in a cover 2 zone and slowly transition to 2 man under. Then, when they think they have me figured out, I'll throw in the cover 1 robber disguised as 2 man under. The SS in the hook zone will shit on the crossing routes/ post routes/ slant routes that everyone loves to abuse if you can user properly.   Every defense can be beat. You just have to look at what the other guy is running. For example, if it's all corner routes and outs/ curls, I'm not running man at all."
Madden,3a1u5v,travhow,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:27:14 2015 UTC,"I run majority of the time with the cowboys and our mediocre corners. Yeah they get beat some times, but usering a linebacker or safety helps, esp in yellow zones"
Madden,39zctp,EarnedRadz,2,Tue Jun 16 00:40:11 2015 UTC,By far the best feature they took away from us.
Madden,39zctp,robmcfaul,2,Tue Jun 16 02:14:23 2015 UTC,If they ever bring it back I hope they let you do it in an online franchise instead of just individual online matches only
Madden,39ym49,modrewgnu,9,Mon Jun 15 21:13:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've never cared about the penalty system. It happened infrequently on 15 and that was fine. All that increasing the frequency of penalties will do is increase the frequency of games being won and lost because of things entirely out of the player's control.   I get that's what it's like in real life, but I don't think it translates well to a sports video game.  Wish they'd have focused on any one of the dozens of other shortcomings with the franchise."
Madden,39ym49,inhumancode,5,Mon Jun 15 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"I could see it working depending on how it's implemented. Some ways it could work:   a penalty rating or trait that affects how aggressive a player plays.  work how often specific penalties are committed into existing penalties like press coverage, pass block, or tackling.  be able to set how aggressive your team plays. Set your DBs to play aggressive and they'll get beat on the press less often and might grab a guy down field to save a big play, but they'll get called more often. Set your O-line and they'll hold blocks for longer, but will get flagged more often."
Madden,39ym49,berychance,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:10:28 2015 UTC,Looks like they are implementing penalties based on at least the first two of your bullet points. There is a new penalty trait for players and certain types penalties get called more based on the type of player.

Madden,39ym49,kylerm42,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:54:29 2015 UTC,"Main details are: The following penalties will now be included in the game, Encroachment, False Start, Offensive Holding, Facemask, Defensive Pass Interference, Illegal Block in the Back, Neutral Zone Infraction, Defensive Holding, Illegal Forward Pass, Illegal Touching, Delay of Game, Kick Catch Interference Running into the Kicker, Unnecessary Roughness and Roughing the Passer.

Illegal touching? Still no intentional grounding?  The fact that it is essentially just a penalty rating each player has just seems lazy by EA, not that I expected any better. And I'm not confident in its implementation either. I can only imagine that the new increased frequency will lead to bogus calls. I can see WRs being shoved out by DBs and getting illegal touching penalties, defenders getting PI calls on balls thrown to somebody else, etc."
Madden,39ym49,mastererrl,2,Tue Jun 16 02:41:10 2015 UTC,Intentional grounding was in M25 and possibly earlier versions too?
Madden,39ym49,Milo_TheLegend,0,Tue Jun 16 10:20:20 2015 UTC,"I don't care about all the penalties, I just really hope when your WR gets blown up by an LB over the middle (past 5 yards) before the ball gets there, and then the pass is off target that PI is called.

Madden has probably the worst franchise and career modes out of all sports games yet it's the most popular sport played in America. For once I'm seriously considering not buying Madden for the first time in years. EA has managed to completely fuck up one of the most renowned sports series on the market. The UI is awful, there really is no superstar mode, there's no true franchise mode and connected careers is shit.

Madden,39xaxx,Coteup,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:41:08 2015 UTC,Really? I thought it was pretty agreed upon at this point that it would be a duo release.

Madden,39xaxx,leftshoe18,2,Mon Jun 15 19:08:47 2015 UTC,That doesn't make any sense. Plenty of games so far have been announced as duo-releases at the Xbox one conference that won't be announced at the PC conferences. Why can't it work the other way around?

Madden,39zrg5,MrGravy92,3,Tue Jun 16 02:43:25 2015 UTC,Generally if the play is deemed challengeable (spelling) then you can press LT/L2 once you break the huddle and you will challenge it.
Madden,39zrg5,HoldenL9,2,Tue Jun 16 15:11:48 2015 UTC,So this is why i challenge plays by accident all the time.
Madden,39zrg5,bquinho,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:08:30 2015 UTC,"I'm confused because you are supposed to just pause during huddle and select it from the menu.  Whenever I play head to head, the menu button says there is nothing to challenge."
Madden,39zrg5,HoldenL9,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:50:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm I'm not sure, I haven't tried pausing to challenge in a while. Anytime I want to challenge I just press LT out of the huddle to see if the game will let me challenge it."
Madden,39yzpn,mcorcoran3,2,Mon Jun 15 22:54:09 2015 UTC,Defense is way too important to sacrifice one of your studs for that WR (6/106).  I bet you could grab a rookie WR and have him in the 90s after one year with that QB of yours. I cut the wide out.
Madden,39yzpn,readyforlaunch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, I can replace this WR if I have to. He is a stud -- up to 99 speed, 99 acc, 99 agility. And he was drafted at age 20, so he is very young. I will probably cap my offers at 6/76 (about 12.5 mil per year). I have seen WRs accept similar contracts when asking for 6/106.   I am not too worried about my lbs. One guy accepted 3 years 15 million (didn't even want to negotiate). Another guy can be franchised for 6 million. So the only one I might let walk is a MLB who is a 91, but I am 3-deep with 90+ MLB.   I"

Madden,39ytw6,kdeezey,3,Tue Jun 16 00:35:19 2015 UTC,"It's to keep the economy under control. The tax is one way to take some coins out of the market. Without it, inflation would get out of hand."
Madden,39ytw6,AgaliareptX,0,Tue Jun 16 00:53:53 2015 UTC,Explain.
Madden,39ytw6,AgaliareptX,3,Tue Jun 16 00:59:25 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but it's basic real-life economy stuff. There's a few ways that coins enter the MUT market. Solo challenge rewards, Online H2H rewards, quicksell sets, etc. Now those coins need a way to leave the market, otherwise they build up. Sure people are buying packs, but when you consider the fact that you can buy packs/bundles with real money, the coins generally build up faster than they leave the market. The auction tax helps relieve this somewhat.  For example, were you playing MUT when the Gauntlet was first released? EA basically gave everyone 200k free coins through the solo challenges and prices of players on the market skyrocketed. Thanks to the tax, among other things, eventually things settled back down."

Madden,39yngw,6enericUsername,2,Mon Jun 15 21:42:56 2015 UTC,"A) I think you can only edit cosmetic things -- equipment, jersey size etc... except during roster adjustments when you have more freedom to change positions. As far as I know, attributes, age etc... are off limits  B) I don't notice that -- it is not uncommon for the top QBs in my franchise to get 5000 yards or close  C) Don't use owner mode, so I have no clue, though someday I want a team in Dublin.   d) I only notice that with aging QBs -- otherwise there are occasional younger guys (Tannehill for instance was on the Falcons, and Manziel went everywhere). But Cam Newton was extended 6 years in my CFM and played out the deal before he started carouseling around the league."
Madden,39yngw,mcorcoran3,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:58:19 2015 UTC,"A) Just their equipment/jersey# I think  B) No. I'm in year ~10 and if anything it's slightly over inflated for me  C) Yep, I don't know why they don't make a feature like they had with teambuilder for NCAA  D) Yes. 90+ OVR QBs should not hit the open market until well into their 30's, but it happens all the time. Gotta assume it's a cap issue wit the CPU teams not planning ahead for their QB's massive contracts and being able to free up enough space."

Madden,39ylkn,mcorcoran3,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"We won't know a solitary player that will be in your pick, but my advice would be to watch the draft stories closely -- they are de-facto cheat sheets on development trait. I have never seen a positive draft story without at least having a Quick Development trait. Also, keep a close eye on stories where a guy was cited as having the ""fastest 40 time"" or was an Olympic sprinter etc... which indicates speed! I don't even bother scouting the D-trait of those guys because I know it will be good and I can use the 500 pts to scout on other guys.   Another good tip for O-lineman in the early rounds is to look for B intangibles or above.   Lastly, I have found if a guy has A spd, it can mean anywhere from 88 to 98 spd -- but if they have a B or an A kick return the offs of their speed being on the high end is good. I have spent the 750 points to scout speed, but only on tie-breaking first round picks.  I should note a lower kick return doesn't mean they won't be slow -- I have seen F kick returns have 97 speed, but if it is B or above they will most likely be at least 93 speed, and often higher."

What I don't like about the slower TEs (even the blocking player type ones) are they're weak as all hell (>65 STR)."
Madden,39w794,Warmaster91,3,Mon Jun 15 14:03:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is more realistic to cap TE speed in the 80s (probably even the mid-80s, given a fair amount of cornerbacks and WRs have mid 80s speed). But it would be cool to find one. I am 10 years into a franchise and I have never seen a prospect, or even a current TE that I didn't scout, with what would translate to A sped.  I don't really need my TEs to be super fast, though. They don't get a lot of YAC.   They should give the TEs better run blocking at times. Almost every TE that wasn't a real-life player has sub 70 run blocking, save for a TE I had drafted who I poured XP into."

I can really see them developing into the next big offensive thing (read option being the last) with Gronkowski as the gold standard. The defensive shifts made to defend these players just doesn't work in madden which is a shame. To cap it would make it more balanced but not more realistic at least from the player ability perspective

Madden,39w794,Warmaster91,4,Mon Jun 15 15:04:48 2015 UTC,M25's draft classes were so different. There were first round players and then besides that the other 90% were athletically deficient (too slow/weak) to compare to any existing players.  One of M25's story players was a safety with high 60s speed...who the hell wants that? Or the running back compared to Darren Sproles who had high 60s ACC.

Madden,39ukcg,Dbash56,5,Sun Jun 14 22:21:45 2015 UTC,"The Oakland Raiders were relocated to London, becoming the NFL's first ever English team. They made some great signings to build their franchise around, Dez Bryant was set to be the face of the franchise for the next 10 years, with Carson Palmer steering the ship around at QB until they find a rookie.  The first game of the season was a home game for the London Raiders, going up against Peyton Mannings Bronco's. The Raiders received and instantly began driving up the field with a flurry of short passes and strong runs by HB Darren McFadden, before Palmer sold the play action and hit TE Marcel Reece in open space, he trucked one defender and outran the rest before sliding into the endzone for a 60 yard TD reception.  With the Raiders up 7-0 Manning went to work, carving up the inexperienced London defence. 3rd and 12 on the Raiders 30, Manning drops back and fires a bullet to DT on an out route who somehow manages to catch it before going out of bounds at the 3. The play was however reviewed and overturned, forcing Denver to take the 3 points.  The Raiders struggled on their next drive, with McFadden getting stuffed on first down, then Palmer's bullet pass was dropped by Eric Decker who would have been able to put them in a 3rd and short situation. 3rd and long Palmer drops back and see's Dez in 1 on 1 coverage and lobs it up. The pass was underthrown and picked off. Denver had a few run plays before heading into half time down 7-3.  Denver received to start the second half as Manning silenced the London crowd with a 40 yard completion to Julius Thomas who beat a few defenders before he was tripped up at the half way line. On the following play Manning hit DT on a slant route as he juked one defender then outpaced the rest, walking into the endzone untouched and taking a 10-7 lead.   The Raiders focused on their run game as DMac went to work, taking the Raiders to the Denver 30 with only a hand full of runs, including a 23 yarder that could have gone all the way. As they worked into the end zone Palmer threw a fade to Dez in the endzone but he wasn't able to hang onto it and the pass was picked off before it hit the ground.  Denver was taking their time driving up the field through the work of CJ Spiller and Montee Ball, with 1:40 left on the clock CJ clutched a first and 10 with an incredible catch in traffic as he was piled on by 3 defenders. Manning dropped back on the following play before being pile driven by Marcell Dareus, he incredibly held onto the ball resulting in a 2nd and 16. Manning forced a pass to Julius Thomas in traffic which was too much for him to hold onto. On 3rd and long they went to DT on a WR Screen and he picked up 20 yards, and the first. The Broncs were now well and truly within field goal range so they continued feed CJ as the clock ran down. 3nd and 3 on the Raiders 12 with 30 seconds remaining CJ took the hand off to the left and passed the first down marker, before being simply obliterated by Mario Williams and coughing up the ball, the Denver offensive line somehow managed to recover the ball as it rolled back behind the first down marker. Denver opted to play it safe and take the 3.  With 1 timeout left and 12 seconds on the clock Golden Tate received the Squib kick and went down as quickly as possible. The Raiders were left with 1 timeout and 7 seconds, with 60 yards to go. The Raiders brought out all their Ferraris and sent them deep, with Marcel Reece on a slant across the middle. The coverage was good and Palmer fired it to Reece who picked up 15 and they instantly called a timeout.  45 yards to go and 2 seconds on the clock. Decker and Tate to the left, Ricardo Lockette and Dez Bryant to the right. Marcel Reece and DMac in pass protect. Palmer in the gun, drops back with all the time in the world, see's Dez in 1 on 1 coverage and throws up a prayer. The ball is underthrown and the CB is in a good position to make a play on the ball or make the tackle. Dez leaps up into the air before Cortland Finnegan can even get close to it, Dez comes down with a spin as he beats Finnegan with speed to the Endzone. Dez Throws up the X to the London crowd as he brings them their first ever victory in their first ever game."
Madden,39ukcg,switchn,2,Mon Jun 15 03:11:53 2015 UTC,"It is the second half of the AFCCG in the year 2024: Pat's vs Broncos -- in the snow at Mile High  I was leading 21-17 (mid-third QTR) and faced a 3rd and 20 from the 46. My QB -- a 99 OVR 93 spd, 93 acc, 2nd year guy who was picked in the 6th round -- scrambled (which I almost never do due to constant injuries) 14 yards without sliding to get in FG range. But he got hurt 8 weeks and was out for the rest of the playoffs.   Then my FG kicker, facing tough wind, had a 45-yard FG hit both the side post and the crossbar and fell out -- no good.   And then Denver scored a TD, had a 3 and out against me (two bad running plays and a sack), backup still hadn't thrown a pass). and then another TD .   They are up by 10 with 9 minutes left and my unproven backup (third year QB) was down 10, in the AFC CG with out a single pass even thrown in the playoffs. Between the news of the injury, the missed FG and the 14-0 Denver run, the feeling was total dejection. Not to mention the snow was out, they had the wind, and the stamina at Mile High sucks and I was seeing third sting bench guys come in who hadn't played a snap all year due to natural stamina issues.   On his first drive he went 4-4 and scored a passing TD on 3 and 9. So I was then down 31-28. Then my defense held Denver to a FG so it was 34-28 with 2.01 to go. On the last drive he went 2-2 and threw the go ahead TD with 30 seconds left.   But Denver had 3 TOs and 36 seconds their KR made it out to the 35 -- so they only needed 25-30 yards for a FG. After using my pass-rushing LOLB, who I used to pass rush on most plays, to USER man Julies Thomas (who was fucking killing me), their QB, himself a backup to an MVP, looked off J Thomas and tried going long to D Thomas (age 36, speed 96 -- go figure) who was one-on-one with my CB, Rondell Landrum (94 spd, 94 overall, 28). He threw it 55 yards to Thomas on the first play but Landrum picked it off in a jump ball. Had Thomas caught it, they would have been in line for a 27 yard FG attempt, or a TD.  But they had 3 TO still, so I needed to run the ball 3 times and get a first to run out the clock. I ran the ball twice and had a 3 and 2 with about 15 seconds lest. I ran for a first down, but they called a flag, stopping the clock with no TO (holding offense, 10 yard, repeat third down) and I had a third and 10, with 10 seconds left and had to decide to run it, using up their last TO, but also having to punt it on 4th down and risk a PR or hail Mary (and they only needed 3 to win). So my backup QB decided to try and throw for the first down -- and he did, with 1 second left he found my best WR on the sideline wheel route for 15 yards. Game over."
Madden,39u90p,mcorcoran3,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:45:42 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: I checked my depth chart and it is hard to find a direct correlation, though it might be a hint.   I have a corner with 94 speed, and an 85 KR attribute who is a 90 K returner on the depth chart, but a CB with 97 speed/30kR  who is only a 72.  Meanwhile, my slowest corner has 89 speed, 20 KR and is a 66 KR. So while I am perhaps an F kick return doesn't lessen speed per se, but it could be a hint (all of my KR OVERALLs above 90 have good speed). So my best is that if you made a Venn diagram it would reveal:  1) Some Corners (with A speed) with Low Kick Return Attributes are Fast  2) Some Corners with Low KR Attributes are Slower(ie 88-89 speed) 3) All Corners (with A speed) and High Kick Return numbers are fast  In other words, I suspect a B or an A KR will almost assure me of a guy being on the higher end of A speed, but I am not so confident someone with F kick return will be on the low end."
Madden,39u90p,switchn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"I think it is useful but not for the kind of accuracy you want in this situation. You already know the second guy is A speed A accel, the reason he has a low KR isn't going to be his speed."
Madden,39u90p,scottw5150,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:20:06 2015 UTC,"Well you can have A speed and still have 88 speed. That is the floor. I know it is not a guarantee but I have never seen a Kick Returner ranked above 90 with lower than 91 speed. I could use 1000 points to find out--which could spare me drafting a guy who is no better than the guy available at 47, and would likely net be a solid LT if I did, but then I would lose out on scouting d-trait on two new players. Tough call."

Madden,39u90p,A_V_,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"The verdict: CB 1 (B kick return, A speed, A Acc, Positive player story) had 98 speed (fastest I have seen for a rookie), 83 overall, Star Development.   CB2 (F kick return, A speed, A ACc, Quick Development) has 94 speed, 77 Overall.   So no conclusions can be drawn, but one might infer that a high kick return increases the chances of great speed, but low kick return doesn't mean guy will be on the low end of A speed. 94 is pretty damn good."

You can tell by how many variations of i-form they have usually, heh). All he should really be doing is establishing a run game, using short/medium play action passes, rb screens, and having a few pass plays out of 4/5 wr sets (for most other pass heavy plays I'd be in some form of singleback). If you don't have someone with a good amount of separation and you are missing their breaks just throw it away. Easy as pie. Hope this helps and sorry I couldn't list more playbooks.

That would've told me of any MVPs and stuff.    I retired him at the end of the season when they lost the wild card and got a head coaching job with the Bills.

Madden,39hvq9,mcorcoran3,15,Thu Jun 11 20:43:26 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try to come at this with a different perspective.  Scouting is something that is so hard to replicate, just as recruiting was.  There may not be a difference between something that is inherently ""realistic"" and something that produces realistic results.  Including the combine statistics will give you a pretty solid understanding of their physical characteristics, while the three attributes you scout will show you the strength of the player. That overall draft grade is a far better indicator than poking and prodding at various attributes.   The scouting system as it stood was not very realistic to begin with. I don't think perfect realism is achievable in scouting, but this mechanism may produce better results."
Madden,39hvq9,NateDogPack12,11,Fri Jun 12 01:23:44 2015 UTC,"I can't upvote this enough. Being able to find out the near exact intangibles of around 100 guys in madden 15, yet not being able to tell if a player's ""A"" speed is an 88 or a 99 is completely unrealistic. I for one, will be optimistic about this new system."
Madden,39hvq9,Philliefan12,-1,Fri Jun 12 01:33:08 2015 UTC,"You can tell that for 750 points. Expensive but speed is so valuable it ought to be. I have never spent 750 to figure out speed, but I would consider doing it if I was choosing between two WRs or two corners.   I don't scout intangibles at all -- when I have tried it, almost everyone is a C and I feel like I am wasting scouting points.   But, anyway, to only to be able to see 3 attributes at all? But to be able to find out the ""real draft value"" of 85 percent of all players? At least with this method you can build your own scouting method -- the new system takes any critical thought out of the process."
Madden,39hvq9,NateDogPack12,3,Fri Jun 12 03:29:48 2015 UTC,"If you haven't figured out by now the best method of scouting BY FAR is to scout intangible + physical if intangible is C or above, and only take interest in players with A/B physical and A/B and if absolutely necceserry C intangibles, you're scouting entirely the wrong way. It isn't surprising to see you complaining about the new scouting system when you don't realize how easy the old one was to break through."
Madden,39hvq9,Philliefan12,2,Fri Jun 12 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"Why should a large majority of your scouting points have to go into a rating that should be given to you considering the combine? And I wasn't even referring to the intangibles rating, more-so the specific ratings, but being able to scout something as vague as ""intangibles"" for so cheap is honstly one of the dumbest features I have ever heard of.  Edit: Also, I highly doubt that you will be able to find out the true value of more than 5-10% of the draft class, not 85."
Madden,39hvq9,mbcowner,3,Fri Jun 12 18:15:43 2015 UTC,"Welcome to CFM for casuals..... its dumbed down because its meant to ""draw in more casuals"" , to try to make it look like CFM has more people using it...... Enjoy the future of CFM that is coming.

He was the #1 WR in a 32-man league basically throughout the entire first season, and straight up won me the NFCCG on the most insane Catch & Run I've ever seen. In my offline CFM (now in 2020) he dominated in 2014, 2015, and 2016. After that his speed dropped off far too much (97 -> 94 -> 92 -> 81) and he lost his luster.  On an similar note FUCK the regression in this game. It's broken as hell. Blackmon dropped from 86 to 68 in ONE OFFSEASON. Larry Fitzgerald dropped to 80 speed after the 2014 season, and Jonathon Dwyer hit 70 speed after being top 5 three years running."
Madden,39bokc,I_Am_Hank_Hill_AMA,5,Thu Jun 11 02:35:23 2015 UTC,In Madden 25 player progression always seemed to get fucked up so I'd start Nate Ebner across from D-mac and he'd progress about 12 Ovr points per season.

So on the depth chart have him as your 1st string TE but if you want to give him a few runs you can change him to 1st string RB. Derrek Carrier (TE) is a great one for this, as is Golden Tate. With Tate I'd start him as my 1st string RB and change him to TE if my passing game is missing a bit of punch."
Madden,39a49c,lookingforanOD,7,Wed Jun 10 10:20:56 2015 UTC,Golden Tate at TE? That's so weak
Madden,39a49c,bquinho,-1,Wed Jun 10 19:52:21 2015 UTC,Why? How is it any different to running 4 WR's or something like that?
Madden,39a49c,drain_patience,3,Wed Jun 10 23:59:31 2015 UTC,Its cheese cause no one does that in real life. But if you're just doing offline cfm who cares.
Madden,39a49c,bquinho,5,Thu Jun 11 00:24:48 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, and yeah I only play offline franchise mode."
Madden,39a49c,drain_patience,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:30:55 2015 UTC,"So no one ever comes up with a new formation in real life?  Chip Kelly or belichek have to do it first, then you're allowed to.  'Cheese' has become my new key word in identifying poor losers."
Madden,39a49c,kksred,3,Thu Jun 11 03:30:50 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying, but if you put a WR in a 3 point stance on the line he is going to end up on his ass."
Madden,39a49c,drain_patience,-2,Thu Jun 11 04:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yes. And your point? That can and does happen in Madden.  Go ahead. Put Tate at tight end. I'll press man him with a linebacker assigned to blitz that I manually adjust from zone blitz coverage. Or a safety. Strength supercedes release, if the player pressing has anything close to decent press skills.  There are ways to defeat anything and everything in madden. The idea that 'cheese' exists anymore is laughable."
Madden,39a49c,kksred,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:42:49 2015 UTC,Awareness blitzes are a thing though.
Madden,39a49c,wahmeister,2,Thu Jun 11 17:42:07 2015 UTC,And they are not unstoppable. HB draws are a thing. No one calls them cheese.
Madden,39a49c,wahmeister,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:14:45 2015 UTC,"And that's why its cheese. If your opponent runs awareness blitzes along with draw stuffing plays, you are screwed.  If its 3rd and long, you might as well punt the ball."

Madden,39a49c,qwertyqyle,0,Thu Jun 11 08:44:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's only cheese if it's exploiting poor game mechanics, but people these days use the term for anyone who does something they don't like."
Madden,39a49c,Tricky_j,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:36:23 2015 UTC,"Fact, just because they can't admit they are shit at defense or dunno how to stop the play. Just fuckin admit the loss. I find with Madden that MOST people are sore losers and quitters and therefore the majority are shit compared to other games. Must be a culture of sore losers within Madden or something?"
Madden,39a49c,mcorcoran3,0,Thu Jun 11 08:46:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I appreciate your maturity in stating that you see that fact. Believe me, there are a few schemes I struggle against, but it isn't because they're cheese.  I would appreciate your intelligence in being able to see it's not cheese, but that would be acting as if these 'anti-cheesers' don't see it; they do. They just don't want to admit it."
Madden,39a49c,cg11915,5,Thu Jun 11 05:51:39 2015 UTC,I know this is not what you mean. And this player is already great.  But I think Darrell Revis would be a phenomenal center fielder in the MLB.
Madden,39a49c,pc14,3,Thu Jun 11 23:50:19 2015 UTC,tim tebow in my local 12 man franchise was moved to fb. he went on to catch 850 yrds and 11 rec tds 340 yards rushing 5 rush tds. i used him like an hback the same position everyone wanted to move him it in the first place. every one was pissed because once i got his trucking to a 90 + it was over lol trucked 2 ppl to te endzone and did his cat daddy haha
Madden,39a49c,dbills12,2,Wed Jun 10 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"I don't like moving WRs to rb or TE -- I feel it is sort of unrealistic to have guys like Tavon Austin and M Goodwin at RB, which was common in some online CFMs. I have never seen a TE with better than B speed in the draft (they may exist, but it I am 10 year in a CFM and the fastest TE is probably an 87).   I do have some luck moving Jamie Collins to LE, although I don't actually make the position switch, I just put him there on nickel situations when I only have two linebackers."
Madden,39a49c,MediocreJesus,3,Wed Jun 10 14:02:40 2015 UTC,"Tavon Austin actually started his college career as a RB, then was switched to receiver in the following seasons.  In 2012 they put him back at RB against Oklahoma and he DESTROYED them with 344 yds rushing and 82 yds receiving."
Madden,39a49c,NoButtholeNoCare,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:24:13 2015 UTC,"Dezrick Carr on M25 is a 6""6 TE who starts with 90 speed 90 accell, not sure about M15 though."

Madden,396p1g,grohling24,40,Tue Jun 9 17:23:44 2015 UTC,"Man, some of you guys are setting yourselves up to get hurt. I hope it rocks, but first year sports games rarely know it out of the park. It's part of the reason it's so hard to set up against EA."
Madden,396p1g,babooyagoo,19,Tue Jun 9 21:59:50 2015 UTC,"We all know it's going to have its issues/glitches, it won't be perfect. What we're all excited for is the competition. For the first time in a while we have a choice in what football game we want, that's a big deal.   Just look at NBA2k/NBALive."
Madden,396p1g,Flexidry_,16,Tue Jun 9 22:29:42 2015 UTC,"^ This, it may be the biggest POS game we have seen, but it will still drum up interest from now madden players and will force EA to actually try."
Madden,396p1g,Gallade3,4,Tue Jun 9 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly, if they can do well or be innovative in certain areas and need to improve on just a few things, it could make EA take notice and really step up to improve Madden 17."
Madden,396p1g,dubblechzburger,3,Wed Jun 10 03:28:20 2015 UTC,I can see the crash and burn but really any other football game would be fresh to see. Have some other minds work on a game we all love.
Madden,396p1g,Teves3D,2,Wed Jun 10 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"Take it with a huge pinch of salt obviously but the forum post that leaked a lot of information said that is tested extremely well.      Actually, ""well"" is an understatement. People went crazy. NDA's were and still are in place for them. That's why you haven't heard anyone saying anything, but a lot of people are having a very hard time because what they seen was unbelievable and it's been impossible to go back to Madden or even take Madden seriously after that. It's like, how you felt when you had an NES and you saw Sega Genesis for the first time.

Madden,396p1g,bluebird2912,3,Wed Jun 10 12:39:00 2015 UTC,Keep it mind that it's being built with the 2K crew (with the addition of Microsoft's budget). People still give high praise to NFL 2k5 to this day
Madden,396p1g,opaz,6,Wed Jun 10 05:58:15 2015 UTC,"None of the above is true. 2K is confirmed to have no involvement in this game (Operation Sports confirmed that fact multiple times), and to this point there is no confirmation that Microsoft is involved, only speculation."
Madden,396p1g,CM_Hooe,2,Wed Jun 10 16:28:41 2015 UTC,Where? I've seen everything being locked on OS

Madden,396p1g,ab__,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"2k is not involved... FORMER employees that worked on NFL 2k5 are involved. And Microsoft is backing it, because Montana has tweeted about being on the MS campus a couple of times."
Madden,396p1g,osubeavs721,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"1 - Visual Concepts (the game studio behind the biggest 2K Sports games) has seen very little staff turnover, even since NFL 2K5 and All Pro Football 2K8. Most of the NFL 2K staff was merged into the NBA 2K staff following the exclusivity agreement. Even if there are former employees of VC involved - which there is zero official confirmation of anywhere, it's all baseless speculation coming from one post on OS which has been discredited countless times yet people still believe it because they want to - it's not many.  2 - That Joe Montana visited Microsoft once doesn't necessarily mean anything at all, either. There's no announcement from Microsoft, there's no announcement from anyone. We don't even know the company making this hypothetical game yet. No game has even been announced; right now it's vaporware. It's all baseless rumor and people connecting dots where they think they see a connection.  Look, if it turns out there is a game, I'll be happy too. I'd welcome competition in the football space to give Madden NFL a push. I'd also like to see whatever game this is at E3 next week, given that I'll be at the conference myself. I'm not, however, going to count any chickens before they hatch. The football community has done this song and dance too many times before, what with an NFL 2K comeback rumor almost every single year since the exclusivity arrangements between the EA and the NFL + NFLPA were signed."
Madden,396p1g,CM_Hooe,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:58:40 2015 UTC,"exclusivity arrangements between the EA and the NFL + NFLPA were signed.   It's a third party license... MS can get a first party license.    That Joe Montana visited Microsoft once doesn't necessarily mean anything at all, either   He's visited a few times and it's not for shits and giggles. Also, look at the dev going into the game just with pics on the article and the mo-cap stuff Montana himself has posted. This is going to be a full fledge game. The only question is, will it have the NFL license? And that's why Montana would meet with MS.    Visual Concepts (the game studio behind the biggest 2K Sports games) has seen very little staff turnover   You have no source for this. You're just making shit up here. There are legit dots to connect and you don't want to see them... Oh and OS has ""discredited"" a post. The OS madden community is a complete joke, so I don't really care if they ""discredited"" it."

Ronnie Morales of 2K Sports tweeted as recently as last year that the NFL license exclusively belonged to someone else.   He's visited a few times and it's not for shits and giggles.   I doubt he visited MS for dinner and drinks either, but that doesn't mean anything meaningful will come of it. I've spoken to Microsoft a few times as well, they'll talk to a lot of people.   The only question is, will it have the NFL license? And that's why Montana would meet with MS.   If Mr. Montana wanted an NFL license, he'd go speak with the NFL at their headquarters in New York or with the NFLPA at their headquarters in D.C. Talking to Microsoft doesn't do anything for him here. The NFL and NFLPA are very protective of their intellectual property and I very sincerely doubt they'd ever delegate IP licensing discussions to a third party.  It also doesn't explain why his company would release a screenshot without the NFL license in place if they were actively pursuing the thing. All that does is confuse the hypothetical game's potential consumer base.   You have no source for this. You're just making shit up here.   My source is me. I'm an independent video game developer and video game studio owner who has personal contacts at Visual Concepts. Further, I'm a member of the forum staff at Operation Sports, and other forum staff members with more important personal contacts at Visual Concepts than I have access to have corroborated the same information. On top of that, I wouldn't waste my time on Reddit making things up, I honestly have better things to do than waste people's time with deliberately false information.  Unrelated, I'd appreciate in the future if we could keep things civil before insults start flying. :)"

I would like to say, Joe has already been talking with the NFLPA back in april 2013 . Even says so in this video :http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/22/first-look-at-imfl-joe-montanas-social-fantasy-football-app-tctv/ at the 6:14 - 645  mark . He does say they have been going back and fourth with them, but he has been talking to them.And yes i know this is about a supposed APP that never really went anywhere. They also made a point a few times to let it be known he was still looking at doing another video game. Also kind of made mention about madden.   Having said that, i really think some things they mentioned in this video is about their video game they were making back then.I just hope that JM16 is not somehow tied to what they showed in the ""app"" they demoed in this video. I dont care about ""guessing"" plays and their outcome for ""points"" . So if that is somehow a part of JM16... well , its not going to turn out that well, if that is a main part of the game."

My company is ROOT 76, LLC., an independent game studio in Richmond VA which officially opened its doors last fall. My previous employer was SRRN Games, a startup created in 2009 by grad students at The University of Virginia, where I went to school studying computer science. The most notable games I've worked on with SRRN Games were Ash and Ash II: Shadows, two iOS JRPGs, the former which won a few indie game of the year awards from a few smaller outlets and the latter of which was published by Konami. I worked on a funded contract on a PSVITA video game prototype for Sony Computer Entertainment with SRRN during Fall 2013. A former colleague of mine at SRRN Games who attended the University of Illinois works at Visual Concepts today as a software engineer on NBA 2K, he currently works on the MyTeam component of that game. I will refrain from naming him because that's irrelevant.  I have no reason to lie to you, and I'm not.

That's not to say JM16 can't or won't be a good game, it will just be incredibly basic and it will struggle in a lot of places that I'm not sure existing Madden fans will have the patience for.  As someone who has owned all the recent attempts at establishing a new football rival to Madden (Backbreaker, Blitz, All Pro Football, etc.) I'm well aware that these games ship with some big ass things that most fans will not be able to get passed. To build a fully functional and deep football game is tough enough, to add in features that players will want over Madden, all in your first try? Impossible. If fans want a legitimate threat to the Madden throne they'll need to support JM16 even with its issues for at least the first 2 years. I think it will take at least 3 iterations of the game before you see a legit contender."
Madden,396p1g,RyvenZ,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"The rumors indicate this game has been in development for some time. With Microsoft backing, the sky could be the limit. The fact that it's a new football game for Windows is what sold me. The thing could be dog crap, but if the engine is good and the community can mod it, then I couldn't care less about bugs or missing features. Plus, if we purchase it, for better or worse, the studio will greenlight a sequel and then we have a match. NFL 2K5 wasn't a better game than Madden, but it was close enough that EA pulled the biggest bullshit move and bought an exclusive license. They would rather snuff the competition, than compete. This has lead to a plethora of features being removed with each new engine and having them added back in years later as if we'd never seen them before. Fuck EA and their practices.

This is the first time in console gaming, that the console is making a profit at launch. Usually they try and future proof them, take a hit and keep them on par with a high end PC at the time.   Well this gen is a low end budget PC. A GTX 750TI out performs them graphically and there are a slew of processors that out pace them. The fact you can built a $400 PC and out perform the consoles is not a good thing for the console users. I bought an XB1 and I haven't played a game on it in 8 good months. I play pretty much on PC for the most part now because the experience is better. I can use any controller or mouse and keyboard.

Madden,39awdh,mcorcoran3,7,Wed Jun 10 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"""nano blitzes"" no longer exist.  Nano blitzes were originally blitzes that you could set up that would sack the QB before he completed a drop back or hand the ball off.   However, there still is Awareness Blitzes that require a set up that result in faster than normal pressure than what they should get.  Basically if you put certain players in certain players there is a known response that causes the inside blocker to ignore a rusher to block the outside rusher.    That concept goes against very basic football 101 pass rushing.  So you get hear faster."
Madden,39awdh,steach91,3,Wed Jun 10 15:51:25 2015 UTC,I see. Is it so indefensible that it should be outlawed in leagues?

Madden,39awdh,steach91,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:25:26 2015 UTC,"Most SIM leagues ban those types of blitzes because it's an obvious manipulation of the game.  There is no way to stop it, but you can play around it with a quick slant etc.   But they severely limit your offensive play calling in an unrealistic fashion.   The underlying issue is that the game doesn't learn that that blitz is coming. So it will react like its the first time it's ever seen it, every time.   I would have zero issues with them personally if the game picked up on it, and adjusted, forcing the opponent to change the blitz up"

Madden,398cvl,mcorcoran3,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"Although while these attributes raise the overall the most, it doesn't mean they are the best ones to add all the time.

Stamina is also important if you have stamina up above 60. and, of course, if you don't sim awareness for QB is worthless"

Madden,3994m0,BDJarko,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:16:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah online franchise robs you of the chance to ""back out"" of mistakes (with the exception of quitting mid-game). For instance, one time I changed Jurrell Casey from DE to DT, but I didn't like the attribute change, so I tried changing him back to RE and he lost several points overall (went from 98 to 92 or something) and I couldn't fix it. Had it been offline you could just exit the game without saving. This is also why re-signing guys in online such a crapshoot -- some guys might refuse to negotiate if you don't overpay them, and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it besides franchise them."
Madden,399472,mcorcoran3,2,Wed Jun 10 03:40:14 2015 UTC,I always do after free agency. I compile picks to fill holes. Free agency is for luxury pickups which I rarely indulge in.
Madden,399472,drain_patience,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:51:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have found if you develop players well, most of your cap space will go towards your own players in the re-sign period.  I recently, however, replaced my 25 million QB with a rookie who makes 500 k a year or something, so I have real cap space for the first time in 8 or 9 seasons. I did, however, pick up Trufant at CB in 2015 or 16 and A Barr in 2018 -- those are my only real free agents splurges. Now, I am in 2024 and the only free agents I tend to sign are  my own guys who I let test the market if they asked for too much money for me."
Madden,399472,drain_patience,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:07:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm about to let my qb walk after rookie deal. Deanthony Thomas and my o-line are the heart of the team, and keeping defensive players is also higher on my list of economic concerns. My tackles and guards are monsters and I know I can find a decent center.  So I'm just letting the qb go (99 overall in mobile qb system). Hell get paid immensely elsewhere, and as long as i beat my leaguemates(12 teams), I should have two rings for him to walk with, as we got one last year. Also my 92 overall 23 yr old center is gonna be allowed to walk.  Will draft replacements there high picks probably, then developmental guys late. Then abandon the draft except for low round picks a couple years to avoid high signing bonuses. Have to resign all my guards and tackles next year and really don't wanna let em walk, but I don't want a new stadium and I am the Bengals so it's been a tall task to manage the money concerns.   Usually a new stadium and winning fixes all concerns, but I am tired of new stadiums and this is more challenging."

Madden,395ulc,MProsserMMA,2,Tue Jun 9 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"I think he means re-sign the players that are up at the end of the year. . I never knew about this. I usually sign these guys early anyway, but didn't know it corresponded to smaller offers because of 0 production.   I have noticed, however, that some guys that ask for say, 5 years 60 million have accepted contracts that are  way low -- says 5 years 25 million or even 5 years 12.5 million etc... but others insist on getting every penny they ask for and more. I think, if you win a lot, some (but not all) players will sign for less since thye like your coach/scheme etc..."
Madden,395ulc,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:53:42 2015 UTC,Yes thats the case. But it means that the superstar that's 26 now and rated 95 gets paid $20 mil over 4 years instead of having to meet outrageous demands and pay $80 mil over 6.
Madden,395ulc,Brendan252,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:26:36 2015 UTC,Oh ya. Definitely. Re-sign everyone as soon as you can before you progress them all season and they want a ton of cash. I thought you were saying you could re-sign people of your choosing regardless of what was left on their current contract
Madden,395ulc,MProsserMMA,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:12:30 2015 UTC,"Yea. But even if you don't plan on progressing them, their cash expectations are mostly determined by their production I believe."
Madden,395ulc,Brendan252,3,Wed Jun 10 06:37:01 2015 UTC,"You should always be drafting rookies in all rounds to fill in spots on your roster, rookie contracts allow for maximum flexibility."
Madden,395ulc,a0wner1,3,Tue Jun 9 15:39:18 2015 UTC,"Rookie deals are key. In leagues i join i tend to get a lot of picks y1 or trade for rookies as they have favorable deals. After filling up you'll be able to make a splash in FA in y2-3.  High Bonus deals are good for players you NEVER are going to trade/cut as they will take a huge paycut for bonus heavy deals. Watch out though as madden makes bonus heavy deals backloaded as default.. Old players you sign in off-season FA or players you might not start 100% of the time they are there I almost always overpay and only give deals with no bonus money as they won't count towards the penalty if i trade/cut them. Try to sign them for a 1 year deal, huge money, and re-sign them on your own terms later. Signing low OVR, good physical trait FAs in year 1 is key. You can sign them to cheap sub 1m/yr for 6 years at the end of year 1. After a few seasons when they are your top players they will be really valuable with those contracts.  If you have any rules in the league this last tip doesn't work, but releasing your bad deals and re-signing them instantly to then re-sign them at the end of the season is a creative way of saving cap, as you will most of the time be able to negotiate a far cheaper deal than the one they had. Especially if their overall is lower. This also works if you sign a big name FA as explained in section 3. You sign them to a big deal, cut them and re-sign instantly just to give them a cheaper deal in the off-season This is not especially fair or sim-style but it works if you don't care about that."
Madden,395ulc,roxzt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:29:57 2015 UTC,"As others have said, you want to have a good amount of guys on their rookie deals -- it is not a bad idea to allow guys to walk after 4 years if they want a lot of money and you can find a replacement in the draft on a cost-controlled rookie deal.   Also, if you can find a good QB in the draft, it can save you 20+ million a year in salary which makes the cap situation possible.   I often like to sign guys to small signing bonuses if I can, so I can trade them even if they have 2 years left on there deal. Cap penalties are split 50/50 between the current year and the next so if you trade someone with two years left whatever cap penalty there exists is mitigated by the salary saved. If you trade (or cut) a guy with 1 year left, you actually will have 1 year where there is some cap penalty, but no corresponding savings in player salary."
Madden,395ulc,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"Also, try to draft rookies who are not 24, but are 20-21 etc... it doesn't always work out, but when possible it helps. If you draft a 24 year old he will ask for a new contract at age 27 and it will start at age 28, so if you give that player a second contract -- especially if the position is speed dependent like corner or WR -- try to limit it to 2-3 year and not 5-6. If you have to give them 5-6 years to get them to accept, make sure the bonus is such that the cap penalty will not be huge when you cut or trade them at age 30 or 31."
Madden,395ulc,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:49:23 2015 UTC,"Lastly, once your team is built up, I draft replacements for guys, even if they aren't due to leave the team for a year or two. This gives you a year or two to game prep them, and also allows you to have replacements in hand in case your current players want too much.   Also, if the player develops fast enough you can trade the guy he is replacing for good draft picks (which means more guys on rookie deals).   Lastly, while draft picks are cost-controlled for 4 years, remember that high first round picks actually have high signing bonuses -- the difference in pay between the 1 pick vs 32 is pretty significant, so if you like a player and can get them by trading down, or using a lower pick, you will have more cap money,   Also, if you do stockpile picks, remember that your salary cap space will be less when the off-season starts due to your rookie reserve going up. I have actually traded 2nd round picks in the current off-season for 2nd round picks the next season just to free up 1 million in cap space. If you traded a top 5 pick it might free up 5 million"
Madden,395ulc,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jun 9 20:57:36 2015 UTC,"How does it work with development in M15? I've decided to skip 15 and I will go from 25 to 16 when it comes out, but with M25 it seems if you aren't giving a player game time the will regress or if you are lucky they will stay the same, as the XP is earned during the games. Is this different with M15 game prep? Is getting a semi raw player that needs to improve a little and sitting them for 2 years while your vet finishes his career a viable option? It would be great if it was like that, I seem to have a fair bit of success getting players in the high 70's low 80's in the mid rounds of the draft, but I struggle to find a starting spot for them and they end up regressing and by the time I start them they are low 70s."
Madden,395ulc,switchn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:56:14 2015 UTC,"Well in Madden regression can be accelerated by inactivity for sure -- for one they don't meet weekly goals. But you can also use a ""game prep"" feature which allows you to add XP and confidence to players  - -so you can develop a rookie without playing him much. Right now I have a corner who I drafted at age 21, but he won't play until he is age 23, given the age and contracts of my top corners. So I devote Game Prep points to him - you get about 35 per week (varies depending on time between games) and it costs 8 hours per drill. So you can do 4 drills and add XP. If a player has slow development they may only earn a few hundred points, but a superstar development can earn up to 1600. You can also buy progression packs which increase how much players get during game prep.   So, basically, if you don't think you can use a player much he won't fail to develop if you commit game prep. It can be a major decision to decide who to give game prep to if you have lots of young players, but I tend to give it go guys who don't play much, or play in positions that I don't rack up great stats in.   My D-lineman and WRs get a lot of XP with sacks or TDs and pro-bowls etc... but my corners are not locks ot make the pro bowl, so I use game prep a lot on corners and bench players."
Madden,395ulc,mcorcoran3,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"Is getting a semi raw player that needs to improve a little and sitting them for 2 years while your vet finishes his career a viable option?   Yes, this is basically the primary reason they added game prep. So you don't have to choose between playing your best guys or developing a rookie. And you can make a point to use game prep on the rookies who are not playing as opposed to the rookies who earn xp each week on the field. I know my rookie WR might well win ROY and may reach his 65 catch goal, so I don't spend a lot of game prep on him, but my 5th string corner and my backup LE get a ton of game prep from me as they get very limited snaps."

Madden,397ivh,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jun 9 20:36:35 2015 UTC,No it does not. I have noticed that high consistency does however tend to lead to development but its not 100% of the time. I tend to draft a ton of fast/ss dev players when i draft players who have A or B consistency. Draft stories can also lead to fast/star dev players. FYI a high consistency player CAN have slow development FYI.  Edit: i never scout development. In my opinion its not worth the scouting points and it allows you to scout many more players.
Madden,397ivh,papap0st,2,Tue Jun 9 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I follow the draft stories as a cheat sheet for development trait. To me development trait is a great way to scout if you have double scouting points and a good roster. If I use, say, 3000 of my 4000 points to scout 6 guys development, and use draft stories to base the rest of my picks off of, I almost never have a rookie without at least quick development (save for 7th round special teamers etc...) To me development is almost everything -- if I ever used a first round pick on a guy with slow development I would be sick. So I go all in on D-Trait -- it works for me, but I know most people use Intangible or otherwise.   I don't randomly use D-Trait though -- I will narrow it down to, say WRs who are 22 and younger and have A SPD and A ACC and decent catching etc... by the time you narrow it down you might only have two or 3 guys to focus on."
Madden,397ivh,GangBangMountain,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:58:51 2015 UTC,"I should add, however, if a guy has a positive draft story I usually won't waste the 500 points because you can safely assume they are at least quick. I have never seen a positive draft story player be less than Quick. So unless I am choosing between two guys with a first round pick, I will write down all the names of positive draft story guys (which ends up being probably about 7-8 guys at the end of the year) and then use my scouting points on positions of need."

Madden,3959jr,PapaKroger,2,Tue Jun 9 14:10:20 2015 UTC,"I play it from time to time, it's like any online game some people go for the most OP teams (Seahawks, Patriots.) I've found it's somewhat balanced out and you'll usually find a good H2H partner."
Madden,3959jr,wowcomma,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:10:54 2015 UTC,It's pretty good.  You will still encounter the problem with people using the same 4 plays over and over again and other cheesy stuff.  If you did buy it you may want to play it for a month and then sell it on eBay or somewhere before 16 comes out.
Madden,3959jr,dej2gp3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"I play a ton of H2H and am in some good CFM communities. H2H is very cheese heavy, I can tell you you're going to encounter probably close to a 60% ratio of people trying heavily to use the same exploits repeatedly. Some of the most common are PA End Around from a bunch formation, and then combos of the 01 trap then hitting slants. You can learn to stop all of it, but it's still a dice roll often enough to make it super tough to play expert cheesers.  And to clarify ahead of time, I consider it cheesing when you're running 3 plays or the like on a loop just hitting the spots where it's really hard to stop without explicitly sticking a person in the area and placing an audible.   Fwiw after 600+ hours on this cycle, I think the H2H community is garbage. But I still play H2H a lot."

I also hate that leagues seem to run dry after a couple seasons  making long-term team building impossible.

If you're wondering, just go into roster and ""edit player"" this can be done at any time during the season and has no effect on their stats."

I use a 3-4 so I prefer big ends anyway, and the biggers one can switch over. Ironically, I have drafted DT's to pass rushing ends as well, since they ones I saw were too small to be DT for me.

I also aim for realism so I would not want a 270 pound DT playing nosetackle (and the ones I see in scouting that are under 300 are almost always 4-3 pass rushers or 4-3 balanced, not nosetackles.). There is also a size attribute which seems to correlate to height and weight. Again, I don't know how much it matters for sure, but in a 3-4 you want big lineman, especially at NOSE so that is what I look for generally.   I am not monolithic about. I sometimes use 4-3 pass rushing ends as a 3-4 end, but if I do that I will make sure the other 2 D-lineman are big and can clog the lanes."
Madden,391l4h,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:10:01 2015 UTC,"Also -- and this is not absolute -- but generally the guys who coded this game make the smaller guys speed rushers with attributes that are more apt to fit that (spd, acc, PMV) while the nosetackles and 3-4 ends tend to have more strength, blockshedding etc..."
Madden,391l4h,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jun 9 01:11:11 2015 UTC,"I go after prototype dt's with A strength. As long as those two things are true and the other attributes(block shed, etc.) aren't terrible, it works pretty awesome.  Be sure to change your scheme for dt's to prototype if you go this way. They don't become a dime a dozen, because most prototype DT's don't have A strength, but look around the league in real life. Safety and nose tackle are the two hardest spots to fill aside from qb."

Madden,391l4h,paperllamasunited,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:17:45 2015 UTC,I run a 3-4 and honestly I usually just pick the heaviest 3-4 DT that's left in the 7th round. His job is to plug the line. Any oversized DT can do it.

Madden,391l4h,Gkredd2,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:00:52 2015 UTC,That's the guy I was able to get.  88 strength and SS development.  The key to my 3-4 defense
