HotlineMiami,3e1bm3,Jruthe1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:02:03 2015 UTC,Oh of course!
HotlineMiami,3e1bm3,FuturaStalkee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:21:50 2015 UTC,I think thats the case also but it is still kinda cool to see what comes up.
HotlineMiami,3e1bm3,wackylunchsack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:54:26 2015 UTC,That fits in nightmarishly well with the game's aesthetic.

HotlineMiami,3dywiz,garcia_jvq,13,Mon Jul 20 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"I like the first game over the second simply because how much of a badass jacket can be. I don't recall a time in hotline miami 2 where I used scissors on a guy's face, dropped a sledgehammer head onto a guy's head, or tore open a guy's throat and then used his weapon to mow down his friends who are charging into the room."
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,Stockenheimer,8,Mon Jul 20 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"The nastiest execution is beheading russians with a machete. Jacket's truly sick, indeed.  PS: I always thought Jacket used his car keys to pierce the russians' throats."
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,Stockenheimer,8,Mon Jul 20 18:28:29 2015 UTC,Have you ever used the pot of boiling water? It's (in my opinion) the most brutal execution in the game.
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,TroubledPCNoob,7,Mon Jul 20 18:29:45 2015 UTC,I think the scissors are worse. He cuts your eyes and you have to lay there basically crying blood until you die.
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,Stockenheimer,4,Mon Jul 20 18:31:25 2015 UTC,I was wrong. The hammer execution is the most brutal.
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,VIsForVoltz2,9,Mon Jul 20 18:32:32 2015 UTC,"Overall, I just can't get the same feeling with hotline miami 2 and all of it's guns."
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,Testa_Inc,8,Mon Jul 20 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"Less guns, more household items."
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,pies1123,6,Mon Jul 20 18:38:37 2015 UTC,"If there was one good execution to come out of HM2, it's the skateboard one."
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,djdaves87y,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"Pardo's gun executions were fantastic though, and the Son! He stomps on the enemy like he was putting out a cigarette!"
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,maxb8888,4,Tue Jul 21 18:48:41 2015 UTC,"The most brutal execution in both games is the fans killing the henchman. I felt really bad after that.  ""Look, I just want to go home ok?"""
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,SpikeFJE,6,Tue Jul 21 10:51:30 2015 UTC,HM1 was a lot more easy compared to the second game. The enemy reaction time in HM1 where a lot more slower.
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,EdEmKay,2,Mon Jul 20 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"Not for me. After getting used to HM2, I tried to %100 HM 1 and it was very strange."
HotlineMiami,3dywiz,CosmicTail18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"My brother tried doing the first mission in HM after finishing HM2 and he kept getting smacked, the enemies did act noticeably different.   One big difference that I noticed from HM2 to HM is the melee enemies, like the timing for the enemies in HM is difficult if you're not used to it and both of you have melee weapons. It makes sense that they took out a lot of melee weapons for HM2, the swing range mattered more in the first one."

HotlineMiami,3dx3m3,KappaTopKekkington,12,Mon Jul 20 08:06:28 2015 UTC,It's because of his thick skin.
