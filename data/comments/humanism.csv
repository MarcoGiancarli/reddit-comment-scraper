Identifying as a technoprogressive is often mistaken for being in unambiguous support of eugenics and technoutopianism. That doesn't mean those labels are incorrect or not useful.

And not even as a blanket; it's a set of critiques of various, probably overlapping subsets of humanists - and many may be valid.  Still humanists are a varied group; you're going to get views there you disagree with.  It's a bit like saying, ""Some Christians are libertarians, therefore I'm won't be a Christian"".  You got a beef with the basic precepts of humanism, that's cool.  Go do something else.  You agree with basic humanism, but think the people are wrong?  Join in the conversation and help move them towards being less wrong.  That's not a reason to ""not be a humanist"", so much as a rationalization of why you don't want to associate with certain people.  It's an excuse for petulantly disagreeing with ""some humanists"".  My favorite bit of bald hubris:   This has been a long list. (To be fair, I did warn you.) There are two responses I can already predict certain humanists will have. Both make me uneasy, and both make me laugh.  The first is outrage. From my experience of the UK humanist community, I feel sure some people will read this post, or parts of it, and feel I’ve been incredibly rude – some people, I’ve no doubt, will think this is disrespectful, childish, tribalistic or whatever else. I’ve observed that however mild your criticism of groups like the BHA, or however fine you are with other people being humanists even though you’re not, certain people will stop being your friend if you’re not In The Club.  The second is the ‘no true humanist’ argument. Few if any of the things I list here is true of all humanists, and some of it applies to very limited numbers, so I’m sure people will turn to a Humanist Manifesto – hello, James Croft, if you’re reading – and declare ‘That’s not in accordance with proper humanism.’   Yeah.  The third is dismissal of your decidedly childish method of dealing with community disagreements - to go build your own humanism, with blackjack and hookers."

humanism,3d9tps,tmamone,8,Tue Jul 14 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a feminist, but I find the author's perspective that Sarah can't possibly have a legitimate reason to not want to identify with movement really frustrating. One example of why one wouldn't want to associate with the movement: science itself is controversial in academic feminism. Some feminists are arguing that the scientific method is patriarchal and that an ideology-first, reality-second approach is necessary. They are being taken seriously.    There's some serious crazy in feminism."
humanism,3d9tps,rickyharline,5,Tue Jul 14 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"So there is a fair amount of contention between feminist academics and their scientist colleagues. To my understanding this is mostly sociology and anthropology, but I believe that epidemiology (the study of societal health), psychology, and biology get involved, too. The sciences prefer quantitative studies, but many feminist academics have preferred qualitative studies and have argued that they are more accurate. From a paper critical of feminism from a legal perspective:     To remain true to feminist theory, no aspect of male female relations can be considered without first accepting the male as all powerful and the female as powerless. The gender hierarchy is omnipresent.     Given this dynamic, the suggestion that women may rely upon physical violence for anything other than self-defense must be rejected. However, the implications of grounding domestic violence in feminist theory go beyond prohibiting any consideration of female violence. Feminist theory also provides the means for discrediting any methodology employed to demonstrate the existence of female violence. By relying upon the definition of domestic violence as a patriarchal tool of control, any methodology which is not similarly grounded within this contextual framework can be rejected outright. Specifically, studies categorized as quantitative are deemed “inherently patriarchal” and therefore invalid because their dependence upon scientific, empirical data does not account for the history and context of male domination over women. By contrast, qualitative studies that depend upon a more clinical approach (which include the personal, in-depth interviewing of battered women) are considered to yield more accurate findings because of their fundamental commitment to a feminist perspective of domestic violence.      This paper I feel has some inadequate or inaccurate criticisms of feminism, however I feel that its main points stand and that it is a highly valuable resource to point to some of the largest problems in feminism.    To my understanding, this is one of the most (perhaps the singular most?) important feminist papers on the inadequacy of science. I'll paste the abstract:     The assumption that observation and data can be separated from theory (and values) and that the natural and the social world can be studied objectively is the core of the debate between mainstream and feminist research on wife abuse. All feminist critiques support in varying ways the contention that objectivity is the name men give to their own subjectivity. The methodological debates that arise are at the core of much of the debate in the field and especially the concept of scientific objectivity. The problems with unexamined positivism and claims of scientific objectivity are clear. It is the alternatives that remain murky. The necessary transformation that science and social science might undergo in response to feminist and other radical critiques occurs in small steps and requires more self-reflection and criticism of assumptions about knowledge, the issue of objectivity, relations with activists, and politics.   If her argument were that our scientific methods were inadequate and needed revising than I would be all ears. I can see that it would be possible that the scientists researching the subject may have been blind to important factors, and that this may have to due with race/class/sex privilege. That is not the argument. Feminists are arguing against their scientist colleagues, stating that ideology is necessary to understand reality."
humanism,3d9tps,rickyharline,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my limited understanding of the subjects is that it's messy and complicated, and I definitely understand that qualitative research has its place. I have no background in any sciences and so I don't really get to have much of an opinion, but regardless of in or out of science, a dedication to reality is necessary to understand reality. I don't think I need a science background for me to comfortably make that assertion. But very importantly, I am leaning on the analyses of scientists who feel that their feminist colleagues are misguided. I trust the scientists a hell of a lot more."
humanism,3d9tps,rickyharline,2,Tue Jul 14 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"Some male scientists might use science to back up their biases (but then again, who hasn't?), but I'm a feminist and I think the scientific method is just fine."
humanism,3d9tps,philwalkerp,2,Tue Jul 14 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"I find Sarah Jessica Parker's words more interesting and cohesive than the author speculating about what Parker meant. Why can't the author take Parker at her word and count her as a humanist? Noting in anything Parker has said or done indicates she doesn't know what ""humanism"" means...in fact, the secular wedding and attraction to Unitarianism seems to indicate that she could, indeed, be a humanist.  Finally, my interpretation of feminism - seeking equality for genders, not superiority for one - leaves it completely compatible with humanism (in fact many humanists in history were known for their 'bizarre' equal treatment of men and women). Not sure what Parker's brand of feminism entails, as there are many, but there's no reason to think it couldn't be compatible."
humanism,3d9tps,Algernon_Asimov,3,Tue Jul 14 20:46:58 2015 UTC,"Why can't the author take Parker at her word and count her as a humanist?   Because Parker, and others like her, are using the word ""humanist"" in a different way than, say, the American Humanist Association. There's a feeling out there among some people that ""feminism"" is too narrow a word to use for the equal rights movement: ""feminism"" concerns itself only with equal rights for women. These people believe that every human should have equal rights; they have therefore created the term ""human-ism"" to describe their fight for equal rights for all humans.   This is not the same as the philosophy of humanism, which puts human concerns at the centre of any ethical system. While humanism as defined by the various Humanist associations certainly includes equality for every person, it's not limited to that. However, this use of the word ""human-ism"" as a replacement for ""feminism"" is primarily focussed on equal rights.  Also, where the philosophy of humanism de-emphasises the role of religion in society in favour of human concerns, the equal rights movement of ""human-ism"" says nothing about religion.   Basically, there are now two meanings for the word ""humanism"", and feminists and other equal rights campaigners who adopt ""human-ist"" as their label often don't mean the same thing that we humanists do."

I agree that feminism has historical problems. They've been fixing some and creating new ones, some of which really are terrifying. Most who simplify feminism will define the movement by one or several submovements while ignoring many others.    Feminists who engage in hate, are tribalistic, are ironically incapable of empathy, or are anti-science are both bad feminists and bad humanists. As someone who considers himself a feminist I will be the first to say that there are too many of these. However, to call this feminism is inaccurate to the point of being ridiculous."
humanism,3d9tps,rickyharline,2,Wed Jul 15 22:18:27 2015 UTC,"As well there are some definite distinctions among people who identify as feminist. There's academics, college culture, people interested in gender issues young and old, and activists either through organizations or online discussion. There are common attributes these groups tend to share, and the differences are very large. The diversity in these groups is also very high, of course, so the commonalities are very loose."

humanism,3d9tps,rickyharline,2,Tue Jul 14 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"Again, I think that is an enormous simplification. ""Fainting couch feminism"" is alive and well, but so is the rest of the movement that is offended and frustrated by these ideas and policies. In most any direction you look you will find people arguing conflicting and often opposite ideas in the name of feminism. If you wish to make such assertions than you should make them about whatever part they are true of. Saying that about feminism is a bit like saying Americans like falafel.

humanism,3cwqof,Viator1739,3,Sat Jul 11 23:56:12 2015 UTC,"Being secular means having a life-stance or attitudes without any religious basis. That does not mean anti-religious, necessarily.  Being a humanist means having a focus on human matters and human agency to deal with those matters (without supernaturalism). Again, that does not mean anti-religious per se.  Note that religion ≠ supernaturalism: Supernaturalist beliefs can be non-religious (eg. rabbit paws for luck, walking under ladders, etc) and religions can lack supernaturalism or belief in deities (eg. Ethical Culture, much of Buddhism, Unitarian Universalism, etc).  Secular humanism means anti-theism therefore about as much as stamp collecting means chicken noodle soup: they don't have much to do with one another. Secular humanism is about stuff other than religion, by definition, and that means it shouldn't be preoccupied with religion at all. Humanists can be secular without being irreligious or even anti-religious (I am).  Unfortunately, humanism (and especially modern Humanism) has recently transformed into something diminished, especially in light of its towering historical achievements for civilization. As has been written by David Hoelscher,    ""What’s wrong with today’s mainstream Humanism goes far beyond philosophical confusion and strategic anarchy. Strangely, the difficulty is one that, almost universally, Humanists seem wholly oblivious to, even though, as it happens, it is right out in the open. What’s more, because the problem concerns Humanism’s often admirably vanguard ethical fundamentals, it amounts to no less than a moral crisis. Put simply, the Humanist movement, in the United States anyway, is badly broken. As jolting as that assertion may be to some, it is nevertheless necessary, because in major respects Humanism is blatantly betraying the core principles it was created to champion. [...] generally speaking today’s Humanists want to focus above all else on promoting secularism.""   I'm not suprised OP is asking the question; most of the public who have heard about humanism probably wonder the same thing at this point. Don't get me wrong: promoting secularism (church-state separation) and the rights of the non-religious is worthy, but it is just one of very very many worthy philosophical and ethical principles in the pantheon of humanism. Sadly it is fast becoming the only one anyone identifies with Humanism. This is the fault of Humanist themselves, who are now often focusing on tearing down religion rather than building up a different way of being."

As Humanists, we should prefer critical thinking and evidence over mere faith. Does the article offer any evidence, other than a formulation of one person's subjective impression? Any critical thinking about its own conclusion? It doesn't look that way, does it?  In fact, in my discussions with anti-theists, in general, I'm rather confused by the lack of good evidence on their part. In my opinion, anti-theism as it's generally understood seems to contradict basic ideas of Humanism."

In other words, they don't act scientifically.  Which is the best demonstration why Humanists are not anti-theists.  Here are some actual scientists who made the case that so-called ""Islamic Terrorism"" has nothing to to do with is not motivated by religion:   Scott Atran, anthropologist and Director of Research in Anthropology at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, Senior Research Fellow at Oxford University in England, Presidential Scholar at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.

humanism,3cwqof,mavnorman,2,Sun Jul 12 06:45:14 2015 UTC,"I find to have the stance that religion is not a large factor, or even the primary, for these atrocities, one would need to make heavy use of blinders and rose tinted glasses.  This particular point absolutely has to do with a very radical interpretation of Islam.   Empirically anyone can clearly see religion plays a significant roll. I don't think there is any credible argument to the contrary.   You could postulate that these types would still act the same without the religious input.  I would counter that the rigid and violent theocracies they live under would also be gone, thereby removing the desire to do so.   There will always be violence and such when dealing with greed and lust for power, but to say religion has no play is naive.   Certainly the absence of religion and it's dogma trappings replaced with rational thought would certainly stop leaders from using religion as a tool to wield power. Leaders then turn to nationalism or other forms of propaganda, but these are far less powerful over time.  Certainly morality plays a part, for example the civil war was, in part, a moral action.   However when morals are dictated from the pulpit they can be twisted for all sorts of terrible things, and are much easier to adopt by 'believers'. This does not dissolve the religion, and the leaders of said religion, from being the major influence.  From your people above:  Scot Atran:   ""Commitment to the group is intensified by religion, not just the literal promise of paradise but the feeling of spiritual awe that comes from submerging oneself in a crusade, a calling, a vision quest, or a jihad"".  Robert Page:  ""Religion plays a role in suicide terrorism, but mainly in the context of national resistance"". The primary cause is ""the dynamics of religious difference"".  Raiz Hassen:  He doesn't argue that it is not religion causing issues, rather that the west should better understand Islam and such so that they can relate in a more humanistic way, rather than just through sanctions and violence, which exacerbate the situation (I agree). He even states in his book that religious commitment in these countries is a major concern.  Very clearly religion plays the largest factor in these cases. However that doesn't mean one should judge all members of Islam by the actions of of a few.   I still am not convinced at all by your point of view, but part of it does ring true. Namely we need to look at the total makeup of the people, and not just stereotype because of the religion. I can totally get behind that.  Rather I see that you have a portion of the problem correctly assessed, but you seem to be seeing the trees to spite the forest.  I still believe that the absence of religion, which can and is used by the powerful as a very powerful form of control, would be far more beneficial and lead to a safer, more humanistic planet, than its presence. As long as the people themselves come to this understanding. One can not force this on people and think it would solve anything.   Education, not deconversion by the sword, is the humanistic answer, in my view.  Oh, by the way you used Gish gallup wrongly here, and your appeal to authority fell flat. But if you feel the need to try and use things like this condescendingly rather than an exchange of ideas, you need to know the meaning first."

If you lack due process, nature may fool you into believing bullshit. In the words of Richard Feyman: ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.""

Individuals who are anti-thiest, or humanist, may or may not use tools to help them make better decisions, such as critical thought, logic and science based empirical measurement.  Neither of these overlapping groups have an inherent mandate for the application of these types of tools.  ""Due Process"" is  a legal term, not part of the scientific method. It means:  Due process is the legal requirement that the state must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person.  As such you are making statements based on an internal stereotype, which is ironic due to your stance. More on this later.   You can find that, but your belief is not good evidence. I could go over all your other arguments, but these are no good evidence, either.   Hogwash, the evidence is in the observation, that is exactly what ""empirical evidence"" is by definition.   You are disagreeing with the hypothesis and subsequent theory anti-theists make from that observed evidence. But in exchange you have not shown (possibly because of your self proclaimed ""sloppy formulation"") that this stance is false.   Changing to ""not motivated by"" still is not enough, rather ""is not the ONLY motivation"" I would accept, in most cases. Often there are other motivations, such as power, greed, self-image, etc.  I would also invite you to formulate a counter hypothesis if you wish to unseat this as the prevalent theory.  From Wiki: Empirical evidence, data, or knowledge, also known as sense experience, is a collective term for the knowledge or source of knowledge acquired by means of the senses, particularly by observation and/or experimentation   Maybe, but due to the sloppy formulation above, you may keep in mind that you may not understand my position.   I am not responsible for interpreting your ""sloppy formulation"". Writing accurately is a skill we all can work on, but is essential for proper debate in a written forum. We can't see your body language, or stop you to clarify a point.  You are also moving the goal posts by now saying religion is part of the equation. This is bad form (sloppy), and an informal logical fallacy.  With all this said, you have some valid points.   However I still contend your view on this is too myopic. I think you are doing so because of an internal feeling of justice or fair-play. But these are also blinding you to the larger reality of the actual harm the institution of religions cause every day. It is similar to misunderstanding that institutionalized racism is a problem, even though most individuals may not be individually racist, and from that contending that anti-racists are wrong.  What I get from your writings is you are trying to get across could be summed up as:  ""Some anti-theists can be too negligent in their thought process, thereby being to vehement in their disagreement with religions, without rational thought to back up their position, thereby possibly leading to the same types of harm they are trying to curtail.""  I would say the above, if that is how you feel, is fairly accurate. But this is typical of any human group dynamic, not specific to anti-theists.   I would say this is the minority of anti-theists as well, but that is anecdotal.   By the way anecdotal evidence is not considered 'wrong' or 'not useful' by the scientific method. Rather it is too informal so should not be used to form validations, but is quite good for forming hypothesis.   By casting all anti-theists in this light (stereotyping), you are guilty of the same behavior you are bemoaning."
humanism,3cwqof,GoingWithThat_Really,0,Tue Jul 14 00:15:21 2015 UTC,"I apologize in advance for the you-wrote-I-say format. I don't like it, but there are two other replies in my inbox.   ""Due Process"" is a legal term   Which is why I wrote ""something like"". It is meant to convey that I don't use the term in a literal sense, but as an analogy.   As such you are making statements based on an internal stereotype   We'll come back to this shortly.   Hogwash, the evidence is in the observation   Correlation is not causation. There's a reason why clinical trials use procedures like a double-blind experiment, you know? In fact, there's a reason why scientists generally use experiments. It's the best way to determine causation. Some say, it's the only way.   with the hypothesis and subsequent theory anti-theists make   You seem to agree that there is a central hypothesis and a common theory associated with the term ""anti-theism"". Why are you allowed to point to that, while you accuse me of having an ""internal stereotype"" when I do that?   you have not shown (possibly because of your self proclaimed ""sloppy formulation"") that this stance is false   I don't have to. If you try to defend the usual claims by anti-theists (or if you consider yourself one), then you have the burden of proof, because you make the claim about religion being the (or the main) cause. I only need to say that these claims are not supported by the alleged ""evidence"" ie. why anecdotes are not evidence for causation.  However, I did point you to alternative explanations. You seem to have been able to search online for some quotes from the researchers I mentioned. If you've read a bit more about what they wrote, you'd know there are alternative hypotheses what motivates Islamic terrorists groups. As long as you cannot rule out alternative explanation for a correlation, you've not established religion as the causal factor in this particular example.   I am not responsible for interpreting your ""sloppy formulation"".   Indeed you are not. But did I say that?   But these are also blinding you to the larger reality of the actual harm the institution of religions cause every day.   Does it? Are you infallible? If not, how do you know it's not you who is blind to the failure of your own reasoning?    I would say the above, if that is how you feel, is fairly accurate.   I admit, you've made a fairly accurate summery. I dispute the word ""some"" though.   But this is typical of any human group dynamic, not specific to anti-theists.    I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. Are you trying to excuse the mistakes of (some) anti-theists, because ""everybody does it""? If not, you seem to contradict yourself in the next sentence:   I would say this is the minority of anti-theists as well, but that is anecdotal.   Now, what is it? Are the mistakes of anti-theists – ie. being ""too negligent in their thought process"" – just a special case of a ""typical"" pattern of ""human group dynamic"". If so, it doesn't make sense to say it's just a ""minority"". Otherwise, how could you write that such mistakes are ""typical""?   By casting all anti-theists in this light (stereotyping), you are guilty of the same behavior you are bemoaning.   You may want to consider that I merely refuse to hedge all my sentences with qualifiers such as ""too many"", or ""most if not all"". You may call this lazy but this is Reddit, not some high-impact science journal. Also, to paraphrase Steven Pinker about such qualifiers – if your opponent bitches about that, this is his fault. A reasonable opponent knows how to apply the principle of charity.  Also, do anti-theists really deserve such a qualifier right now? I'm arguing with them on Reddit for about two or three years. I'm reading their comments. I've read the books they points to, as well as the one or two scientific articles that they occasionally come up with.  ""Anti-theism"" is not a term that describes an unrelated quality to the behavior. It, in fact, describes a certain position which is argued on the basis of certain values, observations, and arguments.   Sure, there are some self-proclaimed anti-theists who don't fit the pattern of arguments I described. For instance, there was one who wrote something like ""I'm opposed to theism because there's simply no good reason to believe that it's true."" If that's the definition of anti-theism, I'm also one, because that would be indistinguishable from atheism.   I don't have to accept all possible definitions. Some people simple don't have a clue, or try to use words in an unusual way to convey certain ideas. I take it for granted that other people understand this as well as I do. If you need to change the meaning of the word ""anti-theism"" in such a way that the majority of other self-proclaimed anti-theists would not recognize it, you've just admitted defeat of their position.  But we don't have to discuss exceptions here, because you followed the foot steps of (almost all) anti-theists I've ever talked to. Let me recap here. It was you who threw around a list of anecdotes, presuming that these are evidence for your claim about causation. At best, these are just correlation which is not evidence for the central claim in your argument, namely causation.  And, second, even if you could actually produce good evidence for causation, a judgment about religion, in general, needs to take into account all consequences – the good and the bad. You didn't even mention the good yet.  And, third, even if you could make a good case that the bad outweighs the good, you'd still have to show that any alternative would actually produce a better result. Sometimes, the best humans can do is to minimize a negative net effect.  So, who's myopic here?  It seems you're in no position to judge whether this is only a minority of anti-theists because you're arguing like they do. But you probably don't think that you are ""too negligent in (your) thought process, thereby being to vehement in their disagreement with religions, without rational thought to back up their position"", do you?  If you agree that you are ""too negligent, etc."" in your defense of anti-theism, then (almost all) anti-theists are guilty as charged, because I've yet to met one who doesn't argue like you did. Surely, this is inductive reasoning but it works well enough."
humanism,3cwqof,mavnorman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:38:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the other poster is right, you are defensive and you resort to putting your head in the sand and playing stupid games, cherry picking, refusal to accept others points of view. You are the typical person who debates as if it were a wrestling competition you must win, rather than an exchange of ideas.   I gave that you had some points, but overall your debate style is nothing more than a child shouting down others and then resorting back to a defensive wall of ""prove it"" and backtrack onto points that were already gone over, rather than learn or consider others thoughts.  Several people put a lot of time and significant effort into showing you why your viewpoint is wrong, or at least not complete, and you just go right back to generalizations, stereo-types and rejection of ideas not your own. Your sentence by sentence, remove things out of context, and then spin these around while deliberately being obtuse to the larger meaning is just mindboggling, and a cheap internet tactic.  You say you don't want a rational, informal debate, yet keep yelling for citations and ""proof"" when you can't answer or can;t counter a point made. It has been explained the proof is in the actual observation of these things, and you keep running back to these and calling them 'anecdotes' which is silly because that is not what that word even means. You refuse to directly deal with the ideas, rather you re-insist the same position. When caught you do a grand proclamation how every anti-thiest you talk to is the same, and how you can't be held accountable for using ""all"" and ""every"" as that is somehow silly.   I explained why ""good v ""bad"" is not a cosmic scale, that the inherent nature of the ""bad"" can never be overcome by the ""good"", and even gave you an example of why. You keep ignoring these things. The statement is out there, that you can't separate religion from the societal, tribal, moral, or other motivations. If you can't do so, the religion is one of the major causative issues. Period, that is the end of it.   You keep yelling coloration is not causation, as if the argument has been that religion is the ONLY cause. Yet every statement has been that religion is one of the causative factors, if not the main one. There are many, but one can't separate i=them unless the religious individual rejects their religion and does a thorough re-examination of the influence of religion on every aspect of their lives. Your viewpoint is far to simplistic and myopic. These things are mixed up in the psyche, not the variables of a computer program.  You keep doing the same things you accuse others of yet don't understand them or their definitions,  such as basic fallacies, burden of proof, evidence, scientific v. sociological studies, etc.  You can reject my, and other anti-theists conclusion from the evidence, that is true, then there is no debate.   If you say why you reject it, that too is up for debate and you must back your reasons for the rejection.  But if you substitute a different answer, you then ARE responsible for the burden of proof of your counter. This is a basic concept, your agreement nor disagreement doesn't change this fact.  You are not particularly rational, and not at all logical, sorry it is jut not so. You are getting there, keep it up.  Your whole argument could be summed up in one paragraph which is a decent argument, but then you ruin it with the rest of this stupidity, brought on by defensiveness and obviously you have issues with others that disagree with you as you then try and lash out, which is very childish.  There is an old saying ""if you smell shit everywhere check your own shoes"". You say every anti-thiest acts the same way, has the same argument, and all are not rational. As this is patently a false statement, there is no way all anti-theists act nor argue the same, so you should look at your own shoes.  Sorry, I agree with the other person, you need to mature more before we can continue, but you have potential."

It can also affect areas of the brain related to stress and emotional regulation.   I thought this line was ridiculous. How, exactly, do you determine that this is the truth? This is why I do not put much stock into psychology as a science. For this to be even remotely testable, you would be required to have a sample size that was statistically significant, and the exact same as the others, with only this variable of corporal punishment.  The parents would have to be of the same upbringing, the same social status, the same mentality and have the same things happen to them. The children would have to be identical, have the same reactions, same genetics, same potential for this to be ""indisputable"" true or even testable as the article claims.

Because with this current uber-liberal parenting style that is so popular, we do not focus on punishing and explaining negative emotions, actions, and situations. Instead, these sad excuses for parents try to shield their child from harsh realities(which aren't harsh at all if you're a hard-working, honest and dutiful person) by way of spoiling them and creating ""safe-zones"".

(on tablet, so formatting could suck)  edit: formating  Real quick, some of the contributing factors would be:   state subsidies:   Every registered religious/life stance society gets state subsidies dependant on membership numbers. This is (roughly) so the parliament could keep the state church (somewhat complicated and unpopular not to), but not discriminate. The Norwegian church gets roughly what it needs, and you take the total of that (excluding things the government can budget and hide away elsewhere), divides by number of members of the church (slightly less than 75% of the inhabitants of Norway), and multiples by membership numbers of e.g. NHA.  Quite secular society  ... Which still clings to old rites:   So, before you had NHA, you had what was called Borgerlig konfirmasjon (roughly Civil Confirmation, started up in 1951), which was early Norwegian humanists trying to give humanists a secular version of the Lutheran confirmation. Most Norwegians would go to confirmation, and humanists wanted something for themselves. It was moderately popular (meaning, a handful 14-15 year olds did it the first year, and it grew somewhat - slowly - from that), and five years later that morphed into NHA (1956). The focus on ceremonies, rites-of-passage has been an important focus all the time, and by now, 1 in 5 Norwegian 14-15 year olds go to (what's now called) Humanistic confirmation.  NHA also actively lobbies for religious (and life stance societies') rights, which means in Norway they are sort of ""one of the gang"". NHA was partial responsible and active member of a national dialogue network for religious and life stance societies (Samarbeidsrådet for tros- og livssynssamfunn (STL)). This is state funded, and it's compromised of representatives from all (I think) different religions and life stances. This makes NHA less of an outsider in a lot of issues, and makes it easier to be noticed and make ones voice heard.    Just a few points, quickly jotted down. I can probably expand on most of this, or point in the right direction for more information."
humanism,3cc0kn,Dan-Raoul,2,Tue Jul 7 13:42:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the interesting reply.  From your description it seems like the NHA has a rather ""official status"" along with ""the other religions"". Is humanism taught in the schools alongside religions? If so, is it described fairly? Due to this ""official status"" I suppose more or less everyone in Norway knows what humanism is. Is it so?  If the Norwegian state stopped subsidizing the church (and all the other religions, as well as the humanists), how would it affect the NHA?  How old are the NHA members compared to the Norwegian population as a whole?"
humanism,3cc0kn,Dan-Raoul,2,Tue Jul 7 17:09:22 2015 UTC,"It's taught in school  alongside everything else. It isn't much (a few pages in the text books), but it's described quite fairly (as far as I've seen).  In addition, every 14 year old gets an invite to take part of Humanistic confirmation (it's a long story, but basically, since the church gets to send out that letter, NHA gets as well), so yeah, almost everybody knows about NHA.   Without state subsidies, there would be two groups that would be in deep shit: the Norwegian church, and the NHA. Other societies are less dependent on those subsidies (I think about 60-80% of NHA income is from state subsidies). The NHA would survive (there are some failsafes in place), but greatly reduced in activity and form. Happily(/sadly for some of the Norwegian economy) this isn't likely to happen anytime soon.   Traditionally NHA has had somewhat elderly members (40-50+), especially among the active members. It seems like this is about to change. In 2007 the Norwegian Humanist Youth was established, and it became easier to engage youth. Over the last few years there has been a lot more late teenagers and twentysomethings active in NHA as well. Now two of the former presidents of the the NHY (the first president, and me, the second) is employed, the third president is chair of a big regional group (NHA Hordaland), while the fourth president just got elected as vice president of the NHA. This is in addition to a lot of other local, regional and national levels which have active members currently or formerly from the NHY.   A last bullet point I forgot in the first comment:   The Hell Debates. It's a bit big and complicated to get into here, but basically, when theologians started preaching about hell on the radio in the 1950s, it didn't sit so well with the public, neither with the liberals of the Norwegian church. This made it feasible to leave, criticise, and look for good alternatives for the non-believers later on. Combined with smart maneuvering by the leaders of NHA, this was monumental in accumulating members. There is a little bit about it here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Hallesby#Hell_debate, but you could probably get the gist if you employ Google Translate and Google around a bit for ""helvetesdebatten""."

I've talked a lot with the Brits, so somewhat familiar with them as well. They are focusing more on youth now, though, what with the AHS and Young Humanists, and quite a lot of their employees are somewhat young (certainly a lot younger in general than NHA).   From what I've heard and seen of the AHA, it's not that different there either, except not that much focus on ceremonies, and it's mostly lobbying going on. I feel like Atheism+ is more the rebranding/a different name for humanism than humanism is rebranding atheism, both in the AHA and BHA. Of course, the focus has to be different, since it's a somewhat different society. In Norway it's not unusual to be atheist or humanist - not that usual in the UK, and definitely not in the US...."

Social liberals were hemming and hawing around it gay marriage just a few years ago, and talking about ""civil unions"" and other similar half-assed ""solutions"". Not too many people were advocating for gay marriage just a decade ago, and I don't recall hearing much from we Humanists and atheists about it back then. This strikes me as breast-beating and lamenting how these folks just aren't as socially progressive as we are (ignoring the fact that this is a pretty new position for most progressives, too!)."

While many in the church are progressive, there are many who push back against new social changes, liturgy, music, etc. And instead of comparing them to the Presbyterians and the Uniteds, perhaps look at how they stack up to almost every other church socially, not just with the gay debate but other levels of social equality.  The socially progressive wing of the church is also playing a political game to not alienate the conservative sides that exist elsewhere, especially in Africa. There is an undercurrent of broke it/bought it with former colonial outposts of the British Empire.  But yes, they could do better."

I was a member of a few Episcopalian churches and I have to say that their culture is more important to me than their religious values.  There were so many great people that I met who believed that the spirit of the religion was more important than the law of the religion. The Episcopal Church served as my formulation of my view that, so long as I live my life as a good person, I don't need to worry about what happens to me after I die.  The Anglicans are the third largest denomination of Christians, I think this is a pretty big deal on all accounts."

humanism,3c4h6q,TheAtheistPriest,8,Sat Jul 4 18:16:19 2015 UTC,"Taking people's stuff because they have ""enough"" is also anti-humanist. Moreso, really. Taxation works because it's a relative reduction in a transfer of value which is by definition fluid and fungible. Progressive taxation works because additional money has diminishing utility. A flat ceiling for both earning and ownership is just going to open some ugly questions about where to put it. Do third-world workers earning pennies a day get a vote? What I spend on air-conditioning in Florida probably seems like unimaginable excess to them.   Also consider the opportunity cost. We'd hobble assholes like the Kochs, but we'd also prevent Elon Musk from pursuing his hobby of commercial space transportation. It would be nice if governments could be relied on to continue advancing our space technology - but we only got what we got as a proxy war for ICBM dick-waving, and I don't want to fly on a space-747 that Kickstarter built. A sensibly constrained capitalist economy benefits greatly from having a few cocksure lunatics with the wealth of Croesus. Reducing such influential individuals to lives of extreme comfort (while removing any monetary incentive to expend their wealth in industry) might even rake in less cash than skimming heavily off their profits.   It is sufficient to (1) get money out of politics, (2) prevent collusion and monopoly in defense of socially-beneficial economic choice, and (3) tax the everloving crap out of incomes as they go up. Even if a gajillionaire is getting a penny of every dollar, that's a penny more incentive than he'd have with a flat cap, and the other ninety-nine cents spends like a whole buck."

Experiencing self happiness flattens way bellow 100k per year so, the only entity that needs to be taken into account is the remembering self. This has a lot to do with prestige and the social aspects of a person. What if we start measuring ""wealth"" as the amount of taxes given to society rather than the amount of money in the bank? What if it would be socially unacceptable to have that much money?   I love what Bill Gates and Elon Musk have done with their money. I love things like The Giving Pledge but this pales in comparison with the amount of misery facilitated by the greed of the rest. I cannot look at a documentary like ""Fire in the blood"" and be for medical patents because the poor pharma industry needs to pay for their research. I cannot look at investigations into the clothes industry and think... yeah... the billionaires of H&M and Zara and Walmart sweated blood working for their fortunes and deserve to keep it anymore than I can think that about the slave owners from two centuries ago.

If I had ten billion dollars, I would reshape the world to my whims. Other people might not enjoy that, but I'd be happier, and that's the metric in question.   Medical patents and sweatshops are not related problems. Capping wealth won't fix them. Fixing them doesn't require capping wealth. I did explicitly mention ""sensibly constrained capitalism,"" though - patents and foreign labor are two areas where we're neither sensible nor constrained.    The greater experiential good should be more important that the slight inconvenience of any one individual.   That's my line. Taxation - even heavily progressive taxation - will always be a slight reduction in purchasing power. Mere friction. Absolute caps are a brick wall that some people will run into. Forcing a change in lifestyle is more than ""a number on a screen,"" even if the lifestyle being changed is lavish beyond mortal reckoning.

So, your original statement is not true: you are NOT 100% against mandatory wealth distribution. Good, I'm glad we learned something.       That said, Article 1 does not specify that ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of legality.""          It doesn't say this because it recognizes that laws can be bought, such that actions which violate human rights (as outlined by the UDHR) are legally permissable.       Remember: that which is legally permissable is not necessarily good. Legal rights can violate human rights.

I am well aware of that, and believe that should be changed. However, I'm not seeing any examples of that applying here, unless you say the billionaires simply owning wealth violates the rights of the poor, which is nonsense.

Bill Gates acquired his wealth through entrepreneurship, in which he made a company which made products that people bought, making him money. That violates nothing in the UDHR.  The Walton family inherited their wealth from their parents, two brothers who founded Walmart. Passing down property to your children does not violate the UDHR. Their parents acquired their money through the success of the retail chain they founded, also not violating the UDHR.  The Koch brothers inherited a company from their father, another example of passing down private property. They then expanded this company into various industries and were successful. Being successful does not violate the UDHR.  I am not going to take the opinions of random internet comments as evidence that they acquired wealth in ways violating the UDHR.

Maybe you want to mince words and suggest that the Walton family =/= Walmart, or perhaps that because the wealth accumulated through Walmart's violation of various individuals' rights was bequeathed, the Walton family is not liable for those violations. So, basically, you believe money laundering is a thing and that it's OK.       Koch Industries does some nasty stuff too., specifically as it relates to pollution. Not to mention their influence over US politicians, most troublingly in the area of climate change policy., which the UN Human Rights Council declared was an ""immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights.""       I'll cede Bill Gates, not because I can't find anything, but because I'm done doing your work for you, and because I'm tired.

However, I don't see, in those links, that they acquired wealth by violating the UDHR. Essentially, I'm saying that in a hypothetical world where they didn't violate the rights of workers through their company's history, they'd still be billionaires today. It might seem nitpicky, but its an important distinction to make, in my view.  Similar in the case of the Koch brothers. They almost certainly are using their wealth to push causes that would violate the UDHR, or are simply using it to violate the UDHR. However, their wealth was not acquired by violating those rights.  I hold the UDHR in high esteem, but I don't believe violating it for other people relinquishes your own claim to it; its for everyone, and its a moral duty to hold accountable those who do violate it. I'm not a fan of the Waltons or the Kochs, don't get me wrong, but I don't think taking their property is justifiable."

Choosing to die is a drastic decision and should not be made unless a person has a terminal and untreatable illness.  If an illness can be treated and is not terminal, then it is temporary.  Why would it make sense to choose immediate death over treatment for a non-terminal illness (non-terminal, so long as it is treated).  I do know what it is like to be in this position.

As someone that has suffered from depression myself, I can understand the type of constantly psychological pain that she is going through.

As if we could cure cancer.  :)  I think the first problem is that we don't take it seriously though.    I'm not a big fan of euthanasia in these cases because I think we could be doing a LOT more to help people like this.  The problem is that we just cut them loose and then watch them kill themselves, and basically blame the victim.  However, there are a lot of challenges with studying mental illness.  First, we struggle with clinical trials/etc in general even for more conventional treatments/diseases.  Next we really don't have animal models for mental illness the way we do for other problems (sure, they aren't perfect, but at least you can experiment on mice - good luck trying to treat depression in a rat).  Trying to experiment on people directly has a lot of ethical problems.  However, the fact that people with depression are literally seeking to kill themselves should really make us question that - if a treatment injures somebody who is seriously suicidal, is that REALLY making them worse off if there was any hope for a gain?"

It happens so often that people don't look at the fact anymore, but people inside the train are just annoyed they are delayed for a full hour again at least.  I can only imagine this is at least better in a practical sense.  Then again, the question could be raised that if she had enough power not to jump in a culture where this is relatively common, and live through to the day she can get euthanasia, is there still reason for the euthanasia?  So far in my observation when I lived there, religion is not practised in the literal sense, but the idea of a god and a heaven still lingers among the population. I feel that this gives fuel to the common suicide practices in a thought of ""maybe it's better after? Anything can be better than this life right?"" - a misplaced feeling of 'hope'."

""We made the problems and we can fix them"" is a distinct worldview, especially given that most people (at least in the US) don't believe it. Most people believe man's problems are supernatural. That Satan gave us the problems and only God can fix them. So as a society our job is to avoid Satan and get closer to God, not to realize our problems and solve them ourselves.   I wish this was oversimplifying the religious argument in America, but it's really not. I was trying to discuss politics with my mother this weekend and she kept going back to ""well, as long as people keep sinning, our society will never get better."" She has two Master's Degrees and works as a public education administrator in California.   I would say it's a distinct worldview. It shouldn't be, but it is.

He turns to the non-believer and says, ""We're both biased. I am biased to believe that the magic is real and you’re biased to believe in naturalism so you won’t accept that it was real magic. We are both equally reliant on bias but choose to interpret the magic trick differently. How can you say your position is better than mine?"" The non-believer responds, ""Why would I accept that it’s real magic when every example I've come across has a natural explanation? You cannot equate the natural and the supernatural.""  Belief that the world is flat is much different than the belief that a supernatural God answers prayers and actively intervenes in our universe. I don't know how we could ever confirm the existence of a supernatural realm that is, by definition, outside of nature."

Secularism is a worldview as defined by its relation and contrast with other worldviews. In a perfect world, the neutral worldview would be called ""worldview"". There would be no need to set it up from others.  In a similar fashion, the only reason we have ""red"" is because we also have ""yellow"" and ""green"", etc. If there was only one color, we would just call it ""color"" (or more likely, we wouldn't call it anything). For most people, there is just ""pomegranate"". Until you learn that there are Garnet Sash, Kashmir Blend, Red Silk, Sharp Velvet, etc. If there was only one variety, it would be called simply ""pomegranate"".

Anyway, …  The evidence so far is quite clear that persuasion requires trust. If you don't manage to be perceived as trustworthy by the recipient, chances are you'll not persuade him or her by reason. One way to manage that is by admitting short-comings of your own position, and the validity of the other's argument to a certain degree.  In the context of the article above, one could admit that its approach seems quite reasonable: The author establishes criteria for a certain classification of worldviews into ""neutral"" and ""biased"", so to say. He additionally describes (or defines) what he considers to be 'secularism', and demonstrates that secularism so described falls into the 'biased' class. Finally, there's the common tu quoque argument which is not always a fallacy. One could also describe it as an appeal to fairness.  Overall, the authors express their perception of the issue, and they do so in a comprehensible way, as far as I can tell. Their choice of words may a bit unlucky, but it's not totally weird.  It's possible to use these premises and argue for your conclusion: You can use the appeal the fairness, as well as the conclusion that we all might have biased world-views, to argue for a fair ""rules of engagement"" in politics (ie. secularism properly understood). All you need is to point out that the dominance of one world view in a society can change.  However, in my opinion, this is only a partial answer to your question. It focuses on what one could do as an individual.  But articles like the above are not influential because of its rhetoric, in my opinion. It's addresses the choir, so to speak, which will accept it uncritically because (a) it justifies the interests of the audience – namely being able to say there's nothing wrong when pushing their world view unto others–, and (b), it comes from somebody who they trust because the author is like them.  One's time is not well spend trying to ""fight against such biased arguments"". It's better spend to build something of value for other humans (and humanists)."

Whether or not there are specters, demons or gods cannot be determined with any agreed upon method, but we can measure the results of policies. We can't say if there is a Christian god, but it doesn't really matter, because the government isn't relying on a god for solutions. If we see citizens who are hungry and poor, then we create policy to help feed and prosper the hungry and poor. If people are fed, and fewer are poor, then it is a success.

For liberal Christians -- and I'm using ""Christians"" here because it's in the article, but it doesn't apply only to Christians or even to all denominations of Christians -- this is OK.  They welcome gay rights, evolution, women's rights, and so on, because they're OK with the idea that science and humanism are right on some things, and they change their Christianity to adopt them.  For conservative Christians, the fact that liberal Christians think this is OK is the undoing of their entire culture."

humanism,3aaib1,skyclerk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:19:12 2015 UTC,"Google search on the definition of Humanism:   an outlook or system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. Humanist beliefs stress the potential value and goodness of human beings, emphasize common human needs, and seek solely rational ways of solving human problems.   Quick Wikipedia search on Cathar:   The idea of two Gods or principles, one being good and the other evil, was central to Cathar beliefs. The good God was the God of the New Testament and the creator of the spiritual realm, as opposed to the evil God, whom many Cathars and, particularly, their persecutors identified as Satan, creator of the physical world of the Old Testament. All visible matter, including the human body, was created by this evil god; it was therefore tainted with sin.   From what I read, I think Humanism ≠ Catharism.   Where exactly in Catharism is it implied a human is inherently good and why is the fact that we can all help each other become a better society together through kindness and love (if it isn't something else that's spiritual or ethical)  limited to only that aspect of Catharism or not even it at all? It's also one thing to strip away the religious aspect, but would it still be about the religion or something else? I'm sorry, but I just think it sounds a lot like the Golden rule and basic morals, which are part and parcel with a lot of non-Catharism, including Humanism and a lot of religion.   Correct me if I'm wrong."

It makes it seem as though once humanity shrugs off the belief of the abrahamic god that somehow we will have reached the finish line of philosophy. Then people just start tacking on the same old song (literally) and dance numbers that people have always done. This ""godless church"" thing is hilarious to me, your just attaching a different label to exactly the same fucking thing. These are simply Unitarian churches with a different mask on, they've been around  for a long time. Is it a step in the right direction? Absolutely. But to act as if this is any sort of new revelation is incredibly myopic. People since the dawn of modern humans have always had community gatherings and always will. We're an extremely social species and that isn't going to stop anytime soon.  So to stop myself before I rant, this notion of a need for a theology of atheism and godless church services is ultimately unnecessary. Fostering empathy and compassion in children should be our number one goal in the humanist community.

I seem to be one of the many sects in the atheist community that seems to innately enjoy what religious practices offer - namely its community-building, charitable, and healing nature - but to have this kind of experience secularly seems to only fall under a somewhat sarcastic participation of organized religion. I think that, as far as integrity goes, this is a plausible option for me, but it pains me to even think that this is the only option.   I will say, I'm not personally not excited for ""hymns"" of any sort. However, for humanism's evolution, we should definitely be focusing on supplying necessary community building to as many people as we can - religious or not. I personally attach myself to the religious, because I want to be sure that they, too, can understand that believing in peace or prosperity does not have a mandatory attachment to illogical bigotry and other extremely dated practices.   It both worries and excites me that Humanism still has much more work to do to show its already-impeccable nature. How do we do this? How can I help? What can I be a part of?

Why do these ""good"" Christians pick and choose specific scriptures, and pass off the rest to warped, old poetry? It's their true, individual morals, ideals, and beliefs -merely using Biblical words as pieces to build a personal religion.

Life happened, we're one of a lot of results of that happening and there's no greater ""meaning"" or ""purpose"" to our existence other than a coincidental chemical reaction a very long time ago.   However, we can create meaning and purpose, as we also lucked out enough to grow a decent sized frontal lobe and are thus capable of reasoning, philosophy, scientific advancement and evaluating both ourselves and our world. We have created the concepts of ethics and morality, albeit unlikely to be universal should we encounter alien intelligence, which means we can consider our world, our society and our individual places in those things with the benefit of another neuropsych phenomenon... empathy.   Put it all together and the simplest meaning and purpose for most of us becomes clear. Better our own lives, gain and increase our happiness and weigh all of this alongside the lives and happiness of our fellow humans, animals and the world in general.   The specifics will obviously differ from human to human. Some go so far as to sacrifice their happiness and even lives to protect others, finding meaning and purpose in the life of a career soldier or fireman or what have you. Some decide their own happiness, through the acquisition of wealth or power, weighs heavier than the lives and happiness of others and focus on that. Some simply don't think about it and go through their lives without a focus on any such things, letting life go along and their decisions made on the spur of the moment.   Me, I find meaning and purpose in continually broadening my horizons a bit, learning and gaining understanding of various pursuits from medicine to playing the violin or simply painting miniatures for board games. Caring for my cat or my coworkers and friends. Being a little bit better tomorrow than I am today.  I suppose my job certainly counts as well, as a paramedic.

According to the 'humanist' or scientific logic, nobody truly needs any meaning and purpose, they just pretend they have one via whatever philosophy. A 'humanist' could potentially be categorised as somebody who is aware of this, in comparison to say, I don't know, an evangelical christian zealot who isn't aware of their own pretention (yes I made that word up according to Reddit Grammar).  Professing awareness of said realisation requires realising that we are pretenders, thus pretention is an embodiment of metaphysical adherence, thus paradoxically contradicting your point.  Long story short, Socrates."

humanism,37sisq,darkthoughts_1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:15:05 2015 UTC,"Going from the definitions I've found, interculturism is the belief that people should actively work to foster intercultural empathy and understanding between cultural groups, whereas multiculturalism is the belief of ""to each their own."" Toleration is the extent of a multicultural society, mutual understanding and even appreciation is the ideal of an intercultural one. I'm not exactly learned on the topic, but as I've grown up within an international context, I feel like I should comment.   I've effectively grown up, and in fact came to humanism, on account of interculturalism. From a young age I made it a point to not discriminate, and simply interacted with others on whatever interests we had in common (usually video games, but you'll be surprised how diverse gamers can be as a community). At this point I've kind of become a cultural mirror and I'm able to relate in foreign environments fairly easily, I mimic the accent to a degree subconsciously in order to help learn to interpret second language English speakers better, amongst other little things. It's a form of mimicking/parroting that makes you seem like you get the culture or are at least trying. I like the ideal of a intercultural society and would wish that more people become that way.  But in a sense I also understand the quote unquote realists, not because I agree with them that those of different cultures can never fundamentally agree or find similarities to bond over, but because the essence of culture lies in the in-group out-group mentality. As someone who desires the formation of new cultural identities and eccentric subcultures to herald the creation of a new global society, I think cultural exclusion is a necessary requirement. To make a new society and new norms, not only must cultural pioneers exist, but they must be both successful and exclusive. Exclusivity incentivizes adaptation in order to reap the in-group rewards, rather than drowning it out in relativistic tolerance. Tolerance in my view tends towards the path of least resistance and encourages mediocrity and herd-like conformity; not conforming to any principle but simply whatever whims society seems to fancy.  I want the emergence of superior cultures, which is bound to conflict with those of contemporary moderns. Tolerance and cultural relativism are a sort of epistemic apathy that leads to the atrophy of strong cultural values - the source of many societal problems today imo."

humanism,37mimz,tmamone,10,Thu May 28 18:40:57 2015 UTC,"If I'm correct in my assessment, this article is attacking Secular Humanism for not being an explicitly socialist ideology. It also claims it was explicitly socialist/communistic in the past, and contrasts that with modern attitudes.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was considerably more economically left-oriented in the past. These days, most Secular Humanists tend to primarily focus on the nonreligion aspect of it, which is covered in the article. They would like Humanism to pay more attention to perceived issues of economic inequality, by rejecting capitalism and 'neoliberalism'.  In my view, free market capitalism and the UDHR are easily compatible.    22: Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic,  social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.   Most capitalist societies these days have already achieved this without resorting to anti-capitalistic policies.   23.1: Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.   This does not mean 'the government must provide everyone a job'. All it means is that the government must protect people from poverty until they have found suitable employment. Easily accomplished by security nets within a free market.   23.3: Everyone who works has the right to just and favorable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.   Again, most every first world nation has accomplished this within the realms of the free market.   25.1: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well- being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care   and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of  unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood  in circumstances beyond his control.   Once again.   28: Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and  freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized.   And again.   From the perspective of mainstream economics these are truly radical notions. Capitalism is unequipped to deliver on such principles and in fact doesn't even believe in them.   From the article itself, ignoring that it definitely does believe in such principles. Impoverished people are not equipped to participate in the markets as well as other groups, so why would capitalism encourage them to exist?"

In particular, I'll point out that it is impossible to be truly moral/ethical in an environment where the threat of violence is present.   For example, if someone has a gun to my neck and orders me stab a third person, you cannot argue that my decision to do it or not is a moral choice.

We decided together that we're going to put a dollar in the popsicle fund jar each week to keep the popsicles stocked up. We also thought it might be tempting to skip out on our dues sometimes, so we agreed together to a rule that if one of us didn't pay they wouldn't be allowed in the clubhouse that week. Word spread about our awesome clubhouse, so we decided to let others join out clubhouse as long as they agree to the rules.   Now you come along and say you want to hang out and eat popsicles, but you don't want to pay the dues. We say that's not allowed because we all contribute together to have a cool playhouse.   You protest and say you don't eat as many popsicles as /u/Doctor_Murderstein so you should have to pay as much as him. You say we should cancel the popsicle fund and just go individually to the ice cream truck if we want frozen treats.   We say no, it's a waste of time to have to chase after the truck for every treat and we'll end up paying twice as much for popsicles because we have to cover the cost of gas for the truck, the driver's salary, and the investors' profits.   Frustrated, you say you just won't eat any popsicles, so we should let you hang out for free. We say no, we don't want to have to go buy pencils and paper to keep track of who's paying their dues, and we don't want to have hire /u/danpaquette to guard the cooler to enforce it. Also, there are other people who do want to participate in the club who are stuck waiting outside because of the space you're taking up.   If you don't want to play by the rules, you are free to go somewhere else, but don't go crying foul because you didn't want to contribute.

Classical liberalism developed in the 19th century in Europe and the United States. Although classical liberalism built on ideas that had already developed by the end of the 18th century, it advocated a specific kind of society, government and public policy as a response to the Industrial Revolution and urbanization.  Notable individuals whose ideas have contributed to classical liberalism include John Locke,  Jean-Baptiste Say, Thomas Malthus, and David Ricardo. It drew on the economics of Adam Smith and on a belief in natural law,  utilitarianism,  and progress.   In the late 19th century, classical liberalism developed into neo-classical liberalism, which argued for government to be as small as possible to allow the exercise of individual freedom. In its most extreme form, it advocated Social Darwinism. Libertarianism is a modern form of neo-classical liberalism.

Many anarchists and socialists still refer to themselves as libertarians or Libertarian Socialists (to differentiate from the modern US definition).  Liberalism in Europe tends to mean being liberal both in an economic and a social sphere. US Liberalism would be almost synonymous with Social Democracy in Europe.
humanism,37i65i,hellafun,5,Thu May 28 01:48:00 2015 UTC,"No question is dumb, we cannot possibly have a conversation if we don't understand one another's positions. :)  I'll confess that I am not too familiar with John Rawls vision of liberalism, so if the liberalism I am speaking about isn't remotely similar, please tell me about the liberalism Rawls wrote about.  Anyhow, Libertarianism as I understand it is socially liberal but fiscally conservative and all for a small government (especially on the federal level). Liberalism as I understand it believes in a larger government that regulates morality/ethics and seeks to construct a wellfare state.  To explain my position in a bit more detail:   As a Libertarian I am under the impression that the welfare issues can be handled much better by private individuals and institutions than they can with bureaucracies. Which I think is another major difference in mindset at least… Libertarians expect people to do their duty as citizens, we believe in the innate goodness of people and that we can help our neighbors much more efficiently than the federal government can. As I understand it Liberalism must believe that people are lazy, bad, and not remotely civic-minded; otherwise why would it suggest we cannot be trusted to behave ethically if we don’t legislate and monitor our ethics?  It almost never works out for the best in the long term, in fact many (most? all?) previous attempts at legislating ethics and morality have lead to us becoming a police state, to having the largest prison population on the planet, to turning people with addiction/chemical dependency issues into criminals, etc. The other side of the coin is that by legislating morality/ethics people feel they have permission to not be good citizens. How many people have you meat who don’t volunteer their time because “i pay taxes, that’s the way i contribute”? Maybe I’ve had a bad run of luck in that regard, but throughout my lifetime I have encountered far too many people with such an attitude. When the government forces someone to behave in a certain way or spend money in a certain way it doesn’t effect a positive change in the person, it effects a negative one that has more negative knock-on effects down the road. How many civic minded individuals do you know in general? By that I don’t mean people who talk politics, how many people do you know that volunteer at homeless shelters? Litter clean-up around your city? Graffiti clean-up? My guess is that you don’t know too many people who like to spend their free time and effort on such things. If you ask people why not, my guess is they’ll tell you it’s because it’s the job of someone in a tax-payer supported bureaucracy    Libertarians like myself believe in a strictly constitutional federal government. The feds should exist to protect our citizens from physically harming one another, and protect our citizens from being physically harmed by outside forces. Everything beyond that is actually illegal as defined by our constitution. Government at the state and municipal level can (and likely should) be a bit more developed than that, but certainly not these bureaucratic monstrosities they currently are.  Government coddling the citizens only makes the citizens dull and useless. It’s bad for individuals and it’s bad for the country as a whole. As a Humanist I don’t think dictating ethics or morality, or forcing them on people is a very humanist thing to do. I’d much rather educate, encourage, and provide an example; if my sister and brother humans join me in Humanism and humanist behavior I would prefer it be because they see and understand why it’s a better path, and stand shoulder to shoulder with me full free, responsible, and aware; not because they have no other choice thanks to the laws of the land.  Finally, I apologize for any antagonistic bits in there, I assure you they're not intended, but you know how it can be discussing things like politics and religion. >_< Please don't take offense as none was intended. I'd actually really like to hear what your understanding of Liberalism and Libertarianism are too, as well as your take on this comment. :)"

On the 3rd January 106 BC Marcus Tullius Cicero, lawyer, politician, Roman philosopher and the founding father of Humanism was born. His academy, the Studia Humanitas taught ‘the art of living well and blessedly through learning and instruction in the fine arts’, his version of ‘humanitas’ put man not God at the centre of the world.Centuries later, Cicero’s teachings had been metamorphosed into ‘Classical Humanism’, a faith in the soft arts of the Greek world. But how did Cicero’s ideas become Renaissance ideals? How did a small Greek curriculum later become a world philosophy? The human centred creed is credited with giving us human rights and democracy but has also been blamed for the most unspeakable horrors of the modern age. Have his ideas been distorted through the centuries for political ends? And why do some contemporary thinkers think the Humanist tradition is responsible for Elitism, Sexism and even Nazism?

The program starts saying they will explore why ""some contemporary thinkers think the Humanist tradition is responsible for Elitism, Sexism and even Nazism"", then seems to be fairly categorical they are responsible, not that some think there is a link. Which I also have a bit of an issue with, as the Humanist manifesto came out in the 1930s and contradicts the ideas of ""Elitism, Sexism and even Nazism"", so that as an idea, doesn't ring true for me.

As a humanist, I would never argue that humans are the supreme beings of the universe. I wouldn't argue that humans come first in all regards. That isn't a requirement of humanism.   If I support better treatment of chickens, despite economic reprocussions to humans, is that an anti-humanist approach? Of course not!   Humanism is the belief that ethics, logic and reason comes from humanity, not a god. You can definitely worship a god while still believing that morality wasn't handed down from said God."

Humanist beliefs stress the potential value and goodness of human beings, emphasize common human needs, and seek solely rational ways of solving human problems."
humanism,36snak,flyonawall,1 point,Mon May 25 20:49:36 2015 UTC,Right. I don't see the belief in a god interfering with any of those. The strict belief in the rules of a religious text would indeed interfere.
humanism,36snak,joalr0,3,Mon May 25 20:53:22 2015 UTC,"I embrace humanism because it simultaneously gives us the humility and audacity to recognize that the state of the world is in our hands, in our decisions. I personally believe that humanism grants a broad view of the history and wisdom of humanity and that we can learn from all the various disciplines that we've created to make meaning in our world.   I am an atheist - I don't believe in any sort of divinity or deities that exist or rule the roost. But I do think that religious experiences are real events that people have, and that humanism is large enough to incorporate these events into our understanding of the world. Where the obvious difference comes in is that the religious person thinks they've encountered some sort some of supernatural realm - I think it's merely a different state of mind that has evolved and followed us from our ancestors to now.   As a humanist, I don't really think that religions is positive or negative. It's simply a part of us that, for some reason, won't go away. We can decide to demonize it and throw the baby out with the bathwater, or we can decide to approach it with science and reason and figure out how we can extrapolate wisdom to live well while chunking out the unnecessary parts.   I hope this made sense!"
humanism,36snak,chrismatallana,2,Sun May 24 04:49:49 2015 UTC,Atheism doesn't see the world. Makes only one claim about reality. It makes no claims to explain anything. God does not exist is not a way of seeing the world.
humanism,36snak,observetheday,2,Thu May 21 23:58:58 2015 UTC,"I think people who describe themselves as strong atheists use logic and science to debunk religion, and focus on the fact that religions are mostly wrong and often bad in their beliefs (teachings and gods).

The side bar definition covers it pretty well. The key, as I see it, is that our ethical choices in life are based on evidence rather than on a book. There is no absolute answer and there should be continuous discussion and debate about what is right and ethical.   To be believe in a creator doesn't stop any of this, especially, as in your case, the potential creator does not interfere, require worship or sacrifice. We are all agnostic because we cannot prove beyond a doubt the absence of a creator/god. It's just that some of us are more agnostic than others. Dawkins describes is at a 1-7 scale where 1 is absolute certainty of the existence of god and 7 the absolute certainty of the absence of god. If memory serves he considers himself a 6.9 (much where I consider myself).  You may not be British but the British Humanist Association website is pretty informative.  TL;DR: Yep, humanist"

humanism,36o7li,Error302,3,Wed May 20 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"it's not uncommon to hold a handful of philosophical positions all at once with some overlap. being a humanist as far as i understand, much like science in general, just doesn't say anything about deities and so forth apart from simply not being based on them.  if you're really interested in the whole proof/disproof of god thing then i can give you a pretty good place to start. when thinking about whether some sort of proposition is correct (god exists) then the first step is to think about what kind of evidence we would expect for god, what sorts of things would indicate god and would only (probably) be there if a god exists and not there if there were no god. then go look. see if you can find any evidence where you would expect to find it, but also see if you find no evidence in places you would expect it to be. if you find no evidence in all the places you expect to find it, then this is pretty good evidence against the proposition. and of course if you can't even concieve of what kind of evidence you're looking for, then the proposition may just be malformed/incoherant/nonsense.  but here's a dirty little secret for you, you can be agnostic and atheist at the same time and odds are good that if you're one you're probably the other too. because not being convinced that a god actually exists means you are atheist. you wanna stay open minded, and that's great, maybe someday if someone manages to find compelling objective evidence of deities you'll change your mind, but until then, walk around proudly with your agnostic atheist humanist labels, as well as any others you think fit.

humanism,36o7li,Louevill,3,Wed May 20 21:27:05 2015 UTC,"Humanism to me is more a belief that it doesn't really matter how you idenitify yourself in order for you to be a good person or to belive that others are good.  It is a stance that removes the supernatural and dogma from religion, and puts the focus on who you are as a person.  Check out the book Good Without God by Greg Epstein, he has a really amazing perspective on what Humanism is."

I'm an agnostic because I don't know what could exist outside of this mutual experience we know we are sharing in some fashion. The former defines me more than the latter, because humanism encompasses more than just a position on belief in an undetected super-powerful creator. It teaches the beautiful and the good that all can speculate upon and share on this level of reality, and that feels more useful to my life. If there are higher intelligences, there would be little we could do to interfere with their actions in reality anyway."

In fact, unless one was not truly following their faith they cannot see any other world view as 'legitimate'. A primary distinction in (I think) all monotheism is a delineation between those of the faith and those outside it.  If you mean Religious people seeing Humanist people as 'legitimate' in terms of their belief structure... yes, I think so - humans are dynamically evaluating their surroundings and its entirely possible for a human (who lives in shades of grey, rather than black and white) to see value in the perspectives of others... despite dogma."

The latter were more of an intellectual movement that can broadly be said to have followed Scholasticism, which had dominated European thought for ~2 centuries. The renaissance humanists were very interested in finding and re-popularizing Greek and Roman texts, and promoted the study of what we now call ""the humanities"": history, philosophy, grammar, and rhetoric.  Renaissance Humanism  For example, insofar as Thomas More was a Renaissance humanist, in almost no way would he be considered a humanist by 21st century standards.  Edit: and a bot snuck up on me."
humanism,36c52v,qqzqq,2,Mon May 18 13:10:03 2015 UTC,"Renaissance humanism:       Humanism is the study of classical antiquity, at first in Italy, and then spreading across Western Europe in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. The terms Renaissance (rinascimento ""rebirth"") for this movement, and ""humanist"" (whence modern humanism; also Renaissance humanism to distinguish it from later developments grouped as humanism) are contemporary to that period.   Renaissance humanism was a response to the utilitarian approach and what came to be depicted as the ""narrow pedantry"" associated with medieval scholasticism.  Humanists sought to create a citizenry able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the studia humanitatis, today known as the humanities: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy.  According to one scholar of the movement,     Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the Middle Ages, not merely provided the old Trivium with a new and more ambitious name (Studia humanitatis), but also increased its actual scope, content and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The studia humanitatis excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group.   As a program to revive the cultural—and particularly the literary—legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity, humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a small elite. There were important centres of humanism in Florence, Naples, Rome, Venice, Genoa, Mantua, Ferrara, and Urbino.    Image i - Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man (c. 1490) shows the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in his De Architectura. Vitruvius described the human figure as being the principal source of proportion among the Classical orders of architecture.

Humanism is about skepticism, scientific world views applied to ethics, self determination for all human beings, secularism (religion being kept out of societies affairs). While religion was often served to be contradictory to these things, and while someone taking their religious scripture 100% literally could in no way be a humanist (not even folks we call 'fundamentalists' do this), there is certainly room within modern religion for humanists.  If you wanna believe in a creator god, a afterlife, reincarnation, etc, that is cool with me. Just don't be a dick."

There's lots of ""no false idols and only one true god"" in many religions, so when you say that you humanity is your primary concern, it goes at odds with worshiping gods.  It can also be frustrating as a humanist when every time something good happens theists will thanks their god/s, rather than the people beside them. Hence the disdain you might sense, though I would call it naivety.  Humanism isn't trying to sell you a creation answer either, so if you think god created the universe but you want people to be your concern, then you can...but when you take away all the mysticism of theism there isn't really much more to say about how it all came to be. If you think god is immortal and created the universe, why not just cut out the middle man, and say the universe is eternal? The argument becomes pretty flimsy."

humanism,36c52v,flyonawall,3,Mon May 18 18:33:47 2015 UTC,"i think what that quiz is aiming for (apart from the primary aim of trying to persuade people they are humanists) is that humanism tends to separate religion from cause and effect.  i think a  religious humanist could feel that there is something ""more important"", but likely wouldn't say that it was the cause of, say, the universe existing, or the source of moral values.  although having said that i could imagine a more sophisticated argument that does manage so, to some degree, perhaps by saying that this is an emergent property we don't understand, in some way.  something that is holistic and ""science compatible"".  and my (very) limited understanding of unitarians is they hover somewhere round this space.  but speaking personally, i'm happy to welcome pretty much anyone who takes the time to think a little.  and what i hope humanism adds to atheism / agnosticism is more of an understanding of human nature and complexity.  the reductionist, caricatured (uthinking) approach to religion that is seen in other groups should be less here, even if it is clearly still present..."

humanism,369oej,philwalkerp,2,Sun May 17 15:23:13 2015 UTC,"Both actually. I believe the government should remain neutral and not endorse one religion over another and that laws should not be based on religious beliefs. This also includes teacher / faculty led prayers, creationism taught in schools, crosses being hung in government buildings. If these are welcome then all religions and the non religious should be allowed the same treatment and space.  Not to mention when laws are passed in the name of religion it's always in the name of Christianity. To my knowledge there has never been a law passed in the name of Islam. So one could say the government endorses Christianity."
humanism,369oej,xxflufyniplesxx,2,Sun May 17 15:38:42 2015 UTC,"But if laws were based on religious beliefs, would that not be a violation of the religious neutrality of the state? (and thus violate my definition)  To me, believing in the second definition of ""separation of church and state"" contradicts two other humanist principles: freedom of conscience and of speech. Shouldn't people of religious faith be permitted, under the tenets of humanism, to advocate for whatever they want based on their beliefs? (not saying I agree with them...but that they should not be denied agency based because of their beliefs). Thus governments that respect separation of church and state would not adopt laws based on religious reasons (such as sharia law)."
humanism,369oej,xxflufyniplesxx,1 point,Sun May 17 15:51:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right. The laws that are passed in the name of religion are a violation of church and state and should never be allowed. Limiting others in favor of the religious is not what America is about. How it got there, I don't know.   Everybody has the right to advocate for whatever beliefs they hold. If you don't like abortion go out and protest. Don't like guns, go protest. Don't like drugs go protest. But once you get laws passed that limit others based on your religion you have crossed the line."
humanism,369oej,Chive,1 point,Sun May 17 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer this from a UK perspective.  Currently there is an established State Church in England- the Church of England- with the monarch as its head. CofE bishops also, by nature of their position, sit in the House of Lords- the second and unelected chamber of the UK parliament- as Lords Spiritual.  In the rest of the UK the situation is different. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have no state church. They used to but in each case it has been disestablished. Church of Scotland is a national church rather than a state church- which can get a little confusing- but the main difference is the separation of church and state in its case, with both bodies being entirely independent of each other, rather than the situation in England.  The present situation raises some cause for concern- particularly that unelected representatives of a state church that only has authority in England can influence the passage of legislation affecting other parts of the UK where they have no such authority. To this end organisations such as the British Humanist Association and National Secular Society campaign against the status quo with the ultimate aim of disestablishing the Church of England and removing its bishops from the House of Lords.  On the whole, a majority of British people seem to be reasonably happy about church leaders making political comments but this is probably more about making their opinions known than throwing their weight around to influence policy."
humanism,369oej,Chive,2,Sun May 17 16:31:29 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the input from the UK perspective (having lived there many years myself) but what do most Brits think ""separation of church and state"" means?   (a) religious neutrality of the state; or  (b) religious people/organizations refraining from attempting to influence public policy on the basis of their religion?  I don't live in the U.S.A. so I don't know how most Yanks define the principle either."
humanism,369oej,Kilomyles,1 point,Sun May 17 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"Good question. I'd have to say it's a fairly grey area. I don't think most people really think about it- other than active humanists and secularists- but it would involve a bit of both answers.  From the state's side it would involve not favouring any particular religion- including the lack of religion- and treating all equally. That said, for many humanists that doesn't really go far enough as it's easy for the government to say it's not favouring any religion but still favour religion over the lack of it- especially when you get an idiotic government minister state that;  ""We're a Christian nation. We have an established church. Get over it. And don't impose your politically correct intolerance on others.""  Thankfully he was moved out of the cabinet in the most recent reshuffle.  As far as humanists go, it would involve disestablishing the Church of England. Let people attend if they want, but don't have the monarch as head nor the bishops in the House of Lords. Those are primarily symbolic, but still important. The question of tax breaks for and the charitable status of many churches is also a rather thorny one.   A major issue is that of faith schools- both independent schools run by religious groups but particularly faith schools funded by the state. This is of particular concern in areas where schooling options are limited; in more rural areas, for example, it's possible that the only school might be a faith school. Faith schools tend to be discriminatory in nature and favour those who subscribe or pretend to subscribe to that faith. It's a situation that many people are not happy about but that the Conservative government has no intention of addressing- in fact they prefer the exact opposite approach.  Put bluntly, this does not look like much of a commitment to religious neutrality.  The question of religious organisations trying to influence people on the basis of their religion doesn't really apply so much to the UK. The church has been marginalised to a very great extent in most areas- Northern Ireland possibly being the most notable exception- meaning that it has very little influence on most people. In fact it would probably be fair to say that very religious people- especially those who are also politically motivated- tend to be viewed rather unfavourably by both the general public and UK media."
humanism,369oej,marzolian,1 point,Tue May 19 20:11:03 2015 UTC,"Try looking at an extreme situation. Let's say a very religious person wants to pass a law about water management.   It has nothing to do with their religion, however they claim god spoke to them and instructed them to create it.  This is often their main speaking point and is a publicly known fact.  Under your second definition, they would be unable to pass the law since it was religiously influenced. This would be bad.  Under the first definition, the law would pass as it should. However if the law said that Religious parties had priority of water rights over other parties, this would be considered illegal and invoke the idea of church/state separation since all peoples wouldn't be equally represented.  The problem comes when people mistakenly think that this law is meant to prevent religion in society (which it doesn't) instead of protecting society from religion (which is its purpose)"

The logical fallacy here is of course, cherry picking, we attribute meaning retrospectively. I used to think my life path was very clear and full of purpose. You can trace through the milestones very easily. But then one day I realized that it was simply a point of view. I am woven into the fabric of existence, the way in which I observe the interactions of space and time is totally arbitrary.

From a epistemelogical standpoint, belief is just a relationship a person has with a proposition such that the the holder of the belief would maintain that the proposition is true. The argument in this post is that there cannot be justification in a religious context, which is debatable, but typically justification is an element seperate from belief. Things like direct sense experience, which they mention, would usually be considered to be justification.  To clarify, 'knowlege,' in philosophy, is typically understood to be ""justified true belief."" I have knowlege of proposition 'p' if: I believe p, I am justified in believing p, and p is true. So it is possible to have unjustified beliefs, and it's even possible to have true unjustified belief."

I just don't understand the following (can someone explain?):  In my view, the most important aspect of humanism is that our belonging to the ""human group"" supersedes our sense of belonging to any other group. When people ask me who I am, my first and only thought is to say that I'm a human being... An equal member of the human group. This implies that my sense of belonging to my country, to my birth given language, to my age group, to my social class, to my gender, to my sexual orientation, to my ""religion"", to my race/ ethnicity, etc, are all fabricated social concepts. They are all impermanent. They are all creations of our mind. My human identity is rock solid. It is the one source of my identity that cannot change, no matter what.

humanism,326wol,TheAtheistPriest,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:03:51 2015 UTC,"I think because of the first few points raised in the article.   For starters, if your concern is primarily about human needs and human desires, then God's desires can take a back seat. Whether you consider this a good thing or a bad thing, one can easily see where a person's interests and God's interests don't align. At the very least, a humanist will prefer to address the human's concerns first. Given the religiosity of many conservatives, this could prove a barrier to humanist thought amongst this subreddit.   Second, humanists place a special value on concepts that are provable through human experiences and tools, most notably science. Conservatives' emphasis on the importance of tradition may be somewhat of a roadblock to the scientific method, for better or worse, and that may hinder humanistic thought from progressing in conservative communities. Reliance on sacred texts or institutional wisdom just isn't a very 'scientific' thing to do.   Edit: for some reason I can't explain, I thought I was in /r/Conservative when I typed this response.

But this subreddit is still the subreddit we make it to be. I may be wrong, but a big part of your activity in this subreddit seems to consist of your involvement in metadiscussions about something belonging to here or not. However, pointing out that /r/Humanism is not /r/Atheism may be a Sisyphean task. Wouldn't it be better to post something which belongs to /r/Humanism instead?  That being said, I still second your concern. Articles like this one can be discussed within a Humanistic context, but they should better be posted within a text post establishing the connection. Unfortunately, that isn't the case here."
humanism,31mne4,anaxarchos,3,Wed Apr 8 11:56:50 2015 UTC,"True, I do spend some of my time in this subreddit pointing out that various random articles have nothing to do with humanism. However, I have also:   Posted a couple of videos from the British Humanist Association. Shared an ""Ask A Humanist"" website.  Posted about a Christmas carol with a humanist message. Discussed moral realism in humanism. Refuted a critique of humanism, as per someone's request. Guessed at why humanism seems to attract older people. Discussed the morality of murder. Shared my experience of being a member of a humanist association.  Addressed objections to humanism. Opined about politics in humanism.   As a moderator of other subreddits, I've told complainers to ""be the change you want to see in the subreddit"". I like to think I do my bit here in /r/Humanism, and don't only complain about the irrelevant posts. I participate in threads I like and that I want to see more of here, as well as upvoting them. However, I'll concede that I'm mostly a reader and lurker here, and not primarily a contributor (despite that flair I got for creating a sidebar image for the moderators). I reckon I'm about 50/50: participant versus complainer.   As for complaining about the irrelevant posts... I don't know what else to do. Downvoting these posts after they've got 20 or 30 upvotes seems kind of pointless. I'm not sure if the moderators do anything when I report these posts (or, if they do, it takes a long time for them to act). The only thing left to do, if I don't want this subreddit over-run by irrelevant articles, is to try to point out to people that these articles are irrelevant.   Should I stop? Would that make the subreddit a better place? I am starting to feel like I'm fighting a losing battle. Maybe I should give up and start /r/TrueHumanism! :P"

I am afraid that real change is hard to achieve by single members. It may be better to open a thread about the problem, but then, at the moment there is one pointing to what Humanism is not about. I doubt that one could master the problem without moderating more strictly, although I would prefer a place where that would not be necessary."

From my experience as a subscriber and moderator on reddit, there is no way to achieve that. As long as we leave the choice up to the subscribers and their upvotes, we'll get what's popular rather than what's relevant. And, given that many humanists would also be anti-theists, they'll like articles which are negative about religion. They won't care whether the anti-religion article is relevant to the subreddit it's posted in, they'll merely upvote it because they like it (some readers won't even notice what subreddit an article is in while they upvote it from their reddit front page).

Unitarian Universalism views the concept of salvation to include the metaphysical notion of finding peace within oneself through the process of questioning and examining oneself and the world. Humanism (secular and religious) are both quite compatible with the UU model, which focuses on answering questions rather than pointing out a ""right"" answer. The only potential bump between the UU worldview and atheism is that UU built around the idea of asking questions when there is an absence of definitive proof (much like agnosticism), while atheism's principle supposition is the non-existence of a deity form."

humanism,31m3kf,liammars,2,Sat Apr 11 15:11:57 2015 UTC,"Why then do you go by the American terminology?  And so it is everywhere in the world, except (maybe) the USA.   According to the American Humanist Association website:    Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism and other supernatural beliefs, affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity.    So, the official Humanist association in America, just like all other humanist associations, includes atheism in its definition. This is consistent with what I've told you many time: the modern humanist organisations define themselves as atheistic.   However, Humanist organisations are only a subset of the humanist philosophy. They may represent the majority of humanists today, but the definition of humanism as a philosophy is still more inclusive than ""only atheists"":   Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over established doctrine or faith (fideism). The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated, according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it. Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of a ""human nature"" (sometimes contrasted with antihumanism).   Note that there's no reference to atheism in that definition. Even the references to critical thinking and rationalism are qualified with a ""generally prefers"" rather than a ""must include"".   I don't know how to explain this any more clearly. There's a philosophy called humanism, which includes both theistic humanism and atheistic humanism. The atheistic (or secular) humanists have formed Humanist Associations for their secular humanism. The existence of Humanist Associations which represent secular humanism does not erase theistic humanism as a subset of humanist philosophy."
humanism,31m3kf,MrJaggedArray,2,Sat Apr 11 22:58:51 2015 UTC,"Religious people only started calling themselves 'humanists' to affirm their humanitarianism in the 20th century, out of envy for the clear and popular moral and ethical frameworks used by humanists. They've often used historical 'humanisms' like Renaissance humanism to argue that Humanism 'was once inclusive of religious people', but this is a very separate thing, and this 'humanism' entered into the language separately - and later - than Humanism as describes a non-religious life stance combining rational scepticism with a code of ethics built around empathy. Though only more recently called 'Humanism', it is a philosophy which has been shared from the dawn of human writing, from thinkers like Epicurus and Confucius, through to the present day. Precisely because it is built on rational scepticism, it is formally incompatible with theism and supernaturalism of all kinds.  'Religious humanism' has always referred to the Ethical Culture movement - religious atheist hippies of the Sunday Assembly mould.  It has been something of a strategy, in recent years, particularly within the Church of England, to use phrases like 'Christian humanism'. One could suspect this is well-meaning, and based off of historical ignorance and wishful thinking, or purely as a mode of emphasising humanitarianism within Christianity. But one might also venture that this is part of a deliberate strategy to undermine the integrity of what Humanism actually means. It is a shame that so forums like this subreddit should be taken in by this deception, and in turn, help to sew further confusion about what Humanism means."

That's not historically correct. The first thinkers to adopt the ""humanist"" label were Renaissance philosophers, who were all Christian. A representative figure was Pico della Mirandola with his Oration on the Dignity of Man. Atheist humanists only made their appearance around the time of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution (Voltaire, for instance)."

I don't see much of a contradiction, frankly. Both say that humanism is not theistic (with ""theism"" meaning the belief in god or gods, especially as creator of the universe); one definition adds the lack of supernaturalism (which covers other forms of supernaturalism too).   As a religious humanist, I am comfortable with either definition. I don't believe in god or gods, or in the supernatural, and my religion does not promote those either. I do attend a religious service every Sunday, which is humanist in nature, but that does not mean I must resolve more ""conflicting beliefs"" with humanism than the average secular humanist does. However, I think humans have a complex psychology and are often hypocritical (myself included); thus we may all hold assumptions and beliefs that may, upon close scrutiny, not quite hold up to a strict humanist definition...and which therefore exist in contradiction of our humanist principles.   Knowing the nature of humans, the ""resolve conflicting beliefs"" almost goes without saying. But it's nice that it is included to highlight the fact that not all of our beliefs, assumptions, ideas need be strictly humanist in order for us to be considered humanists. (eg. from life experience I believe that virtually all humans are inherently good...I do not believe this is a rational or humanist assumption but I still hold it, and consider myself a humanist).  This does not contradict the IHEU's definition."

I would have never really thought to compare humanism with something like Scientology, which is so clearly different.  But humanism, even modern humanism, has very deep roots...much deeper than the writings of a few recent science fiction authors (even though I admire all of them). One of the principal progenators was the Milesian School of Atomists from antiquity - from which a direct line can be drawn to modern humanist philosophy.  Roots well over two thousand years old, and very different origin and nature than that of a religion based on the writings of a mediocre science fiction writer in the late 1940s and 50s.  Though some also consider humanism to be a cult along with Scientology."
humanism,31jxck,philwalkerp,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:46:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just thought it might be an interesting comparison since the way they were influenced was somewhat similar. And how the beginning principle for both are practically the same, harmony and ethical living. Although that's where their similarities end. Humanism does have heavy roots from antiquity. Scientology has no roots or even any evidence behind their beliefs. I guess my comparison would be with the ""golden years"" of modern humanism which in my opinion was when the science fiction writers got involved. That's when the idea grew to a much larger audience. Just thought it was an interesting perspective on the relation (or rather lack of) between humanism and Scientology."
humanism,31jxck,philwalkerp,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:09:10 2015 UTC,"So do you think humanism is beyond its ""golden years"" now? Does that mean it is in decline? When I read the great essays and books on humanism that the likes of Edwords, Lamont, Kurtz, and others wrote in the 1940s to 1980s, I can't help but wonder the same. Certainly, the average person on the city street (in my country) would probably hold humanist ideas and identify strongly with humanist principles...but would not even know what humanism was if asked if they were a humanist.   Does that mean humanism has triumphed by being internalized in large parts of Western society so much that it is indistinguishable from modern civilized ethics, or that it is in danger of slowly disappearing?"

Because humanism is not based on any theological premise, every individual is free to combine humanism with other belief systems and to resolve conflicting beliefs in their own way.   There are religious humanists. I know a few in my own life. In fact, humanism started as a Christian movement. Humanism is, however, strongly connected to non-religious groups, identities, and ideas because of the ""human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives"" part. Religions tend to impose a meaning and shape to human lives, rather than encourage people to do it for themselves.   There are those that want to equate humanism and atheism.

If a person considers themselves a christian They believe that there is a monotheistic god that is all knowing all powerful and is the creator of time and space. Since this all powerful being gave us the bible to guide our lives and the book is infallible because god is infallible then lets pick a few quotes...  The God of the Bible also allows slavery, including selling your own daughter as a sex slave (Exodus 21:1-11), child abuse (Judges 11:29-40 and Isaiah 13:16), and bashing babies against rocks (Hosea 13:16 & Psalms 137:9).    now A humanist definition in the link : http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/humanist?s=t  how can these ideas co-exist in a persons mind?  edit: couldn't help myself http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oxymoron?s=t"
humanism,318p62,daneelthesane,3,Fri Apr 3 04:50:57 2015 UTC,"I agree that those passages of the Bible are horrendous. I also agree that the book in general is a poor guide for moral living. However, I think you will also find that most Christians disagree with slavery, sex slavery, selling their daughters, child abuse, bashing babies, etc. It's a strange clash of ideas that they have to deal with. I know that not all Christians believe the Bible to be perfect, so those folks are fortunate enough not to have to worry about the paradox. You would have to ask the ones who do believe it how they deal with it.  However, given that most Christians do disagree with slavery and baby-bashing and whatnot, humanism is still not necessarily conflicting with their beliefs. I imagine the bigger challenge is the idea of humans creating their own purpose. A great many Christians seem to have the idea that our purpose has already been decided for us."
humanism,318p62,jse803,0,Fri Apr 3 12:20:48 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing my point. If they don't agree with the things written in the bible. Then they don't agree with God so they are not a Christian.  Reread what I wrote. If God exists and you follow the monotheistic idea. Then God is all knowing all powerful God would be perfect according to the bible.   This split in the mind of religion being anything but this is just religions way of changing its definition. I find it insulting that someone could adopt secular ethic guide lines and shoe horn it into this non sense.  Humanist views are scientific ones in many ways. If you are concerned about the out come and proper treatment of people then you are concerned about the cause of heinous actions against them. This cause and effect thinking is logical  Religious views are heuristic driving on emotional response with the idea behind it of spreading belief not concerned with human well being.  Not to mention being any ""religion"" is just saying I like to play make believe where being a atheist is just saying I choose to deny superstitious claims without valid evidence never mind at that point we would just call the discovered thing part of the real world and science and at that point it would cease being superstitious.   Sorry for the rant but I really get tired of the hand holding I get what your doing. Being peaceful and inclusive. Remember you can train  a lion but one day it will bite."

Hell, the Coptics don't even use all of the same books of the Bible that most other Christians do, and most Orthodox believers are not biblical literalists either.   Are you a Fundamentalist?

humanism,318p62,daneelthesane,4,Fri Apr 3 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"What ""actual"" definition are you using? You are creating a very narrow definition of Christian and then saying things that would only be true within that narrow definition. You are also trying to treat your definition as the definition, which is just plain silly. Remember, there were Christians before there was a Bible. Christianity first spread via word of mouth and handwritten letters between believers. The Bible didn't exist until centuries after Christianity started, and biblical literalism didn't even become en vogue until after the ninth century. No matter how many all caps you put the word ""actual"" in, you are not going to change the fact that one does not have to be a fundamentalist to be a Christian.   You seem to want to rant about Christians, and so you are making as narrow and unreasonable a definition as you can to help you do that. Sure, I think that the belief system, fundamentalist or otherwise, is silly, but I don't have the motivation that you seem to. Go ahead, if that is what you want to do, but I don't really feel the need to do so, nor to further participate in your doing so.

I don't want to ""rant"" about Christians you are the one that brought up the idea that fundamentalism is not that rampant.  i simply used some basic math to prove you wrong.   i am not mocking or denigrating the religious. i am mocking the religion. you don't seem to be able to separate the two. if you were truly concerned with decency and dignity you would always have the motivation and the open mindedness to keep at it. to brush me off as some sort of angry atheist when this is very clearly a conversation about the religious trying to coop humanism is a low move on your part.   lets see how motivated you feel when the pitch forks come in a time of darkness and it's convert of die.  you are right tho. this conversation is done. hope your pacifism is not the end of us."

humanism,318p62,philwalkerp,2,Fri Apr 3 06:14:47 2015 UTC,"I am annoyed so many people conflate ""non-religious"" (or even ""atheist"") with ""humanist."" Humanism is quite different from those.  If ""non-religious"" is simply the lack of religion, and ""humanism"" is a life-stance or philosophy that emphasizes human agency to overcome challenges and better the self and society, using critical thinking and evidence rather than supernaturalism, then it should be obvious that the two are not synonymous at all.  Atheist or non-religious describes the lack of something - what you are not, whereas humanist describes what you are. It is a positive declaration of philosophical outlook defining what one is for rather than what one is against or without.  From ancient times, the Buddha is often considered a humanist, and so is Confucious...right up to modern times, many consider majority Buddhism to be humanism, and many Quakers and Ethical Society and Unitarian churches are outright humanist.  I, for example, am a religious humanist. There is no contradiction at all in that term: religious humanists (in the modern sense of the phrase; those who do not believe in deities or the supernatural) have been been around for at least hundreds of years. In the classical sense of the phrase - Christian, Jewish or Buddhist humanists, for example - they have been around for thousands. And together, helped build the philosophical foundations of modern civilization: freedom of conscience and religion (or lack of religion), equality, rationalism, empiricism, the scientific method, the dignity and worth of the individual, etc etc etc.  The British Humanist Association has a good page on the differences between ""non-religion"" and ""humanism""."

As you can read from Fred Edword's great essay ""What is Humanism"" (on the sidebar of /r/humanism under the title Types of Humanism), modern humanism exists both in its secular and religious forms. Most people on Reddit may be more familiar with secular humanism, but beyond historical contributions of religious humanists like sparking the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, or co-authoring the Humanist Manifestos for example, there are millions more religious humanists in the world today than ever before - even though only a minority would know the name of their personal philosophy of life is ""humanism.""  Mind you, religion ≠ supernaturalism....these are the two things a lot of people conflate. No religious humanist today believes in divine powers, gods, or holy scripture handed down from omnipotent beings: if they did, their philosophy probably couldn't be considered modern humanism.  I am a religious humanist. I don't believe in the supernatural, I strongly support the separation of church and state, and affirm and promote the values embodied in the Amsterdam Declaration. Every Sunday I go sing, listen to a presentation, discuss with fellow community members and take action on progressive social issues...all in a church that promotes the aforementioned humanist values and principles, without prayer or supernaturalism. People from religious backgrounds and with supernatural ideas are of course welcome in this church...but those things aren't what the congregation is about. Related is the fact that I founded and continue to lead my local Humanist Society, which advocates for freedom of religion and irreligion (but not against religion per se), end of discrimination against the irreligious, secular public schools, separation of church and state, and the like. EDIT: I say this is related because the church I go to also supports and, often, campaigns on these issues.  But if /r/humanism is explicitly secular, is it the right place for religious humanists like me?   Mind you, /r/Christian_Humanism and /r/HumanisticJudaism are not for me because I'm not Christian or Jewish, nor do I ascribe to belief structures of those faith traditions.  PS.

Your text was difficult to read, but I powered through anyway, knowing that you put a lot of effort into it. Keep working hard on your english and you will keep finding readers working to read your texts.  If I understand correctly the point of your text, today, you are encouraging problem solving and the creation of problem solving skills.  You are also saying not to let a single aspect of life like work as per your example take over the rest of your life negatively. This is desirable, but we can also argue that we should not ignore a problem or isolate it to that part of life. If a problem is happening at work, our personal friends can often be of great help and be very consoling. Our significant others can often lend us points of view critical to solve our problems, when we discuss our problems and our emotions rationally.  I was also going to stick to my motto: ''let's be reasonable!''  I encourage others to learn the difference between problems we can solve and those that we can't. For example, if the problem at work with the boss that is dissatisfied can be fixed by learning new skills at low to no cost to you, than this is a problem with a solution of a kind. If the problem at work stems from the fact that the boss is never happy no matter what you do, the solution is to adopt an understanding that this person is broken and not blame to yourself.

humanism,30ieq9,breauxdle,9,Fri Mar 27 17:44:48 2015 UTC,"Secular humanism is not a religion. It replaces religion for many people, and it's an answer many people give when asked about their religion, but as the name indicates, it is very much not a religion. As such, it need not conflict with religions that don't conflict with it. UU churches are chock full of people who also (or even primarily) identify as humanist.  One of the pastors of the Episcopalian church I was raised in was herself raised Unitarian. She joked that she was taught to believe that there is at most one god. There were a lot of humanists at that Episcopalian church too. Many of them were there more to sing with their friends and family and organize charitable work, which is a fairly humanist set of activities assuming you choose the right hymns and stay away from the creepier parts of the gospel. Some Christians might say that made for a lousy Christian church, but their diocese stated that their policies were dictated by reason, tradition, and scripture, in that order. That sounds quite compatible with humanism to me, though it is not itself secular."
humanism,30ieq9,Centropomus,4,Fri Mar 27 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a humanist in Canada, and I'm also a member of my local Unitarian Universalist church. It's actually pretty strange for me to say that I ""go to church"" because for all my life I've been - and continue to be - an agnostic with atheist tendencies. In fact I'm active with a number of explicitly secular organizations, like Centre for Inquiry, Sunday Assembly and IHEU.  Within the Unitarian church, there are wide range of views on spirituality and the existence of god(s) - there is no dogma or doctrine, no creed or scripture, and people are free to believe what they like - but I'm part of what is probably the largest group within Unitarianism, that is the HUUmanists. At my local congregation, people of similar mind to myself probably make up the majority as well, they would be Humanists in every sense of the word, but might not be considered ""secular"" Humanists because they obviously belong to a religion - even if they don't believe in the supernatural.  Fred Edwords probably put it best in his article ""What is Humanism?"" (linked on the sidebar as Types of Humanism ):   Secular and Religious Humanists both share the same worldview and the same basic principles. This is made evident by the fact that both Secular and Religious Humanists were among the signers of Humanist Manifesto I in 1933, Humanist Manifesto II in 1973, and Humanist Manifesto III in 2003. From the standpoint of philosophy alone, there is no difference between the two. It is only in the definition of religion and in the practice of the philosophy that Religious and Secular Humanists effectively disagree.  The definition of religion used by Religious Humanists is often a functional one. Religion is that which serves the personal and social needs of a group of people sharing the same philosophical worldview.  To serve personal needs, Religious Humanism offers a basis for moral values, an inspiring set of ideals, methods for dealing with life's harsher realities, a rationale for living life joyously, and an overall sense of purpose.  To serve social needs humanist religious communities (such as Ethical Culture societies and many Unitarian Universalist churches) offer a sense of belonging, an institutional setting for the moral education of children, special holidays shared with like-minded people, a unique ceremonial life, the performance of ideologically consistent rites of passage (weddings, child welcomings, coming-of-age celebrations, memorials, and so forth), an opportunity for affirmation of one's philosophy of life, and a historical context for one's ideas.  Religious Humanists often maintain that most human beings have personal and social needs that can only be met by religion (taken in the functional sense just detailed). They do not feel that one should have to make a choice between meeting these needs in a traditional faith context versus not meeting them at all. Individuals who cannot feel at home in traditional religion should be able to find a home in non-traditional religion.  I was once asked by a reporter if this functional definition of religion didn't amount to taking away the substance and leaving only the superficial trappings. My answer was that the true substance of religion is the role it plays in the lives of individuals and the life of the community. Doctrines may differ from denomination to denomination, and new doctrines may replace old ones, but the purpose religion serves for people remains the same. If we define the substance of a thing as that which is most lasting and universal, then the function of religion is the core of it.   I couldn't have put it better myself.  I used to have a bit of a hate-on for religion, like many atheists might. Then I realized that it's not religion I don't like; it's the supernaturalism in religion that bothered me. It's the ""divine instruction"" and the like that religions use to justify immoral acts and positions, that is a major source of their intolerance, and the promotion of this is a form of spreading ignorance. What if you could have a religion that instead promoted reason, tolerance and human agency without the supernatural stuff...and still have the purpose and great community that religions usually offer?  That's when I walked into a UU Church."

It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities.

Humanism, on the other hand, is a positive declaration about the importance of humans and humanity.   My personal one-line description is that I believe in humans, and our power to do great good - or great evil. Everything we are or could be comes from us. We are the cause of, and solution to, our problems.   Humans are important as thinking and feeling beings; we need to take care of us and each other. Humanism is putting human concerns front and centre. This can occur within a religious framework: modern humanist thought started in Renaissance Christianity. But, these days, most humanists are non-religious and non-theists. Atheism is a subset of modern humanism, but only a tiny part. If you read the Amsterdam Declaration of Humanist principles, you'll see that a lack of belief in the supernatural and divine intervention is only a small part of what we believe."

To cherry-pick some statements from the Amsterdam Declaration which I believe support my view:   Humanists believe that morality is an intrinsic part of human nature based on understanding and a concern for others, needing no external sanction.  Humanists believe that the solutions to the world’s problems lie in human thought and action rather than divine intervention.  Humanists also believe that the application of science and technology must be tempered by human values. Science gives us the means but human values must propose the ends.  Humanism is undogmatic, imposing no creed upon its adherents.   I believe that these statements, and others like them I've read elsewhere, support the idea that we humans create our own morals.

I've found that, for better or worse, you can only lose people, fans, friends, business, etc by specifying your religious position (especially if it is irreligious). Or at least, the few like-minded acquaintances you might gain from doing so will be outweighed by the number of people that will no longer count themselves your friends, customers, etc. The only exception to this is if there is a silent majority who think the same as you...and if you live in a small town in Western Canada (like I used to) that silent majority isn't likely to be secular humanist in orientation. Unless you are in Coastal BC or the Yukon maybe.  The best thing you can do is raise your kids with an inquiring, questioning mind and expose them to humanist ideas. I wish I had learned even a little bit about humanist philosophy and its amazing accomplishments for civilization when I was an adolescent, for example.   On that note, religious education is a bit like sex ed: your kids are going to learn about it eventually, whether from you or from somewhere else. And if it's somewhere else, you might not like what they pick up. So yes, let them learn about religion: many religions so they can decide for themselves and there's no mystery or infectious hype around religions when they encounter them later in life. 9 times out of 10, they will become humanists, whether they identify as that or not. I've found going to a local Unitarian church helpful in this, as (a) everything is questioned there, and nothing is really ""sacred"" or verboten; (b) most at my Unitarian church are agnostics, humanists, or atheists, but may have grown up in other religious traditions; (c) the sizeable minority that are not tend to have Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, Wiccan/Pagan, or Hindu religious ideas, so everyone is exposed to those respectfully, including some of their myths customs and writings; and (d) there is a voluntary ""religious education"" for children there that surveys world religions and ideas in an academic (but not boring) way, with imams, rabbis, priests, monks, etc in those religious traditions coming in to talk and answer just about any questions the youth have. The most interesting and animated discussions tend to be when someone comes to speak representing atheism or humanism, but I may be biased.  Anyways, great to see a fellow Western Canadian humanist!

As for church, my wife is fairly set on that not happening for a bit - we don't attend any. I really never have and my wife flat out won't. It would be something I wouldn't stop for the experience if a friend wanted to invite him along but there would be a discussion about appropriate manners, especially limiting questions as my son won't accept the standard answers kids get and will pursue the manner until he understands - something that has been mentioned about him since daycare, but not technically polite in this particular situation.  Cool hearing about the Unitarian Church - that would have been a cool thing to attend as a child. I had to learn my religion on the streets and in the bible camps. As I said church is a non starter for my wife and is an issue I am willing to take her lead on but information like that is always useful.  It's really nice to see that there are other humanists out there as I really don't know any self defined humanists - I know a few people who may not even have asked that question of themselves. I never really defined myself as an atheist (as defining myself as 'against something' rather than for something sounded dumb and a little dangerous) but I have begun to recently when it was pointed out that more people needed to do it 1) take the sting out the word 2) be heard as a faction when the government addresses issues concerning religion and state.

But just being atheist does not make you humanist either.  Atheism is not an affirmative belief in and of itself.  It is, rather, just an absence of belief in religious dogma.

I've never seen this happen in the US, maybe it does in the UK.   Although they make no claim to be the sole purveyors of this view, they also make no claim to say anything original or to add anything to these views. In other words, humanism has no USP.   This seems to be the main grind the author has–repeatedly stating that humanism has no unique values. Defining the human experience as ubiquitous may seem obvious to someone in a 1st world country with a 21st century education but when you consider the amount of oppression the world has seen it is an important and unique stance indeed.   'Humanists seek to make the best of the one life we have by creating meaning and purpose for ourselves. We choose to take responsibility for our actions and work with others for the common good'. ""Again, nothing unique there, no added value.""   Again the author has taken a singular statement an determined the entire merit of Humanism with it. You could say the same to this sentence–the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness are inalienable rights– but we founded a country on this simple idea.     Why do we need to see ourselves as special? Certainly we are different from other animals but they are also very different from each other.   Again the person she references here never said ""we are special"", this is just her projecting her preconceived notions onto humanism.   There was also a retrospective look at various philosophers and others throughout history whose ideas were described as humanist in some form. This is like firing shots at a wall and then drawing a target round them.   This happens with EVERYTHING. Did Andy Warhol know he was part of the Pop Art Movement? Did Napoleon know he would have an Era named after him? We retroactively apply titles and classes to people all the time, so while it is fair to judge the claim on a case by case basis, it is not something unique to humanism.   This will be news to 16.999 million of them. Nothing is gained for the cause if people are humanist without knowing it and trying to claim 17 million kind of looks a bit needy.   I would say I have almost always been a humanist without always knowing it. Humanism in a form is taught in most public schools, so it isn't entirely unfair to claim people may be humanist without knowing it, though I can see the concern for labeling people without their direct vote.   ...many humanists say that humanism gives them an identity, a worldview and set of moral values/rules similar to those provided by religion but without any supernatural element. In this case, humanism appears to be the methadone to the opiate of religion.   This is just a cute tagline–what is she saying? That we need to ween ourselves off of morality? That sounds...terrible.   There were possibly stronger reasons for joining a humanist group in the past when religious people and values dominated and non-believers of any kind were often isolated. But with current technology, wherever you live and whatever you believe, you can find like-minded people   I think this, more than anything, shows how insular the authors world views are. Since, you know, everyone has access to technology and the internet and whatever.   ...so it can be useful to have a term to set yourself apart and distance yourself from claims made by religious leaders to represent the whole of society. But humanist does this no better than atheist, agnostic, non-believer, rationalist, freethinker, secularist and others.   So the author has an issue with the secular groups in general it would seem.   But for me, it's such an inchoate, nebulous concept that I can't engage with it at all.    Making this not a critique providing insight or perspective, but instead an aimless rant with little evidence to back the claims.  Welp that's my rebuttal, I hope it makes a difference to someone."

Although they make no claim to be the sole purveyors of this view, they also make no claim to say anything original or to add anything to these views. In other words, humanism has no USP. [...] Again, nothing unique there, no added value.   Why is it a flaw to not have a ""unique selling proposition""? There are plenty of car manufacturers, all selling the same things - ""transportation"" and ""comfort"" - but noone says that cars are flawed because the manufacturers don't have a ""unique selling proposition"".  This isn't a critique, it's Ms Kendall's opinion. And not a very valid one, at that. Noone said that Humanism is, or should be, unique. Anyway, if so many organisations are selling the same thing... maybe there's something there worth buying.    One argument against humanism by some believers is that it denies the 'specialness' of humanity. This is an argument levelled against evolutionists and atheists too - even its accusers can't find anything original about it to attack.    On the contrary, humanism makes humans very special: it puts us centre stage of our lives, our problems, and our solutions. To quote Willy Wonka quoting Arthur O'Shaughnessy: ""We are the music makers, And we are the dreamers of dreams. [...] Yet we are the movers and shakers of the world for ever, it seems."" What's more special than saying if anyone's going to fix our problems, it's us? What's more special than saying we're the only people we know, so we'd better take care of ourselves?   There was also a retrospective look at various philosophers and others throughout history whose ideas were described as humanist in some form. This is like firing shots at a wall and then drawing a target round them. The people mentioned were not humanists, most of them existed before the term was coined.   This is not a critique of humanism, per se. There is nothing here that says ""humanism is flawed"". The only problem that Ms Kendall identifies here is the application of the ""humanism"" label to people who lived before humanism was defined. Even she writes that ""Democritus and Epicurus [...] are just as much the precursors of scientific rationalism"" - which implies that they are also precursors of humanism. So, she concedes that these various philosophers were, in fact, precursors of humanism at the same time that she criticises modern humanists for pointing out that these philosophers were precursors of humanism. She's arguing in circles here.   many humanists say that humanism gives them an identity, a worldview and set of moral values/rules similar to those provided by religion but without any supernatural element. In this case, humanism appears to be the methadone to the opiate of religion.   Again, there's no actual critique here, merely an attempt by Ms Kendall at a clever analogy. She hasn't pointed out any actual flaw in humanism, she's merely observing that it has similarities to religions but is different. This is not news.    The BHA provide non-religious celebrants for funerals and other ceremonies. This is a much-needed service but could quite easily exist independently of humanism.   Again, not an actual critique of humanism, merely a repeat of the idea that humanism should somehow be different to everything else and not overlap so much with religions and other philosophies.    humanism is no more significant a definition than being a member of any other special interest club that contributes to or informs your identity and relationship with others.   Again with the idea that humanism has to spectacular and different. Ms Kendall's main problem with humanism is that we don't seem to be exciting enough for her.    To identify as humanist is to identify as either atheist or agnostic along with some or all of a rather vague set of ethical and pro-science statements. But for me, it's such an inchoate, nebulous concept that I can't engage with it at all.   Ms Kendall's inability to grasp what humanism is about is not a criticism of humanism, but a criticism of Ms Kendall.  As I said, there's not really much criticism of humanism in this blog. It's mostly just Ms Kendall complaining that she doesn't get humanism and thinks we should somehow be more unique and different to everyone else. But why? Does she criticise Christianity for having the same ""be good and you'll get into Heaven"" as Islam? Where's their unique selling proposition? What about ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"", which is a dictum found almost universally throughout human religions and philosophies - is this somehow flawed because it's shared among various ethical systems? No. What it means is that there are some good morals in every religion and in every philosophy, and that these good morals may appear in more than one ethical system. That's not a flaw, that's a confirmation that there's something useful and good about these morals. And, if humanism has some of these good morals, then all the better!  EDIT: ""Willy Wonky""? Oops!"

The modern New Atheist movement is antitheistic, and that appeals to many of my peers who feel that religion is a net negative force on the world. So, these young people have just started coming into their own and started doubting the religion they were raised into. The New Atheist movement is all over the place: online, on TV, in books, and they see what the Richard Dawkins-types are saying. The message that religion is bad resonates with them, and they turn to 'aggressive' atheism.  Meanwhile, Humanism is mainly represented by organizations such as the ones you've mentioned. Sure, there are some modern Humanist book writers who are putting their thoughts on the same shelves as Dawkins and Hitchens (AC Grayling is the most notable).

humanism,2ylvf2,StealerofSuns,5,Tue Mar 17 03:56:05 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess here, and say that part of the problem is advertising.   Atheism? I know them! That's the group with Richard Dawkins and Carl Sagan and Christopher Hitchens and all those other high-profile atheists who keep doing the debates and writing anti-religion books and writing blogs. Wow. I don't believe in god, just like them, so I must be an atheist!  Skepticism? Oh yeah, that's got all those cool trendy blogs, by PZ Myers and skepchick, and there's Twitter accounts. Cool. And, they don't believe in god and they believe in science, just like me, so I'm a skeptic!  Humanism? What's that? Has it got any cool folks? Is there a blog? Nah. Don't know who they are, sorry.   So, when someone's looking for a ""tribe"" to join, they join the ones they see, the ones they know, the ones they can find. And, humanism is left sitting alone in the dark while the cool kids party elsewhere.  This is one reason that the British Humanist Association is running things like the ""How Humanist Are You?"" quiz, and posting YouTube videos with Stephen Fry narrating, and why the American Humanist Association runs advertising campaigns - to let people know humanism exists!  There's also the aspect that New Atheism is very much a protest movement - they're against religion. Religion! Is! Bad! For young people, that activist protest mentality is attractive. Humanism appears less activist, and more contemplative, by comparison."

There is such a thing as Christian Feminism, for instance.   Therefore, it is not the humanists who must explicitly declare themselves to be feminists, but the feminists who must explicitly declare themselves to be humanists. One can't just assume that they are, because they might belong to one of the variants of feminism which subscribes to irrational or supernatural beliefs."

Feminism and humanism have both fought for gay rights and protections for immigrants and refugees.

I don't even think the statement is that true, I certainly don't believe we are ruled by a patriarchy on any of that stuff you come across in feminist literature.   Plus even the definition isn't 'gender neutral' it essentially says ""I want the sexes to be equal.. So I am only going to fight for female rights"", you cannot have equality among the sexes by only promoting & fighting for the rights of one sex.  EDIT: I just went on facebook to see this image which shows why you cannot and should not only advocate for the rights of one demographic. Of course these helplines are necessary & I am very glad we have them, but the idea of men always being abusive & women always being a victim is embedded in feminism, you don't need to read very much of any feminist literature to come across the idea of the patriarchy which is just this."

However... the word ""humanism"" already existed before this recent push against the word ""feminism"". The word ""humanism"" already had a definition before people created it in the past couple of years. Look in the sidebar. Read the Amsterdam Declaration of the principles of Humanism. Are these things you believe? Are these principles you live by? Is this what you mean when you say you're a ""humanist""?   If so, we're good. Welcome, fellow humanist!

It's just something that some humanists do. And those Sunday Assemblies seem to be most popular with ex-Christians who miss the feeling of gathering together with like-minded people every Sunday. As a never-religious humanist, I have no desire whatsoever to gather with other humanists every Sunday morning.   You don't even need to pay a membership fee to be a humanist. It's a philosophy, just like utilitarianism or hedonism or stoicism. You can be a humanist without joining a ""congregation"".

I totally agree with you. If I made it sound like selfishness was the only reason, I apologize, that's not what I meant. I think empathy plays a huge role in morality, and the absence of empathy is very often present in most immoral situations.   I don't think everyone is always selfish. People can be (and often are) altruistic, when they're motivated greatly by another's self-interest.   I agree, it's just that no matter what one does, someone can always find a selfish motivation in it, even if it's rather far fetched.  Morality comes in part through socialization, in part through empathy, in part through an innate sense of right and wrong, and in part through education.

Morality is a measure of how moral your actions are. You either act or refrain from acting morally, but you are not 'being moral' towards someone else.  How can you convince someone to act morally? You appeal to empathy. You appeal to how they would feel if someone acted towards them the way they acted towards others. You appeal to reason and say that acting morally is a great way for everyone to get along and for everyone's standard of living to improve.  Failing that you tell them that there are consequences towards acting immorally.   One acts in a moral way if one values others. If one does not value others, there is no point in telling them to act morally. You can't go from the fact that eating chips is unhealthy and say that we ought to be healthy either. If the person does not care about being healthy, then an argument against chips based on health will fall flat. You have to then appeal to other values the person does care about, like the ability to be free. If they act immorally and kill someone, they will go to jail and will not be able to be free, ergo they shouldn't kill someone.

While (secular) Humanism is naturalistic, rejecting faith-based explanations of the world, it is not defined by that aspect. From the IHEU's Minimum Statement on Humanism:   “Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance that affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. Humanism stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethics based on human and other natural values in a spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. Humanism is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality.”   By this definition, it does ""promote a secular society and take a critical view of faith and religion.""

OP or anyone else may know some or all of this anyway.   the rise of secularism    I'll go off on a slight tangent for a second: What do you mean by ""rise""? Most people - I would say the vast majority - when questioned appropriately will reveal/find that they agree with secular principles. That's because most people are sensible and secularism is very sensible too.  If by rise you mean: more people being vocal about not 'tolerating' the assumed religiosity of the general population... Well I'm not sure what the establishment has to be worried about save for a select group of individuals losing their privilege. In particular the positions some Bishops have in the Lords, the salaries of (the correct religion's) senior clergy, accompanying homes etc.  In terms of how much religion is used to control the public, well I'm not sure it really does that much any more. Of course there are quite regular and vocal oppositions to various policies (e.g. equal marriage, abortion laws) or scientific/medical advances (e.g. stem cell use), but in terms of controlling the masses it's quite clear that the established church is way behind public feeling. Even non-endorsed faith like Catholicism: check out how often contraceptives are used among Catholics and you'll find it roughly the same as the general population I believe (need to check that, but certainly it's higher than one might have thought if Catholics 'go by the book').  But in the sense that the established church feeds public opinion or is able to sway the parishioners, as it were... well they just don't have the numbers. The CoE's own attendance figures display this: being a cynic I have my own thoughts on why the church doesn't count the way it used to. Back in the day they'd count Sunday attendance. Then it included weekly services. Now it's monthly. Yet the numbers continue to drop year on year, decade on decade. Have a read of the press releases that come out each year with the figures. IIRC you'll find increasing emphasis placed on the diversity of worship that goes on i.e. ""people are coming along on days other than Sunday"" and also - something I find somewhat duplicitous - the underlining of how many young people (16 and under) who attend: of all the groups who don't really get a choice to go where their parents tell them to go... Consequently how many children go to your church doesn't really tell you much.  Now I come to think of it I have to wonder whether things like ""messy church"" is included in the stats. I'd bet a good deal of money that it is - that would surely undermine the ""youth count"". By the by if you look at the minimum and maximum weekly count of youngsters, it's quite clear that one week out of the month is made up of Church parade: the semi-compulsory activity that Cubs/Scouts/Brownies/Guides etc. attend.  Back to the rise of secularism: ignoring the deistic aspect, the church exists to propagate itself. That's one of the main reasons why, even though a pretty darn small percentage of the population are active CoE and given the falling number of people who identify as religious let alone CoE, the various religious groups hate the idea of having schools taken from them. By ""taken from them"" I don't mean that the schools will be shut down: 1/3 of UK state schools are 'run by faith groups' even though everyone is paying for them with their taxes. They impose their own rules as much as they can, they're tied to the church next door, they can choose what lessons to leave out or teach (within reason though not as much as you'd hope) and they can also refuse to employ certain 'types' e.g. homosexuals - There is an exemption in the Equality Act 2010 to this end. Take the schools away and you've taken away an argument for them being established.  There's a distinct amount of circular reasoning going on with the UK being a ""Christian nation"":  We are a Christian nation because we have an established church because we are a Christian nation because we have lots of faith run schools because we are a Christian nation because Parliament does prayers before votes because we are a Christian nation because lots of people are assumed to be CoE because we are a Christian nation because our monarch is 'chosen by Jahweh' because we are a Christian nation because our monarch is the defender of the faith because we are a Christian nation because we have seats in Parliament reserved for Bishops because we are a Christian nation because ... Round and around. Get rid of one and the circle gets smaller and it's easier to get rid of others. That's another reason to oppose equal marriage etc. etc. When social attitudes in conflict with the established church's become codified and everyone moves on, they're left without a moral platform from which to attempt control. Anything and everything is done to try and keep that power.  TL;DR and to sum up: If by the establishment you mean a group of individuals losing power, influence, privilege and comfortable lifestyles, then yes they should be worried. But in the sense that they will come under increasing pressure in the coming years to have it all taken from them. Rather than French revolution manner!  I often ask people who don't think the CoE can or should be disestablished: How few people will have to be active members of the religion before their role and position as it currently exists becomes untenable and ridiculous?  Links - stats and that - available on request.  I'd be interested to know OPs thoughts on it too.  PS - Eric Pickles is a duplicitous (twice in one post!) git: Asking for people to keep their religion to themselves - to remove pointless faith activities from in a public meeting - is not an attack on Christianity nor on religious freedom. It is, of course, exactly the opposite as making everyone take part in the activity of one faith is entirely anti-religious freedom. But he knows this - he just doesn't care because he's an old, white, Christian, Tory man: a cacophony of groups that aren't ever keen to give up privilege.  disclaimer: am a young, white, no-particular-party, male humanist."
humanism,2xd5aq,widgetas,1 point,Sat Feb 28 12:52:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the in depth answer!   By ""the rise of secularism"", I mean the increasingly vocal and assertive rejection of religion; but also the influence of secular organisations. At least I perceive things that way. I welcome the wane of the religious influence and was glad at the failure of their attempt to claim the ""instituation of marriage"" as their own. I read that the Sumerians (3000 – 2000 BCE) had marriages, so I'm fairly sure we can find ""prior art"" here. Incidentally, none of the weddings I've been to amongst my friends have been held in a church.  I have friends who are evangelical Christians. I see things like ""Christian holidays"", ""Christian bands"" and listen to them trying to find Christian partners; this being the main requirement. Then I read about Eric Pickles and what is (to my mind) a desperate attempt to use his political position to force a religious agenda. I'd be interested to see a lawyers opinion on what he's tried there. Overall I get the distinct impression of wagons being circled, a turning inwards. Again, I could be mistaken.  I don't agree with ""faith schools"", in my opinion the education system should be kept out of the hands of faith groups. Religious education should in the curriculum, but only in a comparitive and objective ""this is what various people believe"" kind of way. This must, of course, include the Atheist arguments against faith.   The idea of the UK as Christian nation is worth looking at, as I feel that this is something that is an unspoken assumption. Especially from the Tories. The whole business whith the census question for example. The offical question assumed you were religious, but which one? The idea that you might not be religious didn't seem to have occurred to them! But as the British Social Attitudes survey shows when you remove the assumptions you get a very different picture. I'll wager that a lot of people are only Christian when forced to pick a default; so much of the supposed numerical strength of organised religion in the UK is a mirage. Part of my reason for my question in that I'm wondering how accidental this mirage is.  I have wondered where this leaves our monarchy, as I'm pretty sure that the monarch's power supposedly derives from God. I always thought it was because his/her ancestors were handier with a sword than the next guy. The fall of the established church would strengthen the case for a republic, at least in my eyes and I believe the CofE is on the verge of irrelevance to say the least. The politicians will survive, Cockroaches and Rats usually do.  I've done my best to proof read this, and offer my sincerest apologies for any grammar errors, typos or rogue elephants in the text. ;-)  (disclosure: white male, 40.

humanism,2xd5aq,widgetas,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"Apologies for not replying sooner - this didn't come through as a reply to me! No worries on the spelling etc. No matter how carefully I check I always make a cockup or two which I can't catch in a ninja-edit.  You raised a point I hadn't considered in my comment: the monarch role. It probably won't surprise you that I'm a republican. I have trouble with the monarchy for various reasons, though most people automatically assume it's a case of money. Personally I'm more concerned with how unfair it is on everyone - both 'us' and 'them'. But they also, like you say, are entwined with the CoE with one title they take on board being ""defender of the faith"". ""The faith"", not just ""faith"". Though I've not looked into it myself I've heard it said that Elizabeth takes her role so seriously not least because of its religious import: the monarch is/was chosen by Jahweh. I'm not sure how else, save the general ideas of breeding, how anyone can justify why someone is so important by stint of exiting the right birth canal.   I'd be interested to see a lawyers opinion on what he's tried there.    Do you take much interest in the activities of the National Secular Society (NSS)? I've not been too much recently but was semi-active a few years back. The reason council prayers got public attention a couple of years ago is because a councillor on the south coast asked the NSS to get involved when his council refused to remove prayers from the offical agenda of each meeting. Effectively: you had to be there for prayers or be seen to be late etc. Some people might think that's a minor issue, but then consider that people have to submit prayer cards/mark places in the House of Commons to get a good seat for debates. It featured in the recent BBC series about Parliament.  Anyway: the NSS took the council to court because they refused to get rid of prayers. They offered the council numerous alternatives which were entirely fair: let the Christian councillors do their prayers beforehand or have a moment of (non-denominational silence), that kind of thing. This was refused. NSS took them to court. NSS won. Then Pickles & co played the victim card and tried to make out like it was Christianity under attack, and Pickles tried to rush through an amendment to some legislation (the Localism Bill?) that would let councils hold (Christian) prayers. So far as I recall, that failed and so now it's come around again just before election time when the Conservatives will be looking to gain by the older, white Christian vote from UKIP.   The idea of the UK as Christian nation is worth looking at, as I feel that this is something that is an unspoken assumption.   You're right with regard to the assumption. As I mentioned earlier about Parliament, Christian activities and worship leading public events is common place. I recall Bath half marathon two years ago (it's on a Sunday in Feb/March every year, and today actually) a local clergyman was invited on the PA before the start and took it as an opportunity to bless/pray with everyone. I found that quite amusing: if we wanted his prayers then we'd be in his sodding church and not running!  Take any 'state' event: Remembrance day is a good one. People may think ""Well obviously it'll be run by the church."" But why? The only reason I can think of is because Christians fought and died. Yes. But so did thousands/millions of other religions and none. I take it you know that the armed forces Humanist group is still being refused the chance to march past the cenotaph each year? No room or not big enough apparently. The Jewish group is smaller but gets to march so... who knows? I can hazard a guess though: it's a secular group and doesn't specifically revere a deity/play ball.  That's an interesting point though: The cenotaph is an entirely secular monument. No crosses or religious endorsements at all: exactly how it should be! But everything else: the unveiling of the RAF monument a few years back: religious lead. D-day memorials: religious lead.  The assumption is waning in some areas though: back in the 1980s my mother recalls having a questionnaire in hospital. ""Nothing"" wasn't an option and the nurse tried to put ""CoE"" as default. My mother get a little irate. But even now the census, as you mention, poses the leading question: ""What religion are you?"" and as you say that presupposes a religion. To my mind it's like asking: ""What Taiwanese football team do you support?"" Funnily enough, I don't. Small victories though: ""atheist"" is the first on the list of ""religion"" when you choose the drop down list, even though, of course, it's not a sodding religious belief!  Even smaller things: as soon as there's some kind of accident or tragedy the media will go for the local vicar. Why?! Chances are they won't know the victims, the families or even be known in the community to a large extent. The Cumbria massacre: lots of innocent people shot. There was a service held at a local church a short time after: it wasn't mentioned at the service so far as I recall that one of the victims being remembered was a Humanist. This has been made clear by his family earlier in the week, but it disappeared from the narrative. It's a very minor point, but should anything happen to me my family know to make it quite clear to whatever and whoever try to appropriate my death (this is of course way out there and sounds very self important!) that I hold no truck in it and would have told them very clearly how much I disapprove of their actions.   I mean the increasingly vocal and assertive rejection of religion   I think some people have an automatic reaction to this, in fact Pickles is a good example: while secularism in the UK sense is 'rejecting' religion in so far as asking it to get in line with the rest of us and stop thinking it's more important than anything else, secularism isn't about rejecting religion to make it 'disappear'. I'm sure you know this, but the words can be misinterpreted.   Secularism has been turned into a dirty word and probably entirely consciously. I recall the Bishop of Leicester writing a guff piece about secularists wanted to remove all the spires from the city skyline. The Catholic Bishop of Plymouth said something equally wrong last year. But as I mentioned in my first comment: most people hold secular values when questioned correctly.  Do you think a religion that is not yours should dictate your life, and the laws that govern you/us?  Do you think that one or more religions should have political influence greater than any other group without public vote?  Do you think that children should be taught to be religious by a religion that differs from their own (that's another matter) or their parents?  Stuff like that. All questions that will get the answer ""no"" from anyone who doesn't have an ax to grind: i.e. Pickles, Warsi, the Christian Legal Centre..."
humanism,2xd5aq,andrewcooke,1 point,Sun Mar 1 13:04:43 2015 UTC,"there's also some current political context.  the political right in the uk is facing a new, populist party (ukip) who are asserting a rather traditional idea of what ""british"" is.  that includes an assumption of christianity, even if it's very low-key (largely defined in negative terms - not islam, etc).  also, the right (who are in power, in a coalition with a more central but weaker party) would like to transfer social responsibility from the state to the private sector.  and traditionally that has meant something on vaguely religious lines.  so the idea that everyone should be ""caring christians"" is attractive / useful (to them).  but i don't think that you're seeing anything terribly coherent.  it's just opportunistic noise.  politicians (of all parties) seem to be largely out of ideas, confused and unpopular (hence the rise of the ukip, greens, etc).  they're thrashing around looking for any target that makes a good soundbite."

There are, however, many highly skilled religious chaplains-- usually those who have graduated from progressive-minded seminaries and specialized in pastoral counseling or chaplaincy. These professionals learn evidence-based counseling techniques and undertake supervised practice much like secular counselors. Most hospital chaplains fall into this category.  Also, schools should be able to establish rules for chaplains, such as that they may only discuss religious topics & texts if the student initiates; direct proselytism is forbidden; and the chaplain will not diagnose or treat students beyond his/her formal education and qualification.  With standards of formal education/preparation and rules of practice, school chaplaincy could be a positive alternative when the budget won't allow for more secular counselors."

humanism,2wggtl,StealerofSuns,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:07:20 2015 UTC,"Here is my two cents. Humanists don't subscribe to any specific political view in itself, at least not formally. What we are after (and please correct me if I am making too broad of a statement) is what is both the most reasonable and the most achievable solution to the issues ahead and for the betterment of humankind.   Very often political beliefs try to describe how the world would work so much better if we just subscribed to and applied those beliefs. In reality that's not really how things work, we don't have a perfect model to run countries let alone the world, but we do have hints of some things working on different governmental and geographical scale. Sometimes these things or mechanisms have a liberal imprint, other times they are more socialistic and other times they are even dictatorial, etc... and they change throughout time depending on society needs or environmental factors.  The problem about political beliefs, and that is why you are probably getting the responses you are getting, is that they try to pass as the ultimate medicine to solve the issues concerning the human condition. Everybody has a different ideology and thinks ""oh well if only we did this, everything would be great!"" but in actuality geographical, cultural differences do exist and what you think is not necessarily what is right for everybody and humanity overall. There could be rebound effects of which you are not aware, and the system needs to serve everybody regardless of what political belief they subscribe to.   So humanism in a way is for whatever betters humankind and its knowledge without ""screwing"" somebody else over. So if you think that your beliefs are well substantiated please go ahead and try to convince others and make it happen, however if humanism subscribed to a specific political view it would negate other possibilities that could be equally as good or better.  At the end of the day whatever system we end up having is going to be a system obeying a sort of evolutionary process through trial and error not an ex-novo system. We may not like the pace at which our current system is improving but that is what we need if we want to maintain a democratic process.   As to your idea of radical humanism it sounds like you are trying to polarize humanistic philosophy. By any means go ahead and do it and I am curios to see what comes out of it but I have a hard time believing that your work will be as comprehensive as the work done by the billions of people that came before us. Write your work, if some of your solutions will be valuable to fix some things then it will be used, in the same way if you are mistaken you will be adding up to the list of things we should avoid... which is still very useful."

humanism,2wevfs,matinphipps,2,Thu Feb 19 08:45:51 2015 UTC,"The world population troubles are specifically in areas like China, Africa, and India. Most post industrial societies are below replacement levels. For example, replacement is considered 2.6 children per family. The US is at 1.8 and places like Japan are in the .70s. Something like 95% of the projected population growth is expected to be in Africa. I can post sources tonight when I get home from work and can use my computer.  The truth is that this is a women's rights issue. There is a strong correlation between the education levels of women and birth rates. The more educated the women of a given society are, the fewer births in that society. To solve the population issue, the status of women worldwide needs to be raised. Women also need access to inexpensive family planning care. I am sure birthrates in the US would be even lower if the population were more sex positive (And in the case of media and politics, less misogynistic).  The US and many other countries are declining in population at an economically feasible rate. We cannot drop much lower in the US without opening up to more immigration (something that is highly contested politically), lest the next, much smaller, generation be faces with an aging population it doesn't have the resources to care for.  As others have also noted, we have enough food to feed the current population with plenty left over, but for a variety of reasons, the food doesn't make it to those who need it. This has to do with shelf life, corporate interests, politics, and more."

If the population of the Earth goes over ten billion then it will be very unlikely that we will be able to feed everybody. Hell, there are millions of people who go hungry now. We should stop encouraging people to have so many children, especially in countries like Nigeria where the average woman has eight babies. Average. That means some women have no babies and others have sixteen.   Actually we have more than enough to feed everyone today. Enough for 12 billion, in fact. The problem is distributing this food to unstable regions such as East Africa.   Overpopulation is a very complex issue. In impoverished regions such as West Africa and South Asia, the problem isn't so much too many people as much as it is too many people who aren't productive enough. That's why high population density countries like the Netherlands and Japan aren't having any problems with overpopulation, while Bangladesh and Nigeria are. Our focus should be on developing these countries to sustain their populations; population growth will slow on its own, as the UN predicts world population will peak at 11 billion around 2100 and then enter a decline, as we are already seeing in developed countries (Germany, Japan)."
humanism,2wevfs,Vakiadia,1 point,Thu Feb 19 23:14:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of food does get wasted though and if you wanted to actually feed 12 billion people then the amount of wasted food would have to be reduced to zero.  Wasted food isn't just good food that goes uneaten: a lot of food is wasted because it spoils before it reaches consumers.  This is particularly a problem for fruits and vegetables that are grown on farms that are far away from the people who eat the fruits and vegetables: because some countries are hot all year round and farmers cannot afford refrigerated trucks a lot of the food spoils on the way to the market.  On top of that, there's the fact that most people around the world don't have refrigerators so even when people buy fresh food a lot of it spoils before people have a chance to eat it.  The population of Africa was 1.11 billion in 2013 and it is estimated to reach 2.4 billion in 2050.  If people in Africa aren't productive enough now to sustain the population they have now then it is wishful thinking to think that they will be productive enough to maintain their population when their population has doubled.  Developed countries demonstrate slower population growth but that means, conversely, that undeveloped countries demonstrate relatively higher population growth.  The more children people have in underdeveloped countries the harder it will be to educate everyone so that they can all have productive jobs."

At current levels of production, yes. Luckily 5 billion people don't appear overnight, and by most models our population will never reach that level anyway.   On top of that, there's the fact that most people around the world don't have refrigerators so even when people buy fresh food a lot of it spoils before people have a chance to eat it.   As those countries industrialize, the incomes of the people there will rise to where they can afford refrigerators. This will likely only take a few decades for stable parts of Africa, particularly Kenya and other rising stars.   The population of Africa was 1.11 billion in 2013 and it is estimated to reach 2.4 billion in 2050. If people in Africa aren't productive enough now to sustain the population they have now then it is wishful thinking to think that they will be productive enough to maintain their population when their population has doubled.    That is simply not true. Even now, African economies are growing and foreign investment is increasing. Civil wars and other examples of chaos are on the decline, and the continent is stabilizing for the most part. It is, therefore, not a stretch of the imagination to say that by 2050 most parts of Africa will be developed on the level of the West.   Developed countries demonstrate slower population growth but that means, conversely, that undeveloped countries demonstrate relatively higher population growth. The more children people have in underdeveloped countries the harder it will be to educate everyone so that they can all have productive jobs.   While that is true, it is not so much of an issue that limiting the number of children becomes a necessity. India after all is coming along very nicely and will likely be very developed by the 2030s, despite its burgeoning population."
humanism,2wevfs,Vakiadia,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:58:23 2015 UTC,"At current levels of production, yes.   Overpopulation comes with another cost and that is overcrowding.  We could probably produce more food but we would probably have to get most of our protein from beans as cattle takes up valuable land that people would need to live on.  If the population were to increase by 50% and this meant a 50% increase in fish consumption then this would deplete fish stocks and cause some species of fish to go extinct.  You can't simply ""produce"" more fish, not unless we start getting most of our fish from fish farms instead of fishing from the ocean.   As those countries industrialize, the incomes of the people there will rise to where they can afford refrigerators.    It's simple mathematics: families who have only a few children have more disposable income and are more likely to be able to afford refrigerators.  It's the families with the highest number of children who are least able to support themselves.   That is simply not true. Even now, African economies are growing and foreign investment is increasing.   The rise of a country's GNP is incidental: what is really important is the per capita GNP.  If a country's population doubles while its GNP grows a little bit the per capita GNP has actually decreased by almost half.   India after all is coming along very nicely and will likely be very developed by the 2030s, despite its burgeoning population.   Yes but people in India are also very well educated.  People have been able to feed themselves in India because Indian agriculturalists were able to come up with their own solutions to grow more food on less land.  This is very impressive.  In Africa, there really is a lack of available farmland: much of Africa is covered with desert and most of the rest is covered with either savanna or rain forest and environmentalists don't want all the trees cut down so that Africans can feed themselves.

Flat out, living space is the least of our concerns. Metropolises like New York City and Tokyo have given the world a lesson on high density living, and this trend will likely continue into the future. As for Africa itself, it seems likely major cities will grow as well, with the countryside still holding enough space for cattle farming in areas able to support it.   You can't simply ""produce"" more fish, not unless we start getting most of our fish from fish farms instead of fishing from the ocean.   And that's exactly what will happen. Production will rise to meet demand, farm fisheries are already growing at incredible levels worldwide. It's not inconceivable to imagine a point where fish farms are more profitable than wild catching businesses by a wide margin.   It's simple mathematics: families who have only a few children have more disposable income and are more likely to be able to afford refrigerators. It's the families with the most number of children who are least able to support themselves.   Yes, but as the average income increases the amount of families with that amount of children will decrease. Their children will move to begin smaller families in a more developed country, earning higher incomes.   The rise of a country's GNP is incidental: what is really important is the per capita GNP. If a country's population doubles while its GNP grows a little bit the per capita GNP has actually decreased by almost half.   Yes, and the per capita GDP is rising across the board.

In Africa, there really is a lack of available farmland: much of Africa is covered with desert and most of the rest is covered with either savanna or rain forest and environmentalists don't want all the trees cut down so that Africans can feed themselves. It's not the same situation at all.   Africa actually has three major areas that could produce more than enough food for the entire continent, but problems have been plaguing all of them. The Sahel is endangered by climate change, but the East African highlands and South African lowlands are not. The South African lowlands are primarily in control of the dictatorship that rules Zimbabwe, which has stifled their potential as a breadbasket. All three of these regions lack enough fresh water to be used efficiently. Through modern desalination and water conservation techniques, however, that could be changed."
humanism,2wevfs,In_Today,1 point,Fri Feb 20 03:27:25 2015 UTC,"Flat out, living space is the least of our concerns.   Well, no: cities need infrastructure.  It's not enough to give people places to live: they also need schools, places to work, roads, parks, etc.  It isn't just a question of building taller buildings.   Farm fisheries are already growing at incredible levels worldwide.   Fair enough.  In the meantime ocean stocks are being depleted at incredible levels.  One might cynically argue that mankind has no choice but to farm fish if they want to continue to eat fish.   As the average income increases the amount of families with that amount of children will decrease.   It isn't automatic.  People need to place more importance on education: people have fewer children when they realize that their kids can earn more money to support them in their old age if they get good jobs and that means a better education.  Parents need to realize that they should have fewer children and have them all go to university.  As it is, most parents in poor families think that they need to have as many children as possible in the hopes that one of them will be successful enough to support the family.   Countries all over Africa have rising GDP per capita   Fair enough.  What about specifically for Nigeria though?  Logically if all countries in Africa have GNP rising at the same rate then the country with the highest population growth is going to have the lowest increase in per capita GNP.  EDIT: I looked at your link.  China, Mongolia and Peru are doing great but Africa is not doing so hot with per capita GNP increases varying from -62% to 103%.  That's a wide margin and there's nothing I can conclude from that: I would need to know the actual numbers for individual countries.   Africa actually has three major areas that could produce more than enough food for the entire continent   This is based on current population estimates, right?  And it assumes that food can be efficiently distributed to everybody on the continent."

But, ""It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities."" So we can deduct that it supports equal rights for all. My IRL religious friend thinks torture is OK since terrorists aren't ""people"" but all humanists would disagree with this since, yes, although they are terrible, they are human and deserve basic rights.  Additionally, secular moral progress is the reason why we have the society we do today. In the bible, it says slavery is OK, so why don't we still have it? The answer is because of the progress of secular ethics which the religious department falls behind on. There's a good video about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1THo5lCh1s  TL;DR: Although Humanism isn't defined by being an equal rights philosophy, it is."

Existing evidence reported by reputable sources suggests that the murders were the result of a long-standing dispute with his neighbours rather than a hate crime, but his motives are still unclear.

They either are idiots for attempting to leverage their faith here, thinking that they will get any sympathy from a nation (or a southern state like NC in particular) that is highly suspicious of muslims.

A theist can believe that the world is best handled from a non-theistic point of view and that faith should be private or cordoned off from public policy. They may know that their faith is true, but also not believe that they can force those beliefs on people of other faiths or none.  Secular just means that it is 'worldly' and non-divine"

humanism,2vkjow,Esuts,1 point,Thu Feb 12 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"The word secular typically means separate from religion. That means that secular humanism refers to humanism as something separate from religion. When it is separate, they can coexist.  Originally secular meant worldly or temporal (Latin: saecularis). So in that sense, secular humanism refers to humanism in the worldly domain. This does not exclude a belief in something outside the worldly domain.  Neither of these meanings of the word secular exclude the divine or the supernatural. It is merely a qualifier that states that the word it precedes does not refer to those domains.  I think you might be conflating the institutions with the worldly and other-worldly domains. Secularism as a political idea refers to a separation of institutions, the church and the state. It does not say that belief in the supernatural has no place in politics. That position would be called laicism, and is prominent in for example France, but it is a more far-reaching notion than secularism. Laicism forbids the display of religious symbols in the public domain, for example, or the founding of religious political parties. Secularism is simply the official separation of the institutions."

If you really want to start throwing definitions of humanism around to argue your point, I'd like to take you to the Dutch Humanist association (Humanistisch Verbond), and their definitions, as can be found here. Notice that a rejection of the supernatural is not included here.  Furthermore, the Humanistisch Verbond acknowledge on their page that  ""Some are open to the views of believers, they see this dialogue and the views expressed therein as a personal enrichment. Others find that humanism must take a stronger [stance] against traditional religion, believing that this [view in] particular constitutes a restriction of personal development.""

It's all social construct. We as a species have come up with moral codes to help ourselves survive as a species.

I'd start with the critical thinking stuff though, as it'll help you better assess the stuff that follows. It's going to take a while, but once you can make yourself truly confidant that you are justified in rejecting religious hypotheses, you'll stop worrying about it so much.  I figured this out slowly over a course of about two years, and am now studying philosophy at university with a focus on post-religious ethics and scientific theory.

I see religion as ideas that were created to explain phenomena that humans could not yet explain with the technology that they had at the time. When water fell from the sky, or the earth shook, something had to have been causing it, therefore gods were created and used as explanations. Over time you can even see how religious views have changed based on emerging evidence. In the words of Neil Degrasse Tyson, ""it's just an ever receding pocket of scientific ignorance."" The best advice I can give you is to simply surround yourself with people who's religion is not their main defining characteristic.

Replace the root theos with ""evidence"" and you might see the reflection of each group's positions (theism --> evidence, as in, there is evidence, while atheism --> a-evidence, or without evidence, as in, there is not evidence. a- is a negating preposition in Greek).

The only negativity comes from people's reactions to it.  ""Anousic"" is different:   I use the word ""Anousic"" as a generic term for ""religious"". It is a neologism suggested by ancient Greek to connote ""mindless"", ""unreasoning"", ""illogical"".   The word itself is defined as being a negative thing: mindless, irrational, illogical. The word itself is an insult. It's like calling someone stupid.   This is not a step forward.  I understand the desire to turn the semantic tables on the theists, and define themselves as the opposite of atheists, rather than defining everything using religion as the default: a-theistic, non-religious, ir-religious, non-believer. However, we should find a word which isn't inherently insulting, so that we don't start our debate by calling theists a word that means ""stupid"". Insulting people never leads to a better or clearer discussion.   Why not use a word which already exists?

Why not divide the world into skeptics and non-skeptics, or rationalists and non-rationalists, or naturalists and non-naturalists, or even humanists and non-humanists?   Well, that is sort of what the word attempts to do. But I grant that neologisms aren't necessarily the best approach.  ""Atheist"" is quite literally a semantically negative term; it is defined by what it is not. The moral judgements attached to any term are social rather than semantic. For example, one might even argue from a fideist perspective that anousia is actually a (moral) positive (q.v. Martin Luther raving about how human reason is the Devil's whore).  What specifically interested me about the term ""anousia"" is that it attempts to ""cut reality at the joints"", so to speak; it aims to isolate that particular characteristic which distinguishes the cognitive world of science, skepticism, rationalism, naturalism, humanism etc. from that of religion, faith, tradition, supernaturalism, antihumanism, etc.  One can dispute whether that particular concept of humanistic rationality is really the dividing line, of course, but I think the attempt is nonetheless noteworthy. So what it identifies is not so much stupidity as the absence or rejection of a certain concept of rationality, broadly associated with humanistic traditions (Greek philosophy, the Renaissance humanists, the Enlightenment, etc.)  The issue of ""which way around"" the negative/positive goes is also an important one, as there is much social capital associated with the ability to define the ""neutral"" or ""default"" position. Indeed, non-default positions are usually stigmatised, at least implicitly. For example, extremist Sunnis often describe Shi'ites as ""rafidah"", meaning ""rejectors"" or ""deniers"", because they have rejected or denied the ""true"" doctrine. It's basically the same argument with allowing religionists in general to define non-religious people as ""atheists"". The term is loaded, and by using it we are tacitly playing their game."
humanism,2veyug,Algernon_Asimov,-1,Wed Feb 11 21:58:31 2015 UTC,"""Atheist"" is quite literally a semantically negative term; it is defined by what it is not.   I didn't mean negative as in merely a negation, I meant negative as loaded with bad ideas.   Saying that someone lacks belief in a deity is not a bad thing to say, in and of itself. It's only bad if you think believing in a deity is good. However, saying that someone lacks critical thinking and rationality is bad in and of itself - it's a direct attack on that person's intelligence. I don't think it's good tactics, or even polite, to open the debate with a word that literally means ""you're not capable of thinking clearly"".   I understand that ""anousia"" is an attempt to redefine the debate, and shift the default from theism to rationality. However, I'd prefer a word that isn't insulting in and of itself."
humanism,2veyug,Algernon_Asimov,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"However, saying that someone lacks critical thinking and rationality is bad in and of itself - it's a direct attack on that person's intelligence.   You directly missed the point of what I was saying. This isn't any more intrinsically bad than saying they don't believe in a deity, because there is no intrinsic moral content to terms. Indeed, many cultures in the past would have made the opposite judgement from you, and concluded that being intelligent is almost irrelevant compared to believing in the correct deity. The fact that you value human intellect so highly isn't a reflection of some absolute fact about reality; it's simply a product of the culture you grew up in.  That said, I take the point that in our culture, it doesn't make tactical sense to use a word that would be perceived as offensive. The very fact that it is perceived as offensive is possibly a sign of progress."

humanism,2v8n20,Maodawg,3,Sun Feb 8 23:13:54 2015 UTC,"So if all morality is really just a result of our machinery, then all morality is really just arbitrary and really we do what makes us feel good about ourselves when you get right down to it.   I take issue with the statement that morality is arbitrary. The word arbitrary has multiple definitions, such as    subject to individual will or judgment without restriction; contingent solely upon one's discretion undetermined; not assigned a specific value decided by a judge or arbiter rather than by a law or statute capricious; unreasonable; unsupported   In this case the only definition of arbitrary that would apply to morality would be the second one, and even that is debatable.   Rather than saying that morality is arbitrary, I think it might be more accurate and more prudent to say that morality is not absolute nor does it refer to some kind of external values that we must subscribe to. ""Arbitrary"" just leaves too much room for misunderstandings.   In addition, I see no objective purpose to life.   Here, I'd say 'externally imposed' purpose to life. If you make a system to find out what each person's purpose is, and the system works the same way for everyone (ie it is objective and consistent), then you can say that some people have an objective purpose according to that system.  If it's not externally imposed, however, it is we who give each other and ourselves a purpose, rather than a deity, an entity external to us, decreeing what our purpose in life is.   I think this existential angst is genetic as well.   That's not really how genetics work. Genetics can affect our existential angst, but it is not genetics who cause it. There is no existential angst gene.  Overall though, I agree. I'm just a tedious nitpicker like that, is all ;)"

humanism,2v8n20,BCRE8TVE,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:48:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I knew that the words ""objective purpose"" and ""arbitrary"" didn't quite describe what I was going for originally, but I had no other way no matter how hard I thought on it. Thanks for these ideas and better ways to describe them. In regards to existential angst, my feeling is that we have always tried to make sense of the world and have tried to find an 'externally imposed' purpose to life so that we can feel safe, as opposed to the absolute freedom that a lack of such purpose would provide. I've sort of assumed here that it was genetic because I feel like that from the beginning of our existence we have always had it. Is there a single cause for this drive to feel safe and not see that there is no externally imposed meaning? Is it a multitude of causes? Do you think that genetics is a major or minor factor? I'm interested to hear your opinion on it. Also, a nitpicker is exactly what I was looking for, so that my ideas be proofread down to their core. Only someone with an attention to detail could do that. Thank you for all your input :)"
humanism,2v8n20,BCRE8TVE,1 point,Mon Feb 9 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"No problem! I like being a detail-oriented nitpicker :p  Per being genetic, I think instead that it has to do with the very fact that we are thinking reasoning being. We want there to be a purpose, to be a reason, for things to make sense. However, try though we might, we can't find any, so we make up answers that are satisfactory, answers we make so we can feel safe.  It's not genetic, it's simply due to the fact that we're all thinking beings. We are able to contemplate our own existence, our own deaths. We can think of what we happen when we die, and after we have died. We do not like to think about that, and so we make reasons to think it isn't so, to satisfy our fear of dying."
humanism,2v8n20,BCRE8TVE,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:03:31 2015 UTC,"Your answer seems much simpler than mine, and also much more sound since (as said in a previous comment) genetic assumptions can have truth in them, but often have little science to back it up. I feel that this idea of ""not knowing"" at least in my view is beautiful. This lack of imposed external morality and purpose allows us to pursue our dreams and passions without restraints."

That alone makes me uncomfortable. I'm all for rights equality, I'm not all for calling a movement that stands for equality of gender feminism, that just seems to suggest that inequality is in whole or in part one sided and needs addressing from that one side. That is to say that women need raising up. I think that's a broken view and it's what many people think feminism is, regardless of what it ""actually"" is (what does that even mean when you talk about the beliefs of groups of people?). The reality is much more nuanced then women being in strife and needing help. That label is far to binary for any modern pragmatic view of  ethics in my opinion.

I'm sure that your feminism, and that of most of the people you know, is a positive force--and I'm equally sure that, if you got to know my exact beliefs, you'd probably think I was a feminist whether I was comfortable calling myself that or not.  I'm also sure that the majority of Christians you meet would never suspect you aren't one, because you're probably a really nice person--and I bet that most of the nicer ones are pretty sure that, deep down, you do God's work whether you know it or not.  I may be an ex-feminist, but my values haven't changed, any more than my views re: murder and false witness changed when I became an ex-Christian. I've just decided that I don't want to wear the same logo that a lot of really awful people do. Feminism is huge, yes--and that's the problem to me.

I can say with certainty that the ""tumblr types"" are in the minority. They get a lot of attention because they're low-hanging fruit for places like TiA.  So I can't just reject the label because of a minority of idiots. You could do the same thing to atheism or, hell, even humanism.

And further, it is to be noted that they don't knock Canadian hate speech laws for incitement to violence - that is rightfully illegal in other countries who are not dinged for it - but rather for lack of ability to speak freely about other groups, specifically religious groups, and the fact that Humanism and the irreligious are not granted the same protections.  With a Christian God in the first line of the Canadian constitution, prayers in government council and committee meetings (including in the House of Commons), unequal treatment of the irreligious, and more, the report rightly gives Canada a poor grade.

Gattaca, for example, I don't consider to be realistic.  On the other hand, there are problematic intersections between technology and equality (certainly with existing medical technology), and life extension technology could certainly make this far worse.

His organisation aims to avoid what he sees as the risk of Skynet taking over the world – the problem is that he's not exactly a Geoffrey Hinton or Andrew Ng; he doesn't have a very detailed understanding of what he criticises.  The whole thing is a wee bit like a cult, to the extent that they actually ban the word ""cult"" in their forums (because, you see, it might increase search engine ranking) and insist on using ""phyg"" instead. This also ties in with one of their ideas, ""tabooing"" words. He's also crazily into cryonics and obsessed with the Amanda Knox case. Quite a bit of oddness going on there.

humanism,2uang2,sol-enli-win,14,Sat Jan 31 10:48:33 2015 UTC,"Lack of empathy is obviously more negative than having empathy, but having compassion is better than lacking compassion. Empathy is important to compassion in that it acts as a kind of compass we use to direct our compassion correctly. Without empathy, how does one expect to be able to solve a problem if they can't understand what the problem is?  In the case of, say, a Christian zealot who truly believes they can help save ""the gays"" by reforming them. That's compassion without empathy at an extreme.  You can't help people just by being well meaning."

Morality is a game of constant questions and philosophical quandaries.  In my anthropology courses, we sometimes come to points in lectures about how to not be racist (the early days of anthropology as a discipline were terribly racist). The answer is usually to just ask other people what they want or need, etc.  Boko Haram, in Africa (I don't remember what country off the to of my head) is a terrorist group with fairly advanced weapons, and who use school girls as suicide bombers. The U.S. has been asked to help, but only with intelligence to find out who is supplying the weapons. They don't want soldiers and more war. But our leaders and elites commonly show a lack of empathy by warmongering. You're already showing more empathy than that by being interested enough to ask these kinds of questions.  I don't know if empathy can be cultivated, but if it can, then I assume it would be cultivated by continuing to understand people by asking the hard questions and learning from past mistakes."

Friend, I do not have asperger's, but when I was a child I was thrown out of confirmation classes at my catholic church because I wouldn't stop pestering the youth minister with a certain question: Can god do something that he cannot undo?   I did not understand how my high school classmates could possibly accept such an all encompassing philosophy when those who espouse it cannot explain it fully. At this point in my life, when I am with friends of mine who are religious, I begin to feel that I may have some form of spectrum disorder because I feel this kind of mind blindness.   I honestly cannot tell what their motivation is. Sometimes I get paranoid, and begin to feel like I don't something that is obvious to everyone else.

If you're having an argument with someone like me, the way to make me feel better is to make it clear you fully understand what I'm saying, preferably by repeating it in your own words.  Then you can pin down exactly where the disagreement is.  I've often found that I'm arguing with someone but we're both arguing completely separate points.  Usually it's my fault for not explaining things very well.  Because I understand things differently, people often misunderstand me, I guess?  Hope that helps.

I try to explain to him why he needs to be more careful because not everyone knows he has aspergers, but he doesn't seem to care.

Like what's important to him is the most important thing in the world, to the detriment of all else.  Try explaining to him exactly how that affects other people.  Also try to give him a selfish reason to be on time, like how people will dislike him and respect him less for it.  Inappropriate comments...  Speak to him about ""thinking before he speaks"".  He may feel a little persecuted for this.  I have poor impulse control sometimes and it can be easier to run with my mistakes rather than admit them.  He may come across as thinking he's always right, I know I do.    Make sure you're careful with your words when you speak to him as well, he'll appreciate it (Don't tell him he ""always"" thinks he's right, say ""usually"" or ""almost always"").  I'm sure the fact that you're there for him means alot.  If he's anxious remind him that you're looking out for him.  If he's having trouble in a social context, pull him out and spend 10 minutes with just the two of you.  Remind him that you have his best interests at heart when you're criticising his actions.  I almost feel guilty on behalf of him now, as I'm sure he does, if he feels he's making your life worse with his problems that will make him anxious.  Remind him that you care and you don't mind helping him.  If he IS causing problems for you, be open and honest about that and consider spending more time apart from him.  He'd rather see you once a week when you want to than every day if he thinks he's forcing you.  So honesty and repetition.  Does he take criticism well?  If he interrupts you or doesn't listen try putting it in text form.  Be sympathetic but not condescending.    It's likely he realises that at times he is inappropriate and will be willing to work on that.  As for lateness, tell him exactly who he has upset every time.  And I can't tell you enough, be honest and straight-forward.  And don't treat my advice as gospel.  Everyone is different, maybe even moreso with Autistics so what works for me may not for him.

I like humanism mainly cause there's no reward or punishment for your actions besides the man made logical ones.

The life I have built for myself is pretty quirky - I built a quirky company from scratch in a very unconventional way - I love it, and it was only possible by my deeper understanding of human reality. I used to go to church (though I was atheist) and when I talked about my company while it was in beta phase there I was basically scoffed at - it took a deeper understanding of what is possible to achieve and my experience with most religious people has been that they have a very shallow understanding of reality that is not supported by quantitative terms, and therefore their results in complex matters are not accurate to their projections. i.e. it's probably not coincidence that founders of Microsoft / Apple / Google / Facebook / Tesla are all atheist / humanist.  EDIT: as far as how I treat people, this is where I believe I am leagues ahead of the religious establishment. To be a student of science is to understand the deterministic nature of human reality i.e. reset time by 5 days (or any number) and everything would have happened as before. When you realize that people acted the way they did because they must act that way in accordance with nonquantum determinism - including yourself - your whole philosophy of human interaction will change...

The BHA does quite a few things that go under the radar as far as the press is concerned: it's currently campaigning for Humanist weddings, and spends a lot of resources on training Humanist celebrants, volunteers who teach about Humanism and its history and philosophy in schools, SACRE members who play a part in setting the RE curricula in schools, and pastoral support volunteers (a non-religious equivalent of a chaplain) in hospitals and prisons.

David Pollock is introducing the European Humanist Federation. How does he describes them? They are the equivalent of the non-stamp collectors. they are organized irreligion.  Humanism seems incapable of being defined in the absence of (opposition to) organized religion. It really isn't much of a worldview or an identity that stands on its own. At least that's what I'm taking away.  The EHF should change their name to the European Secularist Federation. That's their main objective after all.

I think humanism should be a belief system centered around the idea that humans are humanity's only hope. Humanist meet-ups need to move is away from debunking religion, and more towards inspiring humanity to simply be better humans. Talk about imagination, willpower, fear, life, death, science, conquests, passions, the human spirit, arts, etc.   I think the equivalent is that there are two kinds of churches (across all faiths). The first kind (the rarer of the two) talks about how to get into heaven. Be good. Help others. I call this positive Christianity. The flip side is how to avoid going to hell. Negative Christianity.   Humanism should avoid Negative Humanism - talking about how stupid religion is - and focus on Positive Humanism - a celebration of human life and potential."

humanism,2sw418,madonnac,7,Mon Jan 19 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"the definition of religion is that it is based on faith. Look at all the definitions, not only on reference.com.  As faith is a reliance on trust, on accepting that which cannot be proven or verified, it can't be a religion  While anything can have songs written about it (call them hymns if you wish), it doesn't make it a religion (else we'd be worshiping the wheels on a bus from childhood).  A temple can also simply mean a meeting place - Sydney Opera House could be called a temple of music.  Yes, we are abandoning supernaturalism, because it cannot be proved that anything can be shown to be influencing or have created the world we live in, be it Buddha, Yahweh or His Noodlieness. If someone would prove their existence, to where we could verify their existence repeatedly, fr4om independent experiments, then we could accept them. Until then, it's really a case of don't be a dick, and we don't need the threat of heaven, hell, or different levels of reincarnation/enlightenment to not be a dick.  Not being a dick would be nice to replace religion, as we wouldn't have to decide who has the most forgiving god.  As empiricism is a reliance on the senses, or on the practice of basing ideas and theories on testing and experience, then yest, it is empiricism. But, that's an antithesis to religion, as they expect you to accept the idea of God, and the stories that have been handed down as true, and as the word of god, untestable, and true, even if it flies in the face of scientific knowledge. This would mean that if religion took a step forward into empiricism, then it would no longer be religion, but humanitarianism."

humanism,2sw418,andrewcooke,2,Mon Jan 19 14:59:13 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that it should.  But I'm Jewish, so my perspective of religion is different from that of those who grew up with Christianity.  We're usually focused on the belief aspects of religions because, in the Western world, that's what mostly sets them apart from each other.  But the West has inherited all of its culture straight from Christianity.  Nearly everyone in the West is of Christian ancestry, with the exception of the small number of Jews, Native Americans (that would be from all of the Americas, not just the US), and some of the immigrants from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.  But really, a religion is a ritual and sociocultural system and identity.  In the past, beliefs weren't questioned; they were just taken as fact.  Judaism teaches that the Torah was received at Sinai, and therefore the Torah was received at Sinai; why would anyone even bother thinking otherwise?  If it weren't true, why would it be taught?  So these beliefs and the accompanying worldview were part of this cultural identity.  Humanism has some of these components, but only some people take it to the level of religion.  You mentioned Humanist hymns and weekly ""services"".  If it has that, it's a religion; end of discussion.  But as someone who only believes in humanity, I can't call myself a member of the Humanist religion.  I'll have to take the lowercase ""humanist"".  But I can't deny that there is a religion there, or at least people are trying to get one together.  The belief doesn't matter so much."
humanism,2sw418,mindbleach,2,Mon Jan 19 11:27:09 2015 UTC,"forget the question for a moment and just think about what humanism is.  my take is that it's an attempt to take what's good from other religions, and discard what's bad, based on the assumptions that (1) humans are intriniscally fairly good and (2) what's bad in other religions is connected with things that are not rational.  so it's a social movement that shares a lot (the good stuff, hopefully) with other religions.  so of course it's going to be possible to make the case that it's ""very like"" a religion.  so what the question comes down to is - how important is the non-rational stuff?  and i think there's two ways to answer this.  first, you can look at what's common in religions, that separates them from other social groups.  and then it seems pretty obvious that a belief in a god (or gods) is important.  and from this point of view, humanism pretty clearly is not a religion.  but second, you can try to answer the question by seeing what's common to other social groups.  is humanism more like schools?  like bridge clubs?  football teams?  and then you say, well, it seems to share an awful lot with other religions (by design).  so if you have to put a label on it, religion seems like a good one because it's similar, in many ways, to ""other"" religions.  and given that language (at least english) isn't defined by committee, but is something flexible and changing - something that can depend on context and speaker - then you cannot say either of these is ""right"".  so what do you do?  what i would suggest is that (at least when things are debatable, like this, and the consequences seem pretty harmless), that you respect the people involved.  and in this case humanists seem to feel (quite strongly, some of them, although not me) that humanism is not a religion.  so, i would suggest, it's respectful and polite to run with that.  edit: personally, i am not sure the question is important, except in a ""propaganda"" way.  what's important are the details.  but you can see how someone who doesn't think much, who just wants to score points, might think otherwise... you can imagine someone saying ""ha ha, but it's still a religion"".  so?  what does that change?  why does the person saying that care?  there are ways in which you can argue it is a religion.  but those don't change what it is - that it's something that tries to be rational.  you just end up with a rational religion.  maybe that's not such a bad thing.  maybe it's better to call it a religion and then use it to shame all the other religions, that cause so much damage, into behaving a little better...  but, as i said, this is just a personal view from someone not so invested in the argument."

humanism,2sw418,Jemora,2,Mon Jan 19 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"Humanism was historically rooted in the rejection of faith-based doctrines and their natural replacement with rationalism and the scientific method. Defined by what it rejects, with rationalism moving in just to fill an operative space, it isn't necessarily a belief system because rationalism is only really coming in as a default within a greater worldview. In this sense it might or might not define a community, but I doubt that it does.  However, beyond rejecting religious faith, insofar as humanism proposes, normalizes and enforces a political liberal trifecta - freedom, equality and justice - there is definitely room for terming it as a religion, complete with sacred objects, sacred ideas and thought rituals. I would have to regard humanists' faith in certain normatives as parts of rigid belief and value systems that may or may not be examined, and appear to form a community. If that doesn't constitute a religion, then we significantly reduce the usefulness of the word ""religion."""

Having justified hope in the capabilities of humanity isn't faith. It is trust. It is verified by past and present observation. It doesn't need faith. It has evidence. And that trust can be shaken by contrary evidence or strengthened by supporting evidence -- each in proportion to the strength of the evidence presented and the confidence we might have in its veracity.   Trust is the virtue, not faith. It is provisional, conditional, and scales up or down based on evidence -- that isn't faith -- it is trust."

Faith operates on a willingness to disregard the facts of the past in the hope for a different outcome.  Faith is largely about wishing something to be true.  Trust is built on established fact and can be altered as the facts or our understanding of the facts change. Trust is largely about using what you know to be true.

You're already in the thick of a philosophical argument that turns on the definition of ""religion."" This is infamously resistant to rigorous definition, so you can amuse yourself with that as long as you like. Sociologically speaking, Humanists are often at least mildly put out by the historical misdeeds of religion, and want to avoid being conflated with it. While there are humanist varieties of many traditional creeds, capital-H Humanism is particular about the scientific standard of evidence. ""Faith in humanity"" doesn't constitute some sort of ""gotcha,"" by the way; the original quote clearly delineates the difference between the Humanists' ""faith"" and that of most religionists.  As I've pointed up with the example of marriage rights above, there is a tactical and strategic element to placing oneself under the umbrella of one term or another. Given that, one is led to wonder why, when asking your question, you respond by arguing with the responders. Do you want to know our reasons, or are you more interested in proving us wrong?"
humanism,2sw418,mindbleach,0,Mon Jan 19 05:01:17 2015 UTC,"Well, one can't very well say religion is based on faith and humanism is based on faith but oh wait that's a different sort of faith so not a religion. A person can have faith in something with evidence. If a religion is faith-based, and humanism is based on a faith in humanity, then it wouldn't matter what sort of faith it was. This a weasel tactic to avoid being classed as a religion based on a previously existing bias against existing religions, which you've acknowledged.   However I wouldn't require any sort of faith for religion, just as I wouldn't require an ablative case for a language. There are languages without certain cases, and there are religions without the supernatural. ""An adhered system of beliefs"" is no more flattering a definition than ""understood mouth noises"" but these are what religions and languages are.  I would consider it a dialectic method of discussion. For instance, someone who defines ""marriage"" as ""a union between a man and a woman"" would find the idea of same-sex marriage obviously absurd, just as I see many humanists find the idea of their belief system being a religion as absurd. I believe arguing our beliefs helps us all reach a higher stratum of understanding."

A humanist expects assertions to be backed up by objective, verifiable fact.  A religious person believes because of personal, subjective experience.

Of course it would. This is an equivocation fallacy - like when the devout insist, ""well atheists must believe in something!"" Using the word ""faith"" to mean a vague notion that humans are generally decent is not in any way comparable to ""faith"" meaning a rejection of evidence-based explanations for the universe. Having faith that my car will start or that the sun will rise again simply is not the same use of the word as believing on faith that hell awaits people who eat pork.   And no, ""an adhered system of beliefs"" is not religion unless those beliefs invoke the supernatural. Americans and North Koreans have wildly different beliefs about the events of the Korean War, but that doesn't mean being American is somehow a religion unto itself."

I mean, at best the word faith could be given some qualifier, but it's still a trust of validity in something. All knowledge is justified, true belief; one must believe in something in order to know it.  The Korean example isn't an adhered system of beliefs; that would just be differing beliefs. Systems of belief are, well, systems of many beliefs that inform each other, and in order for them to be adhered to they would have to make some statement on behavior. You could probably argue that the North Korean stance is part of their state religion, which venerates the Kim family and their mode of government."

But I would agree words with a lot of superstitious baggage tend to be on the flimsy side when it comes to clarity. How about this: let's say a system of beliefs about reality and ethics was practiced much like Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Baha'i, etc., but required empirical evidence for its claims and denied supernaturalism.

I'm not out to be mean here, but the problem is plain and clear that we cannot know what another being is capable of in their mind. This means that we must figure it out through clues from our observations. There is no evidence whatsoever that insects minds are aware of their own state, like the human mind apparently can be. They display no behaviour that seems indicative of this kind of consciousness, and therefore cannot be considered sentient to me."

That reason, consciousness, and  sentience are the moral root of ethics -- it's also what justified the enslavement of other people and the abuse of children and women who supposedly lacked this cognitive agency.  We can dismiss this today, but some human beings still lack this kind of cognitive agency -- like people in a persistent vegetative state.  Do they not have rights despite the lack of ""indicative consciousness?""  I'd even argue a butterfly has more agency than the vegetative human, yet pulling the wings off the former sure isn't on par with dismembering the latter.  Which is to say, ethics are fucking complicated, and as a general rule, I'm against needless insect suffering, and I don't think we should be completely cavalier with any life no matter how insignificant.  I think there's a practical side here too.  Biology is much more of a system than a collection of individual species.  In many respects, human beings are like cells within a larger planetary scale organism, or organelles within a larger cell.   The dividing line between life and non-life is even pretty blurry at the right scale, and what we do to this larger system has direct impacts on human well being as well.

In modern Western philosophy, sentience is the ability to experience sensations (known in philosophy of mind as ""qualia""). In Eastern philosophy, sentience is a metaphysical quality of all things that requires respect and care. The concept is central to the philosophy of animal rights, because sentience is necessary for the ability to suffer, and thus is held to confer certain rights.

Without measuring it how can we make a moral judgement?  And this isn't just nitpicking, how can we reduce the total suffering in the world without giving values to one animal's suffering compared to another?  Thus I choose the literal definition of Humanism, where human suffering is simply always worse than animal suffering.  It's not perfect but it does make it possible to make moral judgements.  Of course animal suffering should be reduced where it doesn't cause human suffering."

Actually, you did disagree. I am making a single point here, and your arguments against it are all over the place. My point is that ""humanism"" is fundamentally narrower than I feel it should be, as it is not concerned with non-human experience. The point made in the third link:   Ethical values are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience.   I feel that this perspective is simply wrong; at least it is far too simplistic. It's beside the point that we can't actually eliminate the suffering of ants or fish or pigs, or know for certain to what extent they're even capable of experiencing it. What I can know is that my ethical values are not derived from an ignorant disregard for it, as the above tenet implies. I believe we should care, and this seems to be in contrast with the popularly perceived foundation of humanism. Go back to my first comment here and reread; this is the only point I'm trying to make. You are arguing against me, and I'm not entirely clear on why.   how can we reduce the total suffering in the world without giving values to one animal's suffering compared to another?   I don't understand the reason for this question. Why does it matter? Are you saying that because we don't fully understand sentience and the ability to suffer, down to a level of assigning relative ""values"" for different species, that we shouldn't care or try?  Why should we have to have that level of understanding to consider the concept of suffering more universally, rather than focusing solely on the suffering of humans? Our lack of understanding of warp drive shouldn't prevent us from trying to explore our solar system.  If we would stretch the meaning of humanism to include concern for suffering in general wherever it exists, then at the very least we must admit that ""humanism"" is a terrible, wrong-headed and misleading name for such a system of belief."

In terms of the animals that is to say that it's pointless to try to consider them until we can value their sentience.  That doesn't mean ignoring them, but rather putting the bulk of our energy toward understanding their value, so that we can move forward.

humanism,2s8hk8,tmamone,6,Tue Jan 13 02:11:56 2015 UTC,"Religious humanism is only an oxymoron if you assume that all humanism is secular humanism - which is the type of humanism espoused by organisations like the International Humanist & Ethical Union and the American Humanist Association and the British Humanist Association and the Australian Humanist Association. They define upper-case ""H"" Humanism as rejecting all supernatural and non-scientific claims, and focussing on science and evidence. However, this secular humanism is only a subset of humanism.   Modern-day humanism has its roots in the Christian theology of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, where some religious thinkers started putting the interests of humans front and centre in their philosophy. The idea of religious humanism is to interpret religions so that the benefit to us humans is an important focus.   It's not an oxymoron to take Jesus' philosophy (for example) and see it as about caring for other humans. For example, look at this story, recorded in the gospels of Matthew and Mark:  Matthew's version:   Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying, “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?” Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”   Mark's version:   Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, “Which is the first commandment of all?” Jesus answered him, “The first of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”   That's a very humanist philosophy: to love your fellow human as yourself. And, it's right there in the Bible. All a Christian humanist needs to do is emphasise this teaching over other parts of the Bible.  And, the same can apply to other religions as well. It's not oxymoronic to be a religious humanist."

The selected winner is discreetly approached beforehand to check that they're all right with accepting the honour. I therefore assume that Carl Sagan was sounded out before he was announced Humanist of the Year.   The same with Richard Dawkins - being Vice-President of a Humanist Association is not involuntary. For example, I know that Isaac Asimov was asked whether he would agree to be President of the American Humanist Association, and would have been permitted to turn it down (speaking of people who didn't go around shouting ""I'm a humanist!"" from the rooftops).  And, if these people choose to be associated with Humanism, who are you to question their self-labelling? One doesn't need to be an A.C. Grayling, writing books about humanism, to be a humanist. One could instead simply be a role model for living a humanist life: a life of understanding the human condition, whether by understanding our place in the cosmos, or by explaining how we evolved; a life of putting human interests ahead of religious interests; a life of educating people so they can reach their fullest potential (both Sagan and Dawkins have produced works that brought science to non-scientists). I'm happy for them to be humanists: nothing they do contradicts humanism, they do some humanist works, and they've chosen the label for themselves.

humanism,2s0d2g,Kernowash,7,Sun Jan 11 00:00:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting Question!   As annoying an answer as this may be, it does depend on exactly what you mean by 'skeptic'. Humanists believe we can gain knowledge about the world, so they are not skeptical in the sense of whether we can actually know anything at all.  According to the British Humanist Association, a humanist ""[trusts] to the scientific method, evidence, and reason to discover truths about the universe."" So clearly a humanist would be skeptical about a claim that had absolutely no evidence in its favour.  Regarding homeopathy, if we agree with the BHA's definition of a humanist then a humanist must trust in what science and evidence has to say. According to the NHS, a 2010 House of Commons Committee:   ""said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos, and that the principles on which homeopathy is based are 'scientifically implausible'. This is also the view of the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies.""   So it would seem that humanists, if trusting in science and evidence, would not believe that homeopathy can cause the body to heal itself.  On to reincarnation. If we were to take out references to 'soul' within reincarnation, then a humanist could believe in reincarnation - depending on the definition.   Suppose all our mental/psychological states were copied, and we were then killed, and then our mental states were 'plugged into' a new body 10 years later. Depending on your view of what it is for a person at one time to be the same person as a person at a later time, and taking reincarnation to be the coming back into existence a person that had previously ceased to exist, then a humanist could argue that reincarnation is possible.  This is clearly an entirely different question as to whether reincarnation has ever occurred in the actual world.  I'll take an educated guess that there is not enough evidence for a humanist to believe Nessie exists!"
humanism,2s0d2g,Atlas200,2,Sun Jan 11 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"interesting perspective for you regarding reincarnation. Its actually possible to logically argue that it occurs.  When we're alive, we're experiencing things, Cogito ergo sum, etc. Therefore, the conditions must have existed in the universe to allow us to come into existence, or how else would we exist? Since its possible for us to begin existing once, and given that in an infinite amount of time and space (like, you know, a universe-worth) everything that is possible will play out an infinite number of times (infinities of infinities, omg). By this logic, the fact that we exist once (now) if the universe is infinite, then reincarnation is true."

As an aside, considering that I think conciousness is a artefact of the physical and temporal arrangement of the neuronal connections in the brain, I'm not sure it will ever be possible to ""re-insert"" a stored conciousness into an existing brain (considering the extraordinary number of interconnections between 100 billion neurons).

My snap reaction would be to say no because of the word ""reincarnated"". I feel that it is a word describing a natural or even supernatural event (i.e. without human interaction). Leaving aside the semantics of the word, and just considering the process, it is a situation would introduce almost intractable difficulties.   I'm afraid I am unable to answer your question. I don't see an obvious right answer and I'll have to cogitate on it some more. Frankly, it's a little mind-bending. While I do that, let me deal out some scenarios...  Lets say I'm in some medical state where no new brain connections are being formed (say a coma-like state) and my body is scanned and genes are cloned and a new adult body is 3-D printed (with matching DNA and scars and so on) and my brain is copied and applied to the brain of the clone (who will be in a coma too).  Due to a terrible three-card-monty mishap, our indistinguishable bodies are mixed up and just then we both wake up fully concious. We both think we are me. Since we're both alive, it's not ""re-incarnation"", it's duplication. We share the DNA, life experiences, memories and so on. Now clearly, once new sensory information starts coming in, our brain pathway patterns will start to diverge, but that's beside the point. Which one is me? Who is married to my wife? Who is parent to my kids? Who owns my stuff? What about my job? What about my siblings and parents?  Lets say that the coma was the result of some terrible crime I committed and, once I woke up, I could be charged. Which ""person"" is charged? Both? Neither (like in the situation with conjoined twins)? Is this a way of avoiding responsibility for crimes? or taxes?  Alternatively, lets say that I could imprint my ""mind"" into an infant's brain in order to become immortal and super intelligent (by accumulating knowledge).

There are reasons why conflicts between individuals, groups, ""races"", religions and nations can go on for a very long time, and one of them is that we feel strongly compelled to do what feels satisfying, not what's going to end a conflict.  Religion could disappear completely for all I care. It creates artificial barriers between people which inevitably leads to conflict. But I think it's way too lazy to put all of the blame on that.  Radical and violent ideologies are like a virus. It's almost impossible to attack them directly. You have to vaccinate and make sure your immune system isn't weakened. Being rational and compassionate is like a vaccine. You can spot harmful ideas more quickly. Having parts of society hate you for your culture, religion or skin color is the weakened immune system.  I'm pretty sure that the overwhelming majority of well-adjusted muslims, especially if they have non-religious friends or friends from other religions, will condemn any attacks like that.  What we should do is to make sure these ""healthy"" people stay that way. Which is why I find that whole ""let's draw as many prophet-cartoons as possible""-circlejerk a bit counterproductive. The only positive thing about it is the ""we won't let ourselves get terrorized""-message it sends, but in the long term that's just a knee-jerk reaction that happens to make us feel super brave and whatnot.

humanism,2rghg6,Fordiman,1 point,Tue Jan 6 17:14:52 2015 UTC,"I believe that a major contributing factor is likely the method that the Dutch national Humanist organisation, HIVOS, gets its funding. As is mentioned near the end of the interview:   There have been various religions in the Netherlands for many centuries which have had about the same influence, and a tradition of government support for all religions has developed. But secular humanists were included after the Second World War inasmuch as they have also been able to become an influential social force.   I think this refers to how the Dutch government actually provides funding to religious and other charitable organisations. As Humanism is taken to be a religious position, HIVOS receives the same type of government financial support and tax breaks that churches do, which means that they simply have a bigger budget than the AHA or the BHA in the UK. As you can see here, HIVOS has an annual income of €116 million (£90 million / $138million). This compares to the BHA here in the UK, which is very well established, with an annual turnover of around a couple of percent of that of HIVOS.  They now have the funding for doing huge PR campaigns, proactive work on a local level, as well as doing loads of charity work in the Netherlands and lots of other countries, which in turn raises the profile of the organisation and its number of supporters.  Also, I would guess that as Humanism is recognised as official religion by the Dutch state, it would appear as an option to tick on every on every census, which would also massively help boost awareness.  I'm not massively well informed about this, but from talking to a few Humanists from the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway (who seem to have broadly similar systems) I think this is approximately how it works."
humanism,2rghg6,CWM_93,1 point,Tue Jan 6 23:37:59 2015 UTC,"I'll have to disagree with HIVOS being the Dutch national Humanist organization, there are several, and while HIVOS is a Humanist organization of sorts, it's more of aid/development organization, mostly giving money to different projects outside the Netherlands with funds from different sources (big among them government). Some of said aid money is channeled through IHEU and IHEYO.   Humanist Alliance is the umbrella organization for some 30 different organization and has according to Dutch Wikipedia(wrong link, will correct) some 85 000 members. I'm somewhat surprised by the figure, being used to thinking of the NHA (Norwegian Humanist Association) with some 83 000 as the biggest Humanist organization. Humanist Alliance do have tax exemption. However    The government provides no direct financial support for religious or secular, philosophical or humanist organisations. But counsellors (both religious and humanists) in the army, the penal and health-system are fair and equally financed by the government. (From IHEU's Freedom of Thought report)   HUMAN is a humanist TV station in the Netherlands which I think is funded by government money which also go to a number religious TV stations.   Belgium do give money to recognized religious groups of which secular Humanism is one., I'm not particularly familiar with the system there. But going back to IHEU's Freedom of Thought report:   The government provides subsidies (payment of salaries, maintenance and equipment for facilities and tax exemptions) for certain officially recognized religious or belief groups agreed with parliament. In determining which groups to recognize, the government examines organisational and reporting requirements. The religious or belief group must have a structure or hierarchy, a ""sufficient number"" of members, and a ""long period"" of existence in the country. It must offer ""social value"" to the public, abide by the laws of the state, and respect public order."

There is ""humanism"" the philosophy, and then there is ""Humanism"" the movement. The movement is a non-theistic subset of the philosophy, which is theistically neutral.   Humanist philosophy in its modern actually started in Christian theology during the Renaissance. At its core, it was merely putting human interests first within the wider context of Christianity. Over time, humanism grew until a section of humanist thought intersected with atheist thought to form secular humanism. However, the formation of a secular humanist movement did not obliterate the original Christian humanism. Even today, there are religious humanists alongside secular humanists.   And the IHEU definition you've quoted is only for secular humanists - who, admittedly, are probably the largest subset of humanists. The Humanist movement (upper-case ""H"") is secular humanism. Religious humanism still exists alongside secular humanism."

When tackling life's problems, a Christian will ask ""what does the bible say?"" while a humanist will ask, ""what does the sum or human knowledge say?"""
humanism,2r8x34,quis-ut-deus,1 point,Sun Jan 4 04:32:49 2015 UTC,"I would like to say that most religions are humanistic at the core, since most religions are centered around a group of people meeting eachother and learning of stories about people from the past. Most religions are old or based on old religions which causes traditions and rituals to play a bigger role than they where intended to play. That's not strange because humans favor repetitive rhythms over chaos, but the traditions lose their  initial purpose.

However, it's hard to call some religions truly humanistic when they put their deity's interests ahead of humans' interests. We all know examples of religious stories or morals where the hero sacrifices themself, or someone or something important, to gain the deity's approval or favour. These are not humanistic stories: these stories put the deity front and centre of the religion, with humans taking second place."

When religious people talk about the most famous sacrifice in Christianity, the crucifixion of Jesus, they will often say that ""Jesus died for our sins"". I don't think that that puts a God or even Jesus at the centre of the religion but humanity. The story is supposed to be an allegory for the single man sacrificing (part of) himself for the benefit of humanity. Most stories can be explained like this, and I think that that was the original intention, to give the average commoner an example to look up to, and we still do that today, just look at the pictures in the header on /r/humanism."

If the well-being of humans conflicts with God's rules, God's rules take precedence. It's a deontological religion, not a humanistic one."

No one puts the good of the species above, for example, the mortal needs of a loved one, when those two things come into conflict. A humanist would.    No. It is humanist to care for humans, not only in general but also in specific. Caring for the mortal needs of a loved one is humanist.   I'm reminded of Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, with the First Law being that a robot shall not harm a human, nor allow a human to come to harm. A couple of robots inferred a Zeroth Law which took precedence: a robot shall not harm humanity, nor allow humanity to come to harm. One of the things they discussed was how to define ""humanity"": you can see and evaluate harm to a single human, but how do you see and evaluate harm to the intangible concept of humanity?   My answer to that question is that humanity is merely the collection of all humans. Therefore, if you care for one human, you are caring for humanity: it's just the specific part of humanity that's right in front of you, rather than the whole of humanity."

Whatever your interpretation of this specific situation, when religion prompts people to hate, we should oppose those people and we should oppose the religion.  Religion is a man-made phenomenon. The fact that some people consider the ideas it presents to be sacred and beyond question shouldn't mean that we can't blame it when it is responsible.    The author is correct that homo/trans/biphobia is a human condition, not a religious one and we should remember that when we're dealing with the religious.

Bigotry as an idea, yes. If that's what you mean to say, then I would agree. But the bigot views of another human being should be respected, within reason. Tolerance is the name of the game. Some people are bigots and to disrespect their ideas (as faulty as we may believe they are) is to disrespect their families, upbringing, convictions, and everything else that defines who they are and what you can learn from them. In order to change someone's mind, you have to empathize with their perspective and respect their viewpoint, even to the point of having sincerely studied it in earnest. Once you've done that sincerely, you can't hate the bigot because you've studied and empathized with that bigotry and hopefully decided against it.   You can't just oppose someone without sincerely attempting to embrace their perspective. Then you're just another streetcorner preacher on a soapbox.  I don't think religion prompts people to hate. Religion gives people an excuse to hate, a reason to justify their learned hatred. I don't think that I believe that religion prompts hatred because otherwise ALL religious people would be hateful and that's simply not the case. Please understand that I say this from an empathetic atheist perspective.

I couldn't agree more, but I might not place blame on religion. I would place it on people who aren't willing to interpret their scripture in a way that benefits humanity. There are very liberal religious people who are accepting of LGBT and there are the orthodox who shun them. I don't think it's helpful to cast a judgement on religion, but I do think it's beneficial to help the religious understand that extremism and orthodoxy aren't relevant or beneficial to humankind, the species that (from their perspective) god blessed above all others.   Let them keep their faith and religion, but help them learn that orthodoxy and extremism was for another time, another culture that didn't have our modern understanding or scientific enlightenment.

I also agree that you can't change a person's view unless you understand it. But we should not embrace a viewpoint that drives people to cause suffering to others.    But there is a way to condemn intolerance without becoming intolerant yourself. And that is, we should make our condemnation as specific as possible. It is wrong to say that Christians are transphobic bigots. There are plenty of Christians who treat trans* people with respect and compassion. There were a couple threads in /r/Christianity about Leelah, and the prevailing opinion was both kind and understanding.   But, on the other hand, there is no denying that Leelah's parents, and the pseudo-therapists they made her see were motivated by religion.

In embracing someone else's perspective, it's purely for the sake of identifying with and empathizing with those who might cause suffrage. For that reason, I think understanding and empathizing with that viewpoint can only help to educate those with whom disagree with.   when some Christians treat trans* people in a hateful and abusive way, we should condemn those Christians for that behavior.   I would agree except that if we just replace the word ""Christians"" with ""people"", that'd be more helpful. To reiterate what I mentioned in another comment, Christianity isn't the problem. It's people's misguided, ignorant understanding of how to apply their faith in modern times that is the problem.  I would deny that Leelah's parents and therapists were motivated by religion. They were motivated by the hurtful side of our human nature and justified (in their own minds) by religion. This fear and phobia isn't exclusive to religionists.

Religious people do not have a monopoly on transphobia, and many religious people are well informed and respectful to trans people. But I think you are trying to separate Christianity from Leelah's mistreatment, and I don't think that's fair.   Here are Leelah's own words:   When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me.  My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.   Leelah's says that her parents used religion to justify the way they treated her. Her ""therapists"" said their treatment was based on religion.  Leelah's mother says:   ""We don't support that, religiously. But we told him that we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy.""   You say that we should try to understand where her parents are coming from. I agree. If Leelah's and Leelah's mother both say this is a religious issue, we should not discount that.  Edit: I wanted to add that I really appreciate your sentiment that we should try to understand people we disagree with. That's an important idea, and it's not expressed often enough."

The person should be given the same basic courtesy (or respect, depending on how you define that word) that everyone deserves, until such time as they act on their bigotry. What goes on in the privacy of another person's head is their business, but when they begin spouting hate we, as members of a society, bear a responsibility to ensure that the hate we witness is opposed. This may mean debate and argument, or it could mean any number of things.   In order to change someone's mind, you have to empathize with their perspective and respect their viewpoint   Yes and no. I would take the first point further and say to understand someone's perspective you must empathize with it. You don't, however, have to respect it once you have explored it and discovered that it is hateful. Respecting an opinion and respecting a person are two entirely different things.    I don't think religion prompts people to hate. Religion gives people an excuse to hate, a reason to justify their learned hatred. I don't think that I believe that religion prompts hatred because otherwise ALL religious people would be hateful and that's simply not the case. Please understand that I say this from an empathetic atheist perspective.   Religion comes in many shapes, and each individual religion can be broken down into many different versions. Religion is not simply an inert set of ideas upon which people impose their own ideas. If you will accept an anecdote, I can offer myself as an example of a person who held what I would currently call hateful beliefs toward homosexuals when I was religious. I personally struggled with the question, but the Bible made it clear: homosexuality is wrong. Regardless, my personal experience does not equal evidence, but to suggest that religion doesn't inspire hate is ridiculous at best. If faith can inspire people to do good, it can inspire people to do bad.    There are very liberal religious people who are accepting of LGBT and there are the orthodox who shun them.   Of course. I wasn't suggesting that all people who follow any particular religion are going to follow it to the letter, but only that the fundamentals of a religion may include some hateful and outdated ideas. The question of course comes down to individuals and how they live their lives, regardless of their religious convictions, but to suggest that a person who may have been exposed to religious ideas from birth wouldn't internalize them and have them become part of their identity and their view of reality is frankly ridiculous. Creationism is a prime example of this.   Let them keep their faith and religion, but help them learn that orthodoxy and extremism was for another time, another culture that didn't have our modern understanding or scientific enlightenment.    I agree. Unfortunately, there are many people who will take this as a personal attack and will respond with further vitriol.   Religion has always followed culture, albeit slowly behind. Except in cases of EXTREME orthodoxy. I feel it's more beneficial to help move them along in empathy and patience.   Religion and culture are not so easily separated, but I see your point. Again, I agree. Empathy and patience are very much my preferred means of discussing issues like these, but that doesn't mean what I'm doing isn't opposition. We don't need to react violently or angrily, we simply need to stand up and tell people they are wrong when they behave poorly and treat people badly. ""You gather more flies with honey than vinegar"", and all that."
humanism,2r5i55,southseattle77,4,Sun Jan 4 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"We can explain away the reasons behind a murder all we want, but that does not excuse the killer from facing consequences for their actions.  Leelah's parents cut her off from any and all support, disallowed her access to any information that might inform her that her life is worth living, sent her to frauds masquerading as counselors to shame her for her pain, and point-blank told her that their daughter did not matter as much as their image did.  Even if it were not religiously-motivated, even if it was not due to the horrible overarching ideas that society has about gender and trans people, this would still be a case of protracted child abuse ending in murder.  Leelah's parents need to be held accountable for what they have done."
humanism,2r5i55,Sudo_killall,3,Sat Jan 3 10:50:00 2015 UTC,"They didn't understand. Empathy is certainly needed. Education, definitely. But judgement on those parents will only cause them to feel more isolated and may even embolden their current belief system.   Casting judgement on her parents is easy. Especially when we're all so far removed from the situation. But finding empathy for their perspective is the challenge. Because if we want people to change their ideas, backing them into a corner in judgement isn't helpful. Empathizing with their perspective and sincerely attempting to understand their motives is very helpful.   Not every trans person commits suicide because their parents weren't accepting or understanding of them. In fact, most don't. I definitely understand that the transgender community has a higher rate of depression and suicide, but that's a mental health problem. Most people, even in the most terrible circumstances, wouldn't choose suicide. It takes a particular set of circumstances including a mental health problem in order to commit to that act.   Leelah Alcorn isn't a victim of her parents. She was a victim of depression. In fact, the mental health of the transgender community should be given much more importance than our culture seems to give it.   Blaming her parents is easy. Casting a judgemental blanket of bigotry on religion is easy. But there is a more serious problem in the transgender community."
humanism,2r5i55,southseattle77,5,Sat Jan 3 11:07:39 2015 UTC,"Suicide occurs when pain and challenges outstrip an individual's ability to cope.  It does not necessarily imply a mental health condition, and it certainly doesn't excuse deliberate actions that lead to it.  Most people don't commit suicide simply because of their parents' horrible actions, that's true.  They do so out of a feeling of hopelessness, that there will never be an opportunity for their life to be worth living.  The problem with the actions of Leelah's parents is that they played into that pain and exacerbated it.  Their perspective is painfully obvious, it's a viewpoint based in misunderstanding, biological essentialism, and naked bigotry that's been written a thousand times.  No parent should have to bury their child, but that doesn't mean they're allowed to ignore that the blood is on their hands.  I would agree that fostering a culture of acceptance and understanding is far more important than indicting the parents.  There are many young trans people who become terrified and hopeless because they're afraid that eighteen is too old to transition, that they will never be able to pass as their gender, that they are only moving toward the inevitable day that they are murdered on the street.  It's more important to spread realistic information and dispel those fears, to show young people that there is hope.  That's why #RealLiveTransAdult is so important, that's why media representation is so important, that's why it's vital that information on transgender experiences be available to people growing up, to show trans kids that they don't have to grow up to be a joke, or a creep, or a victim.  If addressing these problems and holding Leelah's parents responsible for what they've done was somehow mutually exclusive, then it wouldn't even be a choice.  But I don't think they are."

You are aware that depression can be situational? As in the cause of it could be outside the person its afflicting?  Why don't you read Leelah's suicide note, she actually goes into quite a bit of detail about the state of her mind. From her mother's rejection and then her parents isolating her from her friends to her view that all her friends are false or fake, which is a sign of mental illness, and extreme depression.

I feel like it's safe to say that Leelah wasn't a victim of her parents but of depression the same way that a gunshot victim isn't the victim of a shooter but of a bullet.    Whether or not she was predisposed to depression, the lack of a supportive environment makes it worse -- and Leelah's environment was not just not supportive, it actively rejected an innate part of her person.  Support is even more important in this cases than others because often the outside world cannot be relied on to provide support where parents fail, and in cases like Leelah's, a lack of parental support during childhood will permanently close off options that make dealing with gender dysphoria much more manageable (ie, things like hormone therapy are more effective the earlier they start.)"

I tend to believe that although people use religion as their rationale for believing something, in truth, it's more that their culture and people believe it.  Although I do understand that there are places in the Abrahamic scriptures that prohibit homosexuality, there are millions of religious people who don't believe in that aspect. In that regard, I believe that religion follows culture, not that religion defines culture. Except in the case of extreme orthodoxy. In other words, many religious people have no problem with homosexuality.   Human beings are pretty much all the same. There are some of us who are prone to extremism, some to conservative perspectives, some to liberal perspectives, and some who are neutral.

I recognize that no one is going to bail us out; we don't get the luxury of some deity fixing the world for us.   I don't need to tell other people that I do it, and the way I model the concept in my mind does not require that label.

Humanists promote compassion, rationality, and respect for human dignity. These values appeal to people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Humanists also tend to have a distaste for any kind of dogma or indocrination, and an appreciation of independent thought. An easy-to-digest message and a distaste for dogma will lead to a life philosophy that is easy to call ""basic decency"".   I think that's why the Humanist brand is unpopular, but the message of Humanism is widely accepted.   Disclaimer: I've read some of the sidebar links and the wiki page on Humanism.

I'll admit I was imprecise in my language in my previous comment: even though I meant upper-case ""H"" Humanism, I wrote lower-case ""h"" humanism. I was specifically referring to secular humanism, which requires one to be atheist, rather than humanism in general, which does not require atheism as a pre-condition. In this case, while not all atheists are Humanist, all Humanists are atheists. This means that Humanism is a subset of atheism, which means there will always be fewer Humanists than atheists.  As for competing ethical systems, they are many and varied. Any atheist who is not a Humanist will have their own individual ethical system.

Because humanism is not based on any theological premise, every individual is free to combine humanism with other belief systems and to resolve conflicting beliefs in their own way."

A central point in the movie was that love is not just an idea or emotion, but a physical force that exists within the universe. This is how he navigates the 4d room at the end. I disagree with this because I believe love is purely a human creation, and without us it doesn't exist in the universe.  Another heavy handed element of the movie was Dr. Man, who they constantly say is ""the best of us."" Well surprise surprise, Matt Damon turns on us so mankind must be inherently flawed. This is a fundamental mistrust many people have, they think that people at their core are selfish and will do anything to survive. Really a humanist would know the risk, and accept their fate if their world ended up being shitty, knowing humanity would be better off colonizing another place.  Enjoyed the movie (wormhole scene was brilliant!), but I think it fell a little short on the ideology side of things...  Bonus Gripe: Why the hell did Matthew McWhatever look like an overcooked hotdog the whole movie!? Lose the tan, your supposed to be in space!! Gah...  Edit: Matt Damon, not Mark Walhberg lol"

It's best for everyone if he didn't waste the mission's time in coming to his inhabitable planet. He nearly doomed everyone on Earth, who had the good faith to send the mission in the first place.  The prisoners' dilemma is mostly a single lesson, that we must assume everyone tells the truth, for our own benefit, either through reciprocation or because we plan on lying later.  Notice it was never brought up beforehand, that any of the astronauts would lie. They were all on the blind good faith that everyone would uphold their end of the bargain. Dr Mann had to assume that he would be rescued if he lied, because of this assumption of truth-ing."

I think it's great that, unlike the AHA, most people here realize that humanism does not mean you have to reject anything and everything religious. As I've written here before, humanism at its core is a positive view of human nature - that's it. We also believe that religion and ritual are fundamentally human experiences (i.e. not based on or arising from anything external - cultural only). These two beliefs taken together, in my view, must mean that we look on religion and holy celebrations with admiration and respect, as long as they're not harmful to anyone else. Christmas is, at least in theory, a beautiful a time of the year, and there's no reason someone shouldn't celebrate it if they want to."

I don't think you can be a ""pure"" humanist and have traditions and rituals, because those are irrational by definition.

humanism,2ovrhd,busting_bravo,2,Thu Dec 11 03:20:04 2014 UTC,"according to justice Hugo Black, the establishment clause of the constitution, which is the part pertaining to the ""separation of church and state"" means at LEAST this:  The ""establishment of religion"" clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the federal government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa.

Whether you or I agree with this, prayers for solemnizing meals or events or giving thanks are seen by the courts just as tradition: it isn't there to fuck with you as a non-believer, it's just a quirky thing Americans have done for a pretty long time. Now, if the prayers are being used to condemn or try to convert non-believers, then that is an issue, but some boilerplate ""God is great, God is good..."" won't do it.   ""Have a Blessed Day.""   That's well within that person's rights to say that. The constitution does not require religious people to not be religious when they work for the government. As long as it isn't interfering with her legal duties or creating disparate treatment for other religions or non-believers. Of course, the state may have some policy about that kind of thing.   Jesus Banner.   It depends. This stuff actually gets a bit complicated. If it's what's called a ""limited public forum,"" which is a place the government designates for traditional, non-partisan expression by private individuals, then this is okay, provided they don't give better treatment to Christians. If it is not, then it depends on whether a reasonable person would see it as advancing that particular religion through government power. Which would be a difficult case to make, because the fact is that a bunch of the people there are Christian and observe Christian holidays. There's nothing improper about religious holidays. The government can certainly acknowledge the holidays its people celebrate."

That said, I have seen first hand the incredible power that a belief in a supposed higher power has on recovering addicts.

humanism,2ory2j,tmamone,1 point,Tue Dec 9 18:10:02 2014 UTC,"One issue that I have with one of his positions:   The argument is actually a little more subtle than I maybe let on, but the basic point is that veganism is an obvious moral conclusion for everyone except theists. They have potential compelling objections that atheists can't make (atheists can't point to bible verses about dominion over animals or suggest that animals can't suffer because they don't have souls, since souls are necessary for consciousness, and so on). So in that sense, if you're an atheist (who accepts what I think are really noncontroversial moral premises) then you should be a vegan.    I submit that it's morally defensible to eat meat/consume animal products for health reasons.  Unfortunately, the state of nutrition science today is pretty abysmal.  For the longest time we've been fed anecdotes and advertising as self-evident fact when it comes to nutrition... and some of it has very probably had some awful effects on public health up to today, e.g. the food pyramid (advocating grains and carbohydrates at extreme levels in our diet) and the low-fat craze (and the subsequent overcompensating with sugar and salt).  With the amount of uncertainty as to what is or isn't a healthy diet, and the evidence in favor of most diets being anecdotal and/or generally not having causality established, it's highly controversial as to whether or not a vegan diet is actually conducive to optimal health.  I've heard and read claims that dietary cholesterol can increase the body's testosterone production, and thus may in some cases improve mens' sexual health and functioning (this is something that I'm unsure about, and may be something that can be debunked or verified in the coming years).  Vitamin B12 is very important for the health of the nervous system, and the only natural dietary sources of it come from animal products (there are supplements and fortified vegetable foods, but to date it's still controversial as to whether the delivery via these methods is as effective).  I don't find it morally objectionable for an atheist/humanist individual to include animal products in his/her diet when doing so maximizes expected health.  If a vegan diet is legitimately established as the optimally healthy diet for an individual, then perhaps, as this person puts it, then I might be willing to admit that said individual ""should be a vegan."""

Also, I think two days a year - International Humanist Day in June and HumanLight in December - are quite enough. Even the Catholics, one of the most ritualistic religions around, don't have something on every single day of the year!  However, if you're going to expand the use of this calendar, you'll need to address the issue of people living in the Southern hemisphere, where it's Summer in December/January when you have your Winter Festival, and Winter in June/July when you have your Summer Festival.   Also, be wary of including things like Martin Luther King Day and Memorial Day and Independence Day and Columbus Day and Halloween and Thanksgiving which are specific to only one country. Also, you've got Father's Day in June? It's September here in Australia. And Labor Day in September? It's different in Australia. These country-specific days reduce the relevance of this calendar to other people around the world."
humanism,2ogp87,Algernon_Asimov,1 point,Sun Dec 7 14:38:10 2014 UTC,"Hi. Thanks for your thoughts.  First, the point of the calendar is to help us Humanists live well by providing opportunities to engage with important aspects of life and resources to help us do that. Also, following the narrative arc throughout the year can be fun and emotionally rewarding/meaningful. It does border on the spiritual/religious. We think that this is one thing traditional religions do really well and that religious people get a lot out of. It's our attempt to jettison the metaphysical bathwater and re-purpose the useful calendar baby.  Second, if all you want is to celebrate those two days, then go ahead. We know people who would like more (though we do not actually have something single every day, more like every week). But if you see the point of celebrating any days at all, then you're already sort of on board with our premise - that holidays can be important if they are done well. What we're doing here is expanding on this notion. We think that the holidays you mention, the explicitly Humanist ones, are important, but we also believe it is important for Humanists to engage with more of life - indeed all of it. If Humanism is to be a fully realized worldview which helps people live their lives well, then it needs to be about more than just the fact that we are Humanists.  Finally, your critique of our Amero-centrism is valid. That was a difficult design decision to make, but in the end we decided that Americans are our primary audience, at least for now. We couldn't avoid these problems without turning the calendar into something which wasn't really relevant to anyone. But this actually points to something really great about the calendar. Namely, that it is not intended to be the final word on Humanist liturgical practice. We look forward to seeing other Humanist calendars tailored to the needs of Humanist communities around the world. Perhaps you'll write an Australian one?"

Avoid crushing the tenets of Christianity, even though it is easy and fun to do. Remember this: productive arguments in this arena always arrive at faith. Evangelical Christians perceive faith as a gift from God (or they have a vaporous definition of the term and just believe what their preacher and Fox News tells them to believe). Define faith as a thought process that is unreliable for determining what is true. Faith is, however, reliable for achieving peace of mind without having to deal with the harsh realities of... well, reality. Many don't have the will or the capacity to grasp scientific explanations of origins or wrestle with ethics. Most of all, the faithful are unwilling to entertain the idea that nobody is listening to their prayers, and there may not be an afterlife; it is too painful. Think deeply on whether you want to burst this balloon for them. My father is a preacher, well-read on the Bible and theology, and he is now my only Christian family member I discuss such things with. Maybe don't discuss it unless it's with the one or two people in your family who are the most mature Christians.

Interesting. I suspect you're still carrying some baggage from your Christian days - because atheism is not an ideology.  Atheism is nothing more nor less than the statement, ""I lack a belief in god(s)."" There is no ideology, no morality, no ethics, no philosophy, nothing else attached to atheism beyond that single statement. To say that atheism is an ideology is to buy into the misguided critics' views even before you start discussing the issue.   Atheism is not an ideology, any more than a lack of belief in unicorns is an ideology.  Now that we've got that out of the way... :)   I am, however, quite clearly a secular humanist    There's your ideology! Humanism is an ethical stance which actually says things about what you believe. As per the sidebar here (which itself is quoting the International Humanist and Ethical Union's definition of humanism), humanism ""affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. Humanism stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethics based on human and other natural values in a spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities."" That's your ideology - not atheism.  So, when your family start asking you the inevitable question, ""Well, what do you believe?"", that's your answer.   It's not what atheists believe: atheists have no belief, because atheism is merely a lack of a single belief. It's what humanists believe: humanists have positive ethical and moral beliefs.  And, I'll re-affirm something that a few other people here have already said: do not be the first person to bring up this topic. As far as possible, stay away from any discussion of religion. Focus on talking about each other's lives and activities and what you've been up to and how nice it is to get together after so long. Be nice, be pleasant, and don't go looking for trouble.   the role of 'experts' in conversation with xians is valuable. Being able to say a humanist I know... ""believes/does/acts"" etc is compelling. Xians tend to disguise their own belief behind a wall of quoted authority.   If someone else does raise the topic of your supposed lack of belief, and if you want some sort of ""authority"" to back up your statements about your own beliefs, you could not do better than the Amsterdam Declaration, which outlines the principles and ethics of Humanism quite nicely. Print out a copy and fold it up in your pocket, if necessary! This is what humanists believe; this is what we're for.

No really, he never mentioned it. Apparently imperialism, colonialism and general subjugation of these countries are not worth a mention.  Instead we are given some arguments which, while true, are dangerously oversimplified.  1) Poor institutions. Yes of course, poor countries lack effective institutions. Yes, corruption is a problem. But this explanation boils down to ""they have bad institutions because they are corrupt because they are selfish, extracting wealth for their groups"". I.e. it's entirely their fault. If only they stopped fucking themselves over and they'd do better! Like the richest countries, because we're not corrupt and look how well we do for ourselves. To ignore the systematic destruction of existing institutions by many of the rich countries, the establishment of new institutions predicated on benefiting those rich counties, and the subsequent suppression of new institution building by the rich counties is a disgrace.  2) Culture. Again, this is a valid point, but taken alongside various other factors! This argument also boils down to ""if only they were more civilised in their world views - like us - then they would be able to develop!"" - so again it's their own fault that they're poor! And the US is rich because of the hard working Protestants. You have got to be kidding me.  3) Geography. Again yes this is a huge deal! And I'll give him this one.   So two out of three of the reasons that poor countries are poor boils down to it being their own fault, really, with absolutely zero mention of the historical legacy and continuing impact of the influence of the rich countries.   It's nothing to do with trade policies, or rich counties' ever rising demand for resources with no care for local impact, or the widespread devastation of existing cultures and institutions. It's a combination of their own doing and jolly bad luck.   What a joke."

Some of them don't know what to do with those feelings, they could be encouraged by books like these to e.g. flee their country and live a better life elsewhere.  Usually, books much less controversial than this are forbidden, burned or censored in such countries, and denying a human access to information is in my opinion not compatible with humanist ideas.  Background: I read Kacem El-Ghazzali's story and without humanist and atheist books and connections, this ex-Muslim might be dead today.

You need to explain exactly how long you think we have, and why you think that the world (or only the people?) will die.   The psyche controls our inflections of these words, and history creates bullshit meanings for them. As we evolve why cant our language.   You don't think language changes through time?  Also, you think history creates the meaning? Why isn't the interpretation of the written word? Wouldn't history as a concept be objective truth, while people impose their story (with meaning) on the objective truth?"
humanism,2np1u7,deepitee,2,Sat Nov 29 21:17:24 2014 UTC,"RESPONSE  Okay so this may seem long winded, and my facts a slightly skewed, but the main points should be there. i am sorry for taking so long to respond, First of all i would like to thank you for taking the time to read what i had to say, and even responding to it. That alone is enough. I am using drive, and not exactly at a computer so i wont be able to cite you sections properly, so i am answering them in the order i read them.   I dont mean wholly religion, I mean that religion was a strong backdrop of society during the industrial revolution, and even hundreds of years befor that. Christians/protestants control everything, especially in the sense of the law, where anti-gay anything laws were made based on religious ideals. Not to focus on one thing, there is also the criminalization of marijuana, and abortion amongst many other things involved there too.   i dont think that it is hurtful, but i do think that it has led to lazy humans who make poor decisions, in hopes of finding shortcuts and the expense of others.   living my own life, and experiencing my ownbullshit, and getting through it as well as having a catholic background, i learned that too many people including myself are thinking too locally. Putting blinders on the peripherals of our psyche. The human race focuses too much on so much bullshit. Only people who share this realization, who happen to have TONS OF MONEY can have a clear voice to affect mass amounts of people.   Any society with any number of people has to be constructed around at least one BINDING ideal, this is what creates outsiders and insiders. This keeps everyone working towards a goal, whether its big or small. But whats important here is the realization that if the entire human race could get behind one major idea, say saving the world, or interstellar travel, instead of broken factions based on WHICH SKIN COLOR IS BETTER, who WHOS GOD REALLY EXISTS… We could truly make some major strides. Maybe even conquer the stars and answer the universal question Are we alone? Wouldnt that be something.   Yes there are many religions that dont focus on an all powerful deity. Wicca for example focuses on a connection with the forces of nature. I thnk that our consciousness simply moves on to the “next thing” or in other words, a new vessel (universally any where in the galaxy, not just earth) once the current one can no longer support it.   Sure this is a rather pessimistic view, but the science is there. We had glaciers to reflect the sunlight and keep the planet cool, but the surface areas of those glaciers is reducing rather quickly. Those are melting and the planet is turning into one huge slow cooker, with a rising temperature. We also have major levels of radioactive isotopes floating around in our oceans moving across the pacific, and 2.something million gallons of oil floating around with it. When will we learn? How long before it begins to affect our DNA? Chernobyl wont be habitable for humans for another 10,000 years.   Language changes over time, absolutely. But it is derivitive of its predecessing cultural use. Meaning theres always some connection somewhere. Its taking the time now to drop the bullshit behind racial or any other slur, and realizing that those words have only the meanings that we ourselves associate with them based on when/where we grow up. The swastika is a symbol of LUCK!But 99% of poeple dont associate it with luck, let alone use it in regularity like a 4 leaf clover. It is a condemned symbol now."

humanism,2nj0o9,PinkSlimeIsPeople,13,Wed Nov 26 23:48:36 2014 UTC,"“This catch-all category presented anyone who identified as having “no religion” as a homogenous group in America today, lumping people who may believe in God with the many who don’t.”   A damn good point, one not made often enough.   The study identified six types of non-believers: Intellectual Atheist/Agnostics (IAA), Activist Atheist/Agnostics (AAA), Seeker Agnostics (SA), Antitheists, Non-theists and Ritual Atheist/Agnostics (RAA).   This is very interesting.   Education, said Coleman, particularly college education had a more deleterious effect on religious belief than any other single factor.   No surprise there.   The most “empirically visible” type of non-believer is the Anti-Theist, who believes that religion is a destructive force in society. According to Silver and Coleman, these are in fact the least common unbelievers, but there are the most strident. They rate highest in levels of anger and dogmatism, according to the survey results.   Again, no surprises. :/   And finally a type emerged from their research that neither Coleman nor Silver had first thought to study, the Ritual Atheist/Agnostic, who the report describes as individuals who “find utility in tradition and ritual. For example, these individuals may participate in specific rituals, ceremonies, musical opportunities, meditation, yoga classes, or holiday traditions. Such participation may be related to an ethnic identity (e.g. Jewish) or the perceived utility of such practices in making the individual a better person.”    Now this... this is perhaps the most interesting part of all, I think.  I'm glad this study was conducted, it provides a very valuable perspective.   Silver said that he hopes this study is just a beginning, that the destruction of the idea of atheists as being all one type of angry, confrontational person will lead to a lessening of social stigma on atheists.  “You’re a unique snowflake just like everybody else,” he said cheerfully. “There’s just one small group that are the loudmouths” who are potentially making it more difficult for other constituencies of non-believers.    A quote for the ages."

humanism,2n9nun,MrSexysPizza,40,Mon Nov 24 15:12:25 2014 UTC,"Atheism is very simple: most broadly, it is a lack of belief in gods.  That's it.   It's not a philosophy or world-view. It has no dogma or rituals or songs or special books. It's just a single position on a single issue.  Humanism, as the sidebar describes, is more of a philosophy and way of living that includes various positions on how to treat one another.  As such, these are not mutually exclusive - you can be one, or the other, or both at the same time.   Do you, even if you really care more about people/humans, prefer saying ""Humanist"" so that you're basically not put in that ""evil"" category when some asks?    If someone is asking specifically about my religious views, I say that I am an atheist. If someone asks me ""but what do you believe in?"" I answer by saying that I am a secular humanist.   Secular humanism isn't a religion, so if someone asks me ""what church do you go to?"" they are making the mistake of assuming I even go to one, so ""I'm an atheist, I don't go to any church"" is a great way to gently remind people that not everyone goes to a church. Answering ""secular humanism"" to that question would be disingenuous.  Can you clarify what you mean by ""evil category?"" I'm curious what you mean by that.  tl;dr: Atheism is a useful label when talking about my religious views - I'm not a theist. Secular humanism is useful when talking about positive beliefs and morality and philosophy of life stuff."
humanism,2n9nun,astroNerf,3,Mon Nov 24 15:34:57 2014 UTC,Nice explanation. I'd also add that there theists that consider themselves humanists as well.   A secular humanist is less likely to encounter scenarios where not belonging to a faith might interfere with humanist ideals. Certain tenets of faith dovetail with humanism (Catholic nuns who protest warfare and aggression) while others (holding a stance against contraception) are points of contention.
humanism,2n9nun,SirThomasMalory,2,Mon Nov 24 15:54:13 2014 UTC,"There's nothing disingenuous about saying ""I'm an atheist secular humanist, I don't go to any church"".  When someone asks for a religion (and you don't have one) it's perfectly fine to give your ""life philosophy"". That's why in an extended meaning of the word religion someone can answer with say ""confucianism"".   Answering just atheism isn't really answering the question. The person most likely wants to know what you do believe in. It'd be like if a muslim answered ""oh, I'm a theist"". That's not the point of the question. If you really are an atheist who has no other life philosophy then maybe it's make sense (although every person I've met so far has a life philosophy even if they can't name it but can describe it briefly)."

humanism,2n9nun,astroNerf,3,Mon Nov 24 16:03:39 2014 UTC,"This is a problem with the people who were taught that atheists are evil people. This has been happening for centuries. The word itself is a perfectly cromulent word.  A good tactic here, if you want to avoid triggering that connotation, is to swap in ""non-believer"" instead. It means the same thing as ""atheist"", in the context of gods.   Ultimately, though, people need to be disabused of their belief that atheists are somehow evil and doing so is often not easy. A good approach might be to point out well-known atheists like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet and ask if the billions they've donated towards ending poverty and disease in developing nations is good or evil. If you have someone willing to listen, it's not hard to demonstrate counter-examples that might make them reconsider their position."

People who sort of know what it means (which is the most likely case, rather than more thorough knowledge, if a person's exposure to atheism is limited enough to think of atheists as evil) generally have a very negative concept and associate it with a more aggressive, ""militant"" strand of atheism.

humanism,2n9nun,hellafun,3,Wed Nov 26 02:07:18 2014 UTC,"The simplest answer I can put together:   ""Atheist"" tells people what you don't believe in, whereas ""Humanist"" tells people what you do believe in.   A historical side note: Humanism actually has it's origins with the religious (Catholics if I remember correctly), and Religious Humanism actually predates Secular Humanism, though this probably has as much to do with the fact that secularism and atheism were not yet really fully formed concepts at the time as anything. Secular Humanism has since come to dominate over time as conflicts between Humanistic and Religious values tended to push people in to one of two separate categories, religious or Humanist. Religious Humanists still exist, of course, and there is noting about Humanist values that necessarily prevent it, but most Humanists today have either found Humanism after already rejecting religion (which left them searching for a better, more rational philosophy and set of values) or have at some point found that their Humanist values prevent them from honestly continuing to call themselves members of their previous religion. These days, we're increasingly seeing the ""secular"" dropped from the name, with Humanist now being assumed to be Secular Humanist unless otherwise specified.

I suppose that depends on whether or not the gene-centered view of evolution is correct. I can't claim to have anything greater than a layman's knowledge of biology and evolution, but it seems spot-on from my perspective.  And let me ask... how do you account for altruism if people are at their root deeply self-serving? Also, if the majority are deeply self-serving, why would they establish environmental factors and social rules that do not favor their default behavior and attitude?"
humanism,2n9nun,thewriter1,1 point,Tue Nov 25 09:17:06 2014 UTC,"I would reckon that the established rules and even altruism to a degree are results of a sort of pragmatism right? Even though most people would steal if they knew there would be no consequence to themselves, they also don't want to have their shit stolen, so we create laws because we want our society to run with stability and to be safe.   Of course where that gets really potentially dark or tricky is the point where we get past something like theft into something like rape of murder. Have I ever thought ""I would rape/murder if I could guarantee I wouldn't get caught""? Absolutely not. The thought completely repulses me. But then one wonders if that moral compunction is a metaphysical or biological tangibility, or if it's just a very deeply ingrained bit of cultural conditioning. It's troubling to think that people in terrorist groups, the mafia, the Mexican drug cartel, etc., have shaped an insular sort of environment where the ""law"" dictates it's completely reasonable to kill for monetary gain or whatever, so long as you don't go about it in a way that gets you caught. Those are human beings too.   As for altruism, again I'm torn. It could be genuine goodness or it could be a sort of self-service. I personally donate to two charities every month: Sierra Club and ACLU. Why? Because I want the environment to survive and I want to live in a world where social justice exists. But is that self-service in it's own way?  Like when you see people who donate huge sums to something like dog adoption services, it's cause whatever they love dogs. Or they donate to cystic fibrosis because someone in their family has it. The human community at large would benefit much more from a donation to research a more common disease like cancer or famine but it's not personal to those donors so they ain't doin it."

What does ""sharia"" mean as understood by the respondents? I can all but guarantee you that the vast, vast majority of muslims would disagree with the idea as you understand it (the one you're associating with violent islamists).

The Soviet Union and Nazism were existential threats -- and not merely because of their intent but their means.  We're talking about two HUGE political and industrial mights that had the power to destroy liberal western democracy.  Whatever bad things are being done right now in the name of Islam -- and that's an important distinction here from Islam itself -- are far from existential threats.  They export oil and rugs -- not fighter jets and nuclear weapons.  They're barely out of the bronze age.  The truth is very complex, and it actually starts with 20th century secular failure to address real social problems in the Mideast.  These people are turning to extremism because 1st and 2nd world models utterly failed to make their lives better -- and western interference just makes things worse.    That has nothing to do with religion per say -- as evidenced by relatively moderate but modern Islamic nations like Singapore.

Since no individual is capable of knowing everything, it is only when we work together as group that were a capable of achieving things like this. This probe landing on a comet stands to give us a wealth of information about the origins of our solar system, and in a way a deeper understanding of how humans came to exist.   If the origins of our existence isn't an important part of the philosophy of humanism, then I'm open to a discussion about it."
humanism,2m55s5,Algernon_Asimov,0,Fri Nov 14 07:12:43 2014 UTC,"I see heaps of relevance to science - astrobiology, astrophysics, biogenesis, rocketry, and so on - but nothing about the philosopy of humanism.   You wrote ""I also think it's a huge achievement for Humanism "", and I'm still waiting to understand what humansim (not science, not the scientific community) achieved here. How does caring for our fellow humans achieve a rendezvous with a comet?   I think you're confusing science with philosophy.

You seem to be arguing that the probe it is purely scientific, that we gather no greater understanding of our existence through our origins. As I said earlier, the scientific achievement here shows that these people care about humanity, though not directly through their actions.  Straight from the sidebar: ""every individual is free to combine humanism with other belief systems and to resolve conflicting beliefs in their own way"" If part of my system is finding inspiration through the Philosophy of Science, to help people get excited about the idea of humanism, I think that works.  You're clearly an Asimov fan so let me ask you this. Did science - astrobiology, astrophysics, biogenesis, rocketry, and so on have 0 effect on his belief system. Completely irrelevant to the philosophy? Or do you think it helped contribute and shape his views on humanism?  edits: a few typos"
humanism,2m55s5,Algernon_Asimov,2,Fri Nov 14 14:59:45 2014 UTC,"What was the motivation behind launching this probe if these people didn't care about our fellow humans?    It's purely selfish curiosity by scientists. They want to know stuff, so they send out probes to find out stuff.   that there is no philosophy of Science?   There may be a philosophy of science. Humanism ain't it. Humanism is a philosophy of humans and humanity. It includes a declaration that ""Humanism advocates the application of the methods of science and free inquiry to the problems of human welfare."", but you have yet to demonstrate that this is what led to the probe's achievement.  I think it's also worth pointing out that scientific achievements have been made under other philosophies and under religions. The Renaissance, for example, happened while Europe was predominantly Christian. In fact, some of the scientific discoveries of the time were motivated by a desire to understand God and His universe more fully. This period was preceded by the Islamic Golden Age - which was obviously Islam - because Islam placed a high value on scholarship.   So, we see that science has progressed under many different worldviews. It's therefore very presumptuous to start claiming a scientific achievement as being an achievement of any particular philosophy - and one had better be able to back up one's claim if one does so.   You seem to be arguing that the probe it is purely scientific, that we gather no greater understanding of our existence through our origins.   No. I'm arguing that, even if this probe helps us understand our existence, that's not relevant to humanism - not as something humanism cares about, and definitely not as something that humanism achieved.   You're arguing that ""I also think it's a huge achievement for Humanism"". Fine. Prove it. In what way did humanism achieve putting a probe on a comet? Was it sent up by the International Humanist & Ethical Union? Was the probe sent up because humanists sent a letter to the European Space Agency asking for close-up analysis of a comet? Did humanists band together to build the probe? Did humanists raise money to fund the probe? Was the probe built by humanist scientists (and not by Christians or Muslims or non-humanist atheists)? Was the probe built according to humanist doctrine? In what way did humanism achieve this, as opposed to simple scientific curiosity? Because wanting to do science is not the same as caring about fellow humans.  I think you're clutching at straws if you want to paint this scientific achievement as a humanist achievement.      You're clearly an Asimov fan so let me ask you this. Did science - astrobiology, astrophysics, biogenesis, rocketry, and so on have 0 effect on his belief system. Completely irrelevant to the philosophy? Or do you think it helped contribute and shape his views on humanism?   I'm sure science did affect his belief system.

What you're describing is already what we have with government and democracy. Good democracies are secular. We already have non-profit humanist organizations that benefit for government tax breaks or subsidies. We rely on scientific, political, humanist and atheist communities to represent our interests and keep the government in check.  If you're looking for a globally unified group, we have the UN and, unless I'm totally mistaken, society is already trending towards one global government (EU, UN, etc.)  I agree that the athiest community fails in many ways. Churches are still strong forces in terms of humanitarian aid, community and personal support and charities. I think if the individual humanist/atheist communities around the world realize this and act on it, we would probably accomplish what you intend.  There is no need to call it a ""religion"" or to ""unify"" it. Those words just smack of dogma and dictatorship."

Religious groups do not mess around in unifying pulpit and profit in order to get votes. I am simply skeptical that doing nothing to counteract this wave of money will actually stop it. If people with like-minded interests refuse to unify simply based on an objection behind unity itself, it is counteractive to our overall goals. They are an army, and I don't think a bunch of individuals, no matter how right they are, can stop them.  Also, it makes me sad that the pope is the ""politician"" with the most positive influence in our world today... It seems to me it should be a humanist instead.

Unification is a great ideal to have but it is too utopian to realistically consider. A great goal, but social change is inherently slow. The best hope is to try to accelerate it. You can't expect to change a billion minds in a single unification sweep. It has to be a gradual change, a long game.  The solution to problems like the religious influence in politics is to support and promote initiatives like Mayday. If you actually want to make change, pick a single fight and champion it. Bring it to existing atheist groups. Organize something like the Rally for Reason or TAM. Fill the gaps in secular communities that only churches occupy. This is how things change in our world and it can be effective.  While I support your intention, simply calling for unification will not work. It's not as if unification itself will solve all these problems for us. We'd still have to put boots to the ground and fight each battle. What might work is for a person like you to get involved in the higher ranks of existing organizations like the Atheist Alliance and actually starting initiatives to bring various chapters together to fight a common cause."

To address a few points from your video directly with my own examples: the local Center For Inquiry (CFI) group that I'm a member of (here in Toronto, Canada) holds ""Living Without Religion"" meeting every month and it does actually attract newly ""out"" atheists and those who are losing their faith.   Incidentally, CFI is a registered charity here which is a good thing in many ways (e.g. tax exemption) but it also means that they prohibited by law from being overly political. CFI also tries to be as open as possible, to avoid alienating the public, and tries to avoid the atheist label when describing themselves.   I've recently joined a brand new local group that is specifically for atheists so hopefully we can act where CFI cannot.  Another local organization in Canada, called Evidence for Democracy, is trying to combat the corporate lobbying (mainly oil companies) that is influencing governments and silencing science.  I suspect there are communities and organizations in your local area that you are not aware off. Your ideas are not new and smart people are tackling the problems you mentioned right now.

humanism,2lsujr,Algernon_Asimov,3,Mon Nov 10 02:19:00 2014 UTC,"My key reservation with the idea of unifying Humanism into a 'religion', or unified voice is that it smacks of the old saying... if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  I think the issue of religion having too much political and social capital necessitates a drive to discourage our tendency to defer to groups to make decisions with personal ramifications. Deposing religion with another unified group with a common agenda who can out vote opposing voices doesn't solve the problem, it replaces it.  Critical thinking, is not a unifying process but it does/should re-organize people. What I really want to see is people thinking ""Candidate A supports increasing social securities and in this time of economic uncertainty I need to ensure I have a back up plan because my job isn't secure"" rather than ""My church always votes republican/ my humanist group always votes liberal"". Key to this is, maybe the next election that same person nows votes for C because their personal situation has changed and C represents better the focuses of their life... maybe C wants to increase child care incentives, etc... because now my voter has a stable job and a family, etc... What is important is that my person in this example is not in the same 'group' both times, they switched groups because the realities of their situation has changed in the 4 years between elections. What I don't want to see is people voting for Candidate A because Candidate A is liberal and that's who secular humanists vote for.  In my ideal world people are not beholden to any group except insofar as it furthers their own happiness. People change groups all the time, and that isn't seen as weird or 'flip-floppy' or like that person lacks loyalty... Where I can be an 'atheist' when it comes to religion but don't have to be an 'atheist' when it comes to politics, or social issues, etc... Where I can vote for a conservative with a solid economic platform (who doesn't try to further religion) over a liberal who says ""we need to teach the controversy, to be fair to all sides"".  and so on.  To be clear: I am not saying we shouldn't have groups, I think they are both required and inevitable. I mean to say that I think part of what I envision when I see 'religion' is an all encompassing-ness which advises its members to tow-the-line above all else. I want to be able to disagree with a humanist on something (maybe even vote against them) and still be a humanist, and not seen as a 'bad humanist'.  TL;DR: I think 'becoming a religion' is a bid to replace one power group with another, I disagree that is the proper course of action for long term harmony."
humanism,2lsujr,Algernon_Asimov,5,Mon Nov 10 15:02:28 2014 UTC,Secular cannot be considered a religion. Humanism is not a religion it is a philosophical way of life where one could choose to participate or not without any real consequence. Do not devalue this desire to attain knowledge and live in hope by attaching self perpetuated ignorance that is religion.
humanism,2lsujr,Beloson,1 point,Mon Nov 10 08:21:12 2014 UTC,"when people convert out of their religion - be it Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, whatever - they need a safety net in which to fall into [sic]. When I converted from Catholicism to secular or atheist humanism, I didn't know where to turn.   It seemed to me like this is a massive hole that we need to fill in.    You know what this sounds like? This sounds like a recommendation for using methadone to help heroin addicts kick the habit, or a recommendation for using e-cigarettes to replace real cigarettes. You want something to ease the transition from religion to non-religion. Something for people who are used to going to church every Sunday, and are now missing the companionship and support which they got from that organisation.   Well, this already exists. They call themselves the Sunday Assembly.   If we never form a humanist or secular atheist group then we never will be able to counteract the machine that is government.   Leaving aside the American-style anti-government paranoia underlying this sentiment, there have been many groups that organise to protest government actions. There are groups like GetUp and Occupy and Black Panthers - and the epitome of anti-government protest groups, the Tea Party movement. People are organised against government. Find a group that suits your particular cause and join up!   There's a lot of atheist-humanists or secular humanists with some big-time money, and we could make a big big impact on the political scene if we could use that money to create laws that would be in our interest.   Firstly, isn't this the definition of political corruption?  Secondly, what are these laws that would be in our interest as secular humanists, and in what way are they different from laws that are in everyone's interest as humans?  Thirdly, I thought you were against ""the machine that is government"". :P   Why don't we use [The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights] to unify atheist secular humanists across the world? It will help the youth, it will help the adults, it will help the children, it will help the world.   Yes, it will. In fact, it already does. Because... get this... it already exists! The UN Declaration of Human Rights already exists. As does the Occupy movement. As does the Sunday Assembly.   Something else that already exists is the American Humanist Association (""the voice of humanism in the United States for over 70 years""). So does Humanist Canada (""Canada's National Voice for Humanism since 1968""). Also, my local Council of Australian Humanist Societies. And, these organisations are all under the global umbrella of the International Humanist and Ethical Union, which ""is an international non-governmental organisation (NGO) with representation on various United Nations committees and other international bodies. We seek to influence international policy through representation and information, to build the humanist network, and let the world know about the worldview of Humanism"".

It comprises his edited Gifford Lectures on natural theology, which were delivered at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland in 1901 and 1902.  The lectures concerned the nature of religion and the neglect of science in the academic study of religion, in James' view. Soon after its publication, the book entered the canon of psychology and philosophy and has remained in print for over a century.  James went on to develop his philosophy of pragmatism.

There are probably more recent works along these lines but this was a great introduction when quantum theory was less well known.  Also, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Julian Jaynes makes a compelling read.  In short, the human brain only recently (within 10,000 years) developed a concept of ""I"" and otherwise heard an internal voice, the voice of this or that god, guiding them.

I'll be blunt: noone is going to find their personal beliefs outlined in any anti-religion text, because being anti-religious isn't a belief. Being atheist isn't a belief. Being anti-religion is a negative belief. Being atheist is a lack of a belief. So, looking for your personal positive beliefs to be reflected in books like 'The God Delusion' is like for a positive number in the set of negative numbers and zero.  So, what are your personal beliefs? What do you positively believe in, as opposed to what you lack belief in (atheism)?   I enjoy reading books by Peter Singer and A.C. Grayling, for instance, because they're not books writing focussing on ""god doesn't exist and religion is bad"". They write books focussed on how to live a better life, and how we might find morality for ourselves. For example, I recently read A.C. Grayling's 'The God Argument'. I skipped the first half, entitled ""Against Religion"", for obvious reasons. However, I loved the second half, entitled ""For Humanism"", because I found it outlined my personal beliefs almost perfectly. Similarly, I like Peter Singer's 'Practical Ethics' and 'How Are We To Live' because they outline positive approaches to morality rather than being negative attacks against religion (although, I have to confess, I do disagree with some of Singer's ethical stances).  So, rather than reading anti-religion treatises and hoping to find something positive in what are essentially negative attacks, I prefer to look for positively focussed books that try to teach an affirmative philosophy."

The government answered by trying to claiming that atheism was a religion and that the group should receive the same tax breaks.   At that time I claimed that means the country can no longer use ""In God we Trust"" as our motto or include ""under God"" in the pledge.  It's my understanding that the federal government skirts the establishment clause in those cases by claiming that ""God"" can refer to any religion's God and therefore the reference is not favoring one religion over another. However, if the federal government acknowledges that humanism or other forms of atheism are religions, they can no longer claim that ""God"" applies to all religions.   This case further proves my point, and while I have no hope that our politicians will admit their hypocrisy, I will continue to make this argument as loud as I possibly can."

So, armed with that knowledge, we should live our lives as best we can to make the short time we have here as pleasant for ourselves and others as possible.

humanism,2jexsf,InsomniacDuck,1 point,Thu Oct 16 14:34:39 2014 UTC,"Sure, life has no inherent meaning, but in the words of Liam Lynch: ""Whatever!"".  For most, the human experience isn't one of bliss and euphoria at every corner, but neither is it constant pain and anguish. For most of us, it draws somewhere in the grey shades inbetwixt the two.  Every generation seems to have a set of major problems that different people in different communities with different skills and talents deal with. The ones we can't quite seem to fix just yet, we often pass on to future generations.  IMO, not to fix a universal purpose but to recommend one (possibly alongside others too of course), a big part of life is finding one's skills and talents, and contributing towards making life that bit better.  Speaking to a lonely person, to an elderly person, or simply someone completely new can brighten their day, and widen one's understanding of the world, for example.  Giving clean, dry socks to homeless people, giving some packets and tins of food to a food bank, or volunteering at a charity - it's simple things like these which can have a huge impact on improving the world, one small step at a time.  Sure, there may be no point inherent to the world, nor any divine motivation to improve life for people, but knowing that the world is better than before you existed because of your actions is, at least for myself, a pleasant thought."

humanism,2j65qq,snusmumrikan,1 point,Mon Oct 27 00:46:59 2014 UTC,"I think it's not typical, but generation has something to do with it, and the internet, and the ongoing wars.   Most folks coming into teaching today - younger teachers - have always had communication on the level we have now, have had wikipedia for a long time. Critical thinking and assessment of information is extremely necessary and practiced routinely. Most folks over 35-40, the older teachers, grew up with the textbook and whatever they checked out of the library. There was no internet. All the resources were vetted beforehand and while there was some critical assessment of data, it was nothing like on the level we have now, or the ease of access. Fact checking an assertion could take months, not minutes.   Those history textbooks were often biased, definitely sanitized, and definitely, definitely written from a white eurocentric perspective. I got a lot of history of England and not so much history of China. We got a lot of pilgrims and Spanish, not a lot of native perspectives. How do you tell a 10 year old that our nation was founded on a slaughterhouse? You tapdance like crazy. Older textbooks were Sammy Davis Junior. But - even then, they were trying to correct themselves, trying to be more honest. They admitted a lot, they definitely tried, but they just weren't very good at it.   And unless you have a strong interest in personal education - which a lot of teachers don't actually have - most folks of that older age haven't updated either their personal mental information or their basic assumptions about history since they were in class. That older data is the basic model they're running on and they feel it works fine for them to survive in this society.   So on the older generation you have a childhood ideal of the US which is currently reinforced by one of our social self-correcting things: we were horrible to soldiers who were drafted during Vietnam. So we're determined to be supportive now, which is being reinforced in turn by the fact that we actually got attacked back in 2001, which Vietnam never had happen. All that means the older generation is currently Patriotic as anything. And it's not a bad thing, to be patriotic. If you base your patriotic ideals on the US as a nation in constant internal reinvention and a struggle to become more ethical, more moral, in a changing world - if you see the revolutionaries and the people who fought to have a voice in our society, and the changes they've wrought - it's amazing. Our culture has issues, but it's pretty dang cool in a lot of ways.   But a part of the older generation resists anything which could ""tarnish"" our image, as they mistake image for actuality. They have this notion that we're somehow seen as The Good Nation by other nations - not terribly realistic, but as kids we were all taught that we were the land of opportunity, that everyone wanted to live here. And as we love our nation so we want our children to feel that same uncomplicated love, and not have anything interfere with it.   We're not unique in this. We might be unique in the extent to which we're willing to speak freely about it, but other nations have an equally horrible history, and they face the same struggle. How do you think Japan feels about their roles in World War 2? I've heard Japanese adults are horrified when they're first exposed to their own country's actions. I don't know how Germany treats the same subject matter; I do know that Australia is struggling with white/indigenous history. I don't know how Russia feels about their own history, the gulags, the wholesale slaughter of the Jewish people in a lot of parts of the country. China still has serious issues today and it's a safe bet they don't teach that their suppression of dissident voices is a negative thing...   It's happening all over the world, as nations discover dark parts of their own history are freely available in wikipedia, and we develop empathy for others besides ourselves."

It's a bit long but I've done some work/research in the area and like to ramble. These are UK based thoughts:  Many/most NHS hospitals (but to my knowledge zero private hospitals) employ chaplains. These people are from numerous religious denominations but mostly, of course, Christian. Various groups in the UK (the National Secular Society (NSS), the British Humanist Association (BHA)) campaign to have the state funding of chaplains removed citing the cost (~£29m per annum a few years back) in wages alone would fund a shed load of nurses etc.  I have several issues state funded chaplains: they are generally paid an awful lot of money (generally ~£45k per year iirc: average UK wage is £24k I think); they do not need any formal qualifications in counselling or psychology etc.; but they must be ordained in a religion of some kind. In the last regard there, it is therefore impossible for a non-religious person (i.e. humanist) to be a paid chaplain on the NHS. Some people think that that's obvious and fair, but I really don't think it is at all.  NHS chaplains claim to the be there for ""everyone"" - even though they are only just now changing their core aims/policy to make this clear (they've been claiming it for years) - no matter what religion/non-religion, background etc. However the number of chaplains in NHS hospitals doesn't reflect the continuing decline in religion in the UK, nor the lack of religiosity among the public in general. Beyond that, the argument that they are there to serve everyone is undermined by their not having to have qualifications with regard to counselling etc. Also there is a case of discrimination against non-religious people who might feel the same 'calling' (e.g. Humanists) but are barred from the post because they are not ordained in a recognised religion.  I think many who do not agree with the NSS assume that they are calling for these chaplains to be removed from hospitals: not so, the campaign is to have state funding removed, not that chaplains should be kicked out. Some people might argue that it amounts to the same thing, but I don't think so: There are very many volunteer chaplains in UK hospitals, as well as those who are paid. The core of the NSS argument is: If religious groups want to have religious 'officials' on hand then the religious groups should pay for those religious officials.  As it stands I've only ever heard of there being one humanist chaplain in a UK hospital and that person is a volunteer, receiving not a penny from the hospital or the state. The fact that there is a volunteer humanist chaplain undermines any argument presented for the paid posts being exclusively for religious people. Ignoring the issue of their being paid in the first place, of course.  edit - correction"

I am not one for church services at all so I was just taking her for an example of a non religious church since she craves that setting. To me it was exactly what I would imagine a cut and dry church experience to be. They sang a few songs and the sermons were basically picked and chosen from different religions and philosophies (basically all the good stuff). There was about 60 people attending most of which were older. There were no younger adults only middle aged couples with children. The children were taken outside to do a separate event that had the subjects covered in the weekly flyer thing they handed out when you walked in. At the time we had no children, I was very bored considering I have no want or need for any church type setting. My wife found it lacking in the type of church like setting she wants. She is basically deist now (and at the time) and really wants the experience she gets from regular Christian church without the dogma. She did attend a few different churches with her friends most of which were evangelical. The only reason I would have liked to continue going was for the social justice people that were set up outside.  I think someone should develop and open a place where people can get together and have discussion topics rather than sermons. Since it would only be for 1-2 days a week maybe do an hour of open discussion and have the topics chosen the week before then maybe have a guest speaker or debate. You could even have another open forum after the speaker/debate. I would also set it up more like a lounge instead of pews. This would encourage people to socialize more.

Pretty much, yeah. :)   EDIT: I can already imagine some of you wanting to respond that, ""no Humanism is a community based on reason, it is a community based on anti-religion, etc...""   Reason? Yes, that's mostly true. Anti-religion? ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Those aspects of religion that harm people are certainly reviled, for that very reason, but those aspects that benefit people are celebrated! This is true in general, not just in the case of religion.  It's also worth noting that Religious Humanism is a thing, and that although Secular Humanism is now the predominant form (owing to the strong appreciation for reason), it's history owes much to earlier Christian Humanism. To this day, Humanism is still strongly associated by many with modern western Catholicism."
humanism,2i174z,OmicronNine,2,Thu Oct 2 07:35:47 2014 UTC,Christianity would claim everything written on that sidebar.

The same goes for a goal such as ""do good.""  After all, religious people tend to think they're doing good, even though some of the things they do seem quite the opposite from a humanist perspective.    We have to be able to describe the humanist idea of doing good, and why it's preferable to certain religious ideas of doing good that we disagree with.

Your last link observes that ""These ideas have not seen widespread acceptance by the scientific community, have been disputed by philosophers, and continue to generate public controversy.""   The reason for that is because the ideas in question are refuted by basic philosophy.  Here's a page which summarizes some of the limits of science in principle: http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/whatisscience_12  This is from Berkeley University's primer on ""Understanding Science"".  The reason it's taught at that introductory level is precisely to try and avoid the kind of misunderstanding of the role and limits of science that you're currently exhibiting.    Talking about what science is not able to do ""yet"" also underscores the point that we need to be able to make some decisions without a scientific determination of the answer.   Why?   What else are we going to do, if science can't ""yet"" provide the answer?  Especially in cases where philosophical reasoning tells us that science can never provide a single objective answer to certain questions?   And has lead, via it's own path of development, to what we now call the scientific method, the only philosophy we have for objectively finding truth.   The clue to the problem here is in that word ""objectively"".  Science doesn't allow us to find objective answers to fundamentally subjective questions.  The page I linked above might help you think about this: consider the related point, ""science doesn't make aesthetic judgments.""  Do you think that in future, science will be able to tell us which art is objectively better than which other art?  When you understand why the answer to that question is ""no"", it may help you understand why the same answer applies to morality.  Science helps us find objective truths about the external universe.  We observe the universe, and develop models which contain laws that reflect the observed behaviors.  But morality, and many other things that humans are interested in, are not properties of the external universe in the same way that, say, atoms and planets are.  Of course, you can point out that human mental constructs are (probably) merely ultimately arrangements of atoms, and thus can be analyzed scientifically.  But in that case, some future science might analyze what moral positions people hold, but it cannot tell you what positions they should hold, unless we somehow discover moral equivalents of, say, the laws of gravity.  Currently, we have no hint that such laws might exist, and no reason to think that they could.  And if they did exist, how would it be possible for people to violate them?  They are fundamentally different from the laws of physics, and a bit of serious philosophical thought makes this clear."

humanism,2i174z,DebianRandomCat,1 point,Fri Oct 3 05:40:53 2014 UTC,"Yes. It makes me think that the ""creed"" of humanism should really be a declaration of quantifiable, peer reviewed human traits. Once the humanist understands what being a human really entails on a fundamental level s/he is free to do what s/he wishes with that information.  This would represent a significant break from say, Christianity, which asks its devotees to believe in nonsense as a central creed, which naturally leads to a distorted social structure.   Ideally, understanding the reality of human existence will allow a humanist to make the most informed decisions concerning his or her self and others.   I think that the humanist creed as it stands does not represent a significant enough break from organized religion, and is highly informed by contemporary beliefs and values as apposed to irrefutable human traits.  I do not know what such a humanist creed would look like, perhaps something like: Human beings are evolved organisms.... It is human nature to be accepted by his or her peers, etc... etc... Ideally the creed would actually be a blueprint of the human condition on as detailed a level as possible..."

This seems to be the kind of attitude that gave rise to antihumanism and post-modern/post-structuralist criticisms of humanism.  I say this as someone who's pretty sympathetic to secular humanism, but taking humanism seriously means taking criticisms of humanism seriously.  I don't believe you can solve fundamentally philosophical problems of political legitimacy just by quantifying things. That's not to say that there's no role for rigorous science in working out what a humanist politics would look like, but the question of human experience certainly can't be reduced to a problem of peer-reviewed human traits.  Not only is it philosophically problematic, it's prone to some political abuse as well. For example, hypothetically a 'quantifiable, peer reviews' study of human traits conducted prior to the rise of modern democracies could, in good faith, claim that hereditary monarchies are the most natural politics of humans, and therefore modern nation states are ""a distorted social structure."""

I don't disagree with you, just the way you have phrased your criticism. Some of those you proposed definitely have had more of an influence than those featured."

You remove one physicist, two science fiction authors and one science popularizer. That gives you tons of room to put in women, authors, poets, psychologists, etc. A secularizing philosopher like Bertrand Russell? Hume? Singer?  The mix in the first 10 is kind of weird."

humanism,2hcdg4,plo83,7,Wed Sep 24 16:39:05 2014 UTC,"I call myself an Egalitarian, though there is some overlap between my own beliefs and those that might be called 'liberal feminist'   People should be able to pursue whatever career or lifestyle they so choose, so long as it doesn't harm others without their sober consent.   This is regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, whatever.   There are traditions and social expectations that, whilst some were perhaps appropriate with certain economic systems, are now obsolete, and their presence in society is a vestige of an old way of life. These have effects on both male and female, and as such stand in the way of someone pursuing a lifestyle that goes against their expected gender role (eg. stay-at home husband, career advancing-wife). An important distinction ought to be made, however, in that roles shouldn't merely be reversed in what's expected of genders (eg going from male 'breadwinner' and female 'homemaker' to male 'homemaker' and female 'breadwinner'), but rather gender shouldn't play a part in which roles a person plays in a family, but rather pragmatic solutions based upon each member's merits ought to be standard. Every human being should have the opportunity for self-fulfilment, through education, working, raising a family, or creating art to name a few, and these shouldn't be withheld on arbitrary bases that have, unfortunately, been the case in the past (In the developed world), for example, preventing women from voting until the early 20th century (1898 for New Zealand IIRC though), preventing homosexuals from having romances legally until the middle of the 20th century (Much earlier for France IIRC though), or racial discrimination, written into US law up until the 1960s (and unfortunately still present implicitly in many places). As Humanists, it follows that if one professes to uphold Humanist values, then it is our duty to push for equality and human fulfilment and progress  in parts of the world that have yet to achieve égalité, some half the world away, others possibly on our figurative doorstep."

humanism,2hcdg4,RobToe,4,Thu Sep 25 06:54:53 2014 UTC,"It's normal that they overlap.  That's because liberal feminism and especially the modern liberal feminism also often called equality feminism is not only about women.  Yes, it started as a cause only for women.  There has been some man-hating in it.  Mind you, women were so mistreated that it's hard to blame them but it's also hard to blame the men when they were just following the ''societal rules'' of their era.  Now, what we're realizing is that feminism cannot only be about women.  I know that the term may have burnt many bridges with men and I am deeply saddened about this.  Truly!  I'm a man.  I know all about our societal issues as well.  I would not join a cause that promoted man-hating or only one side.  This is really about making it better for both sides.

Nope, even the ones I dislike I wouldn't wish death upon)"
humanism,2hcdg4,RobToe,2,Thu Sep 25 06:51:44 2014 UTC,That's why you don't learn about Feminism from people on the internet. You learn from people with degrees in gender studies and people who spear headed the movement.
humanism,2hcdg4,zariteal,2,Thu Oct 9 08:16:14 2014 UTC,"Aye, my views on radical feminism are taken in part from studying them (and the feminist ideology as a whole) in sociology. They're the kind who advocate women living completely segregated from males, and using artificial fertilisation methods so women don't even need men for reproduction. (Also often includes enforced lesbianism, which reminds me of one of those ""Pray the Gay Away"" type programmes there seem to be in the US switched around, but instead of forcing people to act heterosexual when they're usually homosexual or bisexual, they'd force females to be homosexual when they may be heterosexual or bisexual, for example)  This is opposed to the Liberal Feminists who are effectively indistinguishable from Egalitarians in their concern for men and women and how to stop unnecessary traditionalist values (For example, I had my nails painted by some of my friends at college, but a teacher made me remove it because ""You're a young man"" and ""Only women should paint their nails."" when it's a fairly inconsequential action in itself, applying paint to a body part. It should either be anyone can wear nail paint, regardless of gender, or no one can. I'd much prefer the former option though.)  As for Tumblr pseudo-Feminists, they have largely hijacked the label and have been the ones spear-heading it into the mainstream media, as well as YouTube. They're the ones perverting the movement to a quasi-radical feminist agenda, often blaming the entire male gender for women's issues, and ignoring the crap that happens to men too (Eg. the fact that men can be raped, and many people often say they should have wanted it; imagine if that was reversed?! They'd seem like right scum bags! The fact that male genital mutilation, or involuntary circumcision, is common practice in countries like the USA, or that in many nations military conscription is limited to solely males (Either have conscription for both, or more preferably conscription for neither.).  A particular example one remembers, is how an Egalitarian conference at a Canadian university was halted by Feminist campaigners setting off a fire alarm, and then proceeding to harass and swear at participants of the conference.  Whether or not these cretins are a large proportion of the group calling themselves 'Feminist', they certainly have a larger presence than Egalitarian ones, and thus it's vital that a clear distinction is made between those of us who truly desire equality, and want no unfair treatment on the basis of gender, amongst other characteristics, and those use claim to want equality when instead they use the feminist label as a pass for misanthropic rhetoric.  They make the likes of myself disinclined to associate with the movement and its name, but perhaps more crucially also gives ammunition to reactionaries who'd love to paint a picture of 'Feminazis' when people campaign for equality. They'd love to discourage people from advocating equality by making it seem as though 'equality campaigner' is an ironic by-word for bigoted hate group."

You say they don't have to advocate for inequality in selective services, but it seems you're making the accusation that that is what feminists are doing by negative proof.   I see people talking about it, but in a way that it's beside the point when there's still such a strong voice against women serving in the first place.     But do you honestly think that the next step will be to add women to selective service? Fuck no -- because it doesn't benefit women.    Woah, that is assuming A LOT, isn't it? I honestly think there is no reason to think it wouldn't be the next step. Counting on it being legitimate to assume that feminists and women will only ever be self-serving in their activisms is a tad ham-fisted, no? These conclusions drawn from little else than prejudices are worth ignoring, in my opinion.    They certainly support women being integrated into the military better    They do? Where?"
humanism,2hcdg4,raoulraoul153,1 point,Thu Sep 25 01:56:20 2014 UTC,"Feminism is not egalitarianism. No more than MRA is.   Feminism is a broad church, so to speak. As /u/plo83 says here and here, a lot of people who'd fit liberal/modern liberal/probably other types I don't know because I never studied feminist theory feminism have pretty much identical conceptual grounding as someone who'd call themselves an egalitarian. And the Emma Watson speech is certainly impossible to distinguish from an egalitarian stance.  Luckily, I've had very little-to-no experience of the non-egalitarian feminist people hate - pretty much everyone I've know who'd call themselves a feminist has been indistinguishable from an egalitarian except possibly on grounds of how they spent their time acting on the concepts. What volunteer work/demoing/whatever they did was more likely to be on women's issues. Probably the generation I'm from. It seems great that men's issues are getting more airtime these days, and stuff like the watson speech is definitely symbolic of how I see feminism going - encompassing more men's issues that result from sexist attitudes (in gestures like speeches and in actual support for groups/causes doing things for men that feminism has traditionally tried to do for women) whilst attempting not to lose focus on the issues that still face women or to let the whole thing devolve into a versusgender clusterfuck where each side complains about the other not being attentive enough to their own issues whilst ignoring the other's."
humanism,2hcdg4,raoulraoul153,1 point,Thu Sep 25 02:01:50 2014 UTC,"Now, I'm not saying you can't be both, but I am saying that if you WANT to be both for some reason, you have to ignore bits of feminism, and have a sort of ""pigs are more equal"" view of gender.   Why have you got this monolithic concept of feminism? It's not a religion. The article you quote even mentions feminists criticising gender attitudes that treat men as unable to assume a 'weak' role as the victim of abuse.  The core tenent of feminism is that women are equal to men. Women = Men is the same as Men = Women. As I, the OP and hopefully other people have pointed out, some feminists have always recognised that, and currently many, many feminists who could be classified into groups I'm told are modern/liberal feminism recognise it and are vocal about making sure people realise that.   Any kind of man-hating or neglect for men's issues is a stance some feminists take that isn't binding on everyone who declares themselves a feminist. Historically, the reasons it was called feminism and not egalitarianism in the first place are obvious - where and when feminism originated, women were systematically and legally oppressed in ways that some of the world has thankfully gotten rid of.   On HeforShe - I wasn't previously aware of the movement itself apart from something connected to Watson's speech (I figured it was just a catchy phrase to use for a hashtag). Having looked at it, I can see where you're coming from, and it's more clear to me why Watson was stressing that feminism doesn't mean anti-men in her speech. She's launching a feminist campaign to help women and girls all over the world (obviously including areas where patriarchical attitudes are vastly more prevelant than the west), so making sure people know that such things don't have to be a conceptual zero-sum game is a good thing.   In a limited slice of the world, though, they do have to be zero-sum games. Although many issues affect men and women, some predominatly/only affect one or the other, or tend to affect them in different ways or for different reasons. If you want to work on all the problems both genders have, sometimes you have to concentrate on one or a few problems that just one gender is having. So I can't see any reason why a campaign for ending violence against women and girls is wrong in and of itself.   However, as I said, I see where you're coming from - there certainly has been historically huge neglect of many issues men face, and the extent to which they suffer because they are not thought of as victims of any kind of abuse (and/or a general expectation of stoicism) has got to rank amongst the worst. More visibility for these ideas would be great, and they're certainly still marginalised (although it does seem to be eroding).   This seems to be getting long, so I'll try to wrap it up breifly - the article cites 'mainstream feminism', but this kind of thing is extremely difficult to categorise, and the times article certainly doesn't substantiate that kind of difficult claim, and when I followed the links, all of them seemed significantly more nuanced than the Times article was making out. Just to take the last example;   I think what Jimi was trying to say was not necessarily that men should not participate but that men should not try to bark up, chime in, etc. - shut up, sit back and listen.    It's not a general, at-all-times exclusion or silencing order, it's a (fairly forceful, granted) request to be heard out.   tl;dr so much of this kind of thing seems to turn on he-says-she-says (appropriate?); people accuse groups of things and cite examples of people who belong to those groups, which are in turn used by other people in other groups as examples of why that group is a problem...seems like one of the problems is taking individuals as representative of entire groups of people.

You're marginalising the people in this thread that you've mentioned talking to, who are espousing a kind of feminism that's indistinguishable from the egalitarianism you espouse in favour of a contextless sign and a times article that didn't link a singe thing I read in a simplistic, contextless or misinterpreted manner.    And you didn't really answer my primary point which was that the organization and movement that is being supported here very very specifically states that they're working toward issues faced ""by women and girls"", and not by men, regardless of what emma herself said.    I felt I addressed this very directly. As I said, I don't have a very solid stance on the merits of this kind of campaign as opposed to one explicitly addressing itself towards all genders (through lack of knowledge about how they'd fare). However, as I also said, it doesn't seem at all unreasonable that, given the way different issues can affect men and women, there should be some campaigns that seek to address specific issues that may focus only on one gender, for practical reasons of there being no better way to solve that particular problem."

And by definition, feminist equalists or equality feminism was around before egalitarianism.  However, it's now evolved to the point of understanding that it cannot be about getting women the same rights only but that it needs to be conscious of men's rights as well.  That we share this planet and that we need to be conscious of one another.  Here's a small example: Man is told to not cry.  ''Men don't cry''.  Holds it in.  Hold it in....  Time passes.  He was raped.  Holds it in.  Gets married and beats his wife to let out his hurt.    Had he been told, it's OK to express your emotions.  You will not be seen as any of a lesser man, maybe and likely, this would of been avoided.  He would of gotten help and moved on.  Sadly, some people find male rape a) funny b) impossible to happen c) every guy wants sex how could they be raped?....And our society also laughs at men who cry.  There is more acceptance now about men showing their feelings but we know it's far from being where it needs to be.  So this form of feminism shows these problems as well.  Yes, it's going to help women in the end.  Is that such a bad outcome?  Helping men helps women.  I don't see the bad in it."

Their issues ARE included.  As a humanitarian and as a feminist, I'm certainly not going to fight for women to be in the conscription when I think that men shouldn't be there to begin with.  I think that we need to fight to end it for men as well!  The right to a life free of violence is not dictated by your gender.  If you want to join the army, so be it.  You shouldn't be FORCED no matter what your gender is.  This might be cliche but ''no means no''.  Modern equality feminism doesn't want you to be conscripted as a man.  Not one bit.

However, aspects of feminism are includes in egalitarianism and humanism.  Not all aspects for sure but you have to agree to defend women if you're an egalitarianist.  You are therefore, one part feminist.  You are many other positive things.  You're anti-racism, you're anti-homophobia, you're anti-agism...  Feminism is just a small part of the pie.

humanism,2hcdg4,sahuxley,1 point,Thu Sep 25 10:52:50 2014 UTC,"With all due respect, it really doesn't seem like you're using a very good definition of feminism, and possibly not even a very good definition of humanism. Especially since the American Humanist Association has had a feminist caucus since 1977.   When you actively participate in a movement that actively seeks rights for only one group in a mostly binary set, you are guaranteed to cause inequality in your so-called search for equality. If you then put on a hat that says ""humanist"" but continue to only fight for ""feminist""-relevant issues, I would say that it doesn't make you any more egalitarian than before.    Look, this simply isn't true. In fact issue with this form of thinking is why many of these groups developed their own movements in the first place.  Political movements like feminism (which is really a variety of political movements which share a contested intellectual and political history), anti-colonial movements, various kinds of nationalisms, LGBT activism, etc. are not incompatible with humanism. Humanism, in the barest sense and historical sense, was/is an attempt to recentre the foundations and discussion of politics, religion, ethics, etc. around the notion of human experience.    Often this tends to go with a notion of a kind of universal human experience - for better or worse, since this idea is fairly contested. Regardless of our stance on the idea of a universal human experience, the idea of humanism doesn't deny that human existence is highly diverse.  The humanist branches of these various political movements represent attempts to approach that general humanist goal, or work within the philosophical framework of humanism, by addressing first the most salient and urgent needs of their respective communities. They do not represent an abandonment of an interest in human welfare generally, or seeking an advantage over some kind of universal human interest.  You seem to be imposing a kind of zero-sum mentality that simply isn't there. In what way does a anti-colonial labour activist, or a feminist critic of human trafficking, or an atheist activist in places like South East Asia, for example, by beginning with their individual experiences, by working on the problems most urgent for their communities,  deny the general project of equal rights?"
humanism,2hcdg4,thirdseason111,1 point,Thu Sep 25 16:51:20 2014 UTC,"You'll have to forgive my short reply, I'm supposed to be AFK.   That is why I say that feminism is as feminism does, and that is where my definition of it comes from.    Again, you'll have to forgive my bluntness here but this is not what you are doing. Feminists have worked on men's issues in the past, and they have done so within a humanist framework. Feminist activism on behalf of LGBT people on the issue of Aids/HIV - which affects gay/bisexual men in greater proportion than lesbian/bisexual women - is an example of this (unless you're going to argue that the issues of LGBT men aren't somehow real men's issues).  When you say that you define feminism by what it does, and at the same time completely ignore the variety of responses that different kinds of feminism towards men's issues, you are simply defining feminism as stuff that you don't like. That would be the equivalent of me saying something like: MRAs I've met are impolite (they aren't, but let's use it as an example), therefore polite MRAs are not really MRAs.   It's literally an example of a No True Scotsman fallacy!  Look, I'm not saying you can't be critical of how feminist politics has dealt with men's isues. I actually have some interest in that area. But suggesting that feminism is only ever those issues to the point of suggesting that feminist and humanism are incompatible is not 'defining feminism by what it does' - it's just intellectually dishonest.  Regarding your second point - again you'll have to forgive the brevity of my reply. You raise some legitimate issues but in away which is deeply problematic; I'd argue that you've even raised them in a way which is incompatible with humanism.  What you've done is essentially take your own social position as universal. As a result you've essentially argued, unintentionally, that when a group tries to address their own urgent needs, without immediately appealing to you needs as well, they have somehow betrayed equality.  I'll grant that there are some issues with this - I have some criticisms of this as well - but your account of things makes it so that no other politics except for yours authentic because your own interests are defined as 'universal' whereas everyone else is merely parochial because it isn't centered around you. Surely you can see the problem with this?   I don't have any reason to assume that this is what you intend. Rather, it really seems like you don't entirely understand the argument that you are making.  Also, I'm not certain where you are but I'm not aware of firefighters who have been hired and can't actually do their job. That's a bit of an odd example to raise."

I think women are more important to maintaining population when a catastrophic number of people are dying.  Since our involvement in the birthing process is much more limited, we are more expendable.  The other side of that is that employers know men aren't going to take a maternity leave and often discriminate because of it, so it's a trade-off.  This discrimination is unfair, but economically justifiable.  I think equality is a good goal, but it becomes counter-productive to deny our differences and gender roles simply for equality's sake."
humanism,2hcdg4,butts_are_good_24,1 point,Thu Sep 25 01:58:08 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I see what you're saying, but I think it's a little archaic of a view because we are overpopulated. It's pretty clear that we don't have enough food and resources as it is, so I don't see a necessity in not conscripting women. Maybe if humanity was under collapse, but we have exponential growth. I also think the maternity thing is unfair, because again, not all women are going to have children, especially in the US, so that generalization shouldn't exist. That being said, I also think men should get paternity leave. They are suffering from lack of sleep and getting used to having a child around which places just as much burden and stress on them as it does for the mother.  I think gender roles do have a place in our lives, but it should be a choice for each individual and not for society as a whole to decide."
humanism,2hcdg4,zariteal,1 point,Wed Sep 24 22:54:37 2014 UTC,"I completely agree about our current overpopulation, but the time when conscription would be necessary may very well be when society is under collapse, or if we're losing a war badly.  The employer discrimination is definitely unfair, and that affects women every day, unlike conscription.  A lot of progressive countries do provide paternity leave, which balances that out since an employer has an equal expectation for men to take time off work."
humanism,2hcdg4,zariteal,5,Wed Sep 24 23:57:50 2014 UTC,"I'm Canadian so I'm not 100% familiar with it but there are nations who are sadly known to go to war more often than others.  The issue here isn't so much who's forced to enter the army or who isn't.  It's the war itself.  If there's no war, there's no forcing someone into the army.  And yes, I know that it's not THAT simple.  It's the big picture only.  Still, look at the Swiss.  Didn't they just celebrate 175 years of peace or something like that?  Most wars are about money or power.  There's a few people that profit from it.  They lie to the masses to make us feel like it's our duty to go to war.  Look at Bush and how he used the words: ''terror'', ''terrorist'' ''terrorism'' ''weapons of mass destruction'' and those ''orange alerts''.  It's normal to be scared.  People were extremely emotional at the time and he used that to make the USA once again go in so a few people would profit.  Lives mean nothing to this man.  There are many people like him.  There is a warrant arrest for him, the queen of England, Pope Benedict and many important people by a tribunal of the world (for charges of crimes against humanity).  It's legal...But who's going to arrest them?  How do the logistics of this work?  All of them are 100% free still and the likelihood of any of them ever have to respond for any of their crimes are 0%.  So in the end, conscription isn't really the deep issue.  It's how they are allowed to abuse it to begin with.  It's war. 99% of wars are not necessary.  Things can be talked over.  Look at Israel and Palestine...When asked what they are fighting over, the youth do not really know...they just know that the other side is evil.  Yet it goes on and on."

Also, when it becomes clear that the war is a sham or not working/pointless, there should be a pulling out that is much faster.  How long ago did people start talking about Iraq and how pointless it was?  How long ago did they pull out or agreed to?  It disgusts me that ''leaders'' have such little consideration for human lives that $$ is more important to them than an actual human being.  We could live war-free if we really tried.  Sadly, it's not likely to work out the way that our society is made at the moment.  Money means greed and greed and war go hand in hand.  Or at least greed and pain."

I would be pleasantly surprised if that happened in my lifetime. Discrimination against women is everywhere. Equal pay for equal work would be a good start, but we haven't even got that far yet.  Humanism is a whole different kettle of fish. To me, it's about answering the question of where goodness comes from. Atheism answers that question with ""Not religion!""

Joseph Gordon-Levitt has started a discussion on why some people prefer the term humanist over feminist.   Personally I just don't think feminism is effective, I don't think it practice what it preaches, I do think it enables a lot of extremism and hypocrisy.   I was very taken aback by Joseph Gordon-Levett attitude of acting as if he know what he was talking about with the definition of humanism. Clearly he did a quick Google search and thinks he knows all about humanism from one definition.   So what does humanism truly mean to you?"

humanism,2h5pb3,Shainsworth,3,Mon Sep 22 20:27:41 2014 UTC,"Very well ...  You can't just look up the definition of ""humanism"" and say this is what it is and this is what it is not. It is a philosophy that has evolved over time.   Yes it is partially about putting a stronger focus on humanity over supernatural affairs. It also about promoting equality, believing in the progression of humanity for a better life etc.   He obviously came across is a very narrow definition on Google or Wikipedia. Humanism is far broader than this  In fact there are actually plenty of spiritual persons who would regard themselves as humanists also. Some people think its an atheist only club, its not.  And this ""mis-practice"" of feminism is no different from a person saying someone is an untrue muslim or untrue Christian. Yet both of these religions promote discrimination all across the board. Just because a system of ideas says one thing, doesn't meant those are the ideas that are necessarily put into practice.   A lot of feminists do vilify men, and do seek out to get more rights then men. Feminists only focus on female domestic violence while ignoring male domestic violence. I have never heard of a feistiest person or organisation speaking out against gender discrimination against men (there are lots of cases where men are victims of gender discrimination)  Example when families separate, the woman gets more superior rights to the child. Do feminists fight against that? If they do, its rather on heard of.   So there you go, they are a group of vast double standards."

It's become taboo to question any social justice movement and its ridiculous. Regardless of your idea of humanism one thing we should be able to agree on is its emphasis on rationality. How can it be expected to not turn that rationality on something purely because its ideals are ""good"".   The reason I feel so often humanism is suggested instead of feminism is that it emphasises that the movement is for ALL humans, regardless of race, religion and gender! I am an absolute egalitarian, but man, my instant reaction to some of the terminology used in feminism is anger. I immediately recognise that I am wrong to feel that way as it's a description of the world as they see it and part of the feminist philosphy is just how important identity and the individual experience matters. So I pause, realise they are seeing the world differently and let it go. But there are those out there who aren't as rational or willing to self reflect and their first instinct is to be offended, and that's what they will remain."

Anyway you do have a point with the rest of your resonse, so I'll give you an upvote.   You make an excellent point here, humanism is about progression of rights for ALL humans, and not one single group. This why I don't even call myself a gay rights activist (and I am gay). I am humanist.   But to repeat what I said in response to others, I do not argue that all feminists are extremists. But even the non-radicals have inconsistencies. Very few feminists will fight against men who are denied jobs because the job they go for is ""more of a woman's job"", or a man is given lesser custody rights for his chidden after a divorce or separation, or a man is given more expensive car insurance (just because he is a man), or when a men is not taken seriously when he is a victim of domestic abuse (he does happen).

humanism,2h5pb3,DSchmitt,1 point,Wed Sep 24 23:03:14 2014 UTC,"Firstly, I think you need to consider the context in which Joseph-Gordon Levitt is making his comment. People are saying that the word ""feminist"" is not appropriate because it focusses only on a lack of equal rights for women: they have therefore created a new word, ""human-ist"", to portray the idea that we should give equal rights to all humans. Yes, I said this is a new word. In this context, people are creating the word ""human-ist"" as a contrast to ""femin-ist"".   So, Gordon-Levitt is stepping in to say ""Hold on, folks! The word 'humanist' already exists, and it doesn't mean what you think it means. It refers to a philosophy that's been around since the Renaissance, which is basically about prioritising humanity over the divine or supernatural."" He's explaining that this word which people think they've made up already exists, and already has a meaning which is different to what they think it is.  It would be like someone saying they're going to create a new word to describe a big piece of wood with hooks on it to hold your keys: it's a board for holding keys, so it's a ""key-board"" or ""keyboard"". Then someone points out that the word ""keyboard"" already exists, and it means something different to that.   So, there's that to consider: Joseph Gordon-Levitt is merely trying to point out to people who think they've created a new word that ""humanist"" already exists.  As for your concerns about what ""humanism"" means... Gordon-Levitt has quoted the dictionary definition of this word almost word-for-word: humanism is about giving importance to human issues over divine or supernatural issues. There's a whole lot of other stuff that has attached to humanism over the centuries, but that is the basic core of it. It's like describing Christianity as a belief in the divinity of Christ and following Christ's teachings: there is a whole lot of nuance and variation that have grown up around this central definition, but that doesn't stop the central definition being central. And correct."
humanism,2h5pb3,DSchmitt,1 point,Tue Sep 23 21:21:19 2014 UTC,JGL gave a fair definition. Saying you're a humanist instead of a feminist doesn't really make a lot of sense as the two words kind of belong to different academic and historical contexts.  Egalitarianism might be a better substitute if you're the kind of person who has an unhealthy obsession with labels.

humanism,2g6wvb,ganner,4,Fri Sep 12 16:44:46 2014 UTC,"About ""crushing"" Islam:   Reason: We have to crush the world’s 1.5 billion Muslims under our boot? In concrete terms, what does that mean, “defeat Islam”?  Hirsi Ali::  I think that we are at war with Islam. And there’s no middle ground in wars. Islam can be defeated in many ways. For starters, you stop the spread of the ideology itself; at present, there are native Westerners converting to Islam, and they’re the most fanatical sometimes. There is infiltration of Islam in the schools and universities of the West. You stop that. You stop the symbol burning and the effigy burning, and you look them in the eye and flex your muscles and you say, “This is a warning. We won’t accept this anymore.” There comes a moment when you crush your enemy.  Reason::  Militarily?  Hirsi Ali::  In all forms, and if you don’t do that, then you have to live with the consequence of being crushed.  Reason::  Are we really heading toward anything so ominous?  Hirsi Ali::  I think that’s where we’re heading. We’re heading there because the West has been in denial for a long time. It did not respond to the signals that were smaller and easier to take care of. Now we have some choices to make. This is a dilemma: Western civilization is a celebration of life—everybody’s life, even your enemy’s life. So how can you be true to that morality and at the same time defend yourself against a very powerful enemy that seeks to destroy you?   About closing Islamic schools:   Reason: I want my government to protest the Rushdie fatwa. I’m not so sure they ought to diplomatically engage some idiots burning a piece of cloth or a straw figure in the streets of Islamabad. Isn’t there a huge difference between the two?  Hirsi Ali: It’s not just a piece of cloth. It’s a symbol. In a tribal mind-set, if I’m allowed to take something and get away with it, I’ll come back and take some more. In fact, I’ll come and take the whole place, especially since it’s my holy obligation to spread Islam to the outskirts of the earth and I know I’ll be rewarded in heaven. At that point, I’ve only done my religious obligation while you’re still sitting there rationalizing that your own flag is a piece of cloth.  We have to get serious about this. The Egyptian dictatorship would not allow many radical imams to preach in Cairo, but they’re free to preach in giant mosques in London. Why do we allow it?  Reason: You’re in favor of civil liberties, but applied selectively?  Hirsi Ali: No. Asking whether radical preachers ought to be allowed to operate is not hostile to the idea of civil liberties; it’s an attempt to save civil liberties. A nation like this one is based on civil liberties, and we shouldn’t allow any serious threat to them. So Muslim schools in the West, some of which are institutions of fascism that teach innocent kids that Jews are pigs and monkeys—I would say in order to preserve civil liberties, don’t allow such schools.  Reason: In Holland, you wanted to introduce a special permit system for Islamic schools, correct?  Hirsi Ali: I wanted to get rid of them. I wanted to have them all closed, but my party said it wouldn’t fly. Top people in the party privately expressed that they agreed with me, but said, “We won’t get a majority to do that,” so it never went anywhere.  Reason: Well, your proposal went against Article 23 of the Dutch Constitution, which guarantees that religious movements may teach children in religious schools and says the government must pay for this if minimum standards are met. So it couldn’t be done. Would you in fact advocate that again?  Hirsi Ali: Oh, yeah.  Reason: Here in the United States, you’d advocate the abolition of—  Hirsi Ali: All Muslim schools. Close them down. Yeah, that sounds absolutist. I think 10 years ago things were different, but now the jihadi genie is out of the bottle. I’ve been saying this in Australia and in the U.K. and so on, and I get exactly the same arguments: The Constitution doesn’t allow it. But we need to ask where these constitutions came from to start with—what’s the history of Article 23 in the Netherlands, for instance? There were no Muslim schools when the constitution was written. There were no jihadists. They had no idea.  Reason: Do you believe that the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights—documents from more than 200 ago—ought to change?  Hirsi Ali: They’re not infallible. These Western constitutions are products of the Enlightenment. They’re products of reason, and reason dictates that you can only progress when you can analyze the circumstances and act accordingly. So now that we live under different conditions, the threat is different. Constitutions can be adapted, and they are, sometimes. The American Constitution has been amended a number of times. With the Dutch Constitution, I think the latest adaptation was in 1989. Constitutions are not like the Koran—nonnegotiable, never-changing.  Look, in a democracy, it’s like this: I suggest, “Let’s close Muslim schools.” You say, “No, we can’t do it.” The problem that I’m pointing out to you gets bigger and bigger. Then you say, “OK, let’s somehow discourage them,” and still the problem keeps on growing, and in another few years it gets so bad that I belatedly get what I wanted in the first place.  I respect that it needs to happen this way, but there’s a price for the fact that you and I didn’t share these insights earlier, and the longer we wait, the higher the price. In itself the whole process is not a bad thing. People and communities and societies learn through experience. The drawback is, in this case, that “let’s learn from experience” means other people’s lives will be taken.   She says a lot more, and I don't know that I disagree with her on any of these points. Sam Harris gets in trouble for expressing similar sentiments, but I think that both of them are looking at a rising threat very rationally, whereas the people who ignoring it are basing their opinions on wishful thinking."

Many western countries have laws already that prohibit certain types of speech, such as threatening others, planning criminal activities, inciting others to commit criminal activities, etc. Why should religion be allowed to be used to shield such things?  Further, it seems like a bad idea to let people who'd do away with your civil liberties in a heartbeat have free reign to spread their ideology.

humanism,2g6wvb,OmicronNine,1 point,Sat Sep 13 02:11:34 2014 UTC,"...such as threatening others, planning criminal activities, inciting others to commit criminal activities, etc.   That's very different, they are the rare examples of speech that causes harm directly. Besides, those prohibitions already restrict religious speech as well.   Why should religion be allowed to be used to shield such things?   Religion is not being used to shield anything. Individual civil liberties and the principles they are based on are.  Preserving liberties when you agree with what's being said is easy, it's preserving the liberties of those you disagree with that's hard. We do it anyway, because it is right. This is that same old conflict, not something new.   Further, it seems like a bad idea to let people who'd do away with your civil liberties in a heartbeat have free reign to spread their ideology.   You mean Ayaan Hirisi Ali?   It's basically ""tolerancing"" your culture to death.   It has jack all to do with tolerance. That may be the buzz word in Europe, but here in the US it's about one thing and one thing only, and it's the same thing that guarantees the KKK, Neo-Nazis, and the Westboro Baptist Church the freedom to preach their ideology: liberty  You can't ""freedom a culture to death"" if that culture is founded on freedom. The only way to destroy such a culture is to sacrifice freedom, thus ""preserving"" it to death."

Obviously ""freedom"", in the sense that our society is supposedly founded upon, doesn't mean that anyone can do whatever they want without limit. This means that we already find it acceptable to curtail certain ""freedoms"" for the purpose of maintaining a functioning society.  So the discussion really isn't about whether or not sacrificing freedom will destroy our culture.  It's about what freedoms are and are not acceptable.  Or perhaps to word it better, what things should be and should not be permitted in order to maximize the collective freedom for all in society?"
humanism,2g6wvb,Jzadek,-1,Sat Sep 13 04:47:31 2014 UTC,"That was an invitation for you to explain what you think freedom means, not to be a dick.   No it wasn't:    The ability for everyone to do whatever they feel like?    That's a closed-ended, leading question with an implication that I have given little or no thought to my position. You basically called me a fool in a round about way. It's also a straw man in question form (I never said such a thing, but you are implying that I did).  And you now have gone on to fling an insult at me for calling out your poor behavior. Is that really necessary?   Obviously ""freedom"", in the sense that our society is supposedly founded upon, doesn't mean that anyone can do whatever they want without limit.   Obviously. In any serious, respectful discussion, there would be no need to state that at all, because one of the participants would not be using petty pedantry to try and make the other participant out to be a fool.   So the discussion really isn't about whether or not sacrificing freedom will destroy our culture.   Of course it is. That's literally what I said, and is the entire point I am trying to make. How could it not be what we're talking about?  Since you're going to be unnecessarily pedantic about it, though, I will be more clear: The examples you gave where liberties are curtailed are unique, as I pointed out, in that they result in direct harm, by which I mean that they cannot be permitted without the result being infringing on the rights of others. Permitting them to some is actually equivalent to sacrificing the freedom of others.  All rights and liberties have such natural limits, beyond which they become self-contradictory. Consider the right to life. We have a right to not be murdered, but what if somehow it happens that preserving one's life requires that others be murdered? Obviously, that is the natural limit of that right."

humanism,2g6wvb,mildmanneredarmy,3,Sat Sep 13 03:48:28 2014 UTC,"I agree, they're intelligent individuals. Sam Harris, for instance, is a neuroscientist, which isn't a job for the stupid. But it's also not a job where he is ever exposed to any formal education regarding Middle Eastern religio-politics. And yet, Sam Harris feels ready enough to talk about it as if he's got a doctorate in the subject.  Simply put, I don't think he's stupid. I think (and there's no polite way to put this for which I apologise because you've been nothing but civil) he's been blinded by his bigotry. He doesn't like religion, so when a Muslim does something bad, the conclusion that they did it because of Islam, because of the Quran and the Hadiths, appeals to him.  This is not a scientific view, and Harris is a scientist who should know better. So when a Muslim blows himself up in a crowded square, it's because of Islam. It's because of the passages in the Quran that discuss martyrdom. Nevermind the politics of the region. Never mind the bomber's personal experiences that might have led him down that road. Never mind any of the myriad other factors that might cause this Muslim to blow himself up. Never mind that the ideology of Islamism has existed since 1910. It was Islam. Harris likes this answer, so it must be true.  Then you get people who have been trained in Middle Eastern religio-politics. Say, for instance, Robert Pape. Robert Pape looks at the suicide bombing and doesn't decide it must be Islam because of a passage in the Quran. He's a social scientist, and is unsatisfied with such simple answers.  So he collects all the record of every suicide bombing since the 70s, and examines the perpetrators statistically. He finds that far from it being weighted toward the Islamists, suicide bombing is cross-confessional and cross-ideological. In Lebanon, for instance, during the 70s, eight Muslims used suicide tactics. So did three Christians and 27 communists. In Sri Lanka, one of the largest sections in his statistical analysis, it was the Hindu Tamil Tigers who were blowing themselves up.  So why did they blow themselves up? Pape examined it, and found that 90% of suicide bombing campaigns were aimed at forcing a modern liberal democracy to withdraw. He also notes that this actually fits in well with Al-Qaeda's rhetoric, which focusses on the USA as a 'Crusader' - in other words, it is preoccupied with the occupation. In his own words, ""Religion plays a role in suicide terrorism, but mainly in the context of national resistance"". It is not simply what's written in the Quran.  He paints a complex picture built on statistical analysis. Harris's conclusion is based on his own prejudices. Harris doesn't speak Arabic, or have any real training in social sciences. And yet he presumes to understand and distil the motivation of thousands of individuals and dozens of groups into 'Islam'. It is a trite and cartoonish conclusion, and not one which should be respected. And the pattern repeats itself again and again whenever he talks about Islam."

I therefore assume that the question in your submission title is your own question. In which case... of course the label ""atheist"" is worth using! What other word so succinctly describes the situation of not believing in a god or gods? This word is not only worth using, but necessary to use.  The problem is, as the article's actual title implies, that the label ""atheist"" needs to be rehabilitated. It needs to go back to being a simple statement of a non-belief, and not be taken over by the anti-theist crowd. Being an atheist is not the same as being an anti-theist or being anti-religious. That's the problem.   And, even though the article doesn't mention humanism at all, I assume that you're posting this here because you think ""humanism"" could be a suitable replacement for ""atheism""? (I don't know your position, or how you think this article about atheism is connected to humanism, so some input from you would be helpful here.)

[emphasis mine]  It seems that the author believes that ""atheism"" is morally and ethically vacant: it has no statements to make about morality or ethics. It's merely a lack of belief in god(s), and it is strongly represented by militant anti-theists such as Richard Dawkins: ""By allowing more combative atheists to dominate the conversation, we are enabling the perception of atheism as a monolithic anti-theistic movement.""  If you're looking for a social movement based on atheism, I suggest you investigate Atheism+. They even have a subreddit.

humanism,2f89hw,Mizzou_SASHA,3,Tue Sep 2 03:59:05 2014 UTC,"I agree. In the story of the blog, the following also hits home for me:   I [Chris Stedman] didn’t set out to be a blogger, but after writing about being an atheist who works with and respects people of faith in a guest post for a friend’s column, I received a surprising number of responses from other atheists.  A common thread emerged from this feedback: Many of these atheists felt that their perspective on atheism—one that sees in atheism a call to work with people of faith on addressing humanity’s shared problems—was being drowned out or erased by louder and confrontational atheists.  Some of these atheists felt that most atheist writers and organizations had different priorities than they did. They felt that many of the most visible atheists had a somewhat narrow view of religion, and that a large number were so focused on tearing down religion that they were missing opportunities to talk about the beauty of a nontheistic worldview. (These things aren’t mutually exclusive, of course.) I agreed, and I wanted to keep reflecting and writing about it."

My goal is not to expose the falsehood of people's religions.

Moreover, that degree of religiosity is only one of many facets of their ""self.""   I agree that the non-literalists are being illogical. But the human animal is an illogical creature. We react with ""System 1"" thinking (which lead to superstitions), and it takes dedicated effort to apply ""System 2"" thinking (which involves logic).

From what what I've encountered in /r/atheism, from celebrity atheists like Dawkins and Mahr, from other online forums of which I am a member, podcasts like Point of Inquiry, I see atheists demonstrate an open disgust with religion and a contempt for the magical thinking of its adherents. You yourself were just talking about ""exposing falsehoods"" and that we can't give the progressives who aren't doing harm a pass because it justifies the crazy ones.

humanism,2f4b40,AtheistGorilla,46,Sun Aug 31 22:38:56 2014 UTC,"I really think it's because humanism is an ethical stance, which means more study, thought, reflection, action, work and difficulty.

humanism,2f4b40,Algernon_Asimov,6,Mon Sep 1 02:41:20 2014 UTC,"Of course most people people are more capable of explaining what atheism is than what humanism is: atheism is a simple negation, a mere lack of belief in god(s). That's it. It can be summed up in only a few words, a short phrase. Humanism, on the other hand, is a bit more complex than that."
humanism,2f4b40,two_in_the_bush,2,Mon Sep 1 03:37:29 2014 UTC,"To clarify, I'm talking about all of the reasoning not to believe in a god when over 70% of the people around you do.   Explaining what an atheist is is just the first step (and has a nuance too: it doesn't necessarily mean asserting that their is no god, only that there is insufficient evidence). But beyond that, it's valuable to also understand the Huxley definition of agnostic, the counters to Pascal's Wager, explaining where you get your morality from, having an answer to what you think happens after you die, explaining awe and beauty, knowing nuances of things like naturalism vs empiricism vs utilitarianism vs materialism, why you accept evolution and the Big Bang, etc etc.   We could both play that game and easily oversimplify humanism too by saying ""That's just caring about humanity. Not much else to it."" But the reality is that both are complex.   And I'd still wager a year's salary that more atheists and humanists could tell you the finer points about atheism that I listed above than could tell you what the tenets of humanism are."

I can say I'm an atheist because it's a different epistemological framework, which means more study, thought, reflection, action, work and difficulty.   More study, thought, reflection, action, work and difficulty, etc, are a reflection of your dedication and thoughtfulness to your position no matter what it is, rather than an accurate depiction of what your stance actually is. It's not what you stand up for, it's how you stand up for it."
humanism,2f4b40,Algernon_Asimov,11,Mon Sep 8 12:30:07 2014 UTC,"Let's be honest here: a big part of the reason that Humanism isn't popular is because it's simply less visible and less known. Everyone knows what atheism is: it's when you don't believe in God. But a lot fewer people have even heard of Humanism.  Also, there's the fact that religions have owned the moral high ground in many cultures for such a long time that, in many people's minds, morality and ethics are linked to religion. If you follow a religion, you follow its morality. If you don't believe in a religion, then you don't have a morality to follow. You might make one up for yourself, but there are no non-religious moralities out there (as far as many people know).   Also, especially in the USA, it's more necessary to stand against religion than to stand for something other than religion. Religion in the USA is so pervasive that people who are outside of religion find themselves more occupied in pushing religion back. Imagine yourself living in a lowland next to the seashore. You build up dikes and levees to hold the sea back, but the sea is inexorable, so you spend a lot of time and effort merely supporting and repairing the barriers which hold the sea out of your living space. You don't have much time and effort to put into building something fancy to live in, because you're too busy just fighting back the sea. That's how I see atheists in places like the USA: they're too busy fighting back the sea of Christianity to focus on building up positive moralities and ethics in their non-religious lowlands.  For many people, atheism is the first step away from religion. That first step is to say ""No!"" to religion: to declare your atheism. Humanism and other ethical systems come later. And, for some people, they never bother to go further than that first step.  Also, not all atheists will become Humanists. That's like saying all theists will become Christians. There are lots of different ways of being atheist; Humanism is merely one option. Therefore, we could never expect Humanism to be as popular as atheism; there will always be fewer Humanists than atheists, simply by virtue of there being other atheistic systems of ethics out there.  So, with all these effects:   Humanism isn't well-known. People associate moral systems with religion. People are too busy fighting to maintain their non-religious space. Atheism is a first step for many people. Humanism is just one ethical system among many.   ... it's not surprising that there are far fewer Humanists than there are atheists.  So, I agree with your first point: many people are busy fighting back against religion.   I'm not sure about your second point: I'd be wary of calling anything ""common sense"". As the old saying goes, common sense is not so common. Also, what seems logical to you isn't necessarily logical to everyone (I bet that, if you and I started comparing our versions of Humanism, we'd come with different definitions!).   Regarding your third point, you should know that modern humanist thought actually originated in Christian thought during the Renaissance. We can't deny its religious roots. That's why there's such a thing as secular humanism - to differentiate it from other humanisms.   I deny your fourth point: I think that's just a reflection of what you've seen in /r/Atheism."

I'm curious here, but would you keep insisting that science has its roots in religious thinking (despite there being a thousand+ year gap between the origin of Christianity and when it 'developed' a scientific framework) and that we thus have to recognize that there is a religious science and a secular science?"
humanism,2f4b40,Algernon_Asimov,1 point,Mon Sep 8 12:33:30 2014 UTC,"would you keep insisting that science has its roots in religious thinking   Well, no. Because it's not true: science developed independently of religion, even if there have been religious people who were scientists.   However, it is true that modern humanist thought did develop during the Renaissance; modern humanism is a direct descendant of Renaissance humanism. Furthermore, there are still two main schools of humanism thought today: religious humanism and secular humanism. To declare, as some people have in this thread, that humanism is not compatible with religion is to deny the fact that there are religious humanists.

To declare, as some people have in this thread, that humanism is not compatible with religion is to deny the fact that there are religious humanists.   To declare that science is not compatible with religion is to deny the fact that there are religious scientists. Except that argument is not true though, human beings are very good at compartmentalizing. That's why you can have successful scientists who are creationists, they separate their scientific and religious ideas in their minds and never let the two touch each other. Same thing with humanism. Ask someone if they believe in God, and they'll say yes. Ask them if God was justified in commanding the genocide of the Amalekites for example, and some will still say yes. Ask them if they'd kill their own son, just as Abraham was ordered, if God commanded it of them. Suddenly nobody wants to say yes anymore, because their basic and intrinsic humanism runs into conflict with their religious tenets.   Therefore, it's relevant to point out that humanism is not incompatible with religion, and is not anti-theistic.   I agree. It's not incompatible, but in most people's minds, religion and humanism coexist very well, so long as they don't run into each other. In some people, when the two collide humanism mostly wins out, and in others it's religion that wins out. That's why we have things like this.   Yes, the majority of humanists today are secular humanists, but this is by no means the only school of humanist thought today.   I would say though that the more humanistic someone is, the less religious they tend to be. The opposite is also sometimes true, but not always.

Humanism at that time period wanted to study the glory of antiquity, which the church considered pagan and worthless, except when it served their cause. It certainly wasn't Christian thought who invented humanism, else why would humanism have waited a thousand years since Christianity's inception to appear?"

It is about not believing in gods.   Humanism is basically common sense. This label doesn't really identify any special set of beliefs - nearly anyone could call themselves a Humanist.   Common sense is such a elastic concept. Humanism is not arbitrary, there has to be something which characterizes ones views and makes one a Humanist. I recommend reading The Amsterdam Declaration, which is supported by most Humanist organisations.   Some Humanists see religion as man-made mythology, some still hold to religious beliefs and just use a back door to stand in both the religious and non-religious worlds.   Personally, I see religion as man-made mythology. However, virtually nobody follows a religion just to keep a back door.   Atheism is so much more fun lol. Less political correctness and a lot of 'tellin' it like it is'.   I see critique of religions in particular and ideologies in general as important and necessary.

Isn't it a good thing to have somewhere to see that no, you're not going insane, and that yes many things people do around you for religious reasons are actually nonsensical and irrational?  Humanism is the constructive adult to atheism's alienated teenager only if you take the best of humanism and the worst of atheism.

It's like saying ""If strawberry was the only flavour of ice-cream, would people still prefer pistachio ice-cream?"" It's a nonsensical question.   I should point out that eliminating races would not mean that everyone will automatically treat everyone equally - people will always find ways to differentiate one group of people from another. It might be about intelligent versus stupid people (for the bigot's own personal definition of ""intelligent"" and ""stupid""), or rich versus poor people, or Americans versus Europeans, or Apple fan-boys versus Android geeks. Whatever the dividing line, we are inherently hard-wired to form in-groups and discriminate against out-groups: one of the biggest challenges for humanist philosophy is to overcome this tendency.   what would happen to the concept of humanism if dolphins developed a civilization?   If dolphins were to develop a civilisation, I see humanism splitting into two groups: one group which embraces our delphine cousins as equals, and one group which asserts the primacy of Homo Sapiens over the members of Delphinus Sapiens. I hope that the group which embraced dolphins as equals would be the majority. But, given that the speciesist delphophobes would appropriate the word ""humanism"" to mean ""humans first"", the other group would have to find a new label for their ethical system embracing all sapient beings equally (""sapientism""?). So, the ethics of humanism - treating all beings equally and with compassion - would end up under a new name, while the name of humanism would be associated with people who treated dolphins as inferior beings.   what if machines became more intelligent and capable than humans?   Intelligent and capable aren't enough. Some machines already are more intelligent and/or capable than humans - in their limited areas. Can you calculate as fast as a computer? Can you beat Watson at Jeopardy or Deep Blue at chess?  I think what you're asking is what if machines become conscious and sapient? This would be much more difficult to handle. We're comfortable with biological consciousness and sapience: we are biological. But, machines invoke the Frankenstein complex, a fear that our creations will turn against us. I think a lot of humanists would seek proof of consciousness and sapience in machines, and would prove resistant to including them as ""humans"" under humanist thought.   Of course, this might be me just projecting my own opinion onto other people: I would personally be more comfortable with sapient dolphins than sapient machines. I believe that the spark of wisdom is more likely to evolve spontaneously than be made in an engineering workshop."

humanism,2etkni,Wonderslave,18,Thu Aug 28 15:30:36 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure about scrapping capitalism altogether. I agree it has its flaws but so far I don't believe there are any decent alternatives to replace it with. And remember one of its strengths is its encouragement of innovation and the tripartite alliance of democracy-capitalism-science has been quite successful.  I'd personally stick with capitalism but introduce socialist principles into sectors where its clear that profit cannot and must not be the ultimate goal (education, healthcare, prisons etc).  As for my top 5 issues:  1) Climate change - Urgent and potentially apocalyptic.  2) Inadequate education (especially of women in developing countries) - I am quite certain this, along with number 3, is a significant factor contributing to overpopulation. Education is a big one, in so many respects.   3) Gender inequality - I've heard a lot of intelligent people say that empowering women is the most effective cure for poverty, which in turn reduces the risk of overpopulation as women tend to have fewer children when there are better odds of those children reaching maturity. Gender inequality I attribute to the next 2 issues;  4) Sexual repression - In my view a dangerously underrated blight on humankind. To repress the most natural of human impulses can only lead to pain and aggression. Freud had this shit down. I'd love to see more research on sexual repression and its connections to homophobia, sexism, domestic violence, and rape. The idea that sex is an activity worth of shame and guilt is brought to us by...  5) Religion - Monotheistic religions, with their Bronze age beliefs and retrograde moral codes have a long, repulsive history of degradation of women, disgust for sex and sexual organs, and the still practised attempts to discourage and in some cases physically sully the capacity for normal sexual function. Not to mention all the dangers of fundamentalism ie. violent extremism, suppression of free inquiry, obstructing scientific and social progress and so on."

The West has declining birth rates on average, to say nothing of horror stories like Japan and Russia. As nations in poorer regions develop, trends suggest their growth rates will follow similar paths, and by roughly 2100 the world population will cease growing.  The current rate of resource use could easily sustain upwards of seven billion people. The primary reason people are starving in third world nations boils down to distribution."

Perhaps this in and of itself could be titled instead: Greed. We essentially have a relative few amount of elites controlling the worlds resources. (A friend gave me an analogy of how crazy the current human condition was: Imagine a pigeon sitting on a giant pile of seeds, very fat, and very content. Now, a starving or hungry pigeon attempts to eat a few of these seeds. In turn, all of the other pigeons, attack him for stealing the hard earned seeds of the fat pigeon)  2) Climate Degradation: Use of resources in non-sustainable manners, and in non-sustainable amounts. Production of pollution. We currently have no way of relating the true cost of things like fossil fuel usage, into the price of the product. Because of this we are incentivizing the use of products and things that are killing us, and our planet.

What you eat is the most important thing you do with your body.  It determines how you're going to feel and whether or not you end up with disease/illness.  Food is preventative care and it's not taught as such in Western medicine. Animal Agriculture- It's something crazy like 400 lbs of water to produce 1lb of beef.  That's directly to the livestock and indirectly like through watering the plants that feed them and processing plants and such.  Also, 4 square miles of the rain forest is being torn down every 10 seconds to provide paper products for animal agriculture industries.  I believe 70% of the farmland in USA directly supplies the grains to feed livestock. If we stopped consuming the absurd amount of meat in this culture, we could use the land to feed the world. Water supply- privatization of water is a real thing happening in the world and it's absolutely abhorrent.  Not only that, the USA adds chemicals into our public water supply.  I believe everyone has a right to clean water as it is essential to life.   Slavery- all over the world.

It causes people to be afraid, to act irrationally, and to not be the best citizen of the world they could be.  No, it isn't its own root cause. Hunger, disease, war [etc] all lead to anxiety, but anxiety also makes all those things much worse, and makes solving them harder. For example, a nation's collective anxiety over it's security from other nations will lead to fear, and potentially to war. If people in that nation are hungry, they will worry over where their food will come from, and the leaders [in a state of anxiety over maintaining power] will try to secure resources for their people.  I'm not saying ""don't worry"". No we need to worry. But people need to learn to channel their anxiety worldwide into being constructive in their societies, and those who are constructive should ask what they can do for the global society. IMO.

Any addition to this definition will either, a) make it encompass a group that does not consider itself a religion or, b) exclude a group that does consider itself a religion.

humanism,2ejn27,sharewithme,8,Mon Aug 25 17:15:35 2014 UTC,"This seems interesting. I'll dip in a little bit.  I was born in Scotland and raised Christian, still live here to this day. 18 years old, now an atheist and self-proclaimed humanist. I've always, always been interested in nature, how we work and how the world works around us which is why I'll be studying Animal Biology at University.   It was really only until I started studying psychology a few years ago that I truly understood human nature and began to sympathise with people I never used to. Up until about 6 years ago I was naive like many people and thought that the death penalty was a fantastic way to deter criminals. I'm now completely 100% for love and respect of every being on this planet and 100% against any form of capital punishment.  I firmly believe in reformation and oppose retribution. I see retribution as completely barbaric and unnecessary. As said before, studying psychology really taught me how people become what they are and how easy it is for people to be lead astray. How such a simple thing in childhood can lead to an altered view from the combined population.  I believe fully in personal choice and firmly oppose something like circumcision regardless if it's for religious reasons. I'm ""Pro-Choice"" and believe in allowing a mother to terminate a pregnancy up until a certain point. I'm also deeply saddened that humanist attributes -- attributes that are present in a society without religion -- are firmly attached to religion, and people often forget they can be present without it. When people say ""science and religion shouldn't mix"" it makes me upset, because much of religion is actually just human understanding. Like what it means to be a part of this earth, or how to treat other people.  On top of this though, I am completely for freedom of religion and beliefs. As long as those beliefs to not affect the lives of others in a negative way. Keep church and state separate and do not allow the teaching of religious believes as fact. Besides that, do anything that makes you happy and doesn't harm others.  I can add more, but that's all I can really think about.

humanism,2ejn27,cuteyes,6,Fri Sep 5 00:40:48 2014 UTC,"I have lived my whole life on my family's farm in Kentucky. My parents raised me without any specific indoctrinating, but they were atheists. I was introduced to secular humanism at Camp Quest which I've attended for a number of years. We were taught a bit about all major religions and had Socratic dialogues on philosophy. It is in the end just a summer camp that accepts free thinkers of any denomination, although most attendees are prescribed atheists.  I was seriously introduced to Buddhism in a college class my junior year and now identify myself as secular Buddhist. I don't believe in Karma or Rebirth, but I do see the merit in the philosophies of the religion. I value the human experience and perception, but believe in an objective reality outside of perception. While it may be difficult to articulate the exact nature of reality, I believe it exists.  I have attended Christian church a few times at a young age and found myself listening more closely then my friends. Some elements from the religion intrigued me, such as love and forgiveness, but other parts repelled me. I've visited the creation museum in Kentucky and the amount of misinformation was horrifying. They mix scientific evidence with pseudoscience in such a way that seems plausible unless you know of the alternatives. The individual Christians I have talked to about their religion have been varied, but the general idea is that if you taken Christ as your lord and savior you get into heaven and if you don't you go to hell. This doesn't mean every Christian believes this, just that nearly all of the Christians I have debated with have held this belief.  The humanity that we all share is the key origin that we all share. Throughout all of our lives we share similar problems and experiences. Every individual has a slightly different life, but overall we are all quite similar. I find Atheism to be more of a rebellion to Abrahamic Monotheism. I've found Buddhism to be a less superstitious method to understanding our part within the universe. I have faith in the scientific method as the best way to create accurate theories. I hope there is more to life then the miserable suffering many people undergo, but without evidence for an afterlife I doubt it exists. Reincarnation seems the most efficient method for an afterlife, but without a soul or anything beyond physical consciousness there doesn't seem a way to implement it. I want to spend the rest of my life searching for the most accurate description of reality."

I've very recently started to view things in a pantheistic/panentheistic manner after being agnostic atheist for the majority of my life (currently 22, raised Jewish). The reason, for me, that humanism meshes with the idea of pantheism is that of a self-correcting system.  There is a will in all things to evolve. To improve, to become better versions of ourselves (our Ideal selves as William James would put it). Plants, animals, humans, all behaving in a manner towards the maximal (with varying degrees of effectiveness). To behave in a manner which may harm another, is also to behave in a manner which may harm the self. If I consider myself anything other than everything, I work against myself.   Alternatively, if I'm wrong about there being a Godhead, or a source of all that is, I'll have set up conditions for others to behave as benevolent as possible without a sort of intrinsic, restrictive ideology. without a need for edifying persons based solely on my belief system.

humanism,2eirvn,mavnorman,1 point,Mon Aug 25 15:18:35 2014 UTC,"To be honest, the guy in the article doesn't appear to be sane, to put it mildly. I have therefore some reservation to attribute his actions to his religious beliefs.  However, for the sake of the discussion, let's assume he is sane. Even then, his actions do not seem motivated by his religious beliefs. According to the article, he supposedly said:   ""My mission is vengeance, for the lives, millions of lives are lost every day. … All these lives are taken every single day by America, by this government. So a life for a life.""   If we take that at face value, that 'secular' culture murdered ""millions"". Vengeance is a rather human emotion. It could happen in all similar situations. Religion is neither necessary nor sufficient.  From an empirical point of view, one's moral stance seem to depend on who one considers the victim in a story. To quote developmental psychologist and researcher of morality Paul Bloom:    A “politics of empathy” doesn’t provide much clarity in the public sphere, either. Typically, political disputes involve a disagreement over whom we should empathize with. Liberals argue for gun control, for example, by focussing on the victims of gun violence; conservatives point to the unarmed victims of crime, defenseless against the savagery of others. Liberals in favor of tightening federally enforced safety regulations invoke the employee struggling with work-related injuries; their conservative counterparts talk about the small businessman bankrupted by onerous requirements. So don’t suppose that if your ideological opponents could only ramp up their empathy they would think just like you.   The guy in the article obviously emphasized with ""millions"" of dead people in some pre-dominantly Muslim countries. Quite frankly, reactions like his do not appear to be a surprise. One might as well wonder why it's not happening more often."

Namely women and the effects of culturally imposed beauty standards and the disparity between how much effort is expected out of them compared to men.

Some like it, some do it for some of the reasons you stated, some refuse to shave at all. The thing is if you don't want to you don't have to. But you can't get upset when people voice their opinion.  Also, men feel obligated to do certain societal norms too.

If you truly didn't enjoy the facial hair to some degree yourself, I doubt you would keep it.

If these girls loved you are were attracted to you, they would have loved you and been attracted to you with or without facial hair.  The problem isn't that women are shamed from shaving, because they're obviously not. The issue here is having natural legs. Those people get shamed. I nowhere said that no woman should shave their legs. In fact, I'm very sure that in my original post, I clearly stated that women should have a choice that is not pressured by society on whatever they want to do with their legs.

It's not really malicious, usually, and it actually does serve a function of sorts. Such rituals develop from the desire to make ourselves more pleasant to be around and nicer to look at, which comes from our social nature. Our efforts to meet societies expectations are our way of showing others that we want to belong, to be part of our mutual communities, and are willing to put in the effort to do so. This includes not only the various aspects of hygiene, but also the minding of manners, friendliness to others, those sorts of things. This is not a bad thing, by itself, it's just how communities and society in general develop their cohesiveness.  Sometimes some rituals will acquire out-sized importance in some people's minds, that's certainly true. This can lead to inappropriate reactions like the ones you describe. Obviously, unshaven legs is not even in the same ballpark as, say, smelling horrific. The problem is just that people tend to assign importance to such things based on how frequently they see non-compliance. Long scraggly beards are not the norm, but the are common enough anyway that people are willing to accept them far more readily (presuming other hygiene rituals are sufficiently followed to compensate) then unshaven legs on women, which are comparatively practically non-existent. This is not really the best way to make such judgments, but it is the natural way, so it is predominant nonetheless.   Unfortunately, this situation is the product of a feedback cycle: the less women expose unshaven legs publicly, the more this reinforces the idea that they shouldn't do so, which causes women to do so even less, until it's basically ""unheard of"". While the forces of our social nature and the rituals of community cohesion that they create are generally positive, this is clearly an example of them getting out of control. The best way to fix it is to do exactly what you are doing: actually go out with unshaven legs, refuse to express embarrassment (this part is important), and do not shy away from bringing attention to the issue.  TL;DR: Keep doin' what you're doin'!"

Showering is a personal choice. There are places in the world where it doesn't matter, but in our society it's considered unpleasant to be in public without having done so.  I hate taking showers. I hate the time it takes out of my day, and the high physical discomfort I experience from the temperature extremes involved. I hate being cold afterward, and I don't get much of a benefit for myself from the activity. I certainly don't ""feel better"", or even all that different, after I've fully dried off.  So this is something I compel myself to do every morning, not really for my direct needs, but because I live in a society that happens to care about it. I could feel that this situation is forced and oppressive, sure. Or I could just make the effort in exchange for the social compatibility it affords.

I have no broad data, but my own experiences talking to women don't really support the idea. Seems to me that there are a lot of widely different opinions on the matter, but most women either don't have strong feelings about it (as most men don't,  with shaving), or feel that the hassle is worth it. Some women enjoy it and liken it to the effort to spend money and time on nice clothes.  I wasn't trying to find a specific male analogue to your situation, just to reflect on it with an activity that we all (in most western cultures) do to make us more socially compatible with the expectations of others. Hopefully in a way that helps some people to see the argument from the perspective of the other side -- the side that has experienced the occasional unpleasantness of having to deal with people who expressed their freedom to refuse to conform to a common social norm."

This is why I asked for an example of this, specifically in a man's case that is seen as unacceptable to deviate from the norm.

Whatever it is, think before you kill. You may still decide that on the whole it's worth it, but at least a moment's judgement reflects a respect for the shared experience of life and the important decision of ending it.   What about the truly heinous people of the world? Should we respect the lives of Hitler? Joseph Kony? Jeffrey Dahmer?   Yes, we should. Again, respect doesn't mean we shouldn't stop them, maybe it doesn't even mean we shouldn't kill them. But particularly where humans are concerned, when you start deciding who does and does not deserve to live, you're walking onto pretty thin ice. You think Hitler doesn't deserve to have his life respected, but ISIS thinks the same about you. In the end, there's no objective morality, so their viewpoint is equally valid. We absolutely should respect all life, and as such treat the taking of it, even in the service of saving more lives, as a very serious thing indeed. We should never, ever do it for arbitrary ideological reasons, and only do it as an absolute last resort to prevent other human suffering.   Anti-vaxxers? Holocaust deniers?   Accepting doesn't mean agreeing. It means that some people are always going to be wrong, and we've got to live in a world with them. Some people are always going to have views which are absolutely loathesome to you, and its your job to argue with them and try to keep them from harming the world and other people.

If you understand some basics of psychology then you can understand that what an adult becomes, is how they were raised (Many others too but let's just stick with this example). Is it not perhaps immoral to not ""waste your energy"" on someone who was brought up in such a way to exhibit this kind of behaviour?  Let's give paedophilia as an example, which for the most part is what a child molester is. This is a disorder of sexual preference much like homosexual or heterosexual. When someone is exposed as a paedophile they are often berated and hated upon for something which is out of their control. Is it not far more acceptable, moral, to help these people?  You might have seen a story recently about the Indian women who murdered children. Did you also know that these two women were brought up by their mother in a life of crime. They grew up accepting that that life style is acceptable. That's the only life style they know. I don't think they should be hanged for that.  I really think you look at the mind as being very black and white ""I will do this because it is good, I won't do this because this is bad"". That's how you think but not everyone is you. Some of these things just don't seem right to people, genuinely. Look at Bowlby's study on thieves in 1944 where way over half of the studied individuals had experienced early separation at birth.  I urge you to look up what deprivation and privation can do a child. These are critical points in a person's development that can severely affect a child for life."

I went up and asked him a question about how atheists can better communicate with the religious, it's on the CSPAN recording. He essentially dodged the question, and just used my question to sound even more condescending. I was so disappointed.  I also caught him at an atheist conference where he was doing a God Delusion signing. I waited until the last person was done, and approached him with an open ended question about his clout among atheists and scientists and how he might be thinking to use it to help bridge some divides with people who were opposed to much of what he espouses.

For what it’s worth, my own choice would be to abort the Down fetus and, assuming you want a baby at all, try again. Given a free choice of having an early abortion or deliberately bringing a Down child into the world, I think the moral and sensible choice would be to abort. And, indeed, that is what the great majority of women, in America and especially in Europe, actually do.  I personally would go further and say that, if your morality is based, as mine is, on a desire to increase the sum of happiness and reduce suffering, the decision to deliberately give birth to a Down baby, when you have the choice to abort it early in the pregnancy, might actually be immoral from the point of view of the child’s own welfare. I agree that that personal opinion is contentious and needs to be argued further, possibly to be withdrawn. In any case, you would probably be condemning yourself as a mother (or yourselves as a couple) to a lifetime of caring for an adult with the needs of a child. Your child would probably have a short life expectancy but, if she did outlive you, you would have the worry of who would care for her after you are gone. No wonder most people choose abortion when offered the choice. Having said that, the choice would be entirely yours and I would never dream of trying to impose my views on you or anyone else.”"

Your supposed scientific approach is flawed: you're making assertions without proof.   There's not ""like a fifty-fifty chance"" of a Muslim or Christian going to Hell.

Not that you're calling yourself an authority on purpose, but that is the legacy of priests and those who preach. The point is that secular humanism rejects not only the beliefs about gods and other supernatural claims, but also rejects the paradigms of religion, such as preachers and sermons, that you're trying to co-opt here.   Also, I only listened to the first minute of this video, but you already referred to ""Atheist-Humanism"" as a ""belief system"" which is just..no.

It was a bad assumption for the presenter to make (which she addresses in the article).

From the sounds of it, it was supposed to be a lecture landed in the silliness of memes, what makes a meme work, and why they are so pervasive.  Instead, she shoehorned in a focus on religion, which in any room of 45 nationalities would be polarizing, and expecting otherwise is naivety.  Additionally, forcing a few hundred teenagers to come to grips with their ideologies being flawed in a foreign environment surrounded by strangers is also not a wise decision.  Frankly from her own account it sounded as though she sat in the position of power in the room, talked about memes, then compared deeply held religious beliefs as being as silly and small as these memes.  When the students offered their silent protest of simply walking out and not engaging, she called them out as if to shame them.  Frankly I'm on the school's side.

Now whether that is what happened, or if that's how they perceived it, is something I do not know, so I can only imagine possible answers.  That being said, I imagine some of the audience were primed to be weary of those that try to sway them from the righteous path, so to speak. So it probably wasn't going to be too hard to offend/insult. It is really easy to peg someone as ""just another Atheist that doesn't really know how the world works"" or as a ""silly nonbeliever.""

According to Wikipedia, dogmata are ""core principles that must be upheld by all believers of that religion."" Since a religion is a human construct, it has to have dogmata. Otherwise, it would be as tangible as fog.  However, I don't agree that dogmata are necessarily a bad thing.  Life is short, and reinventing the wheel is thus a waste of time. Additionally, it takes lots of hard work to educate millions, or even billions of people to make them adopt certain principles, or truths. To get things done, one needs a (large) organization.  So there seems to be some value in formulating core principles that a group of people have found to be true, or generally useful up until now."

However, I take strong issue with ""principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true"" (also wikipedia)   So there seems to be some value in formulating core principles that a group of people have found to be true, or generally useful up until now.   Agreed, with the emphasis on ""found to be true"" and ""generally useful"".   Something like ""Always wear a condom"" is a generally useful shortcut compared to a set of lectures on Germ Theory, STIs, Epidemiology and Immunology. However, if it's taken as ""incontrovertibly true"", we'd have a bit of a problem with the survival of the species. ""Always wash your hands to prevent the spread of infection"" is almost universally found to be true, unless one person with ebola has weeping sores and you're all sharing the same water bath.

However, what I find acceptable (about the word 'dogma') is the idea that certain principles should not be open to change, just because somebody has a different opinion. Everybody with an opinion will claim being well-informed, and rational. It's an aspect of human nature.  As I see it, there's some tension between principles being able to change on the one hand, and being resistant to change on the other."

I'm certainly not against strong principles or principles that are resistant to change. I am against principles that are hostile to or even immune from inquiry and examination.  Vaccines are an interesting example. There are people (who consider themselves to be well informed and acting in the best interest of their loved ones) who deny the efficacy of vaccines. Now, I'm in favour of continued scientific inquiry into methods of disease avoidance and protection. I'm in favour of scientific studies into the efficacy and safety of vaccines. I'm in favour of exercising an abundance of caution in the trial of new interventions. However, when a treatment has passed the tests and been shown to be very safe and effective compared to the illness (allowing that almost nothing is without side-effects and 100% effective), then I'm for it and I don't think someone without the battery of scientific evidence should be given equal consideration.  Against that, when someone does have the evidence of a particular problem, it should be examined fairly and openly."

humanism,2dy62i,archon88,2,Tue Aug 19 18:33:07 2014 UTC,"To state the obvious, Humanism is a tradition of thought without scriptures or authoritative sources, so at most you can point to a set of books that Humanists would admire and identify with. Bear in mind that there is no canon, and most statements of the sort ""Humanism is X"" are open to dispute in principle. We (thankfully) don't have a Hubbard or a Joseph Smith to issue ""authoritative"" pronouncements, so what you consider seminal is largely a function of personal preference.  With all that being said, I'd suggest that perhaps the best books I know of for answering the question ""what is Humanism?"" in a concise way would be those of Paul Kurtz. Goodenough's The Sacred Depths of Nature is a quick introduction to naturalism. But there's a large amount of material, and there's no need to limit yourself to what would be considered ""seminal""."

If they are going to publicly pick on someone then they need to be publicly reprimanded.   Think of it like grade school. If you heard someone making fun of a kid you would call them out in front of everyone. It makes the person being picked on realize that not everybody agrees AND it breaks the code of silence around that Stuff.   I have ZERO tolerance for my kids or people around me being a bully. I would obnoxiously stand up for the person being attacked.   I know what it's like. I also know how amazing it feels to have someone stand up against the crowd and say that's not acceptable to EVERYONE involved and around it.   Fuck doing it privately. They were shaming someone on Facebook. We are adults.   Plus doing it publicly reminds people that there are real people behind that screen and user name. And real people reading your comments and losing respect for you as you are a freaking bully.   The only thing I would have said was do it publicly.   Oh and Im a chick if that helps. You never would have heard me say ""don't create drama.""   In fact THAT pisses me off a LOT.   Drama is being a bully online. Standing up for someone is not what's creating the drama.

humanism,2dtmp7,bookwench,8,Sun Aug 17 21:43:08 2014 UTC,"The rightness of a behaviour has nothing to do with who's watching it or who approves of it. If it is a right thing to do, then the fact that nobody is watching you do it does not make it less worth doing; if it is the wrong thing to do, then a million people cheering will not make it good. You did one right thing. You did it because it was easier to live with yourself if you said something than it would be to live with yourself if you were silent, even if other people - whom you may love, and who may be decent people - didn't understand.   You did one possible right thing, and it was difficult. Doing difficult things is good. It's not easy to go against a crowd. It can be frightening, uncomfortable, make you feel awful and nervous and stupid. But it's worth doing it sometimes, deciding you don't agree and voicing that (in a way that's safe. Don't take risks you're not ok with. When you take risks make sure it's on purpose, to push yourself; and make sure you think about and understand the risks you do take.) It's worth practicing not being part of the group, being yourself, holding true to things. It gives you a freedom that people who always comply with the group will enver have, to think things and judge the worth of things on your own.   The only thing to be cautious of is to not let doing a difficult right thing make you self-righteous. Folks who see you do a right thing when they're doing a wrong thing tend to get upset, and attack you, and it's easy to fall back on the defensive ""I did a good thing and you suck"" mentality. Try not to do that. They're who they are for a reason and you can't change them and you're not responsible for their behaviour. You can only do your right thing, not theirs.   And it's difficult when someone you love doesn't understand what you do. You can talk to them about it, and if they love you they will try to understand and accept that part of you. But it's also ok to be different from the people you love, to not be exactly the same as them, to make choices they would not make."

First of all, making fun of a stranger is juvenile behavior, and good for you for not engaging in it.  However, unless I misunderstood your post, the subject wasn't aware of the fun being had at her expense. So just to be clear: no harm was done to anyone by their inane Facebook dogpiling. You, on the other hand, personally reprimanded someone you don't really know over behavior that had no discernible harm to anyone.   Again: good for you for wanting to practice your ethical beliefs, but that's not what you did here. You reprimanded someone else for not practicing your ethical beliefs. That is exactly self-righteous behavior. I personally don't know anyone who resolved to straighten up and fly right based on some stranger scolding them on Facebook. Do you?  I'm not saying to never speak up if you see injustice in the world, just be aware that we all have a limited scope of influence on other people, so pick battles that (a) are important, and/or (b) you can win."
humanism,2dtmp7,bserum,1 point,Mon Aug 18 02:15:48 2014 UTC,"Thank you. Your critique is exactly why I was hesitant about saying anything, and you put into words what I only knew through gut feeling and intuition.   If I'm inferring correctly, the main criticisms are the effectiveness of my actions and the rightness of judging someone based on my own ethical beliefs.  I can definitely see why it would be self-righteous to reprimand someone else based on my own ethical beliefs. I think I could argue that because she is in my circle of influence (being friends on facebook) and she is an American woman who lives nearby me, and that the ethical belief I was upholding is generally supported by most Americans (you shouldn't bully and be kind to others), that it was relatively warranted and only a little bit self-righteous. At the heart of it, I think I was in the right. I do believe that passively accepting unethical behavior is still contributing to the negative behavior, although it isn't as bad as engaging or supporting the behavior.  Now when it comes to picking battles, I think you're right that it's important to prioritize, but my criteria is different from your. If I could, I would fight injustices no matter how important or unimportant they are and no matter if I could win or not. I believe it's my duty to not be a bystander to evil/harm/injustices. The only thing that prevents me from doing that is the limitation of being human. I don't have the time, power, or the bravery to fight every battle. There are negative consequences for me when I speak up. I get anxiety, stressed, worried that people won't like me, that I risk being bullied as well, etc. So really, my criteria on picking battles is: is it work the negative consequences? Is this issue important enough that you need to speak up?   Bullying, and now cyber-bullying, is one of the issues I care deeply about. There are a lot of political discussions that I avoid because it's too much to face, but I think this issue is a battle I'm choosing in my life and I'll face some of the negative consequences of making that decision."

Wouldn't those two not be really able to coincide?   These two principles - universal healthcare and self-responsibility - only don't coincide in a libertarian point of view. If you believe that the ability to shape your life means deciding for yourself what to spend your own money on, and not having your money taken from you by a government to spend on things you didn't agree to... then you won't agree with universal healthcare.  However, if you believe that humanism is also about giving other people the right to shape their lives... it's quite easy to come to the conclusion that we can help people shape their own lives if we prevent illness from dictating their destiny. If someone is sick and can't afford to pay for the healthcare they need, then they're not really shaping their own life. They're merely existing in reaction to their illness.   We, as fellow humans, can choose (note that word ""choose"") to contribute money to a universal healthcare scheme for various reasons related to Humanism:   It's a way of helping other people. It gives sick and injured people some control over their own destinies when they don't have to stress about merely surviving. It creates a compassionate society in which everyone helps everyone else, and in which government becomes the means by which we help each other (the government is our servant, not our enemy).    If you read the Amsterdam Declaration laying out the principles of Humanism you will see references to ""the right of every human being to the greatest possible freedom compatible with the rights of others"", ""a duty of care to all of humanity"", and ""personal liberty must be combined with social responsibility"". There is a strong undercurrent in Humanism of helping other people. Universal healthcare is one way of doing that.  A Humanist is not selfish. A Humanist wants to help other humans and humanity in general."
humanism,2dogby,Algernon_Asimov,14,Sat Aug 16 04:38:43 2014 UTC,"Humanism is pretty much a inherently left philosophy, (progressive world view which supports freedom from religion and the collective wealth fare of all human beings). Which is pretty much contradictory to most right wing and libertarian ideas. I, and many others I am sure personally believe that right-libertarian ideas do not offer any more 'freedom' just a less humane and more volatile world in which very few people reap unfair benefit.   I see no reason why having free healthcare holds you back from giving meaning to your own life... In fact, I only see that it would help you achieve this, I understand that libertarians don't see things the same way, but in my opinion right-libertarianism not only contradicts humanism but stands in the way of it as much as religion (or the ethical stance of right-libertarianism does at least).

I feel that pairing humanism, or any other ethical alignment for that matter, with a perfectly fitted definition is an impossible task to do. Humanism is complex because each ""humanist"" individual carries with them an individualized understanding of what it means to act on humanistic ethical principles. These principles may even conflict on an individual basis sometimes.   You sound bright and I'm sure you understand all of this, but I say it only to give context for my input:  In the midst of such disorienting ethical complexity that exists in our world, I personally believe that the best a humanist can do is to thoroughly and openly explore the merits of one's own ethical stances. With this, we can at least each find confidence in the ideologies we as individuals assert towards others.

In response to your point regarding healthcare, I'm not sure that it follows that people with free healthcare cannot give ""meaning and shape"" to their lives. Apart from ""meaning and shape"" not being well-defined, I'm not sure I could justify charging people for the necessities of life. Water, shelter, food, medicine, education - what right have we to deny these (and other) basic resources to individuals based on the circumstances they find themselves in that arise primarily from a broken system?

Of course they wouldn't.  Besides that, the moderates are against extremism just as much as we are, and even if they were somehow responsible for extremists existing, they wouldn't be doing it on purpose.  The thing is, if you're really working towards a world where there are no superstitious or supernatural beliefs at all, you're fighting a losing battle. If you want less extremism, you should be working with the moderates. They can set an example for the extremists to show them that their belief system doesn't always lead to radicalism.  As humanists, we have to realize that in order to solve our own problems with reason, we have to acknowledge the power of compromise.

But I do agree they make it easier to be a fundamentalist or extremist, whatever the appropriate term is. If everyone around you believe that a god exists, it's less of a leap to believe in a god that is slightly more demanding or absurd. And so on with each step into real hostility to humanity. People who talk about loving the sinner, hating the sin, normalize the belief that homosexuality is wrong, for example. And those who think women shouldn't be pastors, help with the belief that women shouldn't be allowed any positions of significance, even if they don't personally get involved with what society outside of their church should be able to do.  I don't think we really can go after extremism, without going after all of it, simply because the arguments are mostly going to be the same. If we don't want to allow for senseless discrimination, or if we want to argue for science as the way to reliable knowledge, as we talk about it we necessarily end up targeting all forms of belief related to it. And believers who largely agree with us, might find themselves unable to argue against believers who don't, if their approach is ""no, that's not what God wants you to do, this is what God wants you to do, you have to interpret these passages the same way I interpret them"".  This doesn't mean that we can't make any gains, without eliminating all of religion. But I think that with less of it overall, less acceptance of the flawed positions, there will be less of the worst of it, as well."

Human well-being is something we can measure with  a respectable degree of scientific certainty.   Given that he also allows for many ""peaks and valleys"" (i.e., that there may be more than one way to act well, and more than one way to act badly), can't we say that a particular lie (or other action) is probably justified if it results in an increase in human well-being (or lack of an increase in suffering), and that a lie (or other action) is bad if it results in suffering or a decrease in human well-being?

This is, I suppose, fairly uncontroversial if you take it as a given that utilitarianism is true. (I would say that science still couldn't answer this question in every circumstance: who can say who is subjectively in more pain, really?) Trouble is, he doesn't engage with any of the criticisms of utilitarianism (I have read the Moral Landscape Btw), and then boldly declares that science has solved morality.   Here is one such criticism: if utilitarianism is true, is it acceptable to oppress a minority if it is in the interests of the majority? Or in Sam Harris terms: if experiments showed that say, oppressing homosexuals made the majority of Americans happy and reduced their suffering, is it therefore okay to oppress homosexuals? Our intuitions say 'no', but under Sam's approach he would have to conclude 'yes'. Or is it moral to steal from the rich to give to the needy? Our intuitions might be conflicted about this one, since we already do tax the rich for the greater good, but that isn't a policy dilemma that could be solved by science.

When you say that science can give us useful facts but not give us the answer, I'm reminded of his comparison to nutrition, which I will badly paraphrase: Just because science can't tell you if you should order pizza or Chinese doesn't mean the study of nutrition is meaningless.   I suspect you, me, and Sam Harris would all agree that scientific inquiry can't tell us which particular action is right in many circumstances, just as nutrition doesn't tell us whether we should order pizza or Chinese. On the other hand, science has useful input when we're deciding if we should enslave and torture people, just as nutrition does when deciding whether to eat a salad or a handful of dryer lint.

Obviously the article relates to psychology, but there's more to it than that. The main point of the article, as I see it, is that practices in prisons in many parts of the world are inhumane and damaging, for reasons that have quite a lot to do with Humanism:   we derive meaning from our emotional states largely through contact with others. Biologists believe that human emotions evolved because they aided co-operation among our early ancestors who benefited from living in groups. Their primary function is social. With no one to mediate our feelings of fear, anger, anxiety and sadness and help us determine their appropriateness, before long they deliver us a distorted sense of self, a perceptual fracturing or a profound irrationality. It seems that left too much to ourselves, the very system that regulates our social living can overwhelm us.   Humanism isn't meant to be a feel-good, sounds-good-on-paper statement of progressive values; it needs to engage with issues that are directly important to human beings.

Don't just post a psychological article about isolation without context.   Because... while you see this:   The main point of the article, as I see it, is that practices in prisons in many parts of the world are inhumane and damaging   ... I see an article about the psychological impacts of extreme isolation in many contexts, with the largest part of the article taken up with describing various experiments about isolation, and only occasional mentions of imprisonment in a 30-paragraph article, just as examples of isolation. I don't see that this article is about imprisonment at all, let alone as its main point. That's your interpretation, which you didn't share with us until I challenged you about why this seemingly irrelevant article was posted here."

OK, agreed. But it galls me somewhat that some people will tend to assume that (for instance) articles which are just critical of religion for the sake of being critical of religion naturally belong here, whereas other topics of no less human interest are somehow less relevant. Equally, a devil's advocate could say that most of the anti-religious stuff should be left to the ""sniggering philistines"" of /r/atheism.  One thing I would say is that I'd expect articles posted here to have some substance to them – so I agree that motivational gifs and other such ""feelgood"" content are inappropriate. But an article about the psychological effects of isolation does raise a lot of ethical questions for Humanists – from practices in prisons to how to prevent lonley (and perhaps somewhat unrelatable) people from living in misery. Of course I should have done more to introduce it, but for people interested in building a more ethical world, there's a lot of relevant content in there."

I don't think we can segregate things as neatly as you seem to want. There are many articles which relate to several different topics simultaneously, such as psychology, war, humanitarianism, etc. Discussions in specialised subreddits will tend to focus on the aspects of those articles which relate most directly to the relevant aspects of the article. A discussion in a Humanist subreddit should aim to provide a distinctly Humanist response to the topic.  To put things in a more pointed way, if Humanism can't provide a meaningful response to real-world issues, what on earth is the point in it? Who could care less about a worldview or a philosophy which has nothing to say about civilians being killed in Gaza except ""meh"", and not a word on solitary confinement beyond ""irrelevant""? If we want Humanism to amount to anything beyond a circle-jerk of burka-bashing Hitchens-quoting atheists, or the usual Carl Sagan platitudes, then we need to expand somewhat beyond our historically rather limited scope of attention."

My stepsister never visits him - ever.  I don't blame her, he doesn't remember who she is most of the time.  My one sister lives overseas - she doesn't get to see him ever, when she does, there is a huge decline, even if he was at a local low on the previous visit, and he might be on a local high, his highs are still worse.  My other sister was trying to take care of him - but truth be told, she's not quite able to take care of herself.  She's finally self sufficient, but isn't capable of much more.  I live halfway across the country, I see him more than my one sister, but much less than the other (4x per year-ish).  I think I handle it the best of all the kids-and I don't do so hot sometimes.    There is no hope of them getting better, there is only hope that they might have a good day... where a good day might be defined as they remember who you are.  This is the sad truth, it's not something I would wish on my worst enemy.  I don't think I'm ever truly forgotten - he KNOWS I'm someone close to him - maybe I'm his brother?  His cousin?  His son?  He talks about ""dad"" with me, when he's talking about his father, who he never called ""dad"" in front of us - it was always grandpa.   Alzheimer's is the most trying disease you could devise.  As a secular humanist, I bite my tongue when people say ""I'll pray for him.""  To me, there is no god, and there is no dignity in the death he is slowly dying.  I've got nothing concrete for you in dealing with your friend.  I will say life goes on.  Don't talk about it with him if he doesn't want to talk about it - caregivers and family NEED all the breaks they can get.  Listen if he does want to talk.

humanism,2c6rra,archon88,8,Wed Jul 30 23:05:47 2014 UTC,"I think I've only met one group of people where I could safely broach the idea of whether pedophiles get too hard a rap.  Also, in reference to Dawkins' opening example, it's considered heroic for soldiers to leap on grenades to save the lives of either fellow soldiers or second parties.  They're even conditioned to want to do this in some bases.  I asked such a guy why that is, and whether he'd try to save just one other life that way and why; to him, it's just part of the cause, his function as a soldier, to sacrifice for others' sake--even if it is neutral in a utilitarian sense.  And I think he's nuts for it."
humanism,2c6rra,maharito,5,Thu Jul 31 00:18:21 2014 UTC,"Pedophilia is an ethically difficult subject, since the attraction itself appears to be uncontrollable. I remember reading research to the effect that it might result from a problem with the brain's white matter, causing the regions responsible for attachment to children (protection, parenting) to become connected to the regions that control sexual arousal. There's also some evidence that pedophilia correlates negatively with some other attributes, including, I believe, height and intelligence. There's an organisation called (I think) ""Virtuous Pedophiles"" which advocates people being honest about the attraction, and grouping together as a support org to discourage child abuse.  Regarding the point about jumping on grenades, there's also a strong taboo attached to surviving at the expense of others, even if it's unwarranted. Some people have a strong fear of living in shame, haunted by the accusation that they didn't do enough to save someone else."
humanism,2c6rra,gargolito,1 point,Thu Jul 31 12:33:20 2014 UTC,"I have to strongly and vehemently disagree that pedophiles get too bad a rap. I think that anything short of a life sentence is permissive. Chemical castration is inhumane unless it is voluntary, and if the pedophile chooses to do so, they would have to be monitored for the rest of their lives. Putting aside the physical damage they inflict, which is always horrible, the psychological damage they inflict on children is nearly always irreparable. This trauma often drives the victims to violence, other abuse and quite often more pedophiles - a crime that keeps on giving. I do think that my absolutist view should be limited to an appropriate age range, since some people mature physically and emotionally at different rates and in the case that the child is near the end of their teens, gives what they think is consent, the age difference is not huge and, it is the perpetrator's first offence, the courts should be very lenient. Admittedly, my criteria are dependent on arbitrary age limits which make its application/adoption challenging. I have zero tolerance for pedophilia."

humanism,2c6rra,kentrel,3,Thu Jul 31 19:11:59 2014 UTC,"I think it comes down to a debate on degree to which ones views should be applied on someone else.   In cases where the superstation is harmless, perhaps arguably with Ghosts as well (if one hold that belief personally), then I see the 'application' of reason as actively working against the Principles of Humanism (in so far as I understand it)... to do so would prevent that person from being able to choose the life they want to live... unnecessarily.   In my life, when I hear someone is participating in the myth of Santa Claus, I don't lay down the logic on them and the child because I have reason on my side. I am cool with them playing with that. In that example it is (in my opinion) a harmless thing.  There are tons of examples of the opposite.... where superstition actively imposes on others and impedes their ability to choose a life for themselves. Like Religion and same-sex couples, for example. That is an example where I think 'applying reason to life' has value, as it can free someone from a tyranny of some sort of superstition.  I believe the 'where logic should not tread' is where it is not welcome, insomuch as the superstition is a personally held one and does not impact other people in their ability to live a life they choose to live.  tl;dr - In some contexts, and not in others."

There is no need to because they are both free to pay no mind to the words and they harm no one with their belief.  In my eyes presenting those arguments to them without good cause (i.e.: if they were infringing on others) is just combative. I would rather if people with superstitious beliefs didn't come to me with their arguments just because they can, so I would rather not do that to others unless I deem it necessary.

humanism,2c6rra,kslusherplantman,3,Fri Aug 1 15:03:29 2014 UTC,"This is a brilliant article, but unfortunately it's probably going to be lost on the people who sorely need to read it. Formal debate and rational arguments are incredibly rare on the most popular of micro blogging sites, and this is by design.   Twitter, reddit, tumblr, facebook allow its users to build up its communities around common values and rarely are they ever forced to ""get along"" and debate. They can exist independently so emotive issues can be accepted, and not challenged.   There are times where these communities might clash, such as a big news story, and public debates on twitter, but these people have had their views segregated for so long than when they clash it often boils down to Team A versus Team B where the loudest voice ""wins."" Most commenting systems allow some kind of voting system, which is another way to kill rational discussion. IMHO, Web 2.0 has been harmful for the quality of discussion in this culture. Trivial comments on serious news articles, attack blogs, blogs about other blogs, blogs based around finding things to be offended by are all teaching bad habits in their users.  What do I think is the solution? I really believe that we need to start teaching formal and informal logic again, and call people on it consistently when they abuse logic. We can't wait for schools to do it, we just have to stop emotive arguments in their place by demonstrating, without trying to be condescending the logical fallacies the person is making. There was a time where every discussion usually had someone linking to Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit. Invoking ""Godwins Law"" takes care of one kind of logical fallacy, but in the good old days of USENET invoking Carl Sagan usually took care of a bunch in one go.  In such a situation someone will likely call me on my generalizations in the above paragraphs, and they'd be right. That might force me to find better examples, and be more specific, and in the end we'd have a better discussion. This is something that people have to practice, and not just know. Everyone is capable of jumping to conclusions and being overly emotional in discussions beyond all reason. We can change that."
humanism,2c6rra,Apatomoose,1 point,Mon Aug 4 21:56:53 2014 UTC,"Web 2.0 has been harmful for the quality of discussion in this culture.    I'm not sure if it's been harmful in absolute terms, but I suspect it hasn't lived up to its potential, for the reasons you outline. Remember that before these technologies were available, people were segregated and isolated in different ways, and direct exchange of information and views between people from different cultural backgrounds was if anything even harder. Exchange of information was mostly top-down through centrally-controlled (i.e. by states or large corporations) media outlets, and unless you knew someone in person, you could hardly have a discussion with them at all, productive or otherwise.  Thanks to the web, previously-scattered communities such as ex-Muslims (and, indeed, Humanists!) are able to organise and grow, and information from ""unofficial"" sources, which might not be friendly to the worldview of the powers that be, can make its way into cultures which have hitherto been quite insular and oppressive (most Muslim countries, China, the ex-Soviet countries, Africa, etc).  Social media is, of course, much better for exchanging soundbites than for meaningful and productive discussion between intelligent people – Twitter ""discussions"" can often, frankly, be something of a race to the bottom. But it's still a useful tool, even if it needs a good amount of honing. I would say that, on balance, Web 2.0 has given the cultural critique of religion the largest push into the mainstream that it's had in recent years. As a certain Youtuber likes to say, the web is where religions go to die.   We can't wait for schools to do it   This is another good point. Even if we grant that the school curriculum impresses itself sufficiently deeply into the minds of pupils to make substantial long-term differences to how they think, changes made to it now would benefit only the next generation, so their effects wouldn't be seen for many years. We need to think about how people debate and discuss things now, and above all try to model the changes we want to see in our own habits. The most important ambassadors for any kind of cultural change are those who are good exemplars of it, and the stain of hypocrisy is extremely hard to remove.   Everyone is capable of jumping to conclusions and being overly emotional in discussions beyond all reason. We can change that.   Yes, but that's going to take a huge amount of time and effort. A culture of robust, intelligent discussion is not built overnight; you could say that the entire project of the Enlightenment over the past >250 years or so (and, in no small measure, the Humanist project) has been to build exactly such a culture. To paraphrase Jefferson, we need to ""enlighten people's discretion"", so they choose to discuss things in a more mature way. Twitter and its infamous 140 characters have some role to play, but hopefully not a dominant one.  The first thing we need to combat is the tendency to self-segregate; this is exacerbated by some social media actively filtering the content that their users see by default (even Google, I believe, has a bias towards showing its users things they are more likely to find interesting). The problem with letting this continue unchallenged is that it leads to communities becoming even more entrenched in their established positions, with productive discussion becoming ever more unlikely, and the arts of compromise and learning to live together becoming more and more deprecated in effect (I have recently read that the US political culture is currently in the most polarised state it has been in throughout living memory, which is alarming, but a large part of the problem seems to be that the Republican party has increasingly gone off the deep end in recent decades). Above all, discussions should never be personalised, because that poisons everything.  One of my friends had an interesting suggestion: the algorithms used by social media to decide what content to show users should have an occasional bias towards ""unfamiliar"" or ""disagreeable"" content, to make sure that people are more well-rounded in their view of the world, or are at least familiar with other opinions, whether those opinions are reasonable or not – of course I'm not going to start claiming that every opinion deserves equal respect regardless of how poorly substantiated it is, but it's important that everyone has an appreciation of how other people think."

Leaving behind my belief in a mortally anguishing hell was both a huge relief and additional stress. I constantly find myself worrying about if I'm wrong, if I've ""rejected God,"" etc.   I'm finding that the key is determination in changing how you think. Whenever the fears, doubts and other thoughts about hellfire arise, just tell yourself that it doesn't exist. Treat it like monsters under the bed.   As for your kids, expose them to a bigger picture. When they come home with questions or fears about hell, teach them about other religious perspectives on death, morality, whatever.

Your mind knows that logically, the whole story we've been fed is a line of bull.  But theres still that doubt.. that ""what if I'm wrong"" nagging at the back of your mind.    I can only speak for myself, but the cure was lots and lots of study.  Really, the turning point came for me when I studied Islam.  Islam rejects Jesus as the son of god and indeed, insists that he never died on the cross at all.  Obviously, as a ""christian"" I had a problem with that.  Muslim literature pointed me to contradictories in my own bible. For instance, compare the geneology of Jesus in Matthew, Chapter 1 and Luke, Chapter 3.  If the Bible can't even agree about Jesus family tree, that definitely casts doubts on the rest of it.    I can pinpoint the day I became a non-believer.  When I read this passage with my own eyes in my own bible:   Matthew 15:22-28 A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession.” Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.” He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.” The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said. He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to their dogs.” “Yes, Lord,” she said, “but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.” Then Jesus answered, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour.  I do not see this story as some wonderful example of his love and grace as apologists would like to twist it.  Rather, I see this story as a stark example of exactly how Jesus felt.  He NEVER said he came to save the world.  He explicitly states that he came ""ONLY for the lost sheep of Israel"" (Jews).  And he follows that up by basically calling the woman a dog.  If you know anything about Middle East culture, being called a dog is quite an insult.    Once you can make that disconnection.. once it clicks in your head, you will realize the absurdity of it all, and wonder how we ever believed it.  It will become comparable to believing in the Easter bunny."

If more than 50% of the voters say they should die, than they should die.  It's a fine line you are walking.  If you molested my kids, I can assure you, there will be no court hearing, I will kill you, in murderous blood.  See the difference here?  There are strong emotions attached to this and with you being such a young person, without kids, you probably cannot understand the outcome of such an abhorrent action.  Please don't ask me to tell you what I think, because I'm sure you can read between the lines.  But don't take what I think, I  will live with the justices system as it is.  (Trust me, I have 9 brothers, half have been in prison, once someone is convicted of this crime, their life is not numbered by the justice system, they will server their time in prison, then they will serve their time in eternity).  This video you made makes no sense and shouldn't be brought to the forefront, trust me, the people who commit these crimes are duly given the punishment they deserve, not by the state, but by the very state that imprisons other hardened criminals.  Crimes against children are not taken lightly, nor should they ever be.  The justice system already understands, if you rape a child, you will most (90% be murdered in prison) be taken care of in prison, so why leave it up to the public to prosecute these foul criminals?"
humanism,2byjx9,thatguy2150,1 point,Wed Jul 30 08:04:23 2014 UTC,I do understand where you are coming from but all of what you are talking about deals with the practical consequences of what you feel will or should happen to such people. The point of this video is that regardless of what a person does they still are human and still have inherent value by virtue of being human. It's also the position of the video that human worth exists because God maintains that we are worth something.
humanism,2byjx9,archon88,1 point,Wed Jul 30 17:43:18 2014 UTC,"I don't particularly like phrasing like ""having done X doesn't diminish their value as a human being"" because it seems to miss the point. In modern language, we would say (perhaps more productively) that ""having done X doesn't negate their fundamental human rights"". Metaphysical concepts of value aren't that much use in the real world, whereas guarantees of basic rights can be, and we don't really find ourselves assessing how much people are ""worth"" in real life either (thankfully).  Value is a problematic concept in a lot of ways: if you say that everyone has infinite value, then hypothetically, it would seem, it is no worse to kill 100 people (or everyone) than to kill one person. Likewise, triage would seem to be somewhat immoral. So, my view is that concepts like value (in the transcendental or metaphysical sense) add a lot of confusion to discussions about ethics, and don't really help us to decide anything. I would focus instead on more practical considerations, such as guarantees of rights and liberties, and a basically utilitarian approach to ethics."

humanism,2bkmd3,thecornersoftoday,3,Thu Jul 24 18:43:41 2014 UTC,"Sure, religion has both good and bad aspects, but there's no good aspect of religion which requires adopting the whole. So it's absurd to talk about ""religion without the bad parts"", because that's not religion any more; it's just a bunch of good principles.  To follow the analogy, religion is a wrench with a chainsaw strapped to it. If you're very careful, you can use the wrench for good, but why wouldn't you just get rid of the chainsaw altogether and use just the wrench? And once you've done that, why would you still try to call the wrench alone ""religion""?"

To follow your excellent analogy, people tend to want to throw the wrench out with the chainsaw. All I'm saying is we should do exactly what you're suggesting and keep the wrench--the good principles--and get rid of the crap. The problem is that, unless the good principles are packaged in an accessible way and made readily available to the public as a valid replacement to the broken, harmful religions of old, they will just fade away. People need to be made aware that things like the Golden Rule and other good principles that permeate religion, myth, and philosophy, are human products, not divine, and that they emerged universally across time and culture because they are, in essence, universal truths. They have real value, now more than ever, but they are being neglected, forgotten, or ignored, simply because some of them emerged from religion.  In any case, I think we're more or less on the same page. Religion is just a structure, a way to bring good principles and ideas together into a coherent narrative of sorts."

I know some cynical atheists, sure, but the causation between that cynicism is backwards in my opinion: they are disdainful of religion because they have grown self-indulgent and logically-minded.

humanism,2bkmd3,sahuxley,1 point,Thu Jul 24 20:06:36 2014 UTC,"That's not my assertion at all, and that's my bad for communicating poorly. It's not that I think people who abandon religion are abandoning good principles; I don't think they had good principles even when they had religion, because none of the existing religions (Christianity, Islam, etc.) are working properly. They offer outdated explanations for things that we can explain with science now, and promote decidedly bad principles like the ones touted by the pseudo-Christian ultra-conservatives down in the US, or Islamic fundamentalists in the Middle-East. The problem with existing religions is that whatever good they contain is buried in a pile of barbaric, primitive, and harmful tenets. I'm proposing we dig those good principles out, piece them together, and make a secular religion for the modern world out of it.  The only way to deal with the major problems in the world today--income inequality, political corruption, climate change, war and prison for profit, etc.--is to unite the masses. In order to do this, we need a coherent movement. Atheism is not that movement, only a lack of belief. Secular humanism could be it but it lacks cohesiveness, purpose, and visibility. Another problem is dragging people who are currently under the spell of the Big Three religions out of their hypnosis without tossing them into a belief-vacuum. What better way than to introduce them to a belief system that pays homage to the best parts of the old religions without resorting to supernaturalism, bigotry, and subjective values?   Whatever you think of my opinion, I want to make sure you don't think I'm saying people without religion have no good values. I don't subscribe to any religion myself so making that assertion would mean I don't hold myself in very high esteem."

Drafted in 1950 by the then newly formed Council of Europe,  the convention entered into force on 3 September 1953. All Council of Europe member states are party to the Convention and new members are expected to ratify the convention at the earliest opportunity.   The Convention established the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Any person who feels his or her rights have been violated under the Convention by a state party can take a case to the Court. Judgements finding violations are binding on the States concerned and they are obliged to execute them. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe monitors the execution of judgements, particularly to ensure payment of the amounts awarded by the Court to the applicants in compensation for the damage they have sustained. The establishment of a Court to protect individuals from human rights violations is an innovative feature for an international convention on human rights, as it gives the individual an active role on the international arena (traditionally, only states are considered actors in international law). The European Convention is still the only international human rights agreement providing such a high degree of individual protection. State parties can also take cases against other state parties to the Court, although this power is rarely used.  The Convention has several protocols, which amend the convention framework.

It was the beginning of my questioning.  Edit: Added link becuase you probably won't understand it anyway, screw the mula-sem-cabeça too."
humanism,2b3iym,ZombineTM,2,Sat Jul 19 17:29:48 2014 UTC,"Saci-pererê:       Saci (pronounced: [saˈsi] or [sɐˈsi]) is a character commonly considered the best known character in Brazilian folklore. He is a one-legged black or mulatto youngster with holes in the palms of his hands, who smokes a pipe and wears a magical red cap that enables him to disappear and reappear wherever he wishes (usually in the middle of a dust devil). Considered an annoying prankster in most parts of Brazil, and a potentially dangerous and malicious creature in others, he nevertheless grants wishes to anyone who manages to trap him or steal his magic cap. However, his cap is often depicted as having a bad smell. Most people who claimed to have stolen this cap say they can never wash the smell away.

humanism,2b3iym,ZombineTM,2,Sat Jul 19 19:52:13 2014 UTC,"This line gets me to no end:   When the kids heard the religious stories, they should have said the character was pretend.   The issue here is that the kids hear of cultural figures they are used to and are far less quick to dismiss it. This has nothing to do with believing fact or fiction, the article title is a screw up - this has to do with whether kids will believe stories that align with their personal understanding of truth or not."
humanism,2b3iym,casabolg2,6,Sat Jul 19 09:38:58 2014 UTC,"But children with exposure to religion judged many characters in fantastical, but not explicitly religious stories, to also be real    The title is spot on. The religiously raised children were less able to recognize that fantastical, non-religious, stories were fictional. Nothing to do with familiarity, and all to do with comfort in believing fantastical stories as truth."

I find it hard to vote for a third party in the US (vote-throwing-away and all that) and I can never find a Republican I can stand to vote for.  Dems are the lesser of two evils, for me. If we had a Socialist party that was less marginalized than our current third-party options, I'd probably vote that."

humanism,2ayldf,duggtodeath,2,Fri Jul 18 12:49:20 2014 UTC,"Well all things need money to operate, an unfortunate set of circumstances. The real issue with money is not the amount, it is how you got it and what you do with it.   Another thing, yes in Zen as in Dudeism you can buy schwag and merch, but the Dharma and Dude-nature are not for sale, you can get those for free. You can learn all you need to know for free, but a cool t-shirt with the Dude or Buddha on it that'll be a couple of dollahs."

humanism,2ayldf,SolidBlues,1 point,Fri Jul 18 13:46:24 2014 UTC,"Well to a point. Studies indicate that at about $80,000 US is the cut-off for money making you happier. Up to that point one is not experiencing life enough because they can't afford it, after that point money can't buy no more love man.  We're stuck with this economic model for now, this will not be the case for ever. We should be starting to transition to a more modern model, one with a guaranteed basic income, as we will be losing most jobs to automation and robots over the next few decades. What we are beginning to experience is what economist Maynard Keynes described as ""technological unemployment"". He predicted that we would be working only 15 hours a week by 2030, and that we'd all be living a more prosperous life at that as well. This is doable, but humans are slaves to their evolution, and our DNA is more worried about what we might lose instead of what we stand to gain. For example, if I said we could all chill and make more money in the long run, but only if we pay higher taxes, then everyone freaks out.  ""Pay more taxes!!!!""  ""Yeah, but you'll be better off."" ""But when I become a bizzillionare I'll lose all that money to taxes, no way!"" ""B-but you drive a forklift for a living?"""

I'm not happy :(   Up to that point one is not experiencing life enough because they can't afford it, after that point money can't buy no more love man.   I would disagree. I grew up middle class poor and still got to travel, go on vacations, camp and go to amusement parks and more. Still got birthdays and Christmas presents. I was fortunate yes but we shouldn't paint everyone make under at amount as abject miserable. Indeed some people will have a hard time, but not everyone and not all the time. Some people may be very poor but may not let that impact how they find happiness. Not in all cases.   We're stuck with this economic model for now, this will not be the case for ever. We should be starting to transition to a more modern model, one with a guaranteed basic income, as we will be losing most jobs to automation and robots over the next few decades.   Fully agree. This is most likely the future as we transition to a society that is far more automated and efficient with scarce work."

humanism,2aulkn,Ouracutie33,2,Wed Jul 16 12:01:36 2014 UTC,"On 16th July, Giving What We Can and Global have will be hosting a free simulation experience, previously held at the World Economic Forum in Davos. High profile world leaders, including Richard Branson, Sheryl Sandberg and Jimmy Wales have taken part in the experience first hand.  The event consists of a series of scenes intended to simulate poverty. It's fun as well as interesting, and informative about what life in extreme poverty is like from a first hand perspective.  The aim is not to raise money, but awareness: Despite messages from mainstream poverty charities, experiencing even a hint of what daily degradation and struggles are like makes a huge difference to the empathy we might feel for people less fortunate than ourselves.  The simulation can change the way a person sees the world, and it is also completely free.

humanism,2askj8,OmegaRa,1 point,Tue Jul 15 20:10:40 2014 UTC,"Yes, Unitarian Universalists are often spiritual or religious humanists. From Wikipedia:  ""[Spiritual] humanism is an integration of humanist ethical philosophy with religious rituals and beliefs that center on human needs, interests, and abilities.""  ""In 1929 Charles Francis Potter founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included Julian Huxley, John Dewey, Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann. Potter was a minister from the Unitarian tradition and in 1930 he and his wife, Clara Cook Potter, published Humanism: A New Religion. Throughout the 1930s Potter was a well known advocate of women’s rights, access to birth control, ""civil divorce laws"", and an end to capital punishment.  A Humanist Manifesto, also known as Humanist Manifesto I to distinguish it from later Humanist Manifestos, was written in 1933 primarily by [Unitarian minister] Raymond Bragg and was published with thirty-four signatories. Unlike the later ones, the first manifesto talked of a new ""religion"", and referred to humanism as a religious movement meant to transcend and replace previous, deity-based religions.""  It must be said in addition that Ethical Culture was founded as a ""religion based on reason"" as well."
