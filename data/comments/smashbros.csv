smashbros,3e2ht6,8drawr,23,Tue Jul 21 18:36:23 2015 UTC,That was a questionable fsmash from boom
smashbros,3e2ht6,heydoopid,2,Tue Jul 21 13:41:05 2015 UTC,"easy to say in hindsight, it would work like 99% of the time, you need the pixel perfect spacing on falcon upb to get around it"

smashbros,3e2ht6,Rapta22,11,Tue Jul 21 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"what's best in 64 edgeguarding is often influenced by miniscule position differences and can be hard to say. it's hard to tell in gameplay what's 95% effective and what's 96% effective (for example) lol.  boom walked a way a bit before tavo upbed, possibly expecting him to upb immediately, but tavo paused a bit instead.  if boom waited at the edge to dsmash and tavo upbed immediately, you're put into a kind of 50/50  -if you try to dsmash as falcon is moving upwards, falcon can hold back and avoid it, similar to this gif  -if you try to wait until falcon is descending and about to grab the edge, falcon might go full forwards into you and you'll get hugged. it can be hard to react to this one if falcon is close enough so you might have to basically guess  there's short hop weak fair -> fair too should work pretty much 99% of the time as well, but occasionally falcon might get a hug depending on positioning minutia and you're in a worse position if that happens (tavo only got this punish because he read the roll/dash away)"

smashbros,3e2wql,Mikearoo123,63,Tue Jul 21 16:11:10 2015 UTC,"The ones against SFAT and Leffen are completely over the top but I think hbox knows it.   Confused by comments like ""he can't help it"". I'm not sure that's true. Notice how nowadays he first waits to fist-bump his opponent before he goes off. That's control - control that he could exert on the entirety of these manic pop offs. I think he's making a decision to pop off in this exaggerated a manner. It's entertaining and to a great number of people endearing. That doesn't imply good sportsmanship, but maybe he doesn't want to be a good sportsman in that respect (he covers it with the other stuff he does)."
smashbros,3e2wql,slow_poetry,39,Tue Jul 21 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"Idk if you know the context for the one against sfat but the circumstances were ridiculous. He went down like 2-0 in a best of five, won the next two games and then came back from a 3-1 stock deficit in that last game. Probably the best comeback of his career, the pop off is at least sort of understandable."
smashbros,3e2wql,schwm39,21,Tue Jul 21 17:02:45 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that really dislikes Hbox's popoffs? It just feels very disrespectful to go nuts without even shaking your opponent's hand. At least he's gotten better about it, I guess."
smashbros,3e2wql,DylanProductions5,12,Tue Jul 21 16:49:50 2015 UTC,It's pretty common opinion off of /r/smashbros that his popoffs are way over dramatic. Especially when you beat someone you're SUPPOSED to be beating lol.
smashbros,3e2wql,LIint,3,Tue Jul 21 18:53:14 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that be the equivalent of a touchdown dance? Sure you're suppose to be scoring them but why not?
smashbros,3e2wql,Theworstmaker,7,Tue Jul 21 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"Not really. That's more like poping off after every stock.  I like HBox, but his pop offs are obnoxious."
smashbros,3e2wql,nikovan_smash,2,Tue Jul 21 16:08:59 2015 UTC,so what you're saying is a touchdown dance = popping off after a single stock.   So a popoff after a set is like a popoff after a football game?... which isn't reasonable?
smashbros,3e2wql,Ampyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:02 2015 UTC,I'm saying that a popoff after a game is totally reasonable.  It's just that at times I feel his popoffs go a little too overboard.
smashbros,3e2wql,nikovan_smash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"He just seems like an emotional guy, if he wins a close game hes gonna let out his emotions.   I don't see whats so wrong with this, sure he could shake their hand first, but theirs nothing wrong with celebrating a win."
smashbros,3e2wql,Touitle,4,Tue Jul 21 18:07:28 2015 UTC,"I dont mind popoffs. As a matter of fact, as the terrible player that I am, I tend to do little popoffs whenever I beat someone better than me in my scene even in friendlies. However, I feel that, first of all, he pops off against players that he should comfortably beat, and second, his pop offs are way to exaggerated."
smashbros,3e2wql,nikovan_smash,2,Tue Jul 21 18:20:14 2015 UTC,"at least he doesnt scream ""WHOS NEXT"" after each win"
smashbros,3e2wql,Theworstmaker,22,Tue Jul 21 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"What hbox does would be more like of you caught a hail Mary pass with one hand, tip toe in the end zone, for a super bowl win as time expires."

smashbros,3e2wql,Skarfelt,6,Tue Jul 21 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"I've seen the other way though, where the winner shakes the guys hand and then goes nuts, and I""ve seen that look very forced.  I imagine the emotions are greatest right at the point of win, it makes more sense to just let yourself go off for a bit celebrating then go for the handshake. That's how it works in almost every other sport and competition."
smashbros,3e2wql,ESPORTS_HotBid,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that some of his popoffs just look fake. I mean seriously, crying over beating Leffen just didn't seem genuine to me."
smashbros,3e2wql,robbieclacy,4,Tue Jul 21 16:22:49 2015 UTC,Leffen was looking pretty good this year. People actually thought he was going to win EVO. HBox has every right to be happy after that win.
smashbros,3e2wql,RedBomberX,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:49:57 2015 UTC,There's being happy and how he reacted. It was only top 32 and winners side. Plup popped off less against Leffen and Mang0.

It's definitely possible to be passionate and respectful at the same time (it's ok to pop-off, just know your limits), and I definitely don't think any of the other gods are less devoted to the game than he is."

smashbros,3e2wql,ChedduhBob,4,Tue Jul 21 17:37:33 2015 UTC,I hate that too. As if all the other pro players aren't passionate about it. It always feels like HBox just wants the attention and starts crying when theres thousands watching him play.
smashbros,3e2wql,42147,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:13 2015 UTC,I really don't understand what's disrespectful about it. Players jump up screaming and cheering in literally every sport after a big win and no one ever thinks anything about it. Smash is the only community I've encountered where people expect players to behave otherwise.  Just won the NBA finals? Better go shake hands before you scream and pump your fists!  Got gold in the 100 M dash? Don't you dare raise your arms in triumph before you stop and shake hands!  Just beat your college rival? Make sure everyone exchanges pleasantries before you storm the field!
smashbros,3e2wql,Octavian-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"The thing is, in those sports that type of thing isn't the norm. Showing recognition to your opponent after a match is expected in Smash. That being said, Hbox isn't winning grand finals in ANY of these matches, in fact at times he's popping off in scenarios where he's the favorite to win! It just seems ridiculous to me."
smashbros,3e2wql,DylanProductions5,0,Tue Jul 21 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"The Paragon one against Armada AND the one against Mang0 were both GF's. Paragon was the first major he had one since like Apex 2012 or something like that, and he almost never beats Mang0, so those were HUGE moments for him Edit: not GF for Paragon, but he had basically won the tournament when he beat Armada given how awful that GF was for M2K"
smashbros,3e2wql,Vice_Captain_Bubbles,2,Tue Jul 21 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"Paragon wasn't grand finals, but you are right about the Mango one. And just so you know, the last major pre-Paragon was Apex 2010, not 2012. He did play in both GFs against Armada, so you may have mixed the two up."
smashbros,3e2wql,HallowedBeThyBrain,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, Paragon was WF, wasn't it? I forgot GF was that forgettable set against M2K where M2k just basically gave up because he struggles with Puff so much"
smashbros,3e2wql,Vice_Captain_Bubbles,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"Showing recognition to your opponent after a match is expected in Smash.   And he does...after he celebrates. Why is that disrespectful? He's not jumping up and giving him the finger or doing anything to take a shot at the other player. No reasonable person would feel slighted if they lost a big game and their opponent popped off. I've been in the situation dozens of times and never once felt slighted. Hell, hungrybox Held up armadas hand and cheered him on after Armada popped off without congratulating him. What is there to be upset about?   That being said, Hbox isn't winning grand finals in ANY of these matches, in fact at times he's popping off in scenarios where he's the favorite to win! It just seems ridiculous to me.   Maybe, but ridiculous doesn't mean disrespectful."
smashbros,3e2wql,Octavian-,4,Tue Jul 21 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Dude's hyped up, these games are always extremely tense. People shouldn't assume they have the right to see the same standard handshake-walkoff after every game."
smashbros,3e2wql,modwilly,3,Tue Jul 21 18:59:16 2015 UTC,It's just a Hungrybox hate circle jerk. Literally anyone in this comment section defending him or claiming they pop-off or referencing any sport with pop-offs is getting down voted. A large number of people just hate Hbox. It's the same as the Armada camps and is cheered while Hbox camps and is boo'ed thread. It has nothing to do with anything but blind hate.
smashbros,3e2wql,KillZacular,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"Idk what country you are from, but in America, every single sport we have down to bowling has pop offs as a very common occurrence. Heck, I've seen pop offs in poker.   I pop off with close games that are with friends, I don't know a single person who doesn't pop off after a close game. The level of the match only adds to the intensity of the already incoming reaction. I'm sorry you have such boring games but even Mew2King has popped off some low bracket matches that were close. Some people just get more intense or have less of a poker face while they are playing fighting games. Judging a single person over his emotional state is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. I'm sorry hes so different than you."
smashbros,3e2wql,KillZacular,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:18 2015 UTC,"What's ironic is that in the NBA finals, they actually do make a point to shake hands with the opponent first, granted they have a bunch a hugs before hand. Then the big celebration is in the locker room, because they don't want to go crazy on camera."
smashbros,3e2wql,saintmillion,3,Tue Jul 21 19:00:27 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the NBA finals? Popping off is the first thing they do. They shake hands before opening champaign bottles and holding the awards ceremony, but they always pop off first thing when the clock runs out."
smashbros,3e2wql,Octavian-,3,Tue Jul 21 18:50:32 2015 UTC,"Same with football, and baseball, and soccer. They pop-off and dance after every single freaking goal, but when Hbox does it, it's a sin.  Some of the people in this subreddit shock me with their blind stupidity."
smashbros,3e2wql,KillZacular,0,Tue Jul 21 18:15:45 2015 UTC,Eh I do pretty much the same thing he is doing when I win and I'm usually playing someone online with nothing on the table. Some of us show emotion when we win something.

smashbros,3e2wql,Brionac23,8,Tue Jul 21 16:16:18 2015 UTC,Every comment in this chain is complaints about his pop off being unsportsmanlike. It's also above the comment chain defending him.
smashbros,3e2wql,KillZacular,4,Tue Jul 21 16:56:12 2015 UTC,He's my favorite player. I didn't know who he was but I saw him win a match a while back and act like I do and I was like yep that's my guy.
smashbros,3e2wql,awfulmemory,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:24 2015 UTC,"It is really weird and out of character from him.  He's such a good sport literally all of the time except for his pop ups.

smashbros,3e2wql,steelcity_,6,Tue Jul 21 17:34:44 2015 UTC,Popping off against players below you is a sign of respect if anything. The fact that those players made a huge challenge for one of the greatest players ever is something to be proud of.

These people are selfish and inconsiderate."
smashbros,3e2wql,Fatitalianguido,12,Tue Jul 21 18:32:09 2015 UTC,Fox Puff is not 7-3 holy exaggerated shit. Puff does not have a worse Fox matchup than Peach/Pikachu.  7-3 or worse would imply that the matchup is essentially unviable at the highest levels of play (e.g. Puff Peach or Peach IC's)
smashbros,3e2wql,Hariooo,14,Tue Jul 21 18:05:23 2015 UTC,"Well according to this http://supersmashbros.wikia.com/wiki/Character_matchup_(SSBM) it's 70-30.

smashbros,3e2wql,robbieclacy,10,Tue Jul 21 17:57:28 2015 UTC,It is amazing to dissect his spacing and all of the tiny things that he does to get an advantage in every situation. His spacing and intelligence is so beyond almsot everyone (except the god of course). Im not a hug Hbox fan but you HAVE to respect him. Tbh I'm on /r/ssbm a lot more but I do nit like the mentality  that a lot of people here cultivate about Hbox. He may not be fun at the surface like mango but if you dissect the game amd appreciate it is just as emtertaining to watch. In my opinion at least.
smashbros,3e2wql,Fatitalianguido,4,Tue Jul 21 18:06:20 2015 UTC,"Say what you will about Hbox and his play style, but it's tough to not be happy for the guy when he's so passionate about the game"
smashbros,3e2wql,Rebel_Dinosaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:21 2015 UTC,You'd think differently of him if you actually knew him. All these fan boys stick up for him when all you know is what's at face value. The information you receive that he controls and filters. And I'm not talking gameplay

Mang0's persona is so arrogant yet everyone at tournaments go on about how they love him, and Hbox is loved online for his online persona and as a scene icon, but many people complain of his arrogance and attention speaking in person."
smashbros,3e2wql,robbieclacy,6,Tue Jul 21 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"You're looking at this wrong, none of these people know mango or hbox and most of them don't like/dislike them because of their personalities, they like mango because he's hype to watch and dislike hbox because he's not, regardless of how legit hbox's way to play is (I'd probably be doing the same if there was so much on the line). As a spectator, I want to be entertained, and the most entertaining players are my favorites, and altough I dislike the mangonation circlejerk I still like watching him, and it doesn't matter how much I respect hbox for playing such a shitty matchup, I still find his play boring to watch. I think this is a legit reason to like/dislike a person, regardless of their personality, everyone does it in every game/sport."
smashbros,3e2wql,Im_French,-6,Tue Jul 21 16:23:42 2015 UTC,I know him IRL.  He's a really fucking nice guy. Sounds like you're parroting what other top players have said about him. I find it hilarious when people don't call out the other gods for being just as arrogant (if not more) than hbox. Talking about Mang0 and Leffen. I love those guys too but they have gigantic egos but somehow Hbox gets the most hate for it. Stream monster culture mostly and hivemind bullshit.
smashbros,3e2wql,WeirdEraCont,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:00 2015 UTC,He does not like overly nerdy guys. And I agree
smashbros,3e2wql,Tragedy22,0,Tue Jul 21 17:27:42 2015 UTC,This is 100% accurate. If you ever knew the Hbox you would know that he is a gigantic douchebag.
smashbros,3e2wql,SimplisticBiscuit,-15,Tue Jul 21 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"As someone who's actually met the guy, I can say that he's just a regular ass guy. He's polite, very well-spoken, etc. Of course, this is just from one experience and it was a while back, but he's great to be around."
smashbros,3e2wql,FEEL_THE_BAYERN,20,Tue Jul 21 17:59:59 2015 UTC,When I met him he was an asshole and acted like he didn't have time for anybody.
smashbros,3e2wql,WeirdEraCont,-12,Tue Jul 21 18:27:07 2015 UTC,"Stop following top players around then? Armada has stated he wants a green room at tournaments so the fans don't bug him as much. Mango hates being pestered all day at tournies. It can get annoying. Just be normal and treat people with respect and give them space. If an opportunity arises to say hello, do it. They're just normal ass people who get A LOT of attention."

smashbros,3e2wql,WeirdEraCont,19,Tue Jul 21 17:00:13 2015 UTC,Maybe he was trying to concentrate on his next match ? Literally most other top players are like that to an extent.

I have a problem with him because in my experience he's an arrogant self centered prick. I used to LOVE him, like he was the reason I started playing smash. Now that I've met him, you can tell the way he acts online is super fake and if you met him, which I'm sure you haven't, you'd probably agree with me. Also, he wasn't focusing on his next match, like I said it was an hour before the tournament started. He hadn't even had his first match yet, and we were in pools, he had NOTHING to focus on, he wasn't doing shit."

You and your ONE measly interaction and here you go white knighting for him as I stated in my first comment. Ask the smash players that have been in the scene since the beginning. Really funny how everyone commenting that claims to know him is exposing him and everyone like you who met him once or talked to him once will stick up for him being a great guy. You're fucking retarded if you'll stick up for anyone's character good or bad off one measly conversation

smashbros,3e2wql,Han_Solo_Burger,5,Tue Jul 21 17:25:12 2015 UTC,A lot of people are passionate about the game who don't go bouncing around the stage after a close set. Most of those pop offs just seemed like poor sportsmanship.
smashbros,3e2wql,ChampionshipRounds,11,Tue Jul 21 18:29:23 2015 UTC,Some people show their passion differently. Simple as that.

smashbros,3e2wql,chiefkeefismydad,0,Tue Jul 21 19:01:57 2015 UTC,Exactly. I personally show my passion by punching the other guy in the face when I lose. I'm just being passionate though so don't worry!

smashbros,3e2wql,chiefkeefismydad,-4,Tue Jul 21 16:39:36 2015 UTC,"I was just making an outrageous analogy. You honestly don't think some of the popoffs were a bit rude to the other person? Armada was sitting there at the one point just waiting for hungrybox to shake his hand, you have plenty of time to celebrate afterwards.

smashbros,3e2wql,chiefkeefismydad,-5,Tue Jul 21 16:49:08 2015 UTC,Please don't tell me you actually believe that rationalization. Hungrybox had a much bigger popoff when he won the set between Armada in winners semis in Paragon.  Context is what correlates to the degree of the popoff. Which is bigger: winning winners semis in Paragon or grand finals at EVO? Not really comparable.
smashbros,3e2wql,Funkin_donuts,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:56 2015 UTC,That's not relevant. Armada still made Hungrybox wait for him to stop. How important the event was doesn't matter because it should still be rude according to you.

smashbros,3e2wql,modwilly,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:39 2015 UTC,"Chill out dude, here's what I think. When Hbox pops off, he he spends all match putting his focus into besting his opponent. For him, hype builds as he plays. When he wins (see the 3 stock Sfat comeback), of course that hype exploded. Many people keep their reactions to themselves, and that's fine. But having somebody who does this isn't bad. Thinking about it, the popoff shows he had a tough match, the opponent should take it as a compliment. Will his opponents feel worse about their loss? Maybe. But welcome to competitive play, that should be expected. (in addition, I wouldn't think it rude if someone held up their hand and tried, but someone popping off was too busy to notice so they just left)."
smashbros,3e2wql,chiefkeefismydad,0,Tue Jul 21 17:34:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I totally agree with that though.  The problem I have is when hungrybox instantly gets up, stands on his chair, throws his hands up, and makes Armada wait until his celebration ends. Why couldn't he shake his hand, then do his celebration? You're making him sit there and watch you, which is a bit rude."
smashbros,3e2wql,LAHasntKilledMeYet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:12 2015 UTC,"Why are they unsportsmanlike? He almost always shakes their hands or fist bumps his opponent afterward, if anything it's a compliment of their skill that he felt that challenged by his opponent. Plus, at least for a me as a spectator, pop-off's is part of what makes Smash Bros so hype and fun. If we just stood around and clapped politely like at a golf game, it would still be fun, but it definitely wouldn't be as intense and hype."

smashbros,3e37mr,Evictus,-9,Tue Jul 21 17:32:29 2015 UTC,Oh so you think he intentionally threw out the fair and died? No. It was definitely supposed to be upthrow to upair.
smashbros,3e37mr,RAINGUARD,17,Tue Jul 21 17:45:47 2015 UTC,"No, what I am saying is that he did the input for a fair (left on c-stick), which is relatively difficult to 'accidentally' do because the c-stick is analog with large tolerance. It is more likely that he went for the fair followup, but  I was wondering if that was optimal over a potential uair followup instead (though I consider that he perhaps knows the percentage that uthrow --> uair no longer works, and thus went for this)."
smashbros,3e37mr,Evictus,14,Tue Jul 21 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"hbox's DI was to the left, so mango probably tried to align himself with hbox but moved to the left too early which caused the fair to come out."

smashbros,3e37mr,xXEekumBokumXx,4,Tue Jul 21 18:54:08 2015 UTC,"He might actually have been going for a Fair to at least nick HBox, since it looks like Hbox SDI'd the lasers to the left and Fair would have hit while Uair might have whiffed. Also, from that position he would have needed to double jump and hold left if he wanted to get the clean Uair hit, but since Fair extends out so far he can  jump almost straight up and drift to the right which is what he does as he SDs at the end.

How would he do a long press?    If he just waited a bit longer before doing the next thing, how do you differentiate between that and a pause before starting the next letter?  I thought having two signal durations (whether it is audible, visual, whatever) was essential for Morse code to work.

smashbros,3e0wvn,ewd444,7,Tue Jul 21 14:43:48 2015 UTC,What makes the Sheik-ICs matchup so winnable for Chu?
smashbros,3e0wvn,ketusv,15,Tue Jul 21 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not an IC or Sheik player so someone confirm but mostly comes down to:  ICs have phenomenal lateral movement to bait out moves from sheik and then they can punish her very hard with grabs.  If sheik ends up off stage and has to up-b to the stage, it should be a stock. Ics can punish her harder than any other character in that lag with grabs.  Sheik has abysmal downward priority in the air and the ics have very good upward priority with all their moves. Juggling sheik is fairly easy and popping her up isn't hard either.  I believe SoPo can chaingrab Shiek and sheik cannot chaingrab the ics at all. Not to mention grab setups from Shiek are often met with a downsmash from NaNa. Also if they ics get split up, popo can get a grab on sheik, down throw chaingrab a few times, and wait for nana to catch up for the wobble.  Traditionally a good strategy to beat the ics is split them up and kill nana. Sheik lacks good ways to do this.  I believe the ics downsmash outpriotizes all of sheik's tilts. So in close combat or when approaching with a wavedash, the ics can just throw it out and sheik can't do much about it."
smashbros,3e0wvn,runner5678,2,Tue Jul 21 15:26:04 2015 UTC,Other than sheik being the worst top tier against Icies I do not know why Chu specifically is really good at the matchup.
smashbros,3e0wvn,ewd444,4,Tue Jul 21 15:18:06 2015 UTC,"Well, Chu being a super old school player, and way back in the day sheik was considered the best for many years. Obviously because sheik was considered the best many people played her, so someone like Chu should have a lot of experience against sheik, just as a lot of players today have tons of experience against Fox because everyone plays Fox."
smashbros,3e0wvn,zawersed,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"Sheik is bad against ICs. She doesn't have a safe approach, is prone to getting shield grabbed, and she usually relies heavily on a good grab game, which isn't helpful against two characters. It's not unwinnable, but an IC who knows how to get in on sheik can get grabs pretty well."

I pretty much get shined out of tech in place every time I try it. Then again, I don't play Sheik all that much.  These guys make it look easy because it's 2015 and the game came out in 2001. It's not really surprising we dug up a few people that could pull it off by then, and given how important knowing the Fox matchup is (doubly so as Sheik since it's her worst, possibly excepting the much rarer Ice Climbers?) it's not surprising that the Sheiks who made it far in Evo were quite capable of killing Fox off a grab.

The AI isn't necessarily smarter, it just does a couple things that happen to be convenient for practice stuff. (Make sure you put it in Player 2 as well, I think it might only work there? Haven't used my 20xx in a while, maybe that's changed)"
smashbros,3e0wvn,LifeSmash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:43 2015 UTC,I don't believe there is a firmware 5.4. You might want to doublecheck before modding.
smashbros,3e0wvn,AJ12AY,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:22 2015 UTC,It might be 5.3. Either way I don't think they've found a way to mod it. The only solution I saw that got positive reviews was a video on YouTube demonstrating modding it with a copy of Brawl and then something about stage settings.

smashbros,3e0wvn,darderp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:03 2015 UTC,"The ones where he knocked Leffen to the upper platforms to minimize the area to grab him and keep it going were ridiculous. Marth brought the hype on FD, with Scar's reaction to it. Awesome set, despite the flubs in game 3."

smashbros,3e0wvn,zawersed,3,Tue Jul 21 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"A comment on the video says she intended to instigate and play victim anyway.   She's a local anime player and not very bright (I'm pretty sure she has aspergers or something like that), she's a very much ""Social Justice Warrior"" like aswell. Anyway she was not happy with ShinBlade and the Memphis team at all and was pretty vocal to a few people about her not liking ShinBlade thinking he's a rude person and too loud for the tournament. So when ShinBlade starts popping off she decides to go up and grab him, trying to look like she's calming him down but mainly to bait a reaction out of him. Not only did she try to get him DQ'd but he wanted him to end up as another Aris CrossAssault situation and make it look like he attacked her and get some serious heat heading his way from shit like Kotaku and Polygon. I guess she's going off the logic that cause she's a girl people will believe her over the guy. She wasn't alone on this either, she told her friends, who are thirsty as fuck white knight nerds, this whole thing and they jumped in. Hence you can hear dudes in this video yelling to DQ him before anyone knew what was going on even though he did nothing wrong and she was the instigator. This seriously isn't the first time she's played the victim like this to get someone else in a fucked up situation either, on facebook right now she's making the whole situation revolve around her. Anyway TOs show up and try to figure out what the fuck happened ready to get the DQ hammer out, I didn't hear the conversation but I assume dudes with tapes and witnesses confirm that ShinBlade did nothing and the girl started it, tournament continues but I assume ShinBlade was told to keep the pop offs quiet. I just wanted to shed some light on the situation before Kotaku shows up and tries to make it look like ShinBlade assaulted a woman and how the FGC is mysoginst."""

smashbros,3e0wvn,2580374,7,Tue Jul 21 12:33:42 2015 UTC,"The thing is at 78% its not possible to regrab. His option was either fsmash or uptilt. If e uptilted he could get a nair or upair. Nair would send him less far than the prev tipper option. Upair would just rack up damage. Weve seen it from leffen multiple times s m2k and pp. if you go for more damage past 90 he just di's up so u can only upair him and now you can combo into a kill move.   Druggedfox picked the tipper option because at best leffen missed the di and dies, or at worst DF sets up an edgeguard scenario."
smashbros,3e0wvn,Osrsisignorant,5,Tue Jul 21 13:21:53 2015 UTC,"I only say too early of a tipper because I heard that from a previous source. I don't actually know marth that well, so at the time of that comment before you said anything, I thought it was a mistake on DF's part. But thank you for actually giving me some insight on that, because I honestly thought DF just got to nervous about the combo and went for an 'easy' option at that point.   Even though I know leffen should have won that match, DF just got me so hype I really wanted him to succeed with winning it, especially with how much damage he did with that stock."

I must say though, I don't mind nerfs/buffs in moderation like you see in LoL that are merely done to shift the meta. In FGC though, character loyalty is a much stronger thing, even at the highest level, so it upsets people more than usual.   WARNING; Non-Smash talk: A big example of balance though is the past 2 tournaments where SonicFox has been winning consistently using Kitana, which everyone thought was bottom 3, and now people are already calling for nerfs on her."

smashbros,3e36kp,Gold_Jacobson,11,Tue Jul 21 17:31:48 2015 UTC,"I get your point but the example you used isn't great. Villager's camping was working until someone picked Sheik... Okay, great? You can pick Sheik in most if not all situations and do well.   My point being if the only counterplay to a strategy is picking a certain top tier then it doesn't solve anything because overcentralisation still occurs. Villager's camping isn't at that level because there are plenty of characters who can get around it but yeah. Just switching to a top tier to beat a certain strategy doesn't always solve the issue."
smashbros,3e36kp,Thesilense,4,Tue Jul 21 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that Sheik, or any of the top tiers, are the end all be all answer to problems such as this.

smashbros,3e36kp,BorisAcornKing,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:25 2015 UTC,Op is suggesting that there are counters out there that haven't been discovered yet. They will be found. And that's better in the long run compared to banning or asking for nerfs.
smashbros,3e36kp,BorisAcornKing,4,Tue Jul 21 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"I'd love to hear more of Spooky's thoughts on this topic. During the stream, he was communicating with the chat. While Capt. Awesum was playing, the chat was going a little crazy with how boring they all considered the match to be.   Spooky kept saying how he doesn't understand why we hate watching customs villager. His favorite match is one between the rush down character and the heavy zoner. Obviously, that's just his opinion, but I do think smash players in general have a tendency to hate on anything that isn't as fast-paced as possible. Our roots are melee, after all.   We were definitely shown that the strategy was beatable. I also happen to think Sheik was not the best character choice to face customs villager, but I'm sure top level players know better than I do. Anyway, I think we just need to get over it. Certain characters reward defensive play, and that's just how it is."
smashbros,3e36kp,BorisAcornKing,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"It might be because Street Fighter is more slow and methodical compared to Smash's overall zaniness.   You might be on to something about fast paced love, seeing as most top tiers do well aggressively."
smashbros,3e36kp,realniralius,3,Tue Jul 21 18:29:11 2015 UTC,"I was watching that as well, and I noticed people were getting pretty mad at the heals...  But the thing is, the other player was just hadoken spamming on the other end for a good portion of those matches - the heal was a direct response and counter to that. How is that any less cheesy than healing it out? It's not like Elena was Gamerbee's main character and that that was all he ever did. He could, and Did respond effectively to the heals by taking the fight to Gamerbee instead of spamming hadoken defensively.  Also that grand finals! Amazing stuff."
smashbros,3e36kp,HokutoNoChen,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:01 2015 UTC,"The thing with Elena, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not particularly knowledgeable on the SF meta, is that she seems to be able to camp even without being assaulted be fireballs. She also has a bouncing fish like move that she can use against people getting within her range too easily.  That grand finals was a blast to watch."
smashbros,3e36kp,ThatHowYouGetAnts,2,Tue Jul 21 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"Oh neither am I - my only knowledge comes from watching top 8 the other day, so it might just be my own lack of knowledge. But she only gained Meter because she was able to absorb the fireballs - once they stopped coming and his opponent switched characters, he couldn't just heal it out from a safe distance all the time, since he needed to mix it up to gain Meter.  It just seemed that the 'free heals' he got were a direct result of his opponent feeding him."
smashbros,3e36kp,HokutoNoChen,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:32 2015 UTC,"The fireballs seemed to be a way of walling Elena out. Her range was pretty good from what I saw, and her combos were devastating. it seemed the best way to go on the offensive at the time was fireball spam to stay out of range. the only problem was the lack of follow ups after the fireball."
smashbros,3e36kp,madcanard5,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:58 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. It almost worked as well tbh - if not for that one last second heal, he would have won an extra game and Gamerbee would have finished in 3rd."
smashbros,3e36kp,Empiflor,3,Tue Jul 21 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"Man that set between Infiltration and Gamerbee was so stressful! Loved every second, that set was all about mental fortitude!"
smashbros,3e36kp,madcanard5,8,Tue Jul 21 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"But 'camping' in Street Fighter is still inherently way more interesting than its Smash counterpart. Street Fighter is incredibly defensive and ground based as it is, which is why it doesn't stand out as much when someone's 'camping' there, but in the relatively faster and more mobile Smash it really really stands out in an ugly contrast to the regular gameplay.  What's more because Smash has huge stages and mobility options and ledges and multiple projectiles out at a time [etc etc] the camping in Smash is so so so much more annoying and boring to watch."

smashbros,3e36kp,Windy-kun,4,Tue Jul 21 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"No one seemed to like the Elena play from that match, but I think the more pressing issue is how to combat it, rather than, whether or not it's interesting."
smashbros,3e36kp,CandyManJay,3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"But Smash 4 proved that combating camping is possible, at the end of the day most of the campers lost, if anything it's been proven to be worse than just playing a character like Sheik, ZSS or Rosalina.  So I don't get your post tbh, nobody's really calling for nerfs because of how it's strong, mostly everyone's just complaining as spectators because it's dull.  And yes, people complained about Elena as well on forums and such, but it wasn't nearly as grueling to watch as a villager hopping off the ledge repeatedly and chucking rockets."
smashbros,3e36kp,Mikearoo123,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:05 2015 UTC,If you're looking for a character specific counter to the planking custom villager then 2112 Palutena is the answer. I've no doubt in my mind using her reflect and set distance projectile would HUMILIATE anyone planking with villager.  I've never seen anyone do this and I don't know why.
smashbros,3e36kp,Arsenal7X,3,Tue Jul 21 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"I think a hard counter to Campy Villagers is Ness (and Lucas). They can heal themselves with the Balloons and the end of the Lloyd rocket. Ness can get some damage with his PK thunder. If the Villager is ahead and try to camp, you heal yourself."

smashbros,3e2e87,HybridTheory1,10,Tue Jul 21 15:29:27 2015 UTC,"You're kinda right with this comparison, but Shulk also has several inherent weaknesses that he can't really make up for no matter how much potential is unlocked, and that may be why people don't take the time. No idea about Ryu though."
smashbros,3e2e87,redbeanjelly,4,Tue Jul 21 15:18:20 2015 UTC,"As far as I've seen, Ryu's frame data is a hell of a lot better than Shulks. He can zone with projectiles, although linear ones, Focus Attack and FADC give him a lot of options and he can dish out damage like it's nothing. The only problem I see for him in tournament play is his lacking recovery. If you don't have a double jump against a character like, say, Shiek or Rosalina, you're going to have a hard time getting back to the ledge. Tatsu is super interruptible and aside from aerial FADC it's his only other recovery option if he isn't directly under the ledge."
smashbros,3e2e87,Gr4mm4rN4zi,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"Man, never though I'd see the terms ""tatsu"" and ""FADC"" in a discussion about Smash"

smashbros,3e2e87,Dalfgan_the_Blue,16,Tue Jul 21 14:01:16 2015 UTC,"I really think he has a lot of potential. A friend of mine is putting in a ton of work with Ryu and his combos are EXTREMELY good. He also has good range on certain attacks, and overall reminds me of Brawl Meta Knight in many aspects. The key difference is movement speed, hurtbox size and weight (Which all balance Ryu, whereas MK was broken). Ryu is VERY vulnerable to being combo'd himself, and he can't escape very well. He also has some bad match-ups (Shiek and ZSS come to mind).  I do not think he is the best character in the game, but I do believe he could be a strong tournament contender."
smashbros,3e2e87,NeoSeth,2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:22 2015 UTC,The matchup with Jigglypuff also seems to be more or less broken IMO if she decides to crouch under your moves.  Especially since she's based around gimping.
smashbros,3e2e87,ianmonroe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:16 2015 UTC,Yeah but Ryu can utterly destroy her with some of his kill moves. He also can outspace her and he's got HADOKEN if nothing else.

smashbros,3dzqd9,LotusFlare,8,Tue Jul 21 04:15:49 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the intensity of patriotism in the US, you should never jump to conclusions and always research the context. This applies for anything really. On stream it always shows the players' country of origin, as if that isn't enough context to why the chants were being yelled. Besides all of that, if I'm not wrong spectators at  soccer games (specifically the world cup) pretty much do the same thing. Sure patriotism is a big thing in the US, but it doesn't mean people should receive flak for cheering the USA chant at EVO, I mean, back in the day, smash was so small that having players from another country was relatively rare, of course representing your country during a match would happ en. Because of this, representing your country when facing a player from a different country has become a part of the way spectators interact with smash from a spectators standpoint. Like I've said before, this is no different from cheering for your country during the world cup, enough with the ""Murica is stoopid"" circle jerkage."
smashbros,3dzqd9,galactaghost,-4,Tue Jul 21 08:10:42 2015 UTC,"I think you should stop being so defensive about your country and think a bit harder about what you are saying, perhaps reading my comment again.  Americans ARE and will always be way more patriotic than any other country there is. You don't hear people from other countries say how much they are devoted and love their countries. And that's why foreigners MAY find it WEIRD compared to their countries. I'm not bashing nor anything of the like. I'm saying that the SENTIMENT is UNDERSTANDABLE for a foreigner to have.

There is nothing wrong with defending a topic, as long as it isn't baseless and soley orientated around emotion instead of attempting to construct a logical counterpoint.   P.S Nationalism was invented on a global scale after abolishing an old political structure, an entity known as ""empires"". It was essentially created to unify larger populations so in turn it would create less rebellion toward governing bodies. This meant pushing propaganda that was pro-patriatism, and usually involved supporting a single religion instead of being secular. The idea behind it was that less differentiating views and opinions = less disagreements and more obedience toward the government. The US is a very popular country and it is also influential, extreme patriatism exists everywhere, you are just focusing on ""the popular guy in town""."

It wasn't until the end of May or beginning of June when I found out that I was literally the only person he was in contact with about CRTs for Melee - up to that point collecting CRTs was a back-burner effort because I thought I was just adding a few to the already big amount. After finding that out, /u/diaTRopic and I contacted Blur who thought the CRTs were taken care of - from there Red Bull was contacted and we ended up having enough within days.

smashbros,3dzqd9,TheGuyWithFace,7,Tue Jul 21 03:59:23 2015 UTC,"The Gamecube used for SSBM outputs an analog signal.  You can convert that analog signal to digital for display on a modern LCD panel, but it introduces a latency for the conversion.  All gamecube games have it (as do, say, SNES games and such), but everything else at Evo is played on more modern machines that provide a digital output directly."

smashbros,3dzqd9,AttaBoyPhiL,2,Tue Jul 21 08:18:06 2015 UTC,"The only fix would be to get something that can turn standard inputs into HD to trick the tv, then use a gaming monitor. This was attempted with a device but unfortunately it had issues with black screen flashing sometimes. It could be possible if we really wanted it to but it'd be much more expensive than CRTs."
smashbros,3dzqd9,Epicallytossed,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:33 2015 UTC,"Any standard definition game, even brawl or older fighting games. Evo used to have a bunch of their own CRTs when they needed it prior to 2009. The reason is HD tvs like to upscale standard definition inputs which takes processing time.

I used to work at Gaming Generations, and have talked with them multiple times about big smash tournaments that are included in their larger FGC tournaments (such as Combo Breaker).   Gaming Generations definitely wants to support smash, and they do, but they lack something: easily accessible CRT's AND storage/mobility of said CRT's.  So to be clear, Gaming Generations does absolutely support smash, they just don't have the means to supply huge amounts of setups like they do for the other games.  I figured I'd just drop a line so people knew that GG supports all gaming, and they have been working on getting setups for smash for the future :)"

smashbros,3e39ii,Mr_Ivysaur,10,Tue Jul 21 16:56:55 2015 UTC,I'd really like to hear from some of the top players as to why they dislike customs.  Real talk: It's very telling that it seems to be unanimous among top players that customs should be off but the majority of /r/smashbros wants them on. There is a very clear divide in opinion among top players and more casual ones and I think we should shine a bit more light on it and figure out why.
smashbros,3e39ii,Octavian-,10,Tue Jul 21 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty clear why. Even ESAM who benefits from customs is against it. They aren't impossible to beat, but I think they do have make players better just from using them.  I truly don't think Captain Awesum would have made top 32 without custom villager. He may be good, but watching him and MJG you could tell who was actually better with Villager. MJG didn't rely on the customs to win near as much or at all as Captain Awesum did."

smashbros,3e39ii,InZaneByrd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:45 2015 UTC,"Thats not an excuse. Trash beating trash isnt an accomplishment, and shouldnt be brought up in a customs argument. Trash players shouldnt have a say. If something SIGNIFICANTLY raises the skillfloor while the ceiling stays the same, it lowers the competitive aspect of the game. A SKILL GAP, is what makes melee a success and will determine how successful smash4 will be. If we continue to lower it by adopting customs into the ruleset, smash4 will die fairly early. The initial argument was that customs balance out the game, which is wildly false. And with regular balance patches occurring, custom supporters no longer a have sufficient argument. Customs will no longer be legal, and if by the 0.00000001% chance that they remain legal, attendance, support, hype, and the game itself will die. Custom supporters got to enjoy their spotlight, but they wont get another lol."
smashbros,3e39ii,PlasmaVoid,4,Tue Jul 21 18:53:13 2015 UTC,Probably.  I had only lost two stocks by round 2 pools winners semis at Evo.  95% of players there were really bad.

And while SM is a good player, he basically spammed the custom Side B (or Down B) and Ally couldn't do shit about it."
smashbros,3e39ii,icnik,4,Tue Jul 21 17:11:34 2015 UTC,A silly reason to ban all customs though.
smashbros,3e39ii,OmegaLiar,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"That is why I made a fucking huge text instead of pointing just one single reason.  It is not ""It allow jank plays, ban it"".   It is ""there is a lot of problems about customs, ban it"".   Also, I'm not rooting for ban. I'm just okay with customs off, instead of being all pro customs like I was."
smashbros,3e39ii,OmegaLiar,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"There aren't a lot of problems, shown by the fact top level play was dominated by non customs, or maybe a couple of modifications.   When most customs come down to a strong variant and a faster one, or a difference in trajectory, its not fair to say learning the matchups is hard because they hardly change from vanilla.  If anything Evo proved that customs should remain, because skill won the day across the board, there were no consistent upsets or ""jank"" wins for the most part."
smashbros,3e39ii,OmegaLiar,8,Tue Jul 21 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry, did you read what I wrote?  There is a lot of reasons. The other dude, and you in the comment, are focusing only on point 1.  I gave a lot of other reasons there, and you might agree with it or not. Just don't come with ""A silly reason to ban all customs though"", because that reason is not the only problem that customs have."
smashbros,3e39ii,linklore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll address each point.   Jank:  You bring up moves that may be over powered, but are they really. heavy skull bash is powerful no doubt, but its a big move to commit to, is negated by shields, easy to punish on a miss and predictable. Now on top of this we saw it lead to rather comical SDs a fair amount, because push/wind type boxes are very effective at pushing it way off the boundary. It good, but its not amazing or OP. Now wind kong, not even gonna address that no DK made the top 32, but lets not worry about that. The move is stopped by a counter or an air dodge, is highly predictable, and that it. If it was OP it would at least get more results but it didn't. I could go on like this for a while if you feel the need to bring up other examples.   Pain to unlock:  Hardly an issue because you don't need every custom for every character to practice. unlocking every move for a set of 5-7 characters takes a reasonably amount of time, not too much. Further more easy exploits means a 3ds can easily load up a set of 10 customs to a wii. Its a bit extra in set up, but its really not so bad.   Balance Patches:  If you look, what do balance patches really do. They effect a character's core at average. Characters most often receive adjustments to their aerials, smash attacks, and tilts. Specials aren't touched nearly as often, but they are still updated too. Ike in the recent patch received reduced ending lag to all side special variants. So they are just as likely to be patched as anything else.  Pros and Japan hates them:  There is no uniform reason or conclusion as to why. Some say because of matchups, some say because of time commitment. None of that matters when the biggest smash tournament in the history of Sm4sh's life just happened and customs don't seem to have centralized any aspect of the meta. People who tried to spam ""jank"" moves lost. People with the highest skill won. Opinions aren't a compelling reason to remove a huge aspect of the games potential when the evidence thus far is in favor of them.   Turns out they don't make a great difference:  Then why remove them. Give them time to develop and who knows where it goes. It also makes way more sense to maybe ban certain moves that become problematic for extended periods of time, then just saying get rid of all of them."
smashbros,3e39ii,Rauyy,3,Tue Jul 21 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"Think about the added viability to other characters as the move sets continue to change, Ally's Marth could get a huge buff from it and become even more viable (Marths current set of 10 is not particularly good), and one character that becomes a little slower that hasn't been proven broken should not be weighed over the characters that get faster and more viable from the move sets (e.g. Captain Falcon, WFT, Pikachu, Marcina, Ike), and this doesn't include the characters that perfectly hard counter that one particular villager strategy, aka everything about custom Kirby. Other characters can do the same.   Also Ally won did he not."
smashbros,3e39ii,Barom1,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:40 2015 UTC,Yet they're not touching custom moves on patches. Ally won but the game was frustrating to watch. We all want Smash 4 to be appealing for fans right? Player like SM are not helping and they are benefitting from customs
smashbros,3e39ii,OmegaLiar,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:22:41 2015 UTC,"They are touching customs in patches. Off the top of my head, Dragon rush in 1.0.4, burning spindash in 1.0.6, explosive balloon trip in 1.0.8. Furthermore, any change to a standard is also made to the customs, meaning a ton of customs have been balanced."
smashbros,3e39ii,Barom1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:09 2015 UTC,"Manny plays exactly the same with customs on or off, and there is absolutely 0 evidence that customs allow him to camp more effectively or that they encourage camping."
smashbros,3e39ii,sWiTcH-e-RoO,8,Tue Jul 21 18:54:37 2015 UTC,"And fans all have different opinions. I watched those games (and a lot of time out matches) on the edge of my seat because I knew if it turned out those strategies were too effective we could lose customs for it, and yet skill took the day. Ally adapted and overcame a one-sided strategy. Your point would hold more weight if he had won, but he didn't. And anyone can nit pick, in any smash game. Look how intense and fast the rest of the top 8 or 16 was. overall the level of play was fast paced, and the finals reflected this."
smashbros,3e39ii,sWiTcH-e-RoO,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"Manny spams side-b with or without customs, go watch Manny vs. Anti at CEO and you will see that a Sonic spamming default spindash is just as hard to deal with as a sonic spamming hammer spindash."
smashbros,3e39ii,WSFpower,6,Tue Jul 21 18:25:27 2015 UTC,"There is no data copy and transfer.   You can in fact transfer customs from one version to the other. If someone has all the customs unlocked on 3DS (like me) you can just transfer custom sets to your Wii U or anyone else in need of them. It's time consuming but it's a solution to the unlock problem.  I haven't unlocked them all on Wii U yet but I got every single one on 3DS by grinding Smash Run to the point of getting sick of the damn thing, so I just made EVO sets on 3DS and copied them to my Wii U game. Not like I ever use customs but still."
smashbros,3e39ii,Rauyy,7,Tue Jul 21 17:19:28 2015 UTC,"It is a solution, but it is not accessible for everyone.  It is no brainer if you live in a capital in USA. But for many other cases, it is a huge problem indeed. And the fact that you can't transfer the custom moves, just the set, sucks hard."
smashbros,3e39ii,CasMat9,3,Tue Jul 21 17:22:20 2015 UTC,"That's why people make 10 specific custom sets (check out Amazing Ampharos' customs project) for every character so you create those 10 and transfer them over. It's an uniform system so that everyone that plays in a custom setting will be subject to the same sets that everyone else uses as well, instead of different TOs having all sorts of different custom sets all over the place creating inconsistency and confusion."
smashbros,3e39ii,Barom1,6,Tue Jul 21 18:31:50 2015 UTC,"1- I saw an argument against this the other day. The person mentioned Rosalina's down-b and how it completely dominates the Ness/Lucas MU. He then mentioned that if it was a custom move, it would surely be banned. But just because it had a 1 next to it, it stays. 2- There is this, but in case you don't have a turbo controller, I see other methods all the time about how to press the A button repeatedly. Otherwise, one can just go to any customs-on venue and download the sets from a setup that isn't being used 3- Customs do get balanced: sometimes on their own, or as the result of balancing a vanilla special move. To quote another person: ""In the patch notes, there are few if any changes to special moves, default or no. Even besides that, Ike/Link/Marth/Lucina all had customs adjusted in 1.08, Sonic had his burnig spin dash adjusted in 1.06, and a whole ton of characters had custom move adjustments in 1.0.4 1.0.8 Had a grand total of 6 changes to default special moves, compared to 5 for custom special moves."" 4- You're right, but I find a lot of pros are fine with it either way. 5- Wii Fit Trainer, regarded by many to be the worst character in the game, had two players in top 32 using her. Additionally, Dapuffster, using Mii brawler (a character that doesn't exist outside of customs on) was in winner's side of top 32. Furthermore, Trevonte (who used Palutena) made it into top 32."

smashbros,3e39ii,d4b3ss,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:51 2015 UTC,"Here's an argument.   1: Only the customs that significantly improve a character will matter in a tournament.  2: For a move to significantly improve a character, it must be generally applicable to multiple situations that come up in a match where that character did not already have good options.  3: Characters with only one good option for multiple situations are boring to watch.  Ergo, when customs actually matter at the highest level, it is in a way that makes the game boring.  Not an airtight argument, but I feel like its worth considering."
smashbros,3e39ii,Political_Gamer,4,Tue Jul 21 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"Only the customs that significantly improve a character will matter in a tournament.   That isn't true though....even tiny sidegrades can end up making a difference, like how ZSS's custom blaster improves her sheik MU which can give players like Nairo a better chance at taking out sheik players. (Didn't work out at EVO, exactly, but it still helped)"
smashbros,3e39ii,Jmacz,2,Tue Jul 21 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"Your logic is sound except, in my opinion, for point number 1. Diddy's Rocketbarrel custom, I think, does not significantly improve Diddy Kong, but it mattered in tournament when MVD was using it.   Diddy Kong has other ways of killing, and he has plenty of options out of a banana, but MVD used Rocketbarrel Attack to great success in tournament because it was his preferred option.  It's definitely worth considering, though, because characters like Palutena end up playing this way. Unfortunately, some characters (sonic, villager) will play this way even without customs."
smashbros,3e39ii,Thesilense,2,Tue Jul 21 18:52:33 2015 UTC,"I like your logic a lot actually. It's a similar reason why in most games once you get out of the shiny new phase of ""Holy shit that's a low tier character in a tournament match!"" watching low tiers play is incredibly boring. They are low tier because of their lack of good options, which lead them to returning to the same one or two strategies in neutral and redundant punish strings.   I remember there was a top player (no idea who it was) who said he disliked customs because he felt like they ""bypassed the neutral game"". The boring as a viewer and the linear-ness of the character as a player go hand in hand. Any thought in the neutral is ""bypassed"" because your custom move is a massive upgrade and is probably one of the best moves in your kit, so now you've railroaded yourself in playing neutral to use that one particular move to it's maximum effectiveness.  It's definitely a solid reason to dislike customs I feel, even if it's not an airtight argument against them entirely."
smashbros,3e39ii,Lizard_Buttock,5,Tue Jul 21 18:42:10 2015 UTC,"I sadly was not able to watch much of pools, where customs appeared to flourish much more than in the top 8. From what I saw, apart from cancer Villager builds, customs were fairly balanced against defaults and didn't require as much preparation. However, I got the vibe that the top players either didn't like their character's customs or were indirectly protesting having customs.  In a way, Evo had the worst result for the debate. The Smash community seems to believe in one ruleset for every tourney and nothing else. Evo showed that customs...are ok. There didn't appear to be a huge shift in the meta, nor that customs required skill changes, nor anything was broken. It just showed that it goes down to preference.  Maybe things will change as more custom tournaments come down the line. Honestly, I am hoping that both customs on and off tournaments exist in the future. I'm a player and spectator that likes variety. But as Evo showed, we'll have to wait and see."
smashbros,3e39ii,KickItNext,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:55:25 2015 UTC,"This is the same thing everyone always says, people have been bitching about custom Villager for months. We knew this would happen, and StaticManny was already playing like this at CEO. To me, the deciding factor on customs was ESAM. Everyone including myself thought he was going to run through everyone because of Pikachu's customs. But it turned out once he got into the top 8 they were a non factor. He even switched out from custom t-jolt against Abadango, and he couldn't hit a Heavy Skull Bash to save his life.   All you need is one good player to reveal the best way to fight against customs many think are unfair. It's happened countless times now."
smashbros,3e39ii,KickItNext,5,Tue Jul 21 18:14:41 2015 UTC,"Capt. Awesum executed his strategy extremely well to get to top 32. I don't think we can take that away from him by just saying ""oh it was only customs."" Static Manny, while extremely boring, plays that way with or without customs, and he is an exceptionally good player. IIRC he won more matches with default sonic than with customs sonic. I don't think we can draw any conclusions from their placements.  Customs are a pain to unlock. The logistical problem is the only argument I really agree with against customs, at this time. I believe I have the full custom repertoire for two characters in my entire roster (not including Palutena and the Miis). If the logistical problem proves too much for TO's, they should ban customs. That's on individual TO's only, and I stand by their decision, whatever it is.  I'm not really sure how I feel about the balance patch argument. What about all of the other things that went untouched? If a character was left untouched by a patch, should we ban them (sorry for the obvious straw man)? Obviously not. Some things are going to be changed and some aren't, that's the nature of patches. If patches keep coming, and customs then break the game as a result, we can ban them when that happens.  Top players have valuable opinions on character strengths and things like that. I don't think we can just use their opinions as an argument in this particular instance, since it doesn't seem to impact them as much to begin with. The top 8 was not particularly customs heavy, and top 3 had one custom. Sure, they had to beat some custom characters to get there, but they made it all the same. Additionally, the top 8 was more or less what people expected the top 8 to be.   I don't think customs ""not making a difference"" is an argument either way. On the one hand, pro-customs players say, ""No difference, so what's the harm?"" and that's valid. On the other hand, anti-customs says, ""no difference, so what's the point?"" and that's also valid. I read somewhere Palutena also made it into top 32. I think the point is that it gives some characters the potential o be so much better. Palutena in particular gets huge advantages from being allowed customs, and as you mentioned, imagine a WFT in top 32 without customs.   Overall, I think the biggest problem is everyone is pointing at EVO and trying to draw conclusions from it when we just can't. The only thing I'd point out from EVO is that it was by far the biggest smash 4 tournament ever, and the logistics of customs didn't appear to be an issue. We can't just point to one tournament and say, ""look nothing happened! [Ban/unban] customs!"" We need more information."
smashbros,3e39ii,kenniky,0,Tue Jul 21 18:42:36 2015 UTC,"The reason I like customs isn't because of balance. It's because a) it introduces more player choice and allows people to decide on their playstyle, and b) it makes matches more unpredictable and therefore more fun to watch and play (aside from campy villager, but that can easily be countered with a small degree of patience.)"
smashbros,3e39ii,KickItNext,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the mostly lack of customs in high placing really means a lot.  It crushes the idea that a few different customs (windkong, trip seed, etc) are totally broken and beat everything, since they absolutely didn't.  However, there's also a really good chance that a lot of players haven't practiced as much with customs and they're more comfortable without. Then you also have people still trying to unlike them all (raises hand) and so on.  I think customs are fine. There are some that make certain characters a bit better like fox's upB, and that's a good thing.  There are also some that are annoying, like campy villager, but people will likely figure out ways to beat that when players inevitably start spamming it in tournaments thinking it's OP because it got to top 32 in EVO.  With exposure comes adaptation. You can be boring and close-minded and just kill customs as a concept, or you can give people time to work them out. We saw it happen with windkong. At first it was totally broken, but then someone realized you just had to shield the first hit and then knock DK out of it, and now windkong really isn't anything special.  Trip seed villager will be the same as people play against it and learn to play against it.  And one last thing about customs, it buffs a lot of really low tier characters, and I like that. Most of my favorite characters are the mid-low tier ones, and a lot of them have customs that buff them. I don't want to see the top 8 eventually become who is the best at sheik or rosalina."
smashbros,3e39ii,Sethowar,5,Tue Jul 21 17:24:30 2015 UTC,"Wind Kong also have some accidental KOs, that it is hard to say that it is fair.  I don't have the gifs with me, but I saw a lot of people using Up B or jumping, and the windbox goes full retard and send the opponent straight to the blastzone, KOing it.   Anyway, like I'm repeating over and over in this topic, this is not the only problem with customs."
smashbros,3e39ii,papayasown,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:28:19 2015 UTC,"That's just windboxes in general being weird, and I don't think we're going to ban windboxes."
smashbros,3e39ii,angbad,4,Tue Jul 21 17:31:40 2015 UTC,"But custom moves double, maybe triple the number of characters that can have possession of windboxes. The only ones I can really think of in defaults are G+W, Link, and Palutena, and some extremely minor ones like Ness (PSI Magnet), Toon Link (dair), Sheik (Vanish), and Little Mac (KO Punch). You could also include Mario, Pac-Man, and Greninja if water counts. Adding customs, however, brings in DK, Dr. Mario, Bowser Jr., Zelda, Marth, Lucina, Ike, Luigi, and Bowser."

smashbros,3e39ii,FlameCannon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"1) Jank is opinion-based. I think Diddy's standard down B where he pulls a banana is ""jank"" too. It means nothing. All that matters is competitive integrity and none of the customs have shown a centralizing effect thusfar. People keep picking a new flavor of the week for customs that are going to break the game and it keeps getting shot down. Pikachu skull bash? ESAM is the only Pikachu doing anything with the character still and didn't even place as high as he could have with the character at Evo? DK Up B? Oh no! Will got 3rd at a tournament! We had better ban that move quickly or else Will might get 2nd next time! Villager? Highest placing villager at Evo was C Awesum and he was beaten by players who didn't even know how to combat his camping (Larry didn't even throw gravity grenandes at villager on the ledge).  2) It's not a pain to unlock. You get the custom set ups installed on your Wiiu and then you never have to touch it again. I have only unlocked Megaman customs on my Wiiu but I still have the entire cast's custom sets from bringing the Wiiu to a tournament.  3) Balance patches affect both custom and non custom so I'm not entirely sure how this relates.  4) This is a generalized opinion and statement. As I mentioned before, what ultimately matters is the competitive viability of customs and the future competitive integrity of the game. Customs have shown that the best players still win and that more characters are used throughout the tournament. This moves us away from a centralized metagame (sheik dittos on SV only) toward one with more options that can grow as time moves on.  5) Yes, customs didn't change that much in terms of placements. This disproves the kneejerk reaction of ""this move is janky and must be banned or everyone will use it and win!"" This is an argument FOR customs as it proves that the best players win, and the whole point of a tournament is to find the best player that day. side note: Abadango used Wario against sheik due to custom speed bike. Nairo switched between ZSS neutral Bs depending on the matchup. ESAM switched up his neutral Bs depending on the matchup/ counter pick. Manny changed his custom set depending on the match up/ stage (also note that hammer over B was not broken and had to be switched off of multiple times). Customs were used by many of the top 8 in various ways.   your smaller points: - Knowing match up knowledge is part of smash and ANY competitive game/ sport. This is a nonissue  -Equipment makes people glow in many cases and is recognizable. If you really want to dissuade people from ""accidentally"" using equipment just enforce harsh penalties like IRL tournaments do for players using wireless controllers- IE if their control disrupts a match they get auto DQed. -10 saved sets is a lot considering most characters have 2-3 main ones used max. -This point has not been proven yet and is difficult to speculate. Many thought that Mii brawler would not be balanced due to being a custom character, but his Bair was significantly nerfed in a previous patch (in addition to his up B). -This last point is not an issue in tournaments because we have a rule that you cannot create a custom set during a tournament match. You can upload your set from your 3DS to a Wiiu, but you cannot create a set in response to your opponent's tactics game one. Furthermore, most sets that are used are well-discussed in the respective character boards on smashboards and uploaded onto each Wiiu before the start of a tournament."

smashbros,3e39ii,Caststarman,-6,Tue Jul 21 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason why I'm becoming anti-custom is that, even though the game gets more variety with characters, I feel as though each individual character actually gets less variety in playstyles.  Take for example Donkey Kong. You can space your tools with bairs, down-tilt, nairs, and bait shields with grabs. You can mix up your options around, and be unpredictable with your opponent. However, why would you do any of that when you can just Dongnado?  Maybe a bit extreme example? Well as a Jr main who switches between 1111 and 1113 (big mecha-koopa), the point still stands. Usually, I have to place the mecha-koopa down in a position where I can apply pressure alongside it, as otherwise, the opponent can easily just grab it if it goes out on it's own. However, when I have big mecha-koopa, I just place it down and chuck it. No real thinking, if I have the time, just place it down and fish for 15% or good shield damage.  I'm not heavily experienced in customs as I am with default, so I suppose the argument is nullified due to lack of experience. But, through my experience, with the exceptions of Palutena, Ganondorf, and Charizard, most characters become Luigi-like or Pre-Patch-Diddy-like, where they suddenly have an excessively strong option, where most other options are no longer as valid because of it, and the character becomes one-track minded.  Just my thoughts is all."
smashbros,3e39ii,Caststarman,4,Tue Jul 21 17:33:09 2015 UTC,Yes it over centralizes gameplay around certain customs you got it.
smashbros,3e39ii,Caststarman,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:07:09 2015 UTC,"I'll only speak to years your point about top tiers still being top tiers.   Top tiers are top tiers because of their frame data and their normal moves moreso  than their specials. Just changing special moves won't change that fact.   But it gives the player more choice in how they want to play. If I wanted to use fast fireball instead of the normal one, I now have the option to. Its about having the ability to feel more comfortable with their character.   The complaint that the average player would have is that customs take too long to unlock. This is only an early issue as once you have them unlocked in the first place, you'll have them forever on that console.   The complaint that a pro might have is that they don't want to learn all these new matchups. This is easily mitigated by the fact that characters still are themselves. Go back to the top tier point to see why. Most of the custom names are pretty self explanatory, so if you have a list of the custom moves, you should be fine."
smashbros,3e39ii,TheStupidareFunny,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"Looking at the top tiers, they all have really good specials.  Sheik, Diddy, Rosalina Luigi, and Ness all have great specials. Mii Brawler is only top tier when he has access to specific specials.  So I don't really agree with the notion that characters are top tier regardless of their specials."
smashbros,3e39ii,OmegaLiar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I should have said something like only 1/3 the reason a top tier is a top tier is because of their specials.

It is not that simple. It takes much, much time to unlock, people just underestimate that. And every single player must agree to do the same.   Yes, the top tier argument have its holes. But it is not the only reason why I took my stance about the subject."
smashbros,3e39ii,balladofwindfishes,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:34 2015 UTC,"It isn't actually something every player has to do. It takes a fraction of the time on the 3ds version and you technically don't need to have any of the customs besides the legal sets. If you don't have the 3ds version, you can find someone who does have it finished pretty easily by bringing your Wii u to a tournament.   If that isn't an option for you, then you could use the turbo controller method which isn't fast, but it allows you to go about your day.   There are options that make it so you spend less time on the grind, but all of those options do come with the caveat that it isn't something 100% of the players can do."
smashbros,3e39ii,ToadsterOven,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:54 2015 UTC,"Not everyone knows someone who have everything unlocked on 3DS, and is also willing to lend the 3DS to do the transfer. Also, you can't created your own sets with the 3DS method.  There is some ways to make it easier, but you guys are just underestimating how problematic is to unlock the customs."
smashbros,3e39ii,balladofwindfishes,9,Tue Jul 21 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"For your first point, I covered that in my last post. But I'll say it again. The only custom moves you need are the ones legal on the custom move project. That means that you technically don't need to have any of then yourself as you can just get all of the sets from a 3ds. I did say tournament and not just friend. And I also said that not everyone can do this.   For the second, it isn't an underestimation if I have gone through that whole process of unlocking everything already. I actually don't have access to a friend or someone with a 3ds that has all the custom sets needed. So I did unlock them on my own."

smashbros,3e39ii,angbad,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"I was never for or against customs, but I'm leaning this way too. The one pro customs argument I really liked was that it balanced the game. Thinkaman made a huge, comprehensive post about how it was statistically proven to balance the game no matter what.  However, I think caring about this was an issue of the past, really. I supported customs because in 1.0.0, Doc Mario was, to me, one of the few characters that I considered absolutely not tournament viable. He was sooooo bad. Like inexcusably bad. I remember Palutena being way worse as well.  Customs seemed like a good a thing back then. Doc was usable. Palutena got way better. But patches kind of fixed that. They're never going to be high tier without customs, but they are still usable in tournament now. Charizard is even more viable now, and the customs didn't change that. I don't really care about everyone being equal anymore, I'll play PM for that. Without customs, I don't have to deal with Sheiks needles breaking my shield, and it won't be Matchup Simulator 3000 anymore, but I also already have my characters more balanced at the same time. More patches might make this even better, but who knows?  I say customs aren't worth the trouble at this point."

smashbros,3e39ii,InZaneByrd,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on customs:  Since day 1 I noticed customs and that they could be a viable thing, ATT equipment too but then I saw some of them being broken.  Let's look back at the CEO results...  Almost the same.  We just got a bigger international presence along with less travel Johns at EVO.  Do customs make a difference?  Ultimately, to get more people in the door.  Why wouldn't you want that, to maybe inspire some who may not want to play because they feel constrained (I know a few from Brawl) and maybe someone feels Customs should have been the way to play a character? (Palu, Miis, Ike, etc.)  Adding variety that does not break upper level play has been accepted everywhere else.  We're just demanding a little more from our pros to memorize customs and commit more to learning them.  I feel that the upper players just don't want to commit more match-up knowledge than vanilla, which is just pure laziness in my eyes.  You don't want to see / work around Sonic's Hammer Drop special?  How about we change Sheik's Fair?  People are going to opt for the low-effort, easy-win strategies that will suit them.  Personally, I'll play with or without customs.  My Mario benefits from customs, but my Yoshi can care less.  My Palutena near-requires them.  Customs off tourny?  Well, one of my characters is eliminated by rule.  Do you understand how annoying and harsh that is?  How about for a customs player?  They're probably not even going to join.  To some making play cash at locals, no customs is a kick in the pants for playing one less round and waiting 40 minutes less.  In my locals, I've noticed a rough 35% increase in players due to adaptation of customs.  This includes smaller and larger locals.  I don't know about you, but another $40 for another hour?  I know my top guys here don't complain about customs.  Match-ups?  Yes, and that's fine because we don't (actually) have a polarizing character.  Customs widen the meta, makes more people comfortable than not, and adds to diversity.  Thanks to the advice of my local best Villager 2 months ago, I can now defeat every Cillager (expect his) with 2-stocking in sight.  I've learned that more side-steps as Mario have granted me more set-ups against C-DK as opposed to shield.  If results reflected the customs having hard influence, then I'd be against them, but they don't.  I support the decision to have them or not.  I just warn that you make your tournament more club-like making more restrictions.  If you're cool with stagnation, then by all means.  Also, note to Ivy, that bit about WFT in top 32, are you saying WFT has no place in top 32?  Never mind customs, it just sounds like you're discounting Numbers' and Rendons' skill.  Did it help?  Yes, I won't let that off.  Deciding factor?  I don't think so.  I re-watched Numbers v NAKAT, and he uses Side and Up customs.  Weighted Header for space, and Jumbo Hoop for safe recovery.  Fox takes space easily, but NAKAT couldn't figure out how to punish Weighted.  So because NAKAT couldn't figure out one custom move, which he started to respect instead of contesting, Number won due to Customs?  I don't think so.  Numbers didn't even aggressively use Jumbo Hoop until round 3.  Point 1 is ""going to happen"" anyway.  Camping is going to happen.  YGO chain burn is going to happen.  MTG red deck wins is going to happen.  LoL Shaco / Teemo is going to happen.  MK Blue Shell / Lightning is going to happen.  Everything has something annoying, like how I think taxes (a necessary evil) are annoying but everyone lives with it anyway.  Point 2 is spot on.  I will never play 3DS classic mode again.  Point 3 is, while skewed, personally taken with a grain of salt.  IIRC Sakurai stated balancing the mid-range skill level, and the found changes tend to reflect that.  Point 4, culture has a hard bias on opinion.  For pros, I'm calling laziness.  Cop-outs?  I think not for Japan, at least.  The whole precision / the way it is mentality really hampers a lot of their variety.  That and (at least) students feel that anything outside of their realm is not worth their time at all.  Speaking from experience of culture, there are individuals who are exceptions.  Point 5 feels like it reinforces to put customs in tournies.  Once we over-come set-up (maybe an update will have a move select?) and ignorance (scene problem, it CAN go away with time), then the other problems become miniscule.  Sorry-not-sorry for giant post, halfway through I decided I was going to drop everything here and just reference this post over the next month.  As a TO, now that EVO is over, I'm going to allow custom move sets that were previously ""un-standard"" (I've got a Lucario main and Fox main that will be happy) to be pre-loaded at least on my Wii U.  I encourage everyone to have a ""local custom set"" so everyone gets what they want with customs."

smashbros,3e39ii,Quilava711,0,Tue Jul 21 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"But if a bad special move gets replaced with a good custom move, people complain about it....it seems people will look at ANYTHING as a reason to ban customs"
smashbros,3e39ii,ToadsterOven,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:29:36 2015 UTC,"The thing that matters the most to me is that Smash Wii U was great fun in EVO customs or not. So while I was a pro customs person just for the sake of allowing more variety of characters. We got plenty of variety at top 32 without the need of customs anyways. I'd rather have customs to stay. But I wont get angry if they dont.  Sheik does need a nerf though. I didn't wanted to be a ""hurr durr nerf and buff game"" guy, but she can overcome the default and customs scenario pretty easily it seems. And since the Smash dev team so far has proven they know how to balance, I can trust them to nerf Sheik without ruining her."
smashbros,3e39ii,Mithost,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"The moment you use the word ""jank"" to describe customs, you automatically lose your anti-customs argument. They are not ""jank"". Custom moves like Kong Cyclone proved to not be a big deal at all and Custom Villager didn't last much longer after he made Top 32 as other players figured out he was a one trick pony.  You don't have to unlock EVERY single custom move. Just unlock as many as you can for your mains/secondary characters. Also, 9 times out of 10, someone's going to be nice enough to transfer a full or near full set of custom moves from their 3DS to the Wii U being used at a tournament. Balance patches are nice indeed. What top players think about customs is irrelevant as the majority of them are petulant man children who would rather bitch on Twitter about trivial sm4sh things rather than y'know ADAPT to them like other fighting game pros do. cough Zero cough. With everyone else being for custom moves, the top players in sm4sh are literally going to have no choice but to be for them if they wish to keep being a part of the sm4sh community. Also, Japan has the same problem with crybabies not wanting to ADAPT to the metagame so their opinion is irrelevant as well.  They made a notably difference at EVO. Your points scream nothing but ""waaahhhh I don't want to adapt"""
smashbros,3e39ii,Barom1,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:33:00 2015 UTC,Top players opinions do matter.  You're stupid if you Don't think so.  They have played this game so much more than you. They probably know way more than you do too.  The casuals on r/smashbros should literally have 0 say in this debate
smashbros,3e39ii,Mithost,0,Tue Jul 21 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"Not as much as you think they do. Besides, if we let top players act as our community's mouthpiece for competitive sm4sh, it will only end badly as mobs of Zero fanboys have been proven to take anything and I mean ANYTHING he says whether on youtube or on Twitter as literal fact even if its just a spur of the moment opinion he has on (X) when his emotions get the better of him."

smashbros,3e39ii,Barom1,0,Tue Jul 21 18:29:09 2015 UTC,Its a known fact Zero likes to whine as much as other top sm4sh players. My point was aimed more at players who just plain refuse to put in the hours at improving their game and would rather complain about customs or what have you rather than adapt by practicing to overcome their own weaknesses.
smashbros,3e39ii,DrankeyKrang,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:36:00 2015 UTC,"Customs are fun to play with, but they are terrible to play against. Nearly everything that makes the low tiers viable just turn them into sonic-tier frustrating matchups (Villager camp, DK Airbender, etc), while all of the characters that stay ""fair"" and get better (Ganon, Palutena, Kirby) just get stomped by Sheik, Custom Villager, and Custom Pikachu.  edit: I forgot that you're not allowed to state your opinion on custom debate threads. Stay classy, /r/smashbros."

You dance for a while and they think ""hey, this guy's fat, there's no way he can turn on a dime from that dance""  You can quickly pivot away REALLY easily. Or even just roll.

smashbros,3dzdg2,optillamanus,12,Tue Jul 21 06:51:36 2015 UTC,You write a funny thing and post it to Reddit? Not allowed. Someone on a different site writes a funny thing and you post it to Reddit? A-OK. OP is literally rewarded for putting in less effort.
smashbros,3dzdg2,combatwombat121,8,Mon Jul 20 21:02:30 2015 UTC,"The general mod response at the time was NOT saying it was a poorly written piece. The idea is to keep the sub from being a place with a million different shitty text posts and occasionally some good ones, and letting a good one stay would probably encourage others to follow the example.  I see your point about the similarities here, I think an important difference is that the ESEX articles are coming from a writing staff that (presumably) has experience, credentials, and editors they have to go through. Self posts on reddit don't get any kind of quality assurance like that unless the mods go and individually judge each one. I can't see them doing that, so instead they took a more zero tolerance approach. I loved the post they deleted, but in the big picture it made sense. My opinion, at least."
smashbros,3dzdg2,TheCyclops,4,Mon Jul 20 20:50:29 2015 UTC,"This is my reasoning too. It's the same reason we are (were) much more lenient on tournament gameplay gifs than non-tournament play, quality control as you said.  I think in understanding that, it is important to realise that reddit is a link aggregation website and OC is not meant to be rewarded over good found content.  I can't say that I am 100% convinced by that overall reasoning though.  Additionally, I will say that I, personally, was disappointed with this article from ESEX. I don't think it's very original or clever and their previous Smash articles had more to them/seemed higher standard. But that's just my opinion.  You also might be wondering why it has taken/takes a while to get a response from us moderators sometimes. Partly it is due to activity, partly it is due to taking a while to think/consider and discuss what should be done, but also for me at last I was not keen to comment on this issue since last time I received some... unsavoury backlash.  I hope this gives some insight into why I haven't removed this post to anyone wondering."

Armed with momentum, Nairo proceeds to win every match from there, taking a set from ZeRo for the first time. ZeRo procedds to end in 3rd place, with Nairo and Mr. R agreeing to split their winnings, as well as the bounty. ZeRo, heartbroken, tears his scarf in half at the awards ceremony, and vows to come back in melee and destroy everyone.   Meanwhile in melee, the cosmic ripples mean that Mango isn't allowed into the Evo tournament hall, and is sent to jail. This means that Chudat advances by default. Leffen still loses because he's too busy laughing about Mango, but Hungrybox, realizing that he might actually be in trouble, leaves the stage to go find him and break him out. Chudat advances again, to face Plup in Loser's finals. Chudat wins Game 1 with 4 wobbles in a row, while Plup takes that time to get drunk. Drunk and ready, Plup, on a whim, switches to Pichu and asks to gentleman to Pokefloats, which Chudat promptly agrees to. Plup separates Popo and Nana easily using the floats' movement, but proceeds to get chaingrabbed by Sopo anyway. However, due to pokefloats, it ends up in an SD for Chudat also. This means that the game ends in Sudden death, with both players agreeing to play it out instead of a one-stock rematch. Chudat wins after Pichu kills himself, and is up, 2-0. Plup decides to take a break, and Game 3 is delayed for an hour, while Twitch chat complains about how ""Smash always goes over time"". The win is given to ChuDat, and Plup later tweets out that he completely forgot about the match. ChuDat advances to face Armada in Grand Finals (PPMD was mysteriously kidnapped), where he gets 3-0ed. However, as Armada is accepting his award, ZeRo challenges him to a.money match for all his Smash 4 winnings. Armada is pushed into it by ChuDat, and the battle begins. ZeRo reveals that he had been secretly practicing Melee with M2K in their basements for months, and beats Armada 3-0, in dominating fashion. ZeRo leaves the stage, throwing Armada's trophy and medal into the stands. Mango and Hungrybox become best friends after Hungrybox gets Mango out of jail.

No matter how much you refine your tech, no matter how many hours you play each week, you just can't beat them?  Now imagine that happening to you for about 6 years- meanwhile, said person is beloved in the scene while people hate on you for playing lame. Said person openly makes fun of you and shows no respect for the work you've put in. And then, at the biggest tournament of the year, you beat him.  This is what Hungrybox overcame. It wasn't just an in-game thing- Mango now has less ground upon which to base his disregard for HBox's skill. Personally, I got a gigantic justice boner listening to Mango disrespecting HBox in this video knowing that that he was going to have his words shoved back down his throat in a few weeks.

smashbros,3e1gn3,Coolthulu,4,Tue Jul 21 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"This is a specious argument. Coping with high levels of mental stress and applying mental stress to your opponent are fundamental skills to high level Smash, as fundamental as your wavedashes and spacing.    The pressure on both players during this set was insane - the crowd, the ThreEvo, the personal rivalry, the volatile match up. Both of them were cracking under it - Mango threw away two stocks. Hbox dropped edgeguards that should have ended Mango's game twice as fast, etc.    The mental game is completely integral to the Hbox v Mango matchup. Mango is famous for applying as much mental pressure to his opponents as he possibly can, till they collapse into scared defensive play. Hbox has said that in order to beat top Foxes, he needs to get in their head and make sure they're playing sloppy and with fear. He has postulated that he can never beat Mango because Mango is simply too confident against him. This time we found out what happens if Mango's nerves do get shaken.    You can complain about SDs all you want, but those are from decisions that Mango didn't have the presence of mind to back up - not crazy random happenstance. Those decisions do not happen in a vacuum - they happen because both players are working to undermine their opponent's mentality and shore up their own.       Hbox won because he made better decisions than Mango. He made better decisions because he beat Mango at dealing with the crazy pressure and applied enough of his own that Mango wasn't able to center himself.    You can say Mango beat Mango all you want, but Hbox legit outplayed Mango at the mental game. There's a reason why Mango dropped out to Hbox instead of Chu or Drugged Fox or whatever."
smashbros,3e1gn3,StealthRock,21,Tue Jul 21 15:25:41 2015 UTC,"Saying the difficulty of spaces is the reason mango lost is like saying that jigglypuff's floatiness/susceptibility to being laser camped and then killed at 60 is the reason hbox lost to armada, or any fox that beats him. Its true, but it's not an excuse, and both are just things players have to deal with as the trade offs for their characters' strengths."
smashbros,3e1gn3,Hariooo,7,Tue Jul 21 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"that's great but it's still the least convincing win ever.  like did anyone watch that set and think ""wow hbox played super well that last game""  hbox's run at evo 2014 where he went 2-3 against mango twice was actually more impressive by far."
smashbros,3e1gn3,jumpinjahosafa,9,Tue Jul 21 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I thought hbox played brilliantly. If your opponent has no answer to your strategy there is no reason at all to change it up. Notice he played completely differently vs armada? Mango lost because he got outplayed, armada won because he figured hbox out. EDIT: I'm speaking about the set as a whole not the last game in the set specifically."
smashbros,3e1gn3,chunkaroonied,-8,Tue Jul 21 12:11:52 2015 UTC,"Mango's answer to the strategy: 1st stock: Stole the ledge, forcing Hbox to airdodge and get killed 2nd stock: Takes the ledge again after scaring Hbox out of all his jumps and bairs him 3rd stock: Forces Hbox off the stage and counters the bair with his own oos   Clearly, Mango needs to move to Sweden to develop anti-ledge tactics. Anyway, to say Hbox played brilliantly in itself would be funny, considering how Mango was reading his movement and how spaghetti his edgeguards were that game. Hbox deserved the win, but it was a slopfest of a game that no one played 'brilliantly'"
smashbros,3e1gn3,jumpinjahosafa,4,Tue Jul 21 13:07:41 2015 UTC,"That specific game was sloppy, but the set as a whole was amazing to watch"
smashbros,3e1gn3,Hariooo,30,Tue Jul 21 13:55:19 2015 UTC,Notice how I said last game specifically. If you think having  your opponent suicide twice then almost losing anyway is some sort of strategic outplay then your standards are unusual
smashbros,3e1gn3,WinnieT97,26,Tue Jul 21 14:10:47 2015 UTC,"Mango's awesome. But you put it perfectly. I don't like how he treats him, and despite ""changing"" after Hbox burned his AMA to shambles, I always thought Mango never respected him. That upset felt sooo good."
smashbros,3e1gn3,_Sonicman_,33,Tue Jul 21 13:18:30 2015 UTC,"There are people who are going to say- ""Well, Mango SD'd a bunch of times""  Well, Mango isn't known for SD'ing (unlike M2K/Hax lol)- he was under pressure and he performed badly. How many other players can make Mango worry that way?"
smashbros,3e1gn3,RyeDo,15,Tue Jul 21 06:14:38 2015 UTC,"Why even go that far? Are we really going to say ""Hbox was so scary he made Mango SD"". Naw, Mango fucked up because he does that sometimes and is pretty notorious for it.  With that said, Mango ""throwing the match"" doesn't take away from HBox's win. Mango shouldn't have fucked up, and he should have just played better if he didn't want to walk away like a buster. Hbox deserved his placing based on results and not because of some shoulda coulda bullshit. Do I think Mango should have won? Yeah, but he fucked up and HBox doesn't suck so he took the win instead. On top of that, it's not like HBox didn't take him to game 3 without the SDs. I'm surprised it even went to game 3 knowing their record, but I still HBox's win was perfectly legitimate.  It's almost too convenient for Mango that he SD'd twice in game 3 because now people think that's a valid reason to say ""HBox didn't really win that"". Bullshit. Mango got careless in game 3 and simply got outplayed in the first game he lost. People don't want to call it like it is because they love/hate Mango or Hbox, so whatever.  EDIT: I'm even saying this as a total Mango fan. Mango acts like he is above losing to Hungrybox, but if that's really true then he should never lose. Ever. It was more than the SD's that fucked him, though obviously that was painful to watch as a fan. If Mango 2-0'd like he thinks he always should, then there wouldn't have been a game 3 to completely throw away. I can feel bad for the guy without denying HBox legitimately won."
smashbros,3e1gn3,AbidingTruth,15,Tue Jul 21 06:49:41 2015 UTC,"His win was legitimate and he did play well, but because of all the SDs, it's a little hard to say that Hbox outplayed Mango. He capitalized and took advantage of Mango's mistakes, but in my mind, that's not so much Hungrybox outplaying Mango than it is Hungrybox keeping it together more than Mango. Even after multiple SDs in game 3, Mango still managed to keep it close. Yes he choked and yes it was his fault, I get all that, but I don't think at all that Hungrybox is better than Mango because of this"
smashbros,3e1gn3,CaptainPDude,5,Tue Jul 21 08:15:10 2015 UTC,"I dunno, sometimes all you have to do to outplay someone is not kill yourself."
smashbros,3e1gn3,Ezmar,6,Tue Jul 21 09:03:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I'd say the person who didn't throw away 3 of his stocks could be argued to have outplayed the person who did."
smashbros,3e1gn3,RyeDo,5,Tue Jul 21 11:54:34 2015 UTC,"HBox could have undeniably outplayed Mango and 2-0'd him and the notion that HBox is better still wouldn't have meant anything because their record is heavily in Mango's favor.  Even so, Mango dropped game 2(?) because he got outplayed. That's not up for debate. Game 3 is the heartbreaker, but at the same time it doesn't matter who's better when you can't take the win. It sucks what happened, but Mango for sure was trying because he hates losing to HBox. I don't think it's fair to call the whole thing a fluke when HBox is clearly good enough to get second at EVO twice and even third."
smashbros,3e1gn3,Coolthulu,4,Tue Jul 21 15:10:19 2015 UTC,"Hbox outplayed Mango at surviving the Evo pressure. The mental aspects of Melee are just as important as your spacing and punish game, and Hbox was simply better at it than Mango was on Sunday."
smashbros,3e1gn3,AvatarTwasCheesy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:23:01 2015 UTC,Especially when EVERYONE in the fucking crowd sees you as the villain and boos constantly at your play.   I have a ton of respect for Hungrybox seeing that not affect him as much as it could've.
smashbros,3e1gn3,WheresGeno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"The only thing I personally didn't like about the set (and I'll admit to being a Mang0 fan) was how Hbox played the ledge briefly in game 3. Hbox had been only playing a super campy Puff to Armada's campy Fox. It was what he had to do. Since Evo 2013, Mango has been clear that he started to respect the way Hbox plays. Not who he is, but how he plays (for anyone who doesn't know, both of them have a history of being complete assholes to each other, though it's definitely easier to see Hbox's side as he can actually type coherently).   For me, it was disappointing to watch because Hbox still camped on Mang0 on Yoshi's, even though Mango was going toe to toe with Hbox. He even managed to punish Hbox on the ledge after about a minute. But, anyway, there was this whole thing about Armada's Fox, and then he did the same thing, seemingly unnecessarily, on Mango. I'm not saying it matters, and Hbox got the W, but it was still annoying to watch because of how unnecessary it was, and their matches were very exciting when they were actually fighting.   That being said, Mango lost. SDing doesn't change the fact that he lost. At the end of the day, it really just wasn't the GF I wanted to see presented at Evo. Mango/PP/Plup versus Armada would have been extremely exciting, for me anyway, but Hbox ended up clutching it out. For me, it's not really about defending Hbox or Mango, but really it's about the type of matches I wanted to see and the type of matches I wanted newcomers to experience."

smashbros,3e1gn3,Anvillain,4,Tue Jul 21 18:21:24 2015 UTC,I really have no sympathy for Hbox after he aired all his grievances with Mango in his AMA after he won EVO. One of the most petty things I've ever seen.

smashbros,3e1gn3,WinnieT97,6,Tue Jul 21 12:08:54 2015 UTC,"Destroying the AMA was bad for the publicity of SSBM, but I like to think despite being some impulse shit by Hbox, that being exposed like that to all of iama cause Mango to be a little more mature. I don't know if you remember Mango a few years back but I thought he was a straight up dick."
smashbros,3e1gn3,Ezmar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a good way to air out the dirty laundry, but rather than calling Hbox out on what he was doing, he went full Mang0 and completely put the guy down in an inarticulate manner.  it became clear that despite the way he went about it, all the stuff Hbox had said about Mang0's shit attitude towards him and total disrespect was all totally true."
smashbros,3e1gn3,CynicalTree,6,Tue Jul 21 12:13:44 2015 UTC,Mang0 needed a wake-up call because the community needs to be professional. A little back and forth is fine but Mang0 just dumped on someone putting their soul into the game and he did this for years. Mang0 knew he was better so he had no reason other than to inflate his ego and act like a dick.

A player as good as Mango shouldn't be throwing away his stocks like that, intentional or not.  Just because Hbox didn't take the stocks doesn't mean he didn't outplay Mango.  SD's DO count.  We DO take those.  just because they're all in one game doesn't change that.  Mango lost, Hbox won."

The mouse3 is very hard to press (bad if you use mouse3 for RTS) and the scroll isn't the best either (bad for bunnyhopping). Logitech is the way to go with mouses imo, especially since they literally give you free replacements and stuff for a very long time. Oh yeah, and the Razer mouse broke fairly early, he had to get it replaced or buy a new one, I forget which.  But if Razer makes a controller with Hori Gamepad/GC-esque shoulder buttons, Gamecube stick and C-Stick, and REGULAR AB and XY buttons, that'd be a godsend."

The cube controller is so close to being perfect, but the C-stick is suboptimal for aiming in an FPS.  The WiiU layout meanwhile uses the diamond layout (which is sad because the cube layout is one of the best layouts ever) and ditches the analog triggers.... for some reason.  If they made it so that the lower stick could be swapped for a C-stick style nub, say some kind of screw-on head, then that'd be even more perfect.  I also wouldn't mind if ZL/ZR were made a touch larger."

There's a well known streamer, bananasaurusrex, who would get their controllers because he speedruns platformers like IWBTG, Wings of Vi, etc.  His only reason for getting them was that the D-Pad had individual buttons instead of a rubber membrane.  So if you pressed left, there was no mistake that you pressed left and not left+up or left+down.  He returned at least 3 of them citing sticky buttons.  But they were the only ones on the market like that so he dealt with it till he learned how to do everything on keyboard instead.  And much recently, the bullshit that happened in SFIV grand finals where Momochi's fight stick fucked up and paused the match.  On a personal note, I have the Razer Naga.  Used it for FF14 and it's a great mouse...  Except I use a cloth mat and the laser sensors they use sometimes fuck up and ""lock up"" on those types of mats.

smashbros,3dzykv,Clopernicus,2,Tue Jul 21 03:56:01 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the most downvoted post in reddit is gilded as well.  Here's a link for the lowest I could find
smashbros,3dzykv,nnicider,3,Tue Jul 21 04:13:01 2015 UTC,Language changes. It's not set in stone at all. New words are created all the time (whether they stay is a different matter) and old words are used in different ways.
smashbros,3dzykv,Clopernicus,3,Tue Jul 21 03:47:35 2015 UTC,"Haha, I actually agree with you. It annoys me, but it's a thing in this community so what can you do?"
smashbros,3dzykv,nnicider,5,Tue Jul 21 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, its not just this community. Almost every community that has any level of competition uses it."
smashbros,3dzykv,AcousticConfusion,2,Tue Jul 21 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, I realize. I've seen it used among most of the FGC. It's always been a pet peeve of mine. But then again, I'm a guy who hates the word ""gamer"" on the basis that ""game,"" in this context, is not a verb! I realize I'm pretty much in the wrong here, but it still makes my eye twitch."
smashbros,3dzykv,Clopernicus,4,Tue Jul 21 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, man. I wont judge you. We all have pet peeves, yours just happens to be an unpopular one, apparently."
smashbros,3dzykv,AcousticConfusion,3,Tue Jul 21 03:20:02 2015 UTC,"It's not even FGC. It's just a normal word people use now. Like ""this party tonight is gonna be so hype."" Nothing video game related and my friends use it all the time."

smashbros,3dzykv,FreezieKO,16,Tue Jul 21 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"most of top16 are getting offers, remembers a lot of offers are often turned down for many reason like zero who is waiting for the right sponsor."
smashbros,3dzykv,Riku4,10,Mon Jul 20 22:45:26 2015 UTC,Nairo also once mentioned in his stream that he has received numerous sponsorship offers and that he's still thinking about his options. IIRC he said he's going to make his decision after EVO
smashbros,3dzykv,Horseketchup,5,Tue Jul 21 00:40:29 2015 UTC,Do you have any proof or can you give a list of those who have been offered (no mention of sponsors just those who have been getting offered)?
smashbros,3dzykv,para29,4,Tue Jul 21 00:35:36 2015 UTC,D1 confirmed that in a tweet where someone said that smash 4 people are getting lots of offers
smashbros,3dzykv,Teenbasketballstar,15,Tue Jul 21 05:09:56 2015 UTC,"For the record many players have been offered some sort of sponsor before, so when I speak of sponsors in recent tweets I speak about the big league ones comparable or equivalent to the Melee God ones."
smashbros,3dzykv,Hentrus,18,Tue Jul 21 05:47:31 2015 UTC,"I hope Abadango, Rain and Ranai get sponsors, because Japan is really good and DtN | Nietono and VGBC | aMSa are the only ones with sponsors."
smashbros,3dzykv,AvatarTwasCheesy,18,Tue Jul 21 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"Sponsors that actually fly out international players would help the scene tremendously.  Not only to raise awareness in their home countries, but it builds more legitimacy and makes for more interesting storylines."
smashbros,3dzykv,GinceVill,4,Tue Jul 21 01:50:04 2015 UTC,Abadango deserves a sponsorship!
smashbros,3dzykv,Crashman213,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:00 2015 UTC,He should be sponsored by Dole.
smashbros,3dzykv,BigC23,9,Tue Jul 21 17:12:33 2015 UTC,I have a friend who works with a LoL team who is almost ready to sign someone :) I think it is great that Sm4sh getting some love.
smashbros,3dzykv,Amaleplatypus,5,Tue Jul 21 03:54:38 2015 UTC,pls be T8 expanding to Smash
smashbros,3dzna5,Dalfgan_the_Blue,5,Mon Jul 20 20:45:27 2015 UTC,I just want to know if there is gonna be an updated Armada shirt now that he doesn't solo main Peach
smashbros,3dzna5,heyisjambo,10,Mon Jul 20 21:16:30 2015 UTC,Yeah we can add lasers and hbox hanging off the sides
smashbros,3dzna5,HyliaSymphonic,3,Mon Jul 20 21:30:16 2015 UTC,Or just add Fox as the captain of the ship
smashbros,3dzna5,Tonyy14,4,Mon Jul 20 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"I would want an AMA from any of the top players, but especially these two"
smashbros,3dzna5,sumcal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:31 2015 UTC,I proudly wore my Armada Shirt during top8 to cheer him on and was very excited for him to win despite him not doing it with Peach.  He is just a phenomenal player and truly an inspiration. Also a cutie.
smashbros,3e129z,aaa213,21,Tue Jul 21 03:27:09 2015 UTC,You either die the GOAT or live long enough to see yourself become a buster.
smashbros,3e129z,MageKraze,40,Tue Jul 21 15:09:27 2015 UTC,Leffen's giggle at 1:38 is so cute lmao
smashbros,3e129z,dunkeykang,31,Tue Jul 21 05:13:19 2015 UTC,Leffen is so cute lmao    ftfy
smashbros,3e129z,Practicalaviationcat,21,Tue Jul 21 09:50:36 2015 UTC,looking at his twitter lately you can see him slowly morphing into mango's protege
smashbros,3e129z,MamaSexyEggs,11,Tue Jul 21 13:11:59 2015 UTC,That salty hand shake though.
smashbros,3e129z,ShakeTheDust143,74,Tue Jul 21 10:02:30 2015 UTC,Throwing that medal was hype as fuck. I don't even care
smashbros,3e129z,hornestur,-45,Tue Jul 21 04:06:09 2015 UTC,Acting like a child is now hype.  Aight.
smashbros,3e129z,BleepBloopBoom,24,Tue Jul 21 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"He wasn't acting like a child, Mang0 entered Evo with one mission, winning. A 5th place medal would only remind him he failed at that, so when he heard the crowd chanting his name he thought he'd give it to the fans."
smashbros,3e129z,Lyn_The_Myrmidon,-27,Tue Jul 21 13:49:50 2015 UTC,"Its a pathetic, childish reaction. Imagine if an Olympic silver or bronze medalist threw a tantrum like that and tossed their medal in to the crowd. Or the runner up of a grand slam etc. The 'it's a symbol of how much he wanted to win' excuse is laughable as well, like every pro sports person ever doesn't want to win just as much. Its no surprise e-sports and especially smash brothers is a laughing stock when pathetic behaviour like that not only occurs but is considered acceptable by a large portion of the fanbase.."
smashbros,3e129z,LongSchlongJohnson2,12,Tue Jul 21 18:51:53 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that most of mangos fanbase is just as immature as he is.   So they are bound to rationalize his actions, or not even comprehend how immature his actions are."
smashbros,3e129z,BleepBloopBoom,0,Tue Jul 21 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"It looked to me like he was just salty, especially watching him after he throws the medal and his reaction to HBox's getting his own medal.  Either way a salty mango is pretty funny, but I don't see the hype in it."
smashbros,3e129z,BleepBloopBoom,20,Tue Jul 21 13:59:08 2015 UTC,"People keep going to the Hbox thumbs down to support it being a somewhat childish reaction but that felt more like 60% trying to recoop his mood and play into the rivalry for fans, what makes him seem childish in that moment is really his body language. He walks up late with eyes down, arms stiff, never makes eye contact with bald-presenter-guy and sticks his hand out like, 'just give me the fuckin' thing.'  He gets in a little sarcastic wink and rips it off his head like it burns.  Dude is forcing out a smile but he's clearly not being a good sport here... and it's generally kind of shitty to immediately throw away the award presented to you like it's worthless garbage (regardless of if that's how you feel about it or not.)  I'm sure the people running EVO are adults and didn't get their feelings hurt by it or anything but it was a bit disrespectful.  Much better to be a good sport and swallow your pride.  Toss it afterwards or something.  My two cents."
smashbros,3e129z,ChaseSuddarth,13,Tue Jul 21 15:38:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats pretty childish behaviour if you ask me. But not everyone can be a graceful loser, so I get it.   I love all the salt from him and his fanboys though, that's the best thing about all this."
smashbros,3e129z,BleepBloopBoom,5,Tue Jul 21 18:30:07 2015 UTC,"It hurts so much to watch every time, he allllmost comes all the way back ;~;"
smashbros,3e129z,ahampster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:30 2015 UTC,"have you ever noticed how often this happens for him?  ""Man I'm losing by 2 stocks at EVO. Better start trying.""  kills the other guy twice only taking 30% damage  ""ok, now it's back to normal."""
smashbros,3e129z,ManWithYourPlan,44,Tue Jul 21 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree. He's at his best when his back is against the wall. That's why ""Loser's Bracket Mango"" exists, and I'm pretty sure he's admitted that Melee is at its best when it's last stock, pressure's on, and you need to clutch it out. That's where Mango thrives"
smashbros,3e129z,MyPostHas,66,Tue Jul 21 15:04:36 2015 UTC,Really it doesn't help much when everyone else can play well AND not throw themselves off the stage.
smashbros,3e129z,Heroic_Lime,0,Tue Jul 21 18:11:32 2015 UTC,goddamn he would have won game 3 without those SDs
smashbros,3e129z,McJiggins,2,Tue Jul 21 05:03:43 2015 UTC,such is the life of a buster
smashbros,3e129z,Baloobadooby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:35:06 2015 UTC,"Goddam, he would have won if he were playing better right? Or Hbox would have lost if he were playing worse?  Focus on what happened. Not what could have happened."
smashbros,3e129z,canwegoback,-6,Tue Jul 21 17:12:44 2015 UTC,"A lot of times this stance is sensible, but anyone watching can see how Mango threw the game away in this particular instance."
smashbros,3e129z,DovreMountainKing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:37 2015 UTC,especially game 2 i was so sad for mango especially since im sure he's not a huge fan of how he lost
smashbros,3e129z,alchupanebra,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:18:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so sure.  Yeah Hbox wasn't playing well but Hbox can be crazy clutch too, if it had been closer I bet he would have been playing better, it wouldn't surprise me if the SDs and early lead threw him off a little bit.  edit- downvoting my opinion won't make 3vo happen for you guys, but this might help"
smashbros,3e129z,Stitchface,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:55 2015 UTC,"He brought him all the way down to stock 1 after three sds, two of which were on HBox's first stock.  Yeah he would've won."
smashbros,3e129z,JavelinTF2,13,Tue Jul 21 16:31:06 2015 UTC,I saw the match too.    I guess the 3rd stock could be called an SD although Hbox would have easily taken it if he had gone for up-b instead on Side-b so it was really just a desperation move.  And have you never seen hbox take 3 stocks from a fox on his last stock?  He's certainly done it to Mango multiple times before.  But hey I guess you can see into an alternate dimension that I don't have access to where mango didn't SD and won easily.
smashbros,3e129z,Stitchface,12,Tue Jul 21 16:40:59 2015 UTC,"Regardless of Mango beating HBox or not, I still dont think Mango would've won EVO."
smashbros,3e129z,JavelinTF2,43,Tue Jul 21 18:50:55 2015 UTC,literally can't watch the video. Hurts too much :'(
smashbros,3e129z,worldpeacee,19,Tue Jul 21 07:39:24 2015 UTC,"Mango, we know, we know you were ripe for winning this tourney. You weren't phased through 2 SDs. You could have ran through the remaining 4. Damnit."
smashbros,3e129z,FuckingQWOPguy,3,Tue Jul 21 10:00:06 2015 UTC,fuck bo3's in top 8
smashbros,3e129z,Weis,3,Tue Jul 21 11:52:05 2015 UTC,"Don't even know why you got downvoted. Regardless of the outcome of the games in EVO, we should all be able to agree that bo3 in top 8 is pretty shitty."
smashbros,3e129z,2580374,3,Tue Jul 21 12:55:34 2015 UTC,"Everyone had a heart attack and a half when Apex had bo5's for top 8, so TO's are restricting it to just WF, LF, and GF in the interest of time for the tourny."
smashbros,3e129z,PhyrexianBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:47 2015 UTC,"I know why they did bo3, I'm just not agreeing that it's the best thing to do."
smashbros,3e129z,2580374,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:22 2015 UTC,"Right, because losing to Plup totally shows how ready he was for this tournament."
smashbros,3e129z,canwegoback,6,Tue Jul 21 17:13:40 2015 UTC,plup is really good
smashbros,3e129z,alchupanebra,3,Tue Jul 21 18:19:37 2015 UTC,"Meh, bo3. That can happen to anyone.   I'm kinda glad it happened. If leffen beat plup in losers, mango would have had to beat the other 4 gods to win 3vo, which would have been one hell of a run."
smashbros,3e129z,FuckingQWOPguy,3,Tue Jul 21 18:50:27 2015 UTC,"Oh man, what was that awesome melee menu remix at the end of this video?"
smashbros,3e129z,Gatoraay,8,Tue Jul 21 07:02:57 2015 UTC,We still love you mango. Forever the GOAT.
smashbros,3e129z,RocketBun,2,Tue Jul 21 09:02:25 2015 UTC,"Watching it again, my thoughts about the match are reinforced - Mango was playing like he didn't care in that Game 3! And that's not me making excuses for Mango, that's me questioning some of these atrocious mistakes. Watching that live, there were times where I actually shouted ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MANGO?""   He really did throw away those stocks, you'd THINK he'd be more careful in that LOSERS BRACKET TOP 8 situation. I dunno what was going through his mind at that time but tbh I think he could have won, had he been more careful. In any case, Hbox winning that set was a big moment for him and I was really happy for him, despite the crushed 3VO dream haha."
smashbros,3e129z,ZeroManAlpha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:36 2015 UTC,"It felt like he was playing under the assumption that he'd always be able to clutch something out and come back from unscalable depths, as he has so often in the past.   But sometimes the hole you dig yourself is too deep"
smashbros,3e129z,GruxKing,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:14:40 2015 UTC,Hurts to watch
smashbros,3e129z,raine8,8,Tue Jul 21 10:48:01 2015 UTC,"I think the world is a better place if we all just agree that Hbox vs mango evo 2015 never even happened, and we stop talking about it forever."
smashbros,3e129z,t-steak,5,Tue Jul 21 08:34:07 2015 UTC,"I love Mango and all, but he made himself look like a dick with how he acted. Lose with some grace, even if it was in such a heartbreaking manner."
smashbros,3e129z,jjacobsnd5,6,Tue Jul 21 06:57:24 2015 UTC,All the fanboys downvoting you lol. Mango still has some growing up to do. There's no need to make some giant spectacle out of losing just because you went out like a buster
smashbros,3e129z,ryanhosn,5,Tue Jul 21 13:33:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly my point. If he's gonna be the face of Melee, and Melee is going to continue to grow, he needs to be a bit more graceful in losing. Absolutely be pissed, but don't be a fucking man-child."
smashbros,3e129z,jjacobsnd5,0,Tue Jul 21 14:12:51 2015 UTC,"We can have hungrybox literally cry and jump around for the camera for when he wins a top 32 game... Also the crowd, the players and the community all love mang0 that's why it was such a big deal"
smashbros,3e129z,robbieclacy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"There are different standards to how one should react to a win and a loss. The winner should be celebrated and is allowed to do a some grandstanding. The loser shouldn't make it about them, which is exactly Mango did, though I am sure that wasn't his intention.  It is like with any form of competition. The biggest names have the most scrutiny. If Lebron James acts like a baby and storms of the court without shaking hands, he gets called on it. Not so much if some no name bench rider does it. If you wanna be the face of Smash, you gotta expect higher levels of scrutiny."
smashbros,3e129z,jjacobsnd5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:05 2015 UTC,"Uh you do realize whether hbox wins or loses he completely makes a scene for himself, if he wins he pops off WAY over the top, if he loses a close set he literally sits in his chair crying (or at least close to it).  As for mango, this was probably one of his worst losses in his life. He completely choked on the main stage against someone that almost never has a chance at touching him, in the worst way possible. What do you want from mango, honestly? He shook his hand, shook his head and walked off. He didn't ""act like a man-child"" in any regard."
smashbros,3e129z,LIint,5,Tue Jul 21 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not singling out Mango here, I said I would get on anyone who acted that way. If HBox did, I would be disappointed in him. And I expect Mango to lose with some measure of grace, not throw down his controller and toss his medal into the crowd (though I'm okay with the latter). It sucks to lose, I get it. But act like you've been there before."
smashbros,3e129z,jjacobsnd5,-8,Tue Jul 21 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you're doing, saying that on a subreddit that jizzes over fanart of the man."
smashbros,3e129z,Whalerider725,9,Tue Jul 21 11:03:55 2015 UTC,"Haha I don't care about my fake internet points. As I said I like Mango, but if people really can't see he was acting childish, fuck 'em."
smashbros,3e129z,jjacobsnd5,4,Tue Jul 21 14:11:42 2015 UTC,"I think he still lost like a champ, fuck that 5th place noise, he'll come back stronger and it seems that's his way of letting it be known."
smashbros,3e129z,straightcrooked,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:35:54 2015 UTC,"No. PPMD loses like a champ. Armada loses like a champ. When other players set the bar so low in terms of losing gracefully, it really says something when one of these guys doesn't."
smashbros,3e129z,GruxKing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:14 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head. We have other people who lose graciously, but sadly they aren't the face of Smash, at least not yet. I wish Mango would grow up a little bit. I love his fire, but it doesn't look good on Melee if our biggest name acts this way as we are really starting to grow as a scene."
smashbros,3e129z,jjacobsnd5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:41 2015 UTC,"So acting immature on the biggest stage for Smash EVER is losing like a champ? Come on man, I am a Mango fan too, but you can't be blind to the fact that he made himself look foolish with the way he acted."
smashbros,3e129z,jjacobsnd5,11,Tue Jul 21 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"""This is so intense right now."""
smashbros,3e129z,anothershittyalt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:13:39 2015 UTC,Did he shorten that illusion for the failed recovery? That's what it looked like.
smashbros,3e129z,tbwnz,-2,Tue Jul 21 06:32:38 2015 UTC,"No, but he cut his midair jump short. Had he waited longer, he could have gotten either Randall or the ledge."
smashbros,3e129z,Kered13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:39 2015 UTC,IMO that's full length.
smashbros,3e129z,Timestop-,-24,Tue Jul 21 08:04:10 2015 UTC,Yeah
smashbros,3e129z,Magical_Cunt,21,Tue Jul 21 07:36:21 2015 UTC,"no, thats a full illusion. if he waited to get some extra distance with his double jump and then did the side B he would have made it back no problem."
smashbros,3e129z,raulduke05,16,Tue Jul 21 16:24:04 2015 UTC,That's from Apex...
smashbros,3e0r90,posthocstudio,57,Tue Jul 21 01:54:50 2015 UTC,"This is an amazing idea. With huge tournaments like this last Evo Melee stream reaching 200k+ viewers, I'm sure the top players will get a reasonable amount of prize money, compared to prize pools like Street Fighter."
smashbros,3e0r90,blakenab,12,Tue Jul 21 01:58:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's a superb idea and DOTA 2 is already doing it, but the major difference is that you're getting at least something in game for it (compendium). SSB could never have the same thing unless Nintendo would specifically ship a DLC that supports such a feature. I'm sure the prize pools would still get bigger, but I'm not sure just how successful such a crowdfunding approach would be..."
smashbros,3e0r90,Vetano,18,Tue Jul 21 10:24:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, the worst that could happen is that no one donates and then the prize pool stays the same? It seems fairly low risk/ high reward to me"
smashbros,3e0r90,sumcal,4,Tue Jul 21 11:42:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but apparently it has been done before without any promotion whatsoever so the outcome wasn't that good? At least that's what I've read in this thread too."
smashbros,3e0r90,Vetano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:09 2015 UTC,"That is true, it should be planned"
smashbros,3e0r90,sumcal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:02 2015 UTC,They could do some kind of Mii costume code with every donation of $1 or more
smashbros,3e0r90,fofozem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:46 2015 UTC,If twitch donations prove anything its that the masses will contribute to what they are passionate about.
smashbros,3e0r90,FatSloth,12,Tue Jul 21 18:27:41 2015 UTC,Dota essentially does this with its Compendium every year and its prize pool is $17 million this year when TWO years ago it was barely $3.5 million.  Find a way to give people hats for donating and Smash Bros will be the highest paying fighting game ever.
smashbros,3e0r90,Bravetriforcur,8,Tue Jul 21 04:51:51 2015 UTC,"The main issue is that Dota 2 is built to allow aesthetic alterations that are player-account specific into its game engine. Smash, unfortunately, isn't really a platform that can really support a ""hat"" equivalent.   The closest possible thing would be if Nintendo miraculously opened their eyes and supported smash modding, endorsing 20XX edition as a functional ""Melee Remake,"" creating skins and stages and whatnot as rewards for donation. But we obviously know Nintendo's archaic attitude towards modding, and it's really quite sad that they'd let such an opportunity go.  After all, if you remember from WC3, Dota 2 itself is the product of modding (Counterstrike, too)."
smashbros,3e0r90,ALittleFly,3,Tue Jul 21 06:51:01 2015 UTC,Eh I don't think even a lot of players are vying for 20xx to be standard. The part of with frozen PS and stuff like that may not be agreeable.
smashbros,3e0r90,Free_Dumb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:41 2015 UTC,"Also remember that we are a big chunk of the community that don't actually play the game but love watching it. I've been following Smash for a long time but last time I played it was probably 10 years ago. Giving me ""hats"" would not be an incentive to me, sadly."
smashbros,3e0r90,SundanC_e,2,Tue Jul 21 13:20:59 2015 UTC,"What if we have a system similar to AGDQ, where everyone that donates a minimum amount towards the prizepool is entered into a raffle for a prize of some sort?"
smashbros,3e0r90,Arpejjio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"I like this idea, it really gives people more incentive to donate.  I was also thinking someone could sell a variety of shirts/smash merch that would have all profits sent directly into the pot for the tournament"
smashbros,3e0r90,ElectroSaber,36,Tue Jul 21 18:52:47 2015 UTC,"People keep bringing this idea up, but the players who win money never do. It never goes anywhere either, for evo 2013 and 2015 people tried to make it happen, the community heads didn't bring attention to it, the top players didn't care, no money was made. Twitch, Red Bull, Astro, Razer, HTC and others have already shown direct interest in smash. Twitch gave us tens of thousands of dollars for apex, the crowdfunding campaign for Evo made like 30$. Big money comes from large sponsors and we're getting there. We finally broke the record for largest pay out but guess what, there's a 10k pot bonus for a tournament next month and M2K is the only top player to have signed up. The money isn't as big a deal as people think it is, if we want to have a huge scene then we do it by supporting in ways that aren't one time donations to a person who would've made 10k in a weekend on top of ad revenue, sponsorship pay, donations, merchandise, etc."
smashbros,3e0r90,krispness,13,Tue Jul 21 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think a crowdfunding campaign before the tournament would work very well.  I was envisioning a pool that you can donate to as the tournament is taking place, a la Games Done Quick.  Then on top of the excitement of watching the matches, there's the fun of watching the prizes go up.  There would still be a guaranteed prize pool before the tournament (based on things like corporate sponsorship), and anything donated during would be extra. I could be wrong, but I was under the impression that not even the top players are making a living from smash."
smashbros,3e0r90,Free_Dumb,5,Tue Jul 21 03:07:57 2015 UTC,"Top melee players do. At least I know that Mango, Leffen, armada to my knowledge. Mango is making the most by far because he has a huge twitch following with something like 1200 twitch subs."
smashbros,3e0r90,BlitznBurst,2,Tue Jul 21 13:20:47 2015 UTC,"Mango and M2K are the only players living solely off of Smash, afaik. I'm pretty sure Leffen and Armada both have some sort of income source outside of Smash"

As for top players making a living, the players at the very top do but it's from more than winning one tournament. Between the various tournaments, twitch and sponsors they're doing well. Armada and Leffen both quit their jobs, Mango is making a killing and M2K used to make a good amount from just tournies before his injuries arose."

Not toward the prize pool, but directly to a player of my choosing.  I could be watching someone make an impossible recovery and decide they deserve a dollar for pulling that off.  A come from behind victory, a perfectly timed falcon punch, choosing to play as G&W, or whatever makes me think they deserve a dollar... I can pass it their way just by pushing a button.  People are far more likely to donate in the heat of the moment, especially if they know the money is going to someone they think deserves it."
smashbros,3e0r90,Dapplegonger,6,Tue Jul 21 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"We broke records for Melee and Smash 4, but the distinction for the largest prize pool in Smash was actually MLG Dallas 2010. It featured a $35000 prize pool, which was almost as much as Smash 4 and Melee's prize pools at Evo combined. And Gnes won the most money of any Smash player ever, winning $12500 at that tournament. Sadly, we broke no record for Smash at a whole. It's a bit sad that we have yet to break a five year old record for the game that very few people ever play at a top level anymore."

smashbros,3e0r90,Dapplegonger,2,Tue Jul 21 13:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, MLG Dallas 2010 had a pretty ridiculous payout. If you saw the payout for Evo, it was $11556 for first place, but the total payout was 60/20/10/4/2/2/1/1. At MLG it was $12500 for first place, but it was 36/21/14/10/7/5/4/3. As a result, eighth place still got $1000 as opposed to Evo's $192.60, and second place got $7500 in contrast to Evo's $3852.  EDIT: Interestingly enough, Apex 2015 actually holds the distinction for largest prize pool for any tournament in combined Smash events, narrowly beating out Evo 2015. However, this prize pool was spread out among four games, so it isn't nearly as impressive."

smashbros,3e0r90,jaseroque,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:33:57 2015 UTC,"Perhaps instead of the money going to the winners, TO's could use it to lower cost for entry or to pay for the venue/other tourney expenses? idk, I think the community would definitely be willing to put forth money and that people can think of other good ways to use it."
smashbros,3e0r90,FeelsASaurusRex,9,Tue Jul 21 06:27:50 2015 UTC,"Imo the prize pot ideally should reflect the entrant count as that's the most important aspect of any tournament (in an open bracket culture).                  Competition in this game should never be about the money. Its the last thing we need for the community to continue like we want it to. Other ""e$ports"" titles suffer from the dollar count and prize pot inflation being the bottom line.                    More importantly we need stable venues for tournaments of all scales for all regions. That's the real important thing. Pot bonuses distributed to a top N players only help those N players. Regular and consistent tournaments grow communities, improve regions and fund more local winners to potentially go out of state.  As a competitor, spectator, and TO I would rather see people's money go towards a region as a whole than just an individual.                   My suggestion is that a group like Miom should create an ""investment"" fund for proven TO's to draw from to kickstart tournament series in regions that need it."
smashbros,3e0r90,Spectrabox,5,Tue Jul 21 06:24:58 2015 UTC,"Still the only problem is that with prize pools so low it is very difficult for there to actually be ""professional"" smashers. I agree that it shouldn't be all about the money, but top players being able to live of of smash comfortably would be nice."
smashbros,3e0r90,FeelsASaurusRex,-6,Tue Jul 21 06:52:38 2015 UTC,"Living off prize pools is the last thing top players should be doing. Our top talent, leaders, figureheads, and forefathers shouldn't become dependant on any e$port investment and funding. Sponsorships (of any form) are helpful but they shouldn't at all change the way we play this game. Actively funding a group of players through prize pool injections also creates a potential rift between those who fail to win them.  On top of that I totally oppose the distinction of ""professional players"" as it implies a separation between ""amateur"" and ""pro"" players and only creates another barrier to entry for outsiders.                       As someone who originally came from the SC2 community, after MLG dropped its open bracket I saw it devolve into a ""professional e$port"" that focused on prize pools, e$port personalities and invitational events once MLG dropped its open bracket.  I believe the Smash community should prioritize accessibility and integrity. The Melee community didn't rebirth itself from the ashes to turn into a money focused e$ports title.                          Catering to a select group of top finishers over the community as a whole is something we should stray away from. Large scale decisions of any kind should be thought over to address potential barriers to entry."
smashbros,3e0r90,MewtwoStruckBack,7,Tue Jul 21 07:28:53 2015 UTC,"I've gotta say I disagree with you.  You speak of barriers to entry for outsiders - isn't the massive skill gap between good and great, great and elite, where you'll have someone at a local who wrecks all their competition but goes to a regional and gets bodied, then that person finally starts doing well at regionals and goes to a major and gets bodied, and still after years can't hold up against Melee's top 5 or 6 at all, or still has no chance against Zero doing far more as a barrier to entry than anything regarding the money?  But as far as the money, living off prize pools should be the first thing the top talents are doing.  If you're THAT good at a game with such a big community, if you're one of the top 10 talents in the world at a game still being played, your prize support from winning just one or two tournaments should be enough to not have to have a day job for at least a year.  Sponsorships shouldn't be needed.  Whether this is achieved by increasing the entry fee (significantly), injecting money into the prize pools via donation, or doing something that convinces more players to play, there is no excuse for someone like Armada, Zero, Mew2King, Hungrybox, etc. to have to ever worry about where their next rent/mortgage payment is coming from, or how they're going to make it to a major and still come out ahead financially."

He was just some random TO from Pennsylvania.  2) No one promoted it. If someone like Blur, D1, Juggleguy, Tafokints, etc were to have tweeted it out or something there would be more publicity for it.  3) There was no incentive to donate. Marvel did something like this, and Justin Wong promised certain things if goals were met, stuff like exhibition matches, tutorials, etc.  Maybe next time it can get more organized but this year nothing really happened."

But a bigger prize pool wont motivate the top players to perform better. Mango said that you can put all the top melee players in a room and play for a ridiculously small amount of money (like $100) and they would go all out for it because he said melee is more about pride than the money."
smashbros,3e0r90,amorfos2,2,Tue Jul 21 02:03:45 2015 UTC,"melee is more about pride than the money.   But pride doesn't pay the bills.  Those who are at the upper echelon of the game where they're consistently topping bigger tournaments shouldn't have to worry about bills.  Pride is nice, but that doesn't mean the cash can't be there either.  Let's just say you have an outsider looking at this game - and you'll have a good number of those because this subreddit is trending again.  And one of those people looks at these great players and says ""wow, I'd like to try and do that!"" so they go to their local and get fucked up for a good while, probably months to a year or so, before they can even do well in their local group.  And they finally get even remotely good, and then they go to a regional tournament and just get absolutely wrecked.  And now they're wondering about whether or not it's worth it - they've put hundreds of hours of practice into something where even if they're successful, they have nothing other than that pride to show for it.  Even if you have someone who knows at heart they're meant to be a gamer, and they have a lot of innate skill in gaming, why should that person devote the time to Smash with such a diminshed return as opposed to the other games that are professionally supported?"
smashbros,3e0r90,krispness,4,Tue Jul 21 13:00:00 2015 UTC,"It's not so much about motivating them to do better in the moment.  More money at stake won't magically make anyone play better of course.  But like amorfos2 says, it will allow the best players, who are the most fun to watch, to continue to devote time to smash.  It is first and foremost a thank you from the fans to the players for all the entertainment, with the hopeful side effect of allowing them to play more/longer"
smashbros,3e0r90,Whiteboyfntastic1,0,Tue Jul 21 02:23:46 2015 UTC,"That is true and i agree maybe it wont motivate them to perform better but it will help them a lot to keep doing their thing.... sooner or later top players will need to stop being so active because of real life obligations (rl sucks) so they getting more money out of a tournament would help a lot.  And while tournaments are responsible as you say for the prize pool, they are already risking their asses paying for everything without much help from sponsors and stuff (unlike other fighthing games). If every viewer/player donated $1 it would help anyways."

smashbros,3e1tny,Xrmy,9,Tue Jul 21 08:33:23 2015 UTC,I only started following the scene 1 year ago. Its seems pikachu has many traits of a strong character and also Axes play this evo was amazing. How come Pikachu is relatively low tier. What are the major downsides of pikachu ?
smashbros,3e1tny,Castative,24,Tue Jul 21 11:13:04 2015 UTC,"It's easy to watch videos of Axe's crazy combos/gimps and want to think Pikachu is a top tier character.  But the reason why top tiers are the best is becase of their neutral game. A lot of characters can combo/gimp any character to death off of one opening theoretically, just look at aMSa's yoshi.  But the problem with yoshi/pikachu/most lower tiers are the fact that their options in neutral are much worse than the higher tiers.  With pika specifically, I would say the speed is there, but the range/""priority"" isn't.  Neutral game is just generally a lot tougher for him: a lot of his moves can be CC'ed etc.  That being said I would consider him the 9th best character in the game right now, as I think his ceiling is higher than that of Samus/Doc.  I honestly could see him rise to as high as #8 past puff if hbox really won't be around/no puffs rise up in his place to advance her metagame.  Overall though I think Pika is generally considered a ""borderline viable"" character.  I think he can do it, and certainly Axe has shown that with enough effort, Pika can be taken quite far."

smashbros,3e1tny,mylox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:43 2015 UTC,"Puff is a way lower techskill character than Pikachu though, who is second only to spacies. If you can play Pikachu at a high level you can at least play Falco if not Fox. Also, Pikachu's meta is much less developed. Puff had Mango and Hbox and a couple of other really dedicated players for a long time across 2007-15, whereas Pikachu has Axe and PikaChad and DJ Nintendo and that's about it. I think he's at a metagame disadvantage because his playstyle is spacie-like and every would-be Pikachu can get the same playstyle with more wins by moving their selector circle up one space on the character select screen.  I think he could easily rise above Falcon and ICs if people had a reason to main him. But he lacks any compelling winning matchups (except maybe C. Falcon) unlike Peach (ICs), Puff (Peach, ICs), ICs (Shiek), and he has trouble with some mid tiers like Samus."

smashbros,3e1tny,sumcal,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:22:46 2015 UTC,Most of the characters you mentioned are top tier. Pikachu is above Samus. Dr.Mario is above Pikachu.

This is a very different time from 2013. And I also want to point out that on that list, Pika is 10/26? That's not even the top 1/3 of the cast  Pikachu is high mid tier, and Axe is a phenomenal player"
smashbros,3e1tny,sumcal,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:41 2015 UTC,I don't get how he suddenly dropped two spots? The only thing that changed really is usage.
smashbros,3e1tny,Raikaru,0,Tue Jul 21 16:57:02 2015 UTC,"The reason he was so high before was as Shroomed. Shroomed now plays Sheik, so there are no top Doc mains. I can't think of a single top 100 Doc main off the top of my head.  As for Samus, Plup just beat Leffen with her, HugS had a great run at both CEO and EVO, and Duck is a very good Samus player as well. And Axe obviously shows us what Pikachu is capable of. The thing is, no matter how good a character is in theory, if they don't have any results then they don't deserve to be higher than a character that does. If Kirby mains started winning every major tournament, Kirby would rise substantially on the tier list, no matter how bad he is in theory. And aMSa singlehandedly raised Yoshi in the tier list. Generally, results reflect how good a character actually is; in the case of Pikachu there's only one that has amazing results, but that still shows Pika's potential. Whereas there are more top Samus players, but they're not at Axe's level (except Plup, who is now a Samus secondary), so it's hard to say which is better. I also think Luigi should be above Doc at this point too by the way, for similar reasons (i.e. Eddy Mexico, Abate, Vist, etc.)"

smashbros,3e1cvf,MegaSnack,3,Tue Jul 21 08:35:29 2015 UTC,I would love to come out to the tournament sometime. I live in Garland so the venue is not too far. I've been wanting to start playing Smash bros more serious lately but I don't want to join a big tournament like the Low Tier city right off the bat. I just need a place to learn the basics and develop my tech skill. I probably won't be able to make it out there until mid August. Thanks for the post and informing a Dallas native about his cities' smash scene.
smashbros,3e1cvf,greenymacblues,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:09 2015 UTC,I think if you're interested in tournament play you should definitely just go and play lots of friendlies. Even if you get consistently destroyed in friendlies and have no idea what's happening (it probably won't be that extreme though) I still think that's better than not going

smashbros,3e32ih,thenabi,3,Tue Jul 21 16:12:53 2015 UTC,"I hope more of the top players are actually attending... With these registration numbers it is the 7th biggest Melee tournament (unlikely to reach TBH4 at 6th) and it is the 3rd biggest Smash 4 tournament. If you count the number of people who actually took part in Apex 2015 after DQs SSC could surpass that if it gets another 100 people which might be possible.   But yeah, I think most top Smash 4 players are attending but it's be ridiculous if it's just M2K and Plup from the 10 ten in the 7th biggest Melee tournament of all time lol.

To keep it brief, Leffen used to be a bit of a dick in the Swedish smash community to the point where he was constantly disrepecting other players, being loud/rude/obnoxious. Really just causing drama and harm to the community.   Armada made a post on smashboards (which you can read here) that stated Leffen would be banned from tournaments for a year, alongside this he had a file he uploaded with all the evidence they had on Leffen's actions. This file became 'evidence.zip'."
smashbros,3dyo1v,Sire8BitHero,4,Tue Jul 21 13:31:43 2015 UTC,"Leffen used to be a dick at swedish tournaments to people, making fun of their disabilities, etc etc. So Armada complied a list of the shit that Leffen did and uploaded it on smashboards, calling the file evidence.zip. So Leffen was banned from the european smash scene for a while.  He has since then cleaned up his act and became much much more humble."

smashbros,3dyo1v,berychance,6,Mon Jul 20 23:11:29 2015 UTC,Obvious DBZ Spoilers  It's the unofficial name for the new transformation in RoF.

smashbros,3dyo1v,Ampyy,33,Mon Jul 20 18:33:43 2015 UTC,"something about Hbox always wanting the spotlight, saying his act towards Armada wasn't a kind gesture but more of a selfish one."
smashbros,3dyo1v,Nizbel,55,Mon Jul 20 18:42:16 2015 UTC,I believe that people who think its selfish to congratulate the winner like Hbox did are selfish themselves. They can't imagine why anyone would do that out of kindness or respect. Everything is about attention.
smashbros,3dyo1v,SageOfTheWise,23,Mon Jul 20 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"And you know these same people would have complained if Hbox had just walked off, stayed out of the spotlight in anyway. Would have said he was being salty and petty to not congratulate Armada."

There are sooooo many examples of second place competitors doing that to the person that just beat them for first.   It's just because people like you created some ""Hbox is the bad guy"" mentality and jump on the bandwagon of hating him. All of the hate he gets is unwarranted.   People say he's out there for the drama and attention. Did it look like Armada was annoyed by it? No! The guy is just playing a game he loves, get off his back."
smashbros,3dyo1v,SageOfTheWise,5,Mon Jul 20 20:08:32 2015 UTC,I can only assume these same people see the final scene of Karate Kid as the opponent getting some kind of final revenge against the main character by touching the trophy first or something.

I apologise if it rubs you the wrong way but some people get really hyped up, he was in grand finals when he lost, and melee isn't WWE, 2nd place giving 1st place the trophy shows a lot of self control and respect for the one they lost to. If they threw the trophy down and ran off to the bathroom to cry, then I'D be rubbed the wrong way."

smashbros,3dyo1v,Snifflets,13,Mon Jul 20 17:49:09 2015 UTC,Then there's nothing more to it than you simply grossly misinterpreting the action.
smashbros,3dyo1v,disgraced_salaryman,-13,Mon Jul 20 23:04:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not the only one, though. Guess there's a lot of us grossly misinterpreting hbox's personality."

smashbros,3dyo1v,qweyroiquoi,-9,Mon Jul 20 18:31:00 2015 UTC,His personality is reflected by his actions. And what you said about the majority believing something not making in correct might apply to your view of him as well.
smashbros,3dyo1v,Snifflets,11,Mon Jul 20 18:39:36 2015 UTC,"Every action a person makes doesn't have to be in line with their personalities. And this action is something that happens a lot (the second-place finisher holding up the winner's arm, or handing them the trophy, etc.), in more than just e-Sports, and I have never before heard of the action being labelled a 'crave for attention'. It's just good sportsmanship. Being a graceful loser. Respecting the man who defeated you. Being proud of the man who could rival you, and who bested you on that day. It takes a big man to be able to do that. Not just some attention-seeker."
smashbros,3dyo1v,ielfie,3,Mon Jul 20 18:42:52 2015 UTC,To some   To everyone with common sense. FTFY :)
smashbros,3dyo1v,DamnReality,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I could see that. But I could also see him knowing how big this moment was for Armada, and conceding that he was outplayed. And if he really always has to have the spotlight on him, why is starting to retire?"
smashbros,3dyo1v,nnicider,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"So I guess by that logic then, at the end of an MMA fight or something of the kind, the loser isn't actually hugging the winner out of respect or congratulations, but rather for attention? Or at the end of a football or basketball game when the players shake hands theyre just doing it to be in the spotlight? I don't know, you might be right, but your logic seems extremely flawed to me."
smashbros,3dyo1v,TheChocolateLava,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"2nd place does that all the time in every competition. And people act like hbox is the only one who's doing any of this but no one complains that Axe is ""just trying to steal the spotlight"" when he runs up and hugs plup. I can see why people find pop-offs annoying but all the murmurs that they're not genuine are clearly bullshit. Look at sandstorm/MLG, he literally injures his hand popping off...do these people really think that was a calculated decision and not just pure emotion coming from a high level competitor?"
smashbros,3dyo1v,qweyroiquoi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too, Hbox always loves attention but doesn't get his fix from winning enough so he does stuff like that."

Sure, Fox wins the Puff matchup extremely easily, but Fox is easily the most hype character as far as combos are concerned aside from Falco and sometimes Marth.  I'm a Puff main and a huge Hbox fanboy but I'll be the first to admit that watching Hbox (or mostly anyone else that mains Puff) can be boring to watch, much more boring than any of the campiest Foxes we see."

smashbros,3e0dn2,IsaacMole,15,Tue Jul 21 04:46:20 2015 UTC,"TSM and Liquid don't sell anything. They pay for players to advertise their brand, and then they get other brands to pay them to get that exposure.  If you look at the players jackets and streams, they have ads on them, TSM and Liquid get them those ads and pay them for it, so Zero doesn't have to hunt down his own ads/book his flights/other lame buisinessy stuff."
smashbros,3e0dn2,kirocuto,10,Tue Jul 21 04:49:03 2015 UTC,"HTC pays TSM to advertise their products, TSM pays Zero to put the HTC brand on his social media, and stream (This is why some sponsored players are asked to stream by their sponsors). Zero also mentions HTC on interviews. Some sponsors put HTC on the jackets their players wear. A player like Zero gets a los of exposure because he wins tournaments, streams, has a youtube channel, etc. therefore HTC gets more exposure, therefore TSM charges more money, therefore Zero gets paid. Also some sponsors like Fnatic have stuff like Jerseys, or mouspads that fans of the players would buy."

What probably happened was: someone with very basic Japanese knowledge thought ""well… there's mainichi for 'every day', maiasa for 'every morning', maishū for 'every week' and so on… so YEAH, surely PRA_MAI comes from PRA as in ""PRAyer"" (for ""PLAyer"") and MAI as in ""every""!

smashbros,3dzimn,Pikagile,6,Tue Jul 21 12:43:13 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was weird that they even suggested that the Roy in the Brawl files could be the Koopaling or Roy Campbell, as if either of those characters had ANY chance at being in the game."

smashbros,3dzimn,sylvanelite,19,Tue Jul 21 01:03:47 2015 UTC,"The comments make it sound like the article has like thirty or forty corrections in it. Some of the corrections are arguments on what ""speculation"" and ""theories"" are. Like one of the facts (about Brawl) is;    ""Roy is thought to be Roy from Fire Emblem, but since the character listing is so vague some have speculated that this could’ve been a separate character with the name Roy. Such as, Roy the Koopaling or Metal Gear’s Roy Campbell.“    And the correction is that the speculation is false because of sound files."
smashbros,3dzimn,balladofwindfishes,7,Mon Jul 20 23:28:09 2015 UTC,"And the correction is that the speculation is false because of sound files.   Even that's hardly a correction, because their next sentence states:    That said, an unused victory theme for Roy can be found in the game’s data    Maybe they could have worded it better, but it's not that bad."
smashbros,3dzimn,WhiteFox1992,6,Tue Jul 21 02:46:25 2015 UTC,The speculation that Roy isn't Roy from FE is nonsense and shouldn't have even been mentioned by them.
smashbros,3dzimn,hornestur,0,Tue Jul 21 12:45:47 2015 UTC,"Even still the second fact listed shouldn't of been a correction, what was corrected was just the guy giving his opinion and not stating anything to be false. The guy put; ""Ryuo is a place name, which literally means Dragon King. Therefore, it’s in my humble opinion that Nintendo should have never translated it as “Dragon King the Fighting Game”. Especially since the game’s prototype had nothing to do with a dragon king. Sakurai also took those pictures in the prototype. But that’s an argument for a different day.""      And chronologically the final ""correction"" is that the cat in this image from the ice stage (of the Pokemon Stadium 2 Stage) does not even closely resemble the cat in this image."

smashbros,3e1u09,DictatorMad,15,Tue Jul 21 08:38:09 2015 UTC,"When I played Melee as a Kid, everybody was playing characters like Falcon, Pikachu, Samus and Fox. But I was one of the few people that would use Mewtwo. Not only have I been a big Pokemon fan but I loved Melee Mewtwo in Smash. Iv'e stuck by him ever since then, being one of my melee mains alongside Young Link, my pm main, and my secondary in Smash 4. I really wanted Mewtwo to be one of my mains in Smash 4, but I think a few things really hold me back from being one of my primary characters. For one, they made him extremely light, sometimes you can get by this with certain characters that are heavier then lets say Peach/Zelda, but mewtwo falls into that category were no matter how well I DI knock-back, I can't live past 130, even on stuff like battlefield, and you can live for a really long time on that stage. Mewtwo shouldn't be having Jigglypuff damage problems for god sake, I can even trade attacks with Mewtwo because every amount of damage adds up. Mewtwo has good kill power at least, love the kill power on his shadow ball, throw game, down tilt options and fair options. He has a good time killing early, so I like to use him with certain matchups like bowser and rob,when I can use all of Mewtwo's good range and potential to kill early to make the most out of him. But even then, he get's taken out so easily by rushdown characters, especially Shiek and Fox. It's even more of an apparent issue because he's so floaty, I like to use this aspect of him to chase down opponents with dair or bair off stage, but it works against him being that floaty of a character. I love his recovery game, but In Smash 4, a lot of characters have good options getting back to the stage, so it's not that special.   So that's what I think of him, I'd love to use him more, but a few things hold me back from being really invested in mewtwo. I think I'll just keep him at the back of my hand to check and counter certain matchups."
smashbros,3e1u09,LuxShadow1,3,Tue Jul 21 08:50:20 2015 UTC,"Mewtwo can be fun in one match, and then frustrating in another. Once you find yourself in a wall of pain with no way of getting out because of Mewtwo's ""Floaty-ness"" is holding you back.  I swear it was a cruel joke to make Mewtwo this floaty, knowing that what makes you an easy kill. IT even said it proudly on Mewtwo's Trophy.  Maybe Mewtwo's ""Floaty-ness"" wasn't a problem if his air game had a little more rang or power to them. His only safe air move, after Teleport is N-air, and it doesn't even cover most of his body. Heck, most of Mewtwo's hit boxes with his moves are awfully made. His side Smash attacks misses, even if they are right next to Mewtwo. Down Smash severs no purpose, other then being a tiny hit box that doesn't even hit ledge grabbers. Up Smash is Mewtwo best move, problem is, other fighters need to be above him to do any thing to them. If you miss, you're good as dead.  Other then that, Mewtwo is also really slow for a lightweight, and that's not good when ""anyone"" can sent you flying at 70% Maybe an update will one day make Mewtwo good again."
smashbros,3e1u09,Im_French,3,Tue Jul 21 09:35:19 2015 UTC,"Do yourself a favor a go play project m. As a dk main, this game is a godsend, I'll never play dk in any other smash game, he's just too bad."
smashbros,3e1u09,Sandfall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"He already said that Mewtwo was his PM main :P  Also, Smash 4 DK is the best he's ever been (in the official games, that is). He's actually pretty viable with customs on too."
smashbros,3e1u09,Im_French,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:33 2015 UTC,"Oops, didn't see the PM part. And about smash 4 DK, I dunno man, with customs he's pretty good but he's just about gimmicks and spamming one move, which isn't really fun. And without he's just... not good, DK without throw followups and combos isn't DK, I know this is just the way smash 4 is made (which is the main thing I dislike about it), but man, some characters do have combos but heavies get none, they just can't compete when they are slow as hell and have no combos into kill setups, and the fact that they hit slightly harder doesn't make up for it at all. Project M is the only smash game to get heavies right, in every other they're just straight up bad because sakurai doesn't want slow heavy hitting characters to have combos for some reason, which I guess makes sense when aimed at a casual level, but since that's not the way I'm playing smash I have a hard time enjoying it. I'd argue he's better in melee than in smash 4 because while being slow and having a shitty neutral he at least gets good punishes once he catches someone, unlike smash 4 where you get one hit and it resets to neutral again."
smashbros,3e1u09,zimby,3,Tue Jul 21 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"I mostly play Mewtwo and find him very fun, even if he's not great. I loved playing him in project M so I was pretty much going to play him a lot in smash 4 no matter how bad he was. To be fair though, I'm not amazing at smash by any means. I just play locally with friends and on for glory. I have a little over 50% win rate with him on for glory. I play him just because he's fun, his moves are pretty cool, and you can occasionally do some mind games on your opponent with his unusual aerial movement and the ability to delay recovery with various combinations of double jump, disable to stop your downward momentum, confusion to get a little boost, and teleport of course."
smashbros,3e1u09,DrRiceBoy,3,Tue Jul 21 13:17:45 2015 UTC,He's kinda bad.   ...but Mewtwo is Mewtwo. He's the best even if he's bad.
smashbros,3e1u09,Kaios-0,4,Tue Jul 21 16:58:32 2015 UTC,I'm one of those people who say I main multiple characters. Mewtwo was my main in Melee alongside Marth. In Smash 4 he feels a little slower of course but it's all about placement imo.   Mewtwo has his tail to keep people away from him. If you can learn when to use each you'll be fine. With Mewtwo I always plan my attacks a few seconds before theirs since Mewtwo is slower. He just needs proper work to learn how to properly time everything. That's not likely with most players because they like fast easy-to-learn characters...
smashbros,3e1u09,Jpot,2,Tue Jul 21 08:46:44 2015 UTC,"As great as Mewtwo's tilt attacks are, it doesn't help to set up attack, other then his down tilt, that lets you do a f-air attack quickly, but that's all you're getting out of it.  If Mewtwo fighting another slow fighter, his tilts will work all day, until you face a Fox or a Captain Falcon  Mewtwo can still work up a win with fast fighters with quick timing shadow balls, and being aggressive with Neural air, even down B can catch them off guard.  But once they find out how slow Mewtwo is, some that can react quickly can make Mewtwo in a juggle mess"
smashbros,3e1u09,ILoveTails,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:58:49 2015 UTC,"Mewtwo can teleport without much endlag if he lands on the ground, so that can help at least a bit with juggles."
smashbros,3e1u09,brandonnn11,4,Tue Jul 21 18:11:54 2015 UTC,"I like Mewtwo's moveset a lot, it feels good and fun, and I love his massive tail and how often he attacks with it. But his weight is just not worth it for me to really invest time into learning him...I think he's decent but Hopefully he gets buffed down the line so that I can really enjoy using him instead of being frustrated."
smashbros,3e1u09,Jaaahsh,0,Tue Jul 21 12:37:16 2015 UTC,"Which characters' tail, if any, do you think outclasses Mewtwo's tail in terms of effectiveness and power? Mewtwo can rack up some really good damage with those tail bairs and up airs."
smashbros,3e1u09,Crazc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:08 2015 UTC,"Shulk's sword. Not a tail, sure, but it gets used in a similar way to Mewtwo's. I'd argue more effectively, too."

I mean, I main Doc. It's because of how ridiculously large his hotboxes is and how crazy light he is. F that."
smashbros,3e1u09,aflarge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"I have been playing a lot of Mewtwo since he has always been my favorite character. I wouldn't mind his float and light weight if he had more cannon in the glass cannon.  He also lacks a bread And butter down thrown combo which really hurts. After watching project m Mewtwo gameplay, I wish his aerial tail based attacks were a bit faster and the hitboxes made sense. Neutral air also has some startup lag which makes it tough to break out of combos. I don't think they'll ever buff his weight but I'd love to see some of the other things I mentioned fixed. I'd also love to see him be able to act out of teleport or have the landing lag reduced but idk if I see that happening."

After the next match, which I let him win because I was a bit concerned, he again said how stupid it was that he had to be ""all over his controller"" to even do anything. Then he started pressing all of the controller's buttons as fast as he could and started shaking the controller violently for a few seconds. Then he just got depressed and didn't want to do anything for about ten minutes.   So how did I respond to this salty player? I decided to never play Project M with him again. I think this is for the best.  As for randoms online, just leave. Don't trash talk back, just leave. It's just a game, and as long as you know that, salty players can't get one over on you."

smashbros,3dzl8u,TweetPoster,24,Mon Jul 20 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"no hate for either game; but anybody know why we slightly more Wii U players as of lately, then melee has more twitch viewers? Do melee players get airsick?"
smashbros,3dzl8u,driedupsharpie,76,Mon Jul 20 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"I think its because Smash 4 is easier to get into, less of a hassle to set up and its's new.  edit: twitch views I'm not sure"
smashbros,3dzl8u,LarsTarkas,30,Mon Jul 20 22:12:30 2015 UTC,I think melee is more exciting to watch for people. It has more developed story lines and faster gameplay.
smashbros,3dzl8u,OhaiChris,32,Tue Jul 21 02:02:59 2015 UTC,Because Smash4 is a terrible spectator sport compared to other fighting games.
smashbros,3dzl8u,Ddiaboloer,58,Tue Jul 21 01:54:02 2015 UTC,"I'd rather play sm4sh than watch it. I'd rather watch melee than play it. That's how I and, I imagine, a large part of the community feels."

smashbros,3dzl8u,Ryio5,2,Tue Jul 21 06:33:02 2015 UTC,Top 8 this past weekend was pretty damn hype.
smashbros,3dzl8u,shoopler,-8,Tue Jul 21 04:19:58 2015 UTC,"Compared to any other top 8 in EVO? It was a snooze fest because Smash4 is so slow, so clearly forgiving and not designed to be played as a spectator sport."
smashbros,3dzl8u,Ddiaboloer,5,Tue Jul 21 04:48:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know man, no offense to the MKX crowd but I literally fell asleep during top 8 while I was hyped the whole way through Sm4sh since pools. To each their own I guess."
smashbros,3dzl8u,AnonymousXD2,2,Tue Jul 21 05:06:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of MK but I was pretty damn bored, Sonic Fox winning kills the hype."
smashbros,3dzl8u,thegreatkhan96,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:53:07 2015 UTC,MK is at the bottom of the barrel of traditional fighting games anyway. I believe there have only been 2 games in the entire franchise that the FGC would call acceptable
smashbros,3dzl8u,Ddiaboloer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:15:40 2015 UTC,I was at the event.  Wii U was just as loud as Melee.  Dabuz getting knocked out and zero vs Nairo was just as hype as all the other hype Melee matches.
smashbros,3dzl8u,shoopler,-8,Tue Jul 21 05:35:04 2015 UTC,"The crowd always helps, no doubt"
smashbros,3dzl8u,Ddiaboloer,0,Tue Jul 21 05:40:13 2015 UTC,Less of a hassle? Aside from lugging around CRTs I beg to differ.
smashbros,3dzl8u,skwaag5233,21,Tue Jul 21 14:17:44 2015 UTC,"Smash 4 is new, pretty simple reason. There are a lot more players atm."
smashbros,3dzl8u,Dc_Soul,-13,Mon Jul 20 22:16:49 2015 UTC,so maybe ex-melee'ers are still lurking and watching the pro scene you're saying?
smashbros,3dzl8u,driedupsharpie,19,Mon Jul 20 22:17:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe but i simply think that there are more people that play smash 4 but there are more people wanting to watch melee(for whatever reason, not rly here to argue about that). I never played melee or any smash game actually but follow/watch melee for 1~ year now simply because I like it. Less so with smash 4."
smashbros,3dzl8u,Dc_Soul,-5,Mon Jul 20 22:20:33 2015 UTC,"oooh yeah never thought of that, pure spectatoryness.  I guess even if you don't know much about the games Melee's top players and metagame is a lot more eccentric than Smash 4's quieter celebs."
smashbros,3dzl8u,driedupsharpie,7,Mon Jul 20 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"You don't rly have to play the game to know about the game, I would consider myself quite knowledgeable(as much as a guy who started watching 1 year ago can be). You just have to activly inform yourself. Obviously I'm not saying that I would be a good smash player but simply know the players and some mechanics.  That probably isn't the case for every ""casual"" spectator so yes I would agree with you that the more ""eccentric"" meta, would apeal to more spectators."
smashbros,3dzl8u,Dc_Soul,-16,Mon Jul 20 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"Melee's tourny was also on Sunday with Marvel coming in right after it.  If Melee had been on Saturday instead of Sunday it would probably have still gotten more views but it would have been much, much closer.  Also, a lot of Smash 4 players/fans watch both games whereas it's not as true the other way around. And the Melee scene has been around for awhile so those watching may be fans of other games but they know all the storylines surrounding Melee.  Myriad of reasons honestly."
smashbros,3dzl8u,FuriousTarts,10,Mon Jul 20 22:24:51 2015 UTC,"Marvel ended up having 80k fewer viewers than melee, so I doubt it had much of an impact. Certainly not a 110k viewer impact."
smashbros,3dzl8u,-Dubious-,12,Tue Jul 21 03:47:02 2015 UTC,If I had to guess its because Melee's more entertaining to watch but harder to learn.
smashbros,3dzl8u,Han_Solo_Burger,11,Tue Jul 21 01:55:51 2015 UTC,More people play sm4sh but more people enjoy watching melee
smashbros,3dzl8u,pieman2005,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:06 2015 UTC,this is me lol. love all games tho
smashbros,3dzl8u,wanthonio31,5,Tue Jul 21 03:27:56 2015 UTC,"Melee is probably objectively more exciting to watch, and it has a more established viewer fanbase - it has been around for years, built great brand names and rivalries.  All of that stuff contributes to views.  But the second greatest factor in the EVO viewer numbers between the 2 games was the fast that Smash 4's Top 8 took place on a Saturday afternoon - which is a terrible time to attract viewers. Sunday is much much better. Of course, that's not the whole difference, as I outlined already, but that's still the biggest factor.  Smash 4 has more players because it's a really fun game to play (as is Melee), but unlike Melee it's easy for anyone to get into competitively right now, and it's easy to play online as well. It's also a new game that is actively supported by Nintendo."
smashbros,3dzl8u,TheIronKraken,9,Tue Jul 21 14:18:21 2015 UTC,"Melee has celebrities, S4 doesn't."
smashbros,3dzl8u,ChezMere,5,Tue Jul 21 01:45:16 2015 UTC,It's hard to develop storylines and a diverse cast of well-known players when Zero wins everything

smashbros,3dzl8u,DSou7h,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:45 2015 UTC,In this particular instance it's probably because Smash Con is targeted towards casual players.
smashbros,3dzl8u,RathKeno,3,Tue Jul 21 10:59:06 2015 UTC,As a melee player I enter smash 4 at every tournament I go to where they both are there. I don't see too many smash 4 player's reciprocating lol

smashbros,3e38vs,t8manpizza,6,Tue Jul 21 18:50:44 2015 UTC,"Yes.  If you're playing seriously, using the c stick is not optional since you cannot control your movement as well while doing aerials with the control stick as you can with the c stick.  Furthermore, several tools (especially in melee) become either much more difficult or impossible without the use of the c stick (i.e. retreating fairs as Marth)"
smashbros,3e38vs,Tasteh,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:45 2015 UTC,You basically need it to do things like waveshine to up smash. It's super valuable and you should utilize it in some way.
smashbros,3e38vs,billpika,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:47 2015 UTC,"You can see it like that: having control over your character's movement in the air, independantly of your aerial attacks is a very nice boost in control over having to attack in the direction you are moving. That is what a melee-and-after player would tell you. As a SS64 player, I will tell you that retreating fairs, advancing bairs and falling up-airs are very easy with only one stick if you practice it enough. BUT, it's still the quicker route to use the c-stick."
smashbros,3e38vs,SouthSideDummer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:00 2015 UTC,"At the competitive level the c-stick is needed, especially if you want to both move and attack in the Adair."
