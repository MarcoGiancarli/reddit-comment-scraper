introvert,3e2qlq,rattlesnake30,12,Tue Jul 21 14:39:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear ya. I was able to get over the being modest part by actually getting myself to loosen up and care less. But I'm not loud, or tall, so I try to do well in interviews by asking questions that I think the interviewer wants to answer.  It doesn't even have to relate to the job. The way I see it, if you are going to a face to face interview, you are qualified, but they wanna see if you're a good fit, professionally, and socially. So if you hear em mention they ride a motorcycle, ask what type it is, and see how they respond.   My two cents is that its a big mind game, I don't like it, but I don't have a better way to do it, yet."
introvert,3e2qlq,KungFuTortilla,5,Tue Jul 21 15:05:26 2015 UTC,"Same. Or the interview would be an online chat, if that's even possible. I actually did do an interview 2 times before, and I was shaking the whole time. Hell, even if I want to buy something from a store that needed an assistance from an employee, I get all sweaty. More of a social anxiety than introvertion I guess."
introvert,3e2qlq,toshi04,5,Tue Jul 21 16:08:59 2015 UTC,"There is nothing I loathe more than job interviews. I hate talking myself up to strangers. One time a few years back I was having trouble finding a job and was stuck in a temp position, so I signed up with one of those job recruiting agencies. They set me up with 3 different interviews and I didn't get the job at any of them. The lady who was working with me was very curt and said I was ""too reserved"" a person. Well, SORRY! It's called being introverted. I can't open up until I know a person - so you're going to punish me for it, even though I'm perfectly qualified and a hard worker? It's so frustrating."
introvert,3e2qlq,hot_sssake,2,Tue Jul 21 18:02:11 2015 UTC,It takes me years to open up to co-workers.  The more you interview the easier it is to fake being open and out-going.  I feel a little bad sometimes cause I interview well but as soon as I start the job I basically never leave my cave.

Even though I prefer to be left alone and don't want to talk about myself, I approach interviews with an ""I'm awesome, you should hire me"" vibe and a fake smile.  Even if you're naturally humble, come up with a few examples of cool things you did in the past that would apply to the job and make yourself say them to the interviewer at some point.  As long as you don't suffer from social anxiety and can hide any nervousness you have, it's only 30-45 minutes that you have to pretend to be someone that you're not.  You can be yourself when you get the job.  This has paid off for me.  It'd be amazing if a representative could just go and talk about how I'm the right fit for a position, but being an actor for less than an hour to snag a job isn't too horrible."

I'm certain most people dislike interviews. The problem here is, who would hire a person who sends someone else? This is why we do interviews.    Can you work with us? Can you do the job? Can you do the job better than these other applicants? You're not telling us about you for bragging; tell us about yourself so we can answer these questions.   Why can't you just answer them for us? Because it's a judgement call for us, not you.  I'm sure you'll be fine as long as you can keep attending them; the law of averages will work for you, and you'll learn to work them. Askreddit has always had lots of submissions like ""reddit, what are the best answers to these generic interview questions."" That's a good place to start :)"

I'm not keen on talking about myself, especially with someone, whom I've never met before. The concept of giving a brief overview of yourself in the form of a resume and regurgitating it through clever responses is frivolous. Sarcastically speaking, I can appear to be an outgoing, charismatic, person who strives to be like everyone in order to get on top of the mountain, but what fun is that? The fact that you are one of hundreds applying for a position and have to creatively crawl your way through the maze in order to acquire the job doesn't seem practical. One comment I received from an interviewer was ""you're rather reserved in your posture and verbal communications."" What kind of psychoanalytical crap is this? In other words, you wouldn't fit in here because you're too ""quiet."" As if my psychology has any effect on my work performance.

What every interviewer really wants is to hire a friend.

When you go into an interview, don't forget you are interviewing them also! How else are you going to see if you'll be a good fit and they for you? I want to see who I could be stuck working with and if they are tolerable. It could be a dream job but if I don't like my coworkers it'll be some level of hell.   If you landed an interview, they are selling themselves too because they see you have potential value to them. Turn the tables a bit, realize your own worth and you'll be able to sell something (like yourself) that you know to be true. You'll get there!"

Why is it your responsibility?   but she thought I was just lying to try and hide the fact that something was bothering me.   She wasn't wrong. You were hiding something. You said you were tired and stressed from interacting- You couldn't tell her about the main thing? How the lack of conversation topics was bothering you- maybe she would understand (she really seems like she would).  Go tell her this. I think she will surprise you.  Now imagine if the places were switched. She breaks down for seemingly no reason at all and just tells you that she was tired. What would go through your mind?

Eventually you will meet people who don't drain you quite as fast as the average person.  Also, try out new activities. If you're new at something and trying to learn then it's much easier to socialize about it I find because there is much more Q&A going on. In this case you are definitely talking more about the activity than some random small talk.  It's not easy, but it's also not something that can't get better and more enjoyable."

If you are as introverted as you have made yourself sound then the chances are that they don't even know you well enough to make an informed opinion.  I may be wrong but it seems to me that we become hypersensitive to these kinds of ""slights"", and the people around us are oblivious. We cannot expect the world to come to us and just deal with our idiosyncrasies. We need to meet them halfway. You will know the people in your life that making the effort is worth it for.

introvert,3dzdr6,SilverSpooky,18,Mon Jul 20 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with you from what I get from your post.  The first guy (it was a stranger in public, right?) probably didn't expect it. If a stranger greeted me in passing I wouldn't have time to react, honestly. As for the girl, she maybe doesn't know you well and didn't know what to say, or she didn't want to talk to you – or something else, I don't know, I'm not her. But it happens.  Don't get discouraged. Go on with regularly greeting people in your classes, e.g. when you're waiting in front of the class room/lecture hall. I guarantee you that more than one person will greet back, even if it's just ""hi"" or ""morning""."
introvert,3dzdr6,SCPH-0815,6,Mon Jul 20 19:59:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. No one owes anyone attention and expecting to say hi to someone and becomes best friends is ridiculous. After saying hello to people several times they will hopefully start to feel happy when they see you and start to say hi back.  I think it's weird for people who have tried to avoid attention all their lives come to grips with how much most people want attention and how hard they work to get it.  The OP might think the world is in for a treat now that he decided to start saying ""hello"" but he will soon learn that the common attention from family and old friends that is free is limited to family and old friends.  No matter how much a random guy likes you the friendship will most likely be limited to when you randomly are in the same place, and a ""cute girl"" probably knows 5 other guys that she already has stuff in common with and at least as attractive and are probably more fun to be around than an introvert just trying to come out of his shell.   The op shouldn't give up, becoming more social is one thing I'm most proud of, but the biggest part was learning to think about things from other peoples perspectives"

introvert,3dzdr6,PluviusReddit,6,Tue Jul 21 04:18:52 2015 UTC,"I like some of the comments already, but I would add one more thing.  Namely, your experience is not a good measure of what really happened. The feelings are all ouch-y and all, I get it. I live it everyday, I promise you. But, well, we, as human beings, don't record reality, like robots; we interpret it like meat machines making weird psychadelic art beyind our imperfect senses. We don't get to know what's in another person's mind, and we never will--they barely get to know themselves.  That person didn't reject you (that's something we can track in the lab, btw, social rejection hurts): they probably just had the jetstream of their own life hit turbulance for a second and where like, wait, what? They didn't have the perfect response in the moment, that's all.  Try, perhaps, to seperate the act from the expectation. Saying hello, is not the same thing as hearing hello back. Maybe let go of the idea that the thing you want to happen (make a human connection), comes directly from a single action, and more from an attitude and time amongst people. You can fine tune the behaviour and conversation tricks as you go.  In short. Be Bill Murray--put a knowing grin on your face, turn on that part of your head says ""I'm gonna be open to this experience"", go out into the world, and just leave it on. In a fix? Make a joke. Getting angry still? Make yourself the joke with self-depricating humour, even just to yourself.   That's kind of why Bill Murray is grinning anyway, the world is absurd. Knowing that, and enjoying it, is half the battle.  You seem on the right track, OP. I think you're gonna be okay."

Not everyone is up with chatting (especially with a stranger who he/she doesn't know and has no business with).   Just shrug it off and find others. If you tried this on 100 people and the majority brushed you off, you might be giving off some bad vibes somehow."
introvert,3dzdr6,Clamhead99,5,Mon Jul 20 20:15:31 2015 UTC,"I think you're on the right path with smiling and a brief greeting. It sounds as if you may be interacting with people when they're in the middle of something, either walking to class (the boy) or getting ready for class / leaving a class en route to another one (the girl). I'd try talking with people in a more relaxed environment, such as lunch in the cafeteria or at a coffee shop. If people aren't pressed for time, they're probably more likely to acknowledge you. Likewise, if you approach another introvert, we're more likely to engage in a more intimate / less populated setting.

introvert,3dzdr6,RB9,4,Mon Jul 20 19:55:06 2015 UTC,I would suggest putting yourself out there a little in class. Instead of sitting in the back never speaking make some attempts at participating in the class discussion. I personally would like nothing more than to sit in class and say nothing but I also can't stand sitting in a class where no one interacts with the instructor when they are trying to get people to participate.   You might say something in class that makes others interested in who you are and may just respond to your future attempts at interaction.
introvert,3dzdr6,winlock,2,Mon Jul 20 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"Im not sure if this might help but I've had 2 incidences where people said good morning and it threw me off guard because I didnt know them and I was rushing towards class (I was late to class). I think I wouldve said hi back if I knew they were in my class but they werent and I thought they wanted something from me. Anyway I think to approach someone, especially in a college setting, is to first start talking about the professor or the homework. Things like due dates or research papers gets people to be more interactive because they have to think about it and elaborate on the topic at hand. I find it very relating that we both get angry when people dont seem enthusiastic right off the bat and get all pouty about it (well I do anyway). Try sitting in the middle of the class but on the far side if you dont feel comfortable just yet and you'll probably find more talkative people in that area. I've noticed people that ask the most questions or tend to make small chit chat with the professor (quiet enough that we can hardly hear from the back what they're talking about) sit in the very front because they themselves dont know anyone and are willing to make connections. Keep trying!"
introvert,3dzdr6,violbabe,2,Tue Jul 21 00:35:26 2015 UTC,"There are loads of reasons people might not be interested in talking to you or anyone else at certain times. They might not know you well enough or not expect you to talk to them (at least the first few times), at which point they don't know what to say. They might have a lot on their minds.  I've started to realize that everybody is hesitant to open up to other people and are more or less just as afraid of talking to strangers as you and I are. People generally want things to be peaceful, and being friendly kind of ensures that is the outcome of any social interaction. Overcoming the fear of just opening your mouth and saying SOMETHING is imo quite easy. Keeping peoples interest after the initial contact is what's difficult."

In fact, most people are pleasantly surprised by that kind of shit. As for the girl, since you were talking to her out of the blue, she probably thought you were just hitting on her (may be or may not, idk), and she is either seeing someone or wasn't interested. Not a big deal. But if your interested in meeting new people, it has to be through social activities so that relationships (romantic or otherwise) can develop organically.  Otherwise, dude, your post was like reading about me from ten years ago. Keep at it, involve yourself in social activities, and just find other people that you share similar values with and spend time with them.   Best of luck,  A Similar Person"

Greetings to associates (who might be friends) is different.  The trick there is to be sincere, open, and inviting.  Allow others to feel they can talk with you.  Don't forget context though. Starting a conversation without any initial reason with someone you don't know well can be tough.  Also, some humor goes a long way to break the ice."

I had a total of 8 - 10 driving sessions with him, we didn't really chat much nor did he critique my driving much just small tips here and there most of these tips being things I had already know from studying the book so much.  On the last session while driving back to my house he says the following:  ""Well it was nice to meet you dsfunctional, you'll be a fine driver but your one shady ass motherfucker."""
introvert,3e33gs,dsfunctional,0,Tue Jul 21 16:53:38 2015 UTC,"He's probably a bit frustrated because he can't track your sight line as easily as with other people or sense your 'weak spots'.  A lot of people stress out when learning to drive and instructors can pick up on what specifically does it..   you're harder to read it sounds like.  I would start to narrate your actions for him - like, ""checking my blind spot, looks good, turning on left signal, changing lanes..."".  In terms of being social / chatting with him?  That's not what you're there for and you SHOULD be concentrating on just your driving.  Maybe add a few more random bits of small talk before you actually start driving to make him happy."

Don't let a title define how you interact or live a certain way. For example, I love to read, go home after work, stay away from crowds, listen to people, and yet I'm an extrovert.   You can also have the opposite traits, but be an introvert. A ""social"" introvert.   It all comes down to where you get your energy from and what makes you ""refuel""?   Extroverts typically refuel and recharge from speaking with others. It can be just a one on one conversation or with a group of 10-20 people. Either one, you're an extrovert.   Introverts typically refuel and recharge from being alone. Don't get me wrong, there are many Introverts that can talk to anyone and work a room, but at the end of the day they have to be by themselves to recharge.

To much anxiety, really not sure what to do.  I also don't have a preference for dancing, but your reaction seems pretty extreme. You might have an anxiety condition?  Do you get nervous in other scenarios?"
introvert,3dpujg,civilianjones,0,Sat Jul 18 07:50:04 2015 UTC,"middle. yea im not comfortable expressing myself like that. as for the anxiety, it was more like a hallucination. everything got really loud and it seemed like a nightmare where there was no way out. id rather just deal with those things though because i cannot talk to anyone about this, let alone get prescribed anything."
introvert,3dpujg,civilianjones,3,Sat Jul 18 07:56:23 2015 UTC,"It's rough not feeling like you have someone to talk to, I know how that is.   My symptoms were different when I was young, and I've grown past these kinds of symptoms; I'm in my late twenties.  You can definitely avoid dancing for the rest of your life. It's not hard to do.  If you're feeling self-conscious about it, you could even kind of wear that as a badge.  Go to dances, but just affirm: ""nah, I don't dance.""  It could be your thing.  My biggest issue with dancing was being self-aware of how I was dancing.  I was really worried that I would look dumb. I was wondering how I would react if someone criticized or made fun of me.  I was terrified of the interactions required to dance with a girl.  We introverts are good at thinking about possibilities. It's useful in most scenarios, but in situations where we're nervous, it ends up not helping.  Dancing, and other situations like it, are not something you can think yourself out of, or that you can solve with thinking.  Much like the beginning of a chess game--- you can't predict the end. You have to take a few steps into the scenario because our over-thinking talent becomes useful."
introvert,3dpujg,Wamaeno,29,Sat Jul 18 08:09:08 2015 UTC,"Once again: This has nothing to do with Introversion. Absolutely nothing. People never get it :/ You got a huge problem with anxiety instead.  I'm introverted myself and went to my graduation a few weeks ago too. And it was absolutely fine if not great.  Before this date i never danced or went to clubs or whatever. But I tried it out and had so much fun, I could have stayed even longer than 3am. All beeing an introvert. Now i even dance myself in my room when im absolutely chilled – I would never have expected both. So as an introvert it doesn't mean that situations like what you have experienced ""need"" to happen. You need to loose your anxiety and try it out. And environemnt in which you know most of the people (your classmates) would have been perfekt for this.  One more thing which is very important: Don't surround yourself with people who are introverteds tbemselfs, shy or whatever. There is nothing worse to do, but you will copy their behaviour, mindset and feelings. My graduation wouldn't have been as great if i had done this, instead of going to my Partygirl-friend who moved things forward."

[…] you will copy their behaviour, mindset and feelings.   I disagree with that. Throughout my life, my closests friends have often been more introverted than extroverted, and it's great. Surrounding yourself exclusively with extroverts will be draining and not fun at all. And in all those years none of my friends have copied my behaviour or feelings (how is the latter even possible?) or vice versa."
introvert,3dpujg,Wamaeno,-3,Sat Jul 18 09:30:38 2015 UTC,"Doing exclusively is draining, i absolutely agree here. But you shouldn't be one-sided, as you are a very exact copy of the 5 people who are the closest to you in your social circle – i thought this is something known? And yes, you can copy feeling unconsciously. Negative people will give you negative emotions and ways to think. Positive people instead will bring you further. This is exactly what i experience myself right now. I feel like this sub is unfortunately oftentimes not very helpful, as people sometimes tend to circle-jerk about their introversion, which is oftentimes (like it seems here too) not only introversion, but more or less social anxiety. Which is nothing cool or to be proud of."
introvert,3dpujg,SCPH-0815,2,Sat Jul 18 10:39:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you hang out with only 'negative people' it will affect you, of course. I don't agree with the ""exact copy of five friends"" thing though. To a certain extent that may hold true, but not ""exact copy"". There are areas where we have a lot in common, but we're still distinct persons.  I also wouldn't say it's a ""circlejerk about introversion"" here, most people who come in for the first time simply don't know the difference; they have googled a bit, read about introversion, thought ""hey, that's me!"" and posted here to get some insight. In some cases it holds true, in others it doesn't."
introvert,3dpujg,Imprenditore,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:03:20 2015 UTC,"I think Wamaeno is thinking of the quote ""You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.""

A group of socially anxious people isn't necessarily mutually beneficial for those trying to overcome it. Whereas an extroverted friend can help someone who's shy to break out of their shell."

introvert,3dpujg,beefstewie,7,Sat Jul 18 09:36:08 2015 UTC,Sweating? Panicking? Feeling uncomfortable at people just dancing?  Yea. Not introversion. Anxiety.
introvert,3dpujg,kirbac,5,Sat Jul 18 14:02:02 2015 UTC,"There's no need to be so defensive.  If you only came to post for validation then you need to realize that you're going to get a lot of differing opinions.  This really does not sound like introversion, it sounds like you are uncomfortable dancing and have social anxiety because of it.   the shyest of people were there having fun   Those guys were more likely the introverts.    I will give you the benefit of the doubt that if you felt like an island in the middle of an endless sea, it is definitely harder to feel comfortable joining the greater social sphere of dancing.  And dancing isn't for everyone.  But I guarantee that if you had a dance partner, or a smaller group bobbing along away from the dance floor, you'd have been just fine.  Introverts who like dancing will avoid that clump in the middle of the dance floor and find a smaller more intimate space to occupy so they don't feel as overwhelmed.  You just aren't comfortable with dancing itself.  What Wamaeno was saying was hanging exclusively with other introverts lends itself to wallflower tendencies.  You will never seek to do anything more than sitting around and not participating.  It's a party, you can't not expect heavy socializing and dancing.  TL;DR: Anxiety of dancing and Introversion are not the same."
introvert,3dpujg,Wamaeno,3,Sat Jul 18 14:00:49 2015 UTC,"They weren't bashing introverts. They just said not to ONLY hang around people who aren't outgoing. Sometimes shy people need a little push from their friends to try new things. If you only have shy friends, none of you will ever get the courage to leave your comfort zone."
introvert,3dpujg,DoubleHelix3,3,Sat Jul 18 12:21:50 2015 UTC,"I'm an introvert myself. What i wanted to show here is that I never imagined myself to have fun dancing, just like you do. But i tried it out and had a lot of fun. That's why i ""want"" you to do the same.  You haven't even tried it out, but are saying that you will never go to a dance in your life. This is simply said stupid.  What i want to say is that you copy a lot of things from your social circle, unconsciously. If you surround yourself only with shy and not so outgoing people, how will you ever experience sth. besides this? This is exactly what happened at your graduation, and you didn't like it.  You don't need to go in an extreme, just bring some more outgoing people in your life as well as introverts or shy people. But beeing only one-sided is dangerous.."
introvert,3dpujg,dedrizzle,2,Sat Jul 18 10:33:22 2015 UTC,"This EXACT same thing happened to me. It s something I'll always remember and it sucked to know there was no one else who felt like me. How could I be the only one? It would have been so awesome to have at least 1 other shy person to bond with in that time. This was in 9th grade. I'm 22 now and things haven't gotten much better for me. I've only isolated myself even more, which I regret."

I mean, if there's something you don't want to do, to the point of becoming anxious and about to pass out, I don't think there's anything wrong with explaining that you're not comfortable doing it. Or just that you don't feel like it. You don't have to dance at a dance. You're certainly not the only person in the world who goes to dances and doesn't dance. Nothing wrong with be a ""wallflower."" Is that even a term you kids use these days? Get off my lawn! Sorry.  I used to love school dances, personally. But I had friends who would sit the entire time. At the very least, I'd keep them company from time to time, while catching my breath or during a song I didn't like (or during slow dances when I didn't have an SO...). Hopefully your friends did the same.  I'll say this though; Don't write dances off completely. Maybe you just need to find the right place and people. Go to a club one day and just get lost in the energy and music. Sometimes... (start around 0:30)"

That being said, when I went to the rave at anime expo it was a ton of fun. I'm very reserved and you don't see me head banging or anything, but over there I really let loose and had fun. I still found myself on the outside of the dance floor and didn't dance with anyone, but it was fun to just enjoy the music, the hot cosplaying gogo dancers, and live DJ.   WHat kind of music did they play? Was it that shitty club music?"

introvert,3dpujg,bryceland23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"Did your friend ask you and try to drag into the dancing floor? Or did your friend just leave you? At times like these, if I didnt want to dance then I could distract myself with my phone or my purse because I end up carrying a lot of junk that I dont really need but it saves me from uncomfortable moments such as this. I could rummage through my bag for an hour and try to calm myself down from the anxiety. See I'm an introvert and I also have social anxiety but I really love dancing-- I wont be the first one on the floor...not even the second or third person there but eventually once theres enough people going- I immediately start to walk towards there and dance my butt off. Its a great stress reliever believe it or not. And its fun for me. Just remember if you ever feel like giving it a try, just take your time in getting to know how you dance in front a mirror or if you completely dont know how to then just observe some people and how they sway their bodies. Go with the tempo. Take one step at a time."

introvert,3dpst2,xJacy,7,Sat Jul 18 07:10:53 2015 UTC,"I have never really connected with anyone in my entire life and I am 18 years old.   If 90-100% of your social circle is based on the people you're going to high school with, this is pretty normal, even more so if you're in a smaller/suburban town. I was a quiet kid/teacher's pet in high school just because I hated the typical high school drama. Sounds like you might be the same way.  Once I started branching out my social network when I was about 19, I started to enjoy people a lot more, mostly because I could choose my friends from a much wider selection. I'm 24 now, and I have a very small group of close friends, but they understand me almost completely and I enjoy their company more often than not.  If you haven't yet, try taking one of the MBTI personality tests, and connecting with people that have similar traits. If you're heavily introverted (like I am), I'd suggest sticking with I-type personalities. From reading your post, it wouldn't surprise me if you're an INTJ."

I have a small social circle, because I don't like getting into drama and dealing with people.   I guess I'll have to wait as time passes by to meet real people that I can connect with, in the meantime I'll keep a smile on my face and ignore the drama and try not to be sucked into this hole of high school shit lol.  As for the personality tests, I will definitely look into that. Thank you! Upvote."

When I got married, my best man was my cousin whom I am extremely close with.  The only friends that I really have are friends of my wife's that are a bit older than us, and some adult-aged people from our Church we go to. That's really all I need."
introvert,3dpst2,fouljabber,2,Sun Jul 19 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"I definitely value close friends and typically much prefer a few close friends rather than a lot of casual friends.   I guess in the same manner you're implying, the reason why I prefer close friends is because I find casual friendships to be far less meaningful and often forced or fake, which also makes them a lot of effort.  I'm 33 and have noticed that there are often cycles in my friendships. For all the times I felt that I was putting more effort into a friendship, I realised that there were times when they put more effort in than me and I was withdrawn due to personal circumstances or general mood. I think this is what helps to build a lifelong friendship; being able to appreciate that we all have downtime and friendship requires effort from both. I try to take a much more positive approach to life and if I genuinely enjoy someone's company a lot, I will put a lot of effort into being a good friend to help establish the strong, close friendship. I'm happy to make the first moves in that sense, particularly because I'm naturally attracted to extroverts as friends (but prefer my SO to be introverted) and extroverts tend to already have a lot of friends. It's hard to build new friendships as an adult, but if you are attentive and demonstrate your excellent friendship, the good ones will naturally reciprocate your effort in time."

introvert,3do7pl,newsjournalist88,8,Fri Jul 17 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"I'm always shocked at how narrow minded therapists can be.  They're not mind readers obviously, but it is their job to get into your head, see why you think/feel the way you do and try to figure out a way to treat you.   Be wary of continuing to go to this therapist with the idea that it will ""get better"", that's what I did and it only made me resent my therapist and close myself off. (It wasn't an introversion/extraversion thing, but a similar failure to connect)  The caveat I have is that her advice to try and be a bit more ""extraverted"" may be good advice.  I know I'm happiest when I have a balance of going out/staying in, and it may be doubly true since you work from home."
introvert,3do7pl,yiab127,4,Sat Jul 18 05:28:19 2015 UTC,"Do you feel comfortable otherwise around her? Does she communicate in a way that you think will help? If not, find a new one. If so, her not believing introversion alone won't make her an ineffective therapist. The issue isn't caused by introversion, but a limited social life and isolation."
introvert,3do7pl,wolark,2,Fri Jul 17 21:58:42 2015 UTC,"That's true. I feel comfortable enough around her. A lot of the time the things I leave feeling that I didn't gain much from the experience but I probably am, it just takes time. So maybe I'll keep trying and also putting myself out there socially. One of the challenges I feel is accepting the traits that come with being introverted, and not comparing myself to others."
introvert,3do7pl,wolark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:14:19 2015 UTC,"I think that you would get the most from therapy if you told her your concerns and in general stopped using broad terms like introversion and instead gave the specific issues labels. It's a bit like saying you have blood sugar issues, then expecting a doctor to know it's diabetes not hypoglycemia or something else  Edit Removed extra useless sentence"
introvert,3do7pl,dejoblue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:18:50 2015 UTC,"The issue is no that she doesn't believe in introversion, it is that she stated such and did not provide evidence or a frame of reference for you to latch onto. I agree with her premise (that introversion and all personality traits are learned behaviors), but in practice people are introverted. One doesn't change that by stating it doesn't exist and sprinkling magic ""I said so"" dust around.  It is like saying I do not believe in the English language because we are all born without language and what language we speak is exclusively dependent on our upbringing.  We are all born with blue eyes, so I suppose brown eyes do not exist either.  While we cant change our eye color, we can learn a new language, (and a therapist needs to know which things can be changed and which need to be coped with properly) but we learn new languages much differently than native languages, in a different part of the brain, and all secondary languages, even those we become ""fluent"" in are always referencing the native language.  This is exactly what will occur with behavior learned from birth, from coping mechanisms to hand gestures. And all new ones will reference your original ones, even if it is simply to remind yourself not to do that and to do the new thing you learned.  I am not a doctor, but that is my take on it. And I will tell you, the older I get, the more I just speak my mind, it solves all kinds of problems. This is the point where I would speak up and see if she is going to back up what she said, put up with me and help me help myself by calling me on my own bullshit (if it is bullshit) or acknowledge her own. Either way, I find out what kind of therapist I am conferring with."

It's a horrible job for an introvert, but then so are most jobs, and it's a good way to keep making money while looking for a job that actually suits me. Anyway, we have 0 expectation that a customer will talk. If they're engaging or entertaining, that's fine too. Basically, the few other lyft drivers I know personally, and everyone on our local Lyft facebook group, have all said that they rarely find themselves giving out less than a 5 star rating unless the passenger did something really bad. Lyft drivers are also screened more, and generally people, at least in my area, seem to far prefer the Lyft experience over the Uber experience. I know I'm biased, but I still recommend switching services. Lyft is maybe a few cents per mile more expensive, basically negligibly, but our peak-time prices are capped, whereas Uber's prices can skyrocket if the service is busy. Long time users actually report spending less on Lyft in the long run. They discontinued our driver referral codes, so I have nothing to gain by suggesting Lyft to you, especially because I'm interviewing for a new job here pretty soon. I just think that might be the way to go for you. Plus, look at their new driver tip video: http://thehub.lyft.com/blog/2015/7/14/giving-betterrides-great-conversation-or-golden-silence"

introvert,3dk3if,My_Post_Is_On_Topic,25,Fri Jul 17 13:38:14 2015 UTC,"I've never used Uber, and this is precisely a reason I don't intend to.   It does bug me when I pick up a taxi, and I just want to be lost in my own thoughts, or quietly observe the world outside through the window, but the driver keeps trying to make small talk and strike conversation.  But in the case of a taxi, at least the way I see things, the roles are clearly defined: he's a professional doing his job, I'm a paying customer being taken somewhere. That's it. I'm not there to socialize, and there's no need for me to maintain some sort of ""rating"" so I can get a proper service next time. So when I don't follow his attempts at making conversation he ends up giving up, shuts up, and we can have the rest of the ride in peaceful quietness.  But to me, things like Uber, or Airbnb, and such, blur these lines between customer and service provider.   Last year while I was traveling during my summer holidays, I stayed for a couple days at what I initially thought was a regular hotel, but turned out to be one of these airbnb-type of things: it was an older couple who owned several other flats on their building, and rented them out as rooms.   The place was very nice, they had a good taste, and it was clear they put a lot of effort into making your stay as pleasurable as possible. But they kept bugging me and my SO to come over their own flat for dinner, or for ""drinks and chats""; they would show up unannounced to our flat to bring fruit platters, ask us and try to give us advice on what places to go and visit in their city, and so on and so forth.  It's not that I'm ungrateful for all their efforts, I'm well aware they did everything with their best intentions, and that ""normal"" people would greatly appreciate it all.  But for me (and my SO), the best kind of hotel service is the one where I see them when I check in, and don't see them again until I check out. That's how my brain is wired, I enjoy being left to my own devices.  So I try to stay away from these new kind of ""social"" services that blur the lines between customer and service provider - such as Uber. Take my money and do your job, that's all I'm asking, thank you."

It was nearly 1am in Downtown Oakland and I desperately needed to pee so I just wanted to get home. 5 minute ride and he could go right back and pick people up but he was annoyed I wasn't higher fare so he tanked my ranking.  Don't take it too personally. If you want to try getting a little better about it, ask a couple basic questions like ""How's your day?"" or ""Any good fares lately?"" and leave it at that.

I don't understand why you being quiet but polite should lower your rating, as long as you're not causing a problem of any kind then it should be fine. I guess that's an issue with letting part time taxi drivers make the rules up as they go along."
introvert,3dk3if,AptCasaNova,8,Thu Jul 16 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and let's face it, uber and lyft drivers are a different breed. Because it's more part time, they decide to have a bit more fun of it and are interested in all the different personalities they come across--especially in a big city like mine.    I sometimes think, ""Hey, it'd be fun to set my own hours and drive around whenever I want and get paid for it"" because that is exactly what I like to do in my free time.  But then I'm reminded of having to deal with people and their personalities, and it's an instant turn-off."

Lay down some clear boundaries and let him know that if he over steps them you simply won't spend ANY time with him at all.  Don't even answer texts/calls unless you are 100% OK with being talked into hanging out.  People like this latch on and exhaust their friendships fairly quickly.

Generally, those who do not bore themselves are busy in the world in one way or another, but for that very reason they are, of all people, the most boring of all, the most unbearable… The other class of human beings, the superior ones, are those who bore themselves… They generally amuse others — at times in a certain external way the masses, in a deeper sense their co-initiates. The more thoroughly they bore themselves, the more potent the medium of diversion they offer others, also when the boredom reaches its maximum, since they either die of boredom (the passive category) or shoot themselves out of curiosity (the active category)."

introvert,3djy3l,7536982145,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:20:29 2015 UTC,"INFJ here. I've often felt that I am boring in the average social situation.  I have interests like football and current events that cover about 80% of the most relatable conversation, but outside of that, I just don't share my peers' interests (usually drinking, night clubs, expensive hobbies) which makes me come off as boring sometimes.  My extrovert friends can easily carry conversations because they are quick to say everything there is to say and spin the conversation into a new thread.  I am usually unprepared to go this new direction they go, so I become quiet.  Instead I step back and I go back to listening mode and I need time to think about this new subject, so it often seems like I become disinterested.  But that's where my hobbies come in.  I play piano, I cook, I bake, I bike, I craft swords, I draw, I do archery, I build with LEGO, I garden.  And people will ask me what I did over the weekend and I'll tell them with great joy one of my strange hobbies and I immediately come off as the most interesting person in the world.  I've found that I am no good in exchanging ""pleasantries"".  My extrovert friends are very good at kicking a conversation along.  But part of being good in conversation means that you have a lot to offer.  If you feel you are boring, pick up new hobbies or read books to start expanding your views."

And your reaction is:   This is one of the few things I have to deal with almost every single day.   Don't take it so personally. Boo-hoo, you have friends who somehow like you and want to hang out! Have you tried to explain introversion to them, or do you just fume silently and then lash out?  You don't sound introverted, to be honest. You sound antisocial and like you don't want to see anyone, or have any friends, or talk to anyone. Ever. That's not introversion.   Anyway, many people on this sub have a bad habit of identifying with introversion and then just wallowing in it while indulging in pitiful feelings of victim-hood. What a waste of time."

I love those friends of mine to bits but if you knew them like I do, you'd know that they can be very intrusive and extremely talkative (they once had an hour long argument over music). I believe that if you're antisocial you push people further and further away from you. I don't do that always, just often. Sometimes more often that other times.

This is why i believe Introverts feel so over powered and angered by our 'rivals', but ironically, we don't have a say do we?  For me personally, I've felt the need to adapt to this 'western construct', and have tried to become more sociable.   Why?   I have no choice. It has come to the point where I'm becoming unlikable due to my lone Friday and Saturday nights at home. I'm sick of arguing with other's of why I don't want to go out.   Even though your conversation/explanation about introversion is significantly substantial compared to Brittany's new boyfriend, job, car or whatever, Brittany takes home the win.

Hanging out with my cat. I used to have guinea pigs and building cages for them and making fun environments for them was very rewarding. Listening to music, Bach is very centering also.

They're doing it for you, too, because they think you're like them.  Your policy of canned responses is correct. It helps the extravert while avoiding the bullshit. If you try to explain how you're different from them they will not believe you, because they think others are like them.  The reason they think you're rude is because by speaking, they think they are doing you a service, because it would be for them. So you are being ungrateful and harmful, as you denied their help and denied their interaction needs.  Your best course of action is to continue canned responses and spend time alone or with introverts when needed."

You can also just do it and not care that people find you rude but I don't think you need, not with most people. If you are being completely drained by it then you need to find a better way to turn the conversation to something that interests you or excuse yourself completely. There is nothing wrong with not finding fart jokes funny or not wanting to discuss a topic that doesn't interest you. You are choosing to act how you are and then blaming it on other people - stop caring so much about what other people think. A lot of people can tell when you are not genuine anyway."
introvert,3deiyz,WiretapStudios,3,Wed Jul 15 21:15:35 2015 UTC,"I find racial humor funny, as in a comedians set, but not racist people telling me racist jokes, etc. I either just look at them, explain that's not my type of humor, or make it apparent their bullshit is disappointing to me. I'm introverted, but unless someone catches me off guard, I don't feel the need to validate something that I don't find amusing. Small talk is sometimes needed to fit in, so I get that part, even though I hate it - it's just more socially acceptable than everyone being awkwardly silent. Validation is important to people, but yes, it's not really my job (as you said) to walk around validating everyone - however, in work and social relationships, that's what people crave, so you can choose to participate, or don't, but you'll probably be judged if you don't. It mostly depends on the location. If a friend showed me some unfunny shit, I'd just say ""eh"" and move on. If it's someone at work... depends on the situation. I live in the South, so there is a lot of ""Good Ol' Boy"" racism and humor that abounds, so it's a minefield to dodge. What I haven't mastered yet is being able to navigate it to validate them and also not get annoyed internally. I can do it a good amount of the time, but sometimes it annoys me for hours on end afterward."

Even those that don't will spread the word that I'm unfriendly or cold and it will hurt my career...  I realize this is very utilitarian, but I try to strike a balance in my personal life.  I have a few close friends who are extroverts and I don't mind speaking their language when we interract because they respect my language too.

I'm not good with confrontation either, but sometimes if you stop laughing at the terrible jokes (or do it in a way that's kind of obvious you're only being polite), they'll get the picture.   It's also ok to say something like ""ah that's not really my sort of humour, but I can see how a lot of people would appreciate that"" without actually laughing. That's worked for me in the past, when it's one on one anyway. It's harder to use this approach if there's a group of people there."

introvert,3dbxu9,roadwarder,26,Wed Jul 15 02:03:00 2015 UTC,"I may be unnecessarily splitting hairs here, but that sounds more like internal/external processing instead of introversion/extroversion.  I'm guessing that a majority of extroverts are external processors and vice versa, but I've always thought introversion/extroversion to be where people get their energy from, not where they feel their thoughts are most clear.  Either way, I think it's a great analogy."
introvert,3dbxu9,AdioRadley,5,Wed Jul 15 03:24:05 2015 UTC,"No, that's a good point.

introvert,3dbxu9,dworon1,3,Wed Jul 15 03:49:37 2015 UTC,It probably all made sense in your head.   Before you tried to write it down.
introvert,3dbxu9,Crushgaunt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:13:16 2015 UTC,It's worth pointing out that internal/external processing is a hallmark of introvert/extravert and is actually one of the ways they're understood academically.
introvert,3dbxu9,Wurstgeist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:47:15 2015 UTC,"""Getting energy"" makes no sense literally. Even losing energy (being tired out) raises the question of what your brain is using all that energy to do. Somebody recently suggested to me that introverts get more easily over-stimulated - that sounded plausible.  Internal/external processing is an interesting thought, we use external processing all the time (like how I'm reading my words as I write them and editing sometimes), why shouldn't some people rely more heavily on hearing their own words spoken than others do? You'd think this would make extroverts more prone to faux pas than introverts, though. There's that adage ""engage brain before opening mouth"", if extroverts really do their thinking after speaking they should be constantly falling foul of this. Maybe they develop strategies to patch things up when they misspeak? Oh, maybe sticking to bland phrases and cliches could be a useful strategy for such a person, that might explain a thing or two.  There are all kinds of styles of being introverted, anyway. Defining it in an excessively strict way irritates me because it would tend to exclude me even though I have distinct hermit traits. I might be a bit schizoid but don't strongly fit that type; I've been socially awkward in the past but am mostly over it; I tend to feel alienated or aloof; I like having a few close friends, If I go out and dance or meet people that probably means I'm behaving uncharacteristically, probably on purpose, and I might do that once every three or four years. I like time alone. I'm an introvert by any ordinary dictionary definition, but this ""energy"" thing means nothing to me and I'm fine with stimulating environments if I've chosen them. I'm sure there are many ways to be an introvert."
introvert,3dbxu9,Crushgaunt,2,Wed Jul 15 11:49:49 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that ""getting energy"" in this sense is referring to social energy, not the kind of energy referred to in, say, physics.   I'm an introvert by any ordinary dictionary definition   It's worth pointing out that most dictionary definitions are going to be woefully incomplete and potentially flat-out wrong."
introvert,3dbxu9,Wurstgeist,0,Thu Jul 16 14:59:52 2015 UTC,"In the circumstances, I'm going to make an unusual request: can I read your thesis? Because on the face of it you make it sound as if ""social energy"" is metaphysical and dictionary definitions aren't real."
introvert,3dbxu9,Crushgaunt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"Sure, it just may take a while to be in a position to make it available, real life being real life, and such.   Because on the face of it you make it sound as if ""social energy"" is metaphysical   I don't think I'd say metaphysical, at least not at least without qualifying it to some extent.  Social energy is essentially a term used to describe the potential to resist mental fatigue.  In introverts mental fatigue is often caused by over stimulation, something introverts are more easily prone to than extraverts.   and dictionary definitions aren't real.   Less ""not real"" and more ""not meant to be used in this contex."" The dictionary definition of words like this are simplified and that often impacts meaning which means that when discussing things like this (that is to say, non-concrete and and quasi-philosophical points) a simplified definition such as one you'll find in a dictionary will often leave you under-equipped to fully understand the subject at hand."
introvert,3dbxu9,Wurstgeist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:57:10 2015 UTC,"Less ""not real"" and more ""not meant to be used in this contex.""   By this context, do you mean this subreddit?  Seems to me a comparison could be made with r/berries. People there are posting about things they think are berries, by the common usage of the term. If they were following strict botanical definitions the sub would look quite different. Everybody posting about raspberries or strawberries would told to post in r/nuts instead. There'd be a lot more posts about grapes, and there could also be posts about bananas, except I don't think so many people are interested in growing, identifying or discussing bananas. The poor guy who wants to talk about sloes (""sloe berries"" as he termed them) might be chased off to r/drupes, which hasn't had a post for over six months.  So r/introvert could be all fussy and fragmented like that, or alternatively we could be nice to one another and allow fruitful discussions about personality traits that seem quite similar and have things in common and would be broadly termed ""introvert"" by the man in the street. What do you think?"
introvert,3dbxu9,Crushgaunt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:45:15 2015 UTC,"By this context, do you mean this subreddit?   Not exactly.  The dictionary definition serves fine for extremely casual conversation or a quick explanation.  If one wants to discuss introversion in any depth past that, one must look for a more technical definition.  So siting a dictionary definition when giving someone a quick overview is fine, but when sitting down and talking about introversion, such as on this subreddit, you're going to need a more complete definition.   Re: comparison   It would be more akin to if r/USMC had posters talking about the National Guard under the guise of military things often being clumped together.  When we've got so many people here labeling their social anxiety, shyness, or lack of social skills as ""introverted"" we're not only doing them a disservice by letting them think that they're merely discussing introversion (thus making it less likely that they'll get constructive advice), but we're also sending the wrong message to the introverts here: introversion doesn't look like shyness, it doesn't look like social anxiety, and it isn't predicated on a lack of social skills.  If we're talking about introversion, we need to be talking about introversion, not perpetuating the idea that introverts are neutroatypical recluses with social issues."

And he was extremely extroverted, so he'd often bring new people with him that I didn't know.  I was a shy kid then, so this did not make me happy, although admittedly these pop-ins usually did lead to going out and having a good time.  Even so, I think part of why he kept doing it was because he thought it was ""wrong"" that I felt uncomfortable with it.  I guess sometimes what extroverts consider to be normal behavior can seem rude to introverts.   And then I look like an a-hole for preferring to not sit there to talk or entertain them.   And in this case, sometimes what introverts consider to be normal behavior can seem rude to extroverts."

I suffer from depression and also mild social anxiety (generally feelings of worthless, useless, left out, not part of normal social gatherings).  As a coping mechanism I like to plan things - a regular schedule (like regular working hours, go home, cook, walk dog, sit and chill - puts me at ease.  If my wife changes her mind about something we planned to do, it threatens to increase my feelings of depression because my plans are now ruined.  So if someone were to come round unannounced, I hate it - I'd rather they phoned and arranged something.  Typically because of the lack of friendships, it's usually for my wife and I go hide upstairs.  But it's not my introversion that causes this."

I also wouldn't mind if my parents showed up at my house or my in-laws.  However, when it's the holidays and I go to my parents, or if we are having a get together at one of my brothers places....and I show up and see people I don't know and wasn't told would be there...I get annoyed.  I don't know why, but I get in sort of a shit mood. I don't feel comfortable and don't really want to talk with them or deal with them in any aspect.  Even I think it's pretty weird, but it's just how I've always been."
introvert,3daoey,cloningblues,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:17:55 2015 UTC,"Yep. My mother's friends do this too. Her friends, which are my mom's roommates' family don't give a shit. They are Latino so they're loud as fuck. I'm Latino too, but I guess I'm very Americanized, don't know. Day and night, doesn't matter. They'll come and be loud, while people are trying to sleep.  It's annoying cause I pay rent too. I never have friends over or parties in my house because once I do, 15 of my mom's friends show up unannounced for their own party.   Sometimes I have meetings with actors in my house (I guess you can say I'm an entrepreneur filmmaker), and they just come unannounced with their loudness.   One time, back when I was in high school, I had to take the ACT for high school. In my school, if you didn't pass the ACT you didn't pass high school. My mother and her roommate knowing full well I needed a good night sleep, decided to throw a late night get together which lasted until 3AM.  My mother doesn't care about my opinions, though. She never has. She's only ever cared about her friends' opinions, then gets mad when I tell her that I don't like her friends. She tells me they're like family, I tell her, they're like your family.  My comment has nothing to do with being introverted... So I'll conclude by saying I myself am introverted. lol"

They will continue to talk to you but will have to speak in a raised voice. Few people like to  They will invite you to events, politely say no thanks ""I'm busy."" This would still take a couple of weeks for your neighbors to catch on.  People I would rarely see I use that method. Since you live there I would simply let them know when you're home you like to stay at close to home. Confess to being a homebody and an introvert. Most people will accept that and move on. They will still be nice but keep more of a distance. It can back fire since some people will try to ""help"" you break out of your shell."

Every time I'm outside, or in my yard, I always feel like the other neighbors come outside just to be nosy as shit or see what i'm doing. The worst is when they try to make small talk, when I hardly know them, or have never even talked to them. I guess it's good because we don't have to worry about being robbed or burglarized since they are so damn nosy.   The only neighbor i've really talked to is a lady next door. She's older, had surgery recently, and can't get around because of it, so i'm nice enough to mow her lawn once a week for some extra cash. Even though I told her she doesn't have to pay me. I guess we don't mind talking to her because she seems introverted and reserved like us.   I guess I should just be satisfied that we live in a rent-free house right now. I'll take the nosy and annoying neighbors for that any day."

Being a mega-introvert myself though, these are some things I/we want to do to keep everything as low-key as possible:   Small wedding party, made up of partners (so everyone has someone to talk to and it's not awkward) Wedding party spends minimal money on their outfits (~200 bucks or less) Short rehearsal/rehearsal dinner (rehearsal less than an hour, don't have to attend the dinner, but I figure if you make people do stuff you should feed them) Short, evening wedding No brunch afterwards (we might have breakfast with our parents but that's it)   It irks me how much of a three-ring circus weddings are, and how people want to be involved with everything at all times. I also plan to pretty much do all the coordinating/planning/setting up myself (with the help of my fiancé) because dealing with other people is time consuming and tiring and generally so not worth it.

I've found that the social encounters are far from shallow at the weddings I've attended as a guest (I worked as a photographer for a while shooting weddings and other events, but that's a different story). People are happy and dancing and being loud, and sure that's not my dream activity, but no one is forcing you to get on the dance floor and in a few days this will all be history and you won't see half of those people ever again.   Yeah, it's draining, but it's your brother's wedding so try to take advantage of whatever alone time you can squander and make a real attempt to enjoy yourself."

I'm less comfortable at weddings for people I don't know well, like the SO's side or one of his friends or acquaintances. At family weddings, I'm comfortable letting loose & there's lots of people to talk to.  But without that, weddings are tedious & not very enjoyable for me. And it's worse if they don't even have good food or cake, because that's the only thing I look forward to when I go to a wedding like that."

Don't you think there is a better option than hiding in a corner when you're there and loathing the people who drag you out to be there to support and congratulate your brother and his soon-to-be-wife? Wouldn't you rather find some way to be happier in the inevitable situation?   Edit: Tone is everything and it's always lost in text, so please don't read this as combatative.

Actually, can't you just ask him that? I'm not hugely up to speed with social mores and things and I despise marriage, but I don't see why it should be offensive to tell somebody that you'd like to be there for the ceremony and not for the other bullshit. I mean, if you came up with a less offensive word for ""bullshit"" to use there. He is your brother after all, doesn't he get the general idea that you might feel this way already?

I'm not very close with him as we have very little common ground. But nevertheless I am in the wedding party by default so there really isn't much I can get out of. I mean potentially I could tell him that I'll be there for the ceremony and the rehearsal and I'm sure he wouldn't hate me, but I think it'd really hurt him as well as my family.  The only thing I can potentially get out of is the Sunday brunch, but even with that I don't know, cause at that point it's not about him.

We're planning a wedding in Hemingways house in our 5yr anniversary because we both love Hemingway and he knows I'd love to be surrounded by cats at our wedding then take the cruise down to Cuba and spend a week there in some isolated beach drinking all the rum smoking all the pot having all the sex.

I like to leave myself enough in case something happens on the way there such as a detour because of an accident.   As for being early for other things? The sooner I get there, the sooner I leave. So it's a win."
introvert,3da71s,chrysophylax_dives,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:52:23 2015 UTC,"Agree, totally. I need to be 'in the zone' to deal with people, and it irks me when they turn up early  The level of irkedness is proportional to the prematurity of their arrival  But all of this pales into insignificance compared to tardiness. Heaven help you if you're late (and you don't call). Heaven won't help you if you no-show (with or without notification)  If I make plans with someone, i view that as a contract, a commitment. It automatically becomes a matter of trust and integrity.  I have 'commitment' issues, can you tell? (couldn't resist)"
introvert,3da71s,Hegemott,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:13:19 2015 UTC,"I usually am a bit early at places for two reasons:   I finished getting myself ready a little bit before I have to go. Now, I have nothing to do until my optimal time to leave. I leave a bit earlier than I have to, for when I have to travel longer than I have to. If there's a traffic jam or something, I'll still be on time."

introvert,3d6arw,InforMedic,18,Mon Jul 13 21:25:47 2015 UTC,"I have found that people like this feed off of getting a response. It doesn't seem to matter if it's positive or negative, they just want a reaction, and the bigger the reaction, the more they'll repeat whatever it is that caused it. I've learned a bit about positive reinforcement and it seems to apply when dealing with attention seekers.     When I encounter someone obnoxious like this I take great pains to show as little interest as possible. I'm not rude, I don't insult them or complain, I don't completely ignore them, I just don't give them the feedback they desperately want. If I interact with that person often, they will start to realize that I'm not going to reward them for their behavior. Usually they will stop bugging me for attention at this point. If you're lucky you may even be able to shape their behavior into something you find more agreeable, but that takes more knowledge about training than I have."

Narcissist are not only what people typically think of them as (shallow, self-absorbed people). They also are known to invade other people's space both physically and emotionally. They basically get their fill on other people's energy until they empty them, and then hunt for other people so they can steal their energy. The reason for this is they mirror other people and are empty themselves. My father-in-law is so needy and self-absorbed that my husband and I have had to break ties with him and his wife. It seemed the more time we spent with him, the more time that was required of us. We were constantly being harassed via phone calls, texts, emails, snail mail and by person...it was just too much for us."

I'm not sure if we butt heads because we are both the youngest girls in our family and don't want to be knocked off our little princess thrones, but she drains the hell out of me. She is always in need of lots and lots of attention and must always contribute to every single conversation in some way. She has an opinion on EVERYTHING and no matter what the subject matter, she has some sort of authority on it (she thinks).   I'm pretty quiet and my voice doesn't project well, so it can be difficult for me to converse with or near her, as she is loud and EXTREMELY disruptive. She never, ever lets me finish a sentence. She seems to attempt to one-up me in any way possible. It is absolutely exhausting for me to be around her for more than an hour or two, so I usually just completely shut down in her presence. She is insufferable to me.   Oh, and congrats to me, because she is now knocked up by my brother. No gettin' rid of her now.

The problem with that is, it just makes things more tense and awkward and the environment becomes more draining. I basically allow it to keep the peace.

I think telling him that you're a more reserved individual and there are topics which interest you but may not interest him (and vice-versa) really will go a long way."

It will take time and it will be difficult, but eventually you will turn a page and a new, more upbeat chapter will begin in your life.  In the meantime take care of yourself. Do the small, inexpensive things that make you happy and provide a break from the routine. This could be taking long walks or bike rides; borrowing and reading books from the local library; visit local museums or art galleries; playing video games; rearrange and/or redecorate your home; etc.  It doesn't matter what it is as long as you enjoy it and it takes your mind off your troubles for a short while.    Once you find your mental state improving and provided you have the time and energy, you can expand your list to include group activities with the intent of making new friends. Look around for local organizations/groups that share your interests. This could include volunteer organizations (homeless shelters, habitat restoration projects, animal shelters, etc.) as well as more traditional clubs/orgs (book clubs, running/exercise clubs, political groups, etc.) with the intent to make new friends and expand your horizons a bit."

Like you I have to put on an extrovert mask in order to so much as function there, but there are times in the day that I just shut down completely, and most of my high-energy coworkers seem to notice. I just go kind of numb and robotic in some way. I usually try and ask for tasks that involve the least amount of customer interaction, like making drinks on bar. But even so, you're always talking to customers. And some of them are so rude and entitled over something so simple as coffee that it's mind blowing.

It's easy to get pulled into things that sound fun but will just leave you more tired, so be on alert for that.  On the other hand, make sure you're still being available to people when you can be.

Just one piece of it at a time - rehearsal dinner, wedding, reception - whatever matches your plans.  The wedding won't be hard because typically the guests are behind you - you won't see them once the ceremony starts.

introvert,3d1uxh,mxmindock,2,Sun Jul 12 23:55:20 2015 UTC,"Part of me wonders why it's important data to know about male vs female answers.   And also, for those who don't fall neatly into those two categories (whether they aren't sure, transgender, express very differently than stereotypical, etc) it can be a very ""I don't care enough to give you data, because you don't care enough to make me feel welcome"" moment.  Male, Female, Other -- is often a good option, which lets people get past that moment of ""this survey needs to know more than I'm sure of"" and get to what the survey actually wants to know."

There's also the awkward silences when you've finished your answer. Generally, I'm awkward on the phone, so having a phone interview only adds to my anxiety.  One good thing about phone interviews is that you can use your notes to help you out. So if you do find yourself getting jumbled up, you can create notes beforehand which you can use to guide you through the interview.  Good luck!"

Even for less than a second feels bad to me - I used to work at a call centre (never do that), and if you even pause for breath clients instantly launch into ""hello? Are you there? Are you there? ARE YOU THERE!?"". I still anticipate that when I'm on the phone years later, and cringing at the slightest pause doesn't exactly help ease the pressure."

My eyes will blankly gaze at the number ringing until it disappears into a missed call. Friends who witness this will ask, ""Do you do that to me when I call?"" And a grin will spread across my face as I tell them, ""No, not at all.""  Later I discover, when I actually have an impulse to clear the texts, that one of my friends got into a car accident, I got accepted into university, I was asked on a date, an admirer professed genuine love for me, and so on. Of course, when I first received the texts, I thought I'd text back at the right time. But an hour became two hours, two hours became three weeks, and four months, and who gives a fuck anymore? After a while, all the unconnected communication just releases into time. People keep on living, some don't. The earth still spins on its axis, Ben Stiller acts in a bad movie, babies are born, some aren't, a trillion tweets are tweeted, a celebrity nude is leaked, North Korea builds a factory line of plastic rockets with miniature rockets inside, another issue is unresolved in the Middle East, and still my messages are not checked, and never will be checked."

Heck, at ten years old I was responding to ""But I told (other person) that you would do this for them"" with ""Then it looks like you have a problem, doesn't it?""

introvert,3cwowj,aaaaaaaaaanditsgone,18,Sat Jul 11 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"If you politely refuse, and keep refusing, what's the worst she could do - and what do you need to do in advance to insulate yourself from that?  I had a family member who was irritating enough that I asked them to stop, then told them to stop, then brought it up at a family meeting, then moved out, then when that didn't work I moved across the country and didn't give them my contact details - and told everyone I did give them to that if they ever let the problem person have them, I would get new details and whoever let the last ones slip would not be getting the new ones. And if no-one told me who had passed them on, no-one would be getting my new ones.  I got eight years hassle-free that way.  I find it helped to reset my own base personal defaults. I reset them to ""I am a person who has free time."" I didn't need to defend it, I didn't need to argue or come up with reasons for it, that was just the way things were, and I would take actions - even actions unexpected by others - to maintain that. Moving across the country might have been considered extreme, but it was polite, legal, and got me my free time back. What they thought of me didn't get to rent space in my head or appear on my radar; they were toxic and so their opinions (and those of anyone who sided with them) became simply empty wind."

Trust me, work alone makes me feel like I'm losing my mind...I can't imagine having kids and a husband on top of it. I feel your pain."
introvert,3cwowj,griss0,11,Sat Jul 11 16:05:08 2015 UTC,"I live close to my parents, about 10 minutes away. My brother lives there as well. I rarely visit them. My parents don't give me any grief since they know how introverted I have been since I was a kid. I have never been one to do things when pushed, and I've never been afraid of arguing with them when I didn't agree with them. I did go to their house every weekend when I was single since I had nothing better to do and they made me food. Whenever my mom wants me to visit and bring my daughter over, she makes food. So she will watch my daughter and give me food to take home.   On the other hand, my husband has a hard time putting up boundaries with his mom. She is an extrovert, goes dancing, goes to parties, get togethers, etc. My husband has always been a people pleaser and has let her dictate his activities so often he would go with her to these events. Ever since we got together he has started to say no to basically all of her invitations, because he realized they were never fun for him and it was mainly to make his mom happy. She has gone off the deep end calling him names, and basically blames it on me that he no longer does these things. He has finally grown a backbone and she can't deal. I have not once told him not to go out with his mom.   I think the difference with us is that I never once tried to hide my lack of wanting to do things with my family, so when I do they are surprised and happy since they just expect me to say no. My husband has always done things to please his mom, so now that he doesn't cave anymore he is suddenly ""not who he used to be""  when in fact that was never him. My husband has cut her out since she is toxic and he gets anxiety and angry any time he talks to her or sees her.   Sorry for my long rant. I'm sure you will do a good job ignoring the guilt trips from your family. They might eventually understand, or they might not."

It's all fine 'til it reaches a head, then she'll go off the deep end, play armchair psychologist and say I have depression, that ""technology has caused this"", or that I just go along with whatever my friends or SO does because ""I do everything to please them"" or something."

Can't buy back time, so if possible make the most out of your own.  They can accept it or not, but ultimately it's yours to do with what you please.

It's not your job to make your family happy. It's not your job to meet their expectations.  You don't owe them  anything.    You are an individual, autonomous human being.  Only you can decide when it's time to connect with family  if that time ever even comes.    So I say, good for you for not caving to that kind of nonsense anymore!    Some people seem to have this idea that ""family"" is this sacred organism that must be catered to at every possible opportunity, or else it will fall apart completely and lose all meaning. Sometimes it's driven by fear (of what, who knows), sometimes because that's how they grew up and they've never stopped to wonder if that's the only way, sometimes I'm sure there are other factors I haven't considered.    But the reality is, everyone's needs are a little different, and family will continue to be family whether you visit them or not.  Send your mom a paper bag she can hyperventilate into every time you don't satisfy her need to control your family contact.  This is  her  issue,  not  yours."

introvert,3cwowj,HouseOfMiro,2,Sat Jul 11 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"You're right.  I cannot say a person is or is not terrible for the choices that are made, but can only express my opinion of the situation.  I personally felt more happiness when my time was my own.  It may not be the case for all, I admit that.  How others perceive my choice to enjoy my time as I see fit is no longer something that concerns me as much as it once did.  Terrible or otherwise, it was my choice and I abide by any consequences that arise as a result.  It wasn't my intent to generalize.   I hope I didn't cause any offence. I was simply trying to be supportive."

introvert,3cwowj,HayleeLOL,4,Sun Jul 12 12:05:47 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to become extremely apathetic towards my family and their insane expectations as of late.  My family really hate the concept of ""alone time"" and whenever they even come upstairs they try to fill the air with small talk, even when I've got my headset on my PC. And yet somehow I'm the ""rude"" one for wanting to hear my game, not the people constantly expecting me to stop whatever I'm doing to engage in yet another conversation about how ""shitty"" our neighbours are.  They also know that me in a morning is a shambling, grumpy ball of ""shut up I need coffee."" So every morning they're awake when I am, it's always constant bombardment of small talk. Yet they get annoyed/upset when I respond with short responses or don't say much.  The thing is, they give me no chance to recharge, which makes me moody, so I end up reacting towards their attempts at conversation negatively (something I admit I probably shouldn't do, but when I can't recharge I can't help it :/) and they react aggressively and guilt-trip.  I think it reached ""apathy point"" when a few weeks ago my mum lectured me about how I ""never speak to them"" and how I ""can never take a joke"" and how I'm the ""disrespectful"" one because ""my room is a mess"" (it is, but it's my space), and then she said ""Oh, I think you definitely have something wrong with you which you're ignoring. I think you're depressed and ignoring it."". A week prior to this, she also told me that I ""used to be sociable"" but then I ""suddenly changed"", and she uses technology as a scapegoat for this.  So eh. I do what I want now. If they want to scapegoat technology, my friends, my SO, ""depression"" (that I don't even have), then frankly, they have no interest in accepting me for what I am."

So far it seems to be working out pretty well for me.   My mom is very conscious of what other people think of her, so it about gives her a conniption fit whenever I do something crazy like march with an anarchist black bloc or bring home a puppy or get a new tattoo or shave my head. Luckily I live in my own home and pay my own bills so she has very little influence over what I do now.

Does your mother have any concept of the sort of angst you're living with though?  It might sound hokey but spending a little time alone and writing her a letter could yield great results.  You could tell her what you're capable of contributing to family time, like one call on the weekend and one family visit every other month.  Because you don't have kids she might just assume that you have loads of free time, putting it into words what you do with your time could help her see how little you have.  You can make some promises to her and to yourself at the same time.  The extra time you save by ceasing catering to their needs could be spent on planning quick meals, visiting a counsellor to talk about your depression, looking for solutions to your work troubles.  These are just examples but the point is that YOU need you more than they need you right now.  Telling her that might get her to back down and take one big daunting responsibility off your plate, freeing you to focus on some of the things you're not too happy about in your own life. <3"

Working so much, I can 100% understand why you wouldn't want to be calling your relatives with whom you probably have very little in common.   My mum is similar. I think she worries because I'm an only child so when she and my dad die, I won't have any family. However, I have some lifelong friends that I consider more like family than my cousins and aunts and uncles who are extremely dramatic, judgmental, emotionally unstable people. Christmas and a few birthdays are plenty enough for me.   Life's too short to deal with people you've got nothing in common with. I do feel kind of bad for never calling my grandma, but she's away with the pixies and refuses to wear a hearing aide so obviously  I am way too socially inept to be dealing with that."

As long as you're not depressed, I'd say you're OK. You'll get back out into the world eventually but people are exhausting to us introverts, and traveling is exhausting to everyone, so take your time!

I met some of my closest friends through a local youth movement, and they are still some of the few friends I have to this day, and keep in touch with."
introvert,3czgok,DaKuY,2,Sun Jul 12 22:45:21 2015 UTC,"First and foremost I have to commend you for #1 noticing that you aren't fitting in well with your current circle of friends and #2 you are acutally looking for new friends instead of just complaining. Great job!   I too was in a similar situation. My friends more frequently went to bars, smokes, and went to more parties. I felt so out of place because I didn't drink and I didn't like to do any of that ""crap"", at all. I'd rather stay home, play video games, read a book, or learn something (self development). I felt like my interests were totally different, but I didn't really know where to find people like me.   I didn't know it at the time but there were two powers in play.    Law of Attraction - Like attracts like and Whatever you focus on you attract.  Quote by Jim Rohan, ""You are the product of the five people you spend the most time.  with.""   I gradually stopped hanging out with my old friends and I focused on self development and just being the best help I can to anyone I met. Online or in person. Since like attracts like I naturally gravitated toward my current group of friends and them toward me.   Now since I'm more intentional about who I hangout with I try to find people that have similar goals, people that are where I want to be in 5 or 10years from now, and add value to them. Whether that be helping them, giving them an interesting article or just hopping on a Skype session and just listening to them.   That being said, here's my recommendation for you. I'm not sure if this will get you the exact group of friends you want, but it will get you going in the right direction.    Before you meet new people you want to make sure you don't wind up in the same group of friends with different names. Clarity is power. Let's clarify a few things:  1.What do you dislike about your current group of friends?    What do you like to do? What really interests you?  What type of people do you want to surround yourself with? What does their chartered look like? What do they do on a Friday night? How do they treat you if you are struggling or need help?  Where do you think these people hangout?    Once you've done that and you're focused on who you want to attract, now all that's left is to find where they hangout and talk to them.   Go to Meetup.com and Facebook and search for groups that interest you.   Just message one person and ask a question. (I know I might be hard, but look at it like this. What's the worst that could happen? They don't respond and you contact someone else. What's the best that could happen? Whatat if this person is just like you? What if they introduce you to someone that you just really enjoy hanging around?)   My recommendation is to:   Send a message to someone that is doing something that interests you in a group that you're interested in. Ask them about the thing that interests you. (""Hi Bob, I saw your post of the XYZ Facebook group and I really agree with what you said. I tried out what you said and I got ABC result! Thanks so much! If you're free, I'd like to talk more about how you came up with that strategy."") Give a genuine complement to one person a day. You'll be surprised how many awesome people you meet. (""Hi. I just wanted to say, I really like your hair/shirt/the way you walk. Where'd you get that shirt? What hair product do you use? Cool, thanks! Have an awesome day!) Walk off with a smile   If this helped you at all or you just found this interesting send me a message. I'd really like to talk and hear your story.   Have an awesome day! :-)"

One of my biggest problems is not knowing what to say at the very beginning, you know that awkward silent after you say ""Hi, I'm [name]. Good to meet you.""  Here's what you can do to start that conversation and keep it going.  For example, let's say you are talking to a friend, a girl, or just a random stranger at an event: ""Hey. What brought you to this event?"". ""Oh really that's interesting, tell me more about that."" OR ""What do you usually do as a hobby or when you get off work?""  Every now and then throw in something about yourself. ""What you said reminded me of a time when...[tell a short story]""  Action Steps:   Come up with 5 questions to ask them. (Here's a couple to start: What brought you to this event? Come up with an ""out"". (For example: It was great chatting with you.

introvert,3cvgv9,RyuuFlame,2,Sat Jul 11 02:50:23 2015 UTC,"My friends are 90% introverted. Stereotypical hobbies aside, the women seem to be much more social and open to friendships compared to the men. Their cliques tend to grow and they meet and become friends with a lot of new people very easily. The biggest difference is how the women would talk for hours on end about anything whereas the men would talk for an hour or two and then go back to their own hobbies in solitude.   I get typed as an introvert thinker, dating an introverted feeler. We joke around that he is much more clingier than me. He is much more affectionate (wanting to do some kind of PDA when we're out) while I'm more shy and reserve about that kind of stuff. Personally, I think he's more of a thinker type with a lot of empathy.   I have another introverted feeling male friend. He has a hard time being in predominantly male cliques. I think it's because of the weird clashing dominant vibes between each person."
introvert,3cvgv9,deletethisafter,2,Sun Jul 12 07:17:33 2015 UTC,"I think being an intp female can be great as long as you recognize your uniqueness and positive traits. I do recall reading once that the ""preferred"" personality for women (however they determined that) is esfj. It's not because it's inherently better, only that society (and America in particular) placed a lot of emphasis on these personality traits in certain social circles and careers. Just keeping picking your friends and deciding what your interests are (maybe salsa is not one of them, hehe) and recognizing how you contribute to the world and how important that is.  Not sure how old you are either, but at 31 I've noticed men who are very attracted to the female and introverted thinking types.

introvert,3cvgv9,EmergingBetter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a very strong introvert and an ISTP female. Until my 20s, I was totally fine with being an introverted thinking female because I pursued a career that is male dominated (being unfeminine actually helped!). It suits my introversion perfectly and being nerdy will give me a well-paying career, so it worked out in that regard. However, I'm totally clueless when it comes to dating.   Most guys tend to go for the feeling and feminine girls and it's hard for me to pretend to be that. To feel more girly, I lost weight and started dressing in more feminine clothing. I think that definitely helped. I'm still a tomboy on the inside, but I got a lot more guys talking to me when I changed the outside. Even with the increased male attention though, the only relationship that worked out longer than a year is my current boyfriend and he is the most caring and feeling person I ever met. I never met a person who is more open about his feelings before. I think he appreciates me for my no-nonsense practical ways of approaching life and loves my sense of adventure. He appreciates the fun I bring into his life and I appreciate his kindness. He made me a lot more aware of my emotions (I do have them, they're just buried deep down!) and more open about sharing them.  So my advice is to date a feeling guy. They're out there I swear. Try online dating because that's a good way to meet fellow introverts. The introverted feeling guys probably have it even tougher on the dating market because their sensitivity is sometimes seen as un-masculine. We're a match made in heaven."

introvert,3cvgv9,AptCasaNova,5,Sat Jul 11 12:11:41 2015 UTC,"I would have to contend that both genders have different downsides when they are INTP. In fact, they are the same downsides with normal dating, but with less socially access-able people.  Both prefer hobbies that, most of the time, won't expose them directly to other people, let alone the opposite gender (less so for females that enjoy male dominated activities (not saying quantity=quality, just easier access)). Males being the primary instigators of an overwhelming majority of all relationships means an Introverted male will rarely be in a spotlight to attract or situation to find, another Introvert.   You might be in a large body of water, but they're in the desert with binoculars, looking to find that one oasis through all the mirages, without being seen by their enemies.  The ""Introverted Thinking Types"" are all off doing something Introverted where you will never interact with them, unless you are also doing the same thing within close proximity, or someone who knows them and/or you and introduces one of you to the other.  As annoying as it is, the world is a social place and we need to make use of those dynamics to find people we're compatible with.  As much as I would love to do things where I never/rarely interact with people, I've taken up hobbies that include people and will rarely ever require me to carry a conversation (pen/paper RPG's, community board game nights, a LARP, [insert group physical activity or goal based task]). Through these people, you network, just like you would trying to find a job, but to find people.

People don't understand that small talk and emotional ramblings are extremely shallow and boring. I also agree that INTP females get the worst of it.  You're not feminine or charming, so they (at best)dismiss you or (more often)criticize you for being ""unlady-like"", or something to that effect. I honestly gave up on irl social life.  Perhaps that is a mistake, but attempting to please people's sense of 'social whatever' takes way too much effort.  Instead, I've connected with people online.  Small skype groups are great for this.  It can be really intimate without the annoyance of social stigmas. I suggest you find a small group of people who have similar interests and make friends that way. I, personally, got involved with an INTP skype group, and we get along famously.

The thing is, my family loves to tell me about how I was always ""so sociable"" as a kid and that I'd ""changed"" as I got older. My mother actually uses ""technology"" as a scapegoat for my introversion.

introvert,3ctqrb,ZeldaMusic113,5,Sun Jul 12 00:17:13 2015 UTC,"Besides being introverted, I am a pretty shy person unless I'm good friends with someone. I don't mind being called shy at all.   A funny story actually related to this happened in my spanish class my junior year of high school. It was the end of the year, and we all sat in a circle with our names on a blank sheet of paper. Your sheet would get passed around and people would write what they remembered most about you (in Spanish obviously). Like I mentioned, I don't act shy at all around my friends, but in this class I didn't really have any friends. Just people I knew from past classes and whatnot. So by the time my sheet came back around to me, almost every single person wrote something along the lines of ""very nice, but quiet and shy"". I thought it was funny. I showed my good friends my sheet after that class at lunch and they all thought it was hilarious. :)"
introvert,3ctqrb,ZuphCud,6,Fri Jul 10 21:54:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind being called shy, but rather take it as a compliment.  If only they'd act accordingly by not demanding my attention all the time, talking to me forever, and asking hundreds of questions."
introvert,3ctqrb,-kodoku-,2,Fri Jul 10 19:50:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really phase me when someone calls me shy. People know I'm shy, so they're less likely to get me to talk more which is what I want. I can see why it would be upsetting though when you're trying hard to get out of your comfort zone and then someone calls you shy.   Try to look at it like this. Shyness is simply a personality trait. It's not something to be ashamed of; it's who you are. The fact that shy people can be silent in social situations should be looked at as a skill. There are plenty of people who feel that they have to talk and they feel uncomfortable with silence."
introvert,3ctqrb,spases,2,Fri Jul 10 21:16:49 2015 UTC,it is fairly annoying. i don't talk much because i like to gauge a person or people out before i settle into my comfort zone and sort of odd mannerisms and quirks. i'm saying i'm kind of weird and i'm not going to be myself in front of strangers for fear of scaring them off or something
introvert,3ctqrb,EmergingBetter,2,Sat Jul 11 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"My advice after experiencing a similar situation in high school (31 now) is try not to sweat the shy label too much. It sounds bad in your head, but you are working and doing so much that you don't sound like the stereotypical shy person who is struggling or can't leave the house. It's perfectly fine and, for some people, even desirable to be a little shy. It's their problem if they want to label you but no need to add your own anxiety on top of it :) accept it as a personality trait and keep doing what you're doing! Breaking boundaries and putting yourself out there regardless. You are fine and acceptable as you are. There are books on shyness you could read as well, but self acceptance is often the best route toward lessening the trait. Beating yourself up or feeling defensive could make it worse, because who you are doesn't need to be shamed or defended.  Sometimes I remind myself, too, that at the opposite end of the spectrum are people who are not shy and don't have a social filter as much. They can be annoying or overbearing or talk about themselves too much. Lots of bad traits on the opposite end too. I've experienced feelings of both and I'd rather be more shy or socially inhibited. As you grow older people respect you more and listen, some types admire what seems like a high degree of self control and conscientiousness, because they are not that way. So the grass is anyways greener I suppose :)"
introvert,3ctqrb,pineprincess,2,Sat Jul 11 20:11:26 2015 UTC,Hate it! It can even feel really condescending sometimes.. and people always make the assumption that I don't like how quiet I am.

introvert,3ctqrb,PluviusReddit,3,Sun Jul 12 19:53:10 2015 UTC,I feel like it's probably not a great thing to be a shy doctor.   My doctor is definitely an introvert.  He's also an excellent doctor.  Most introverts are good listeners and that's half of what general practitioners do.

They do see me as reclusive, though, which doesn't really annoy me (... because it's true...) as long as it doesn't shift their view on my mental capabilities"

I'm fairly confident and self assured though not always of course, and I think it tends to show even though I don't talk much.   Some times people do act like they believe in shy but it may also just be them wishing I was more available/open to socialize."
introvert,3ctqrb,Geminii27,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:04:59 2015 UTC,"I've tried so hard to not be labeled shy   There's the root of the problem. You're letting other people dictate your behavior, and in particular your long-term behavior. A word that takes them half a second to say makes you change your entire life.  Instead, don't spend more than that same half-second responding. ""Ha! You idiot."" with death stare takes about the same time.  As for being a doctor, the medical profession is a great place to be an introvert, particularly if you're going to be a research doctor or specialist.  Interestingly, GPs and those with extensive patient contact are best suited by being able to 'read' a patient and present a compatible persona, particularly with kids. Being extroverted all the time doesn't mesh well. If you're going to present an unchanging personality, it's actually better to be slightly introverted, with a professional demeanor, and with a thin layer of friendliness over the top. People like the friendliness, but they're there for your skillset.  This is not to say that extroversion is useless in medicine. It's particularly helpful in career-building, if that's what you're looking for. As an introvert, you can emulate a lot of it by learning and exercising networking skills, delegation skills, the ability to read people's body language, tone of voice, and expressions, and enough basic psychology that you can smooth over at least the smaller forms of conflict.  It also helps to put in effort to be the ""guy"" everyone knows when they say ""I know a guy"". It does require a bit more interacting with people than otherwise, but the rewards are extensive - the networks you build will result in a large number of professionally connected and well-resourced people feeling they owe you favors because you did them or their friend/family one once."

I feel like I'm always expecting the other person or the group I'm with to start an interesting topic that I could contribute value in. I've always felt that I contribute, rather than initiate.  I think we as introverts, should learn how to initiate topics of interest and emotional arousal, rather than expect someone else to do that."

If he is in any way concerned that you might be uninterested or thinking about leaving, he could be over-doing it in an attempt to hold onto you. If that is the case, reassuring him that your alone/quiet time is NOT indicative of you wanting out might help him relax and give you the space you need. Or, he might just have a greater need for interaction by default.   My Wife has described herself as a hothouse orchid, but describes me as a cactus/succulent. Either plant will wilt and die if you don't care for it, but if you treat either like the other, they still die. Let him know that the succulent you are still NEEDS him, but you have a different set of care instructions than he does. Figure out what his care instructions are, then lay out what yours are, and see if you can negotiate a happy medium."

If I feel I need my alone time and I can't get it at home, I usually go for a drive, take a walk in the forest, go to a swimming pool and keep swimming...usually by the time I come back home he is already engaged in some activity and while he shares everything he has discovered ...I fold clothes ;P  I also have noticed that if I am doing home chores and he just keeps talking, I ask him for help and then, suddenly, he has something really important to do and disappears ;)"

introvert,3cq36b,CeilingWax,54,Sat Jul 11 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"When I was young I used to abhor small talk with people but as I've gotten older I've come to realize that it's essential for building a potential connection with someone; especially between two people who are not quite familiar with each others interests. It lets you find some common topic that can bridge the gaps of age, social standing, or whatever differences.   Before it used to annoy the hell out of me when having to talk about the weather or bitch about office coffee. It felt forced and phony ... but I started thinking of it as talking about phenomena that affects us all and you can share a moment with somebody, no matter how different we are, by sharing these mundane experiences through small talk. And through that process I think that's how you can determine that a person is cool and slowly over time you can progress into cherished deeper talks. It's just a natural progression, I guess. There are friends I've made from the get-go where we can talk deeply about stuff from the beginning and that's been great, but it's been more rare. There are other friends I've made that required small talk in the beginning and then building a friendship and finding common interest our deep talks came naturally afterwards.  I'd recommend Dale Carnegie's How To Win Friends And Influence People ... it's been very important in helping me empathize and connect with other people."
introvert,3cq36b,fishpuddle,13,Thu Jul 9 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. I used to hate small talk when I was younger, but realized that there are levels of familiarity we have with certain people. You just don't talk about deeper subjects unless you and the other person are on a deeper level of familiarity. Just think of the people that come up to you and immediately assume you're of a political affiliation and talk about how much they hate or love Obama. It just gets awkward and makes you want to retreat into yourself more. Think of small talk as level 1. Most people you interact with are level 1. The better the friend, the higher the level."

We have been together seven years now and it works out very well!  I honestly cannot remember how it worked at first, I do think that deeply understanding each other comes with time. He is very easygoing and does not mind that I need a lot of alone time, even when I get irritable and cranky from not being alone enough, he doesn't take it personally. I was worried about moving in together, but it has been two years and he goes out with friends while I stay home and binge watch Netflix, read, cook, or do whatever I want so we make it work. He is not the type to make tons of plans, so when we go out we come up with something together, like going out to dinner and not spending all day out which I find draining.  My parents, on the other hand, are a little different. My dad is an extrovert, my mom is an introvert. My dad often wants to spend time with my mom, which there is of course nothing wrong with, but when she needs alone time he sometimes has a hard time understanding why. They have been together almost thirty years though, so the relationship does work. I think it helps that he works daily, and she is at home so she does get plenty of alone time.

Quite frankly we've barely exchanged words, but from what we've talked she seems to have had a rough past. Once she told me about being ""broken beyond repair"" I tried to cheer her up. She asked if I was secretly an ""old dude inspirational speaker"". I simply told her (or rather hinted at) some of my previous experiences. When she returned I expressed my intrigue towards her attitude. She told me that I shouldn't attempt to ""fix her"", and warned me about her not being very open. What impacted me the most was this: ""You seem like an inspirational speaker who needs a inspirational speech."" She completely defined me with that sentence. I feel like I should try and help her out. However she's an introvert, and I'm sort of in doubt on how to proceed. I've offered help to a lot of people, but I don't know how to approach this.   Is not related to this:   I already knew she was an introvert as it was in the description, but I told her to not worry.   and I (and I imagine most people on this sub) would be more than happy to explain why that is if needed.  Now, that being said I'm only going to respond to the portion that's actually introversion specific.  Introverts tend to respond less well to external stimuli in the form of trying to force them to open up.  Your better bet is to provide an environment in which she is able to do so comfortably."

Earbuds help, but 80% of people ignore them and just gesture in my face that they want my attention. If there's a loud conversation happening, I will mention that should there be a delay in my work.  If all fails, I just leave for 5 mins and come back. The bathroom is a fine refuge and I use it often."

introvert,3ckwq3,dawnofthemichael,8,Thu Jul 9 12:40:16 2015 UTC,"I work in legal/accounting so my job search usually starts with a recruiter.  He connects me to law firms who are looking for accounting people and if the fit is right, they hire me.  I'm 33 and have been working in accounting for law firms for the last 9 years so its different for people starting out.  I don't know how old you are or what type of work you are looking into but interviewing well is important.  It is also easier than it seems.  I hate talking to people, especially small talk and that kind of thing but to interview well you just need to be honest about what you know and what you don't know and have a positive attitude.  You'd be surprised how many crazy people HR has to sift through so making it clear that you are friendly and not crazy goes further than you may think."

introvert,3ckwq3,black-raven-1307,2,Thu Jul 9 04:56:50 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow accountant. I just started working as a vanilla  accountant for a bankruptcy administration company and I'm just wondering what type of accounting work is done at law firms. Is it vanilla (corporate) accounting or is there more to it? ie: when I was a hedge fund accountant, I had to understand securities that were being traded.  ps: master of puppys is my favourite album."
introvert,3ckwq3,aceshighsays,2,Wed Jul 8 23:59:14 2015 UTC,Hey buddy.   I would say there is much less to it than corporate accounting. My brother works for a university so as you can imagine their accounting and reporting needs are huge. Most small to mid size law firms can be run by a team of 2-4 people.   It's definitely niche.  I don't do anything very advance. Mostly processing of billing and payables.  I have many years of trouble shooting the accounting system and am the most knowledgeable person in the firm in that regard so I would say that is what makes me most valuable.   Law firms seem to pay more than other industries.  I make 61k annually. That is near the top end for my position. I would need to work out in West Los Angeles to get more money and that would only be like maybe 5-6k more a year. I'm planning to finish my bachelor's this year and then try to land a billing manager position.    And that's probably the biggest strength and draw back. I don't feel my skill set is valuable outside of the legal field. But if I play my cards right I could eventually land a low stress job making somewhere in the low to mid 90k.
introvert,3ckwq3,masterofpuppys,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:47:12 2015 UTC,"How do you define corporate accounting? In financial services, corporate accounting is defined as regular accounting ie a/r, a/p.  You don't even have your BS and yet you're making 61k? How many years have you been an accountant? Billing as in a/r or a/p? What type of low stress jobs are there that pay mid $90k?"
introvert,3ckwq3,aceshighsays,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:04:19 2015 UTC,"Corporate accounting I would define as working within a framework built around GAAP.  Advance reporting maybe?  I've been in law firms for so long but from what my brother tells me it seems much more complicated compared to what I've seen in law firms.   61k is in the higher end for my position.  I don't think for what I do I'd get paid that much outside of a law firm.   I mainly do billing as in process fees and expenses we incurred for the period. Generate prebills.  Work with the various attorneys editing and finally generating invoices.   I don't do AR regularly but I know how. It's not a regular duty but u cover for the bookkeeper when she's out.   And our expenses. I pay monthly bills like telephone, subscriptions, credit cards anything that comes through. Code them. Enter and cut checks.   I see my job as mainly clerical but I could be wrong. Of course in an interview in would focus on my general knowledge of law firms day to day functions.   I've been working in law firms for 9 years. I hope to get into a big enough firm where I can establish best practices and oversea a small team. Get out of all the day to day to focus on procedure optimization.  And redditing of course :D"

introvert,3ckwq3,masterofpuppys,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:49:01 2015 UTC,I recently started working as a vanilla accountant for a bankruptcy administration company. It was the only part time job I was able to find. My knowledge and experience lies in hedge fund accounting.
introvert,3ckwq3,aceshighsays,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:52:12 2015 UTC,How do you like it?  What was hedge fund accounting like?
introvert,3ckwq3,masterofpuppys,2,Thu Jul 9 04:06:43 2015 UTC,"I loved fund accounting, but fund accounting part-time roles don't exist. Actually, it's very difficult to find part-time accounting roles in general. I looked for 4 months and I only found 1 role, that I ended up getting.   The thing is, is that I don't really like (vanilla) accounting. It's not challenging and I don't learn anything of value (ie use the knowledge to my own advantage)... it's too basic for me. For me, what makes accounting interesting is dealing with securities (domestic/offshore and alternative investments). The hedge funds that I worked at traded everything from fund of funds to more exotic stuff like commodities, futures, FX, swaps, repos. I had to have an excellent understanding of how those securities traded, I needed to spot errors, book general journal entries, know how cash flow was going to be affected, know how to report them for tax purposes, calculate and send the PNL/ROR and send investors their statements. Compare that to doing a/p, a/r, payroll... it's a humdrum. It's a different animal.  By no means am I criticizing you or those who enjoy vanilla accounting. It's just not my cup of tea."

Working nights now, and don't have to deal with as many people. So its a good fit so far."

But, to complete my radio/tv/film degree I had to get and complete an internship.   It was interesting, my professor said not to call and bug people, but just to email and go through other proper channels. That got me nowhere. So, I just started cold calling and leaving very polite messages with people, asking about their internship program. A week later I was an intern for the #1 station in town.  I learned all sorts of stuff about the news. A year later they called me in to temp in place of an ill video editor. I did that for nine months.  When that ended, the news operations manager actually found me a new job at a rival TV station. I actually just completed my third day on the job today. I'm basically a studio cameraman now. It's not an amazing job, but it's fine for now. Better than unemployment.  btw, a lot of the guys that work there never went to college. I bet almost anyone could have applied.  Oh, I also got a job at Domino's, by applying, and then stopping by, and politely inquiring about it fairly regularly. I ended up working there for three years."

The current job market sucks, regardless of experience seems like. Sure, there's a stigma attached to temping, but if you land in a large company / corporate, it can open doors.   Anyway, once I was there, I kept a low profile and aimed to outperform my peers. This included dressing professionally (business casual) and staying out of office drama. I got noticed this way and eventually made it full time with the company, then switched into employee support (from customer support).   Finally, once I was in front of management, so to speak, a manager hooked me up with my current boss - different company / line of work - and I started contracting with him. Now, I'm full time salary.   Tl;dr Start with a staffing agency / get your foot in the door with a large company. Have a complete professional image.

Then to night stock at a grocery store (this is the one I didn't have connections to, did this during college, where I lived with a family, but not my family. This is important later). Then back to the Y, then I was the in-house IT guy for a non-profit whose executive director was the guy I lived with in college.

introvert,3ckwq3,archertom89,2,Thu Jul 9 01:00:11 2015 UTC,"I joined the US Air Force after 2 years of college.  I got tired of college and wanted a job. So all I had to do was walk into a recruiters office, fill out some paperwork and 8 months later I was started basic training.  This process appealed to me because of my really awkward/shy personality and shitty social skills would make it hard to network during and after college to get a decent job.  My goal was to get a job in the air force that would  transfer well into the civilian world. So I got air traffic control. Maybe not the best job for an introvert as you work closely with other people . I struggled a lot in training, but I managed and now I'm fully certified and love the job. Once i'm done with the air force I can hopefully get an ATC job with the FAA that could pay anywhere from 60k-100k a year (depending on location).  And from my understanding there is really no big interview process with them, I just need to fill out an application and hopefully get picked up. So my shitty networking and social skills should not be a hindrance to getting hired by the FAA after my time in the air force comes to an end."

Honestly, it's retail, so you know what your getting going in- bitchy customers who get their way, and demanding managers with endless amounts of notes and tasks. But contrary to popular belief, it's not a bad place to work, and in my 8 years of being with the company, I've been treated with lots of respect (despite being younger than most of my co-workers and management) and given many opportunities to move up with the company. The training isn't always the best, but as of recent it's seemed to become more of a importance, so that there is less turnover and more associates willing to move up and get promoted withing the company. Also, the benefits, insurance, discounts, bonuses, and paid vacation aren't too bad either.  I know everyone's Wal-Mart experience isn't like this, but I have no problem and will proudly recommend the job to anyone who is interested.  And no, I don't work for Wal-Mart Corporate. Ha."

I had several interviewers that insisted that I name them  a situation in which I would get angry but I simply explain that I'm not someone who gets angry because I'm trying to think rational and base my actions on what benefits me long term the most.   I also tell them that in everyday life I don't often reflect my emotion to the outside and I'm sometimes rather silent, shy, introverted even if I don't come off as if I would be like that in the interview. They usually give me a sceptical comment because I'm all smiley and open in the interview and mimic the behaviour of an extrovert.

introvert,3clief,sinwarrior,3,Mon Jul 13 12:49:56 2015 UTC,"I think i am seeing myself here. Everyone has a different definition of friends, for some the coworkers you described would be friends, for some they would be just coworkers. Depending on that you might get a few different answers. I dont have any friends either and i am happy about it, but think it is important to keep yourself busy and to keep some acquaintances, as long as it doesn't get to close. If you feel like you don't want to get to intimate with someone (wich is perfectly fine in my opinion) then why force something that you don't enjoy. My point is, do what makes you happy and stop comparing yourself to others."

introvert,3clief,Trower12,3,Thu Jul 16 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"My attitude has been that I will allow friendships or relationships to be a part of my life if they naturally emerge and it ""feels right."" I'm not seeking them out or running away from them, I'm just allowing life to happen however it happens.   For many years I was in a relationship and it was great and I enjoyed it. But we broke up and I've spent the last year of my life without anyone I could really call a good friend. This year of relative solitude was great too, but now I feel like making an effort to connect more with people again.   Don't doubt your own intuition, as long as you feel content with yourself it doesn't matter if you act ""normal"" or not.  Keep your doors open, be flexible to the idea you may change in the future, who knows?"

I had many hobbies and like you, the hobbies meant a lot to me and I wanted to focus on them. Now that I'm older, I make more money and would like to travel and explore with someone but am missing out on that opportunity because I moved and avoided making new friends cause of my priorities."
introvert,3clief,black-raven-1307,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:32:05 2015 UTC,"Are you happy?   Despite all the bullshit that gets bandied about how life is 'supposed to be'... at the very crux of your being are you content with life?   If so, why does anything else matter? Don't feel bad for being you... you are awesome as you are, because there's nothing fake about you. You just do you, and that is amazing.   If you feel like you would like to open up then my recommendations are that you find a group at university, or online, and you take small steps of starting to interact. Initially, you might only turn up or read conversations. There's nothing wrong with that. You made an effort and you congratulate yourself for doing so. There is no such thing as too small a step. x"
introvert,3clief,sum1rand0m,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha I was about to post something similar a few days ago. I also don't have friends but not because people don't like me. I just really don't see a use to having friends at the moment with my busy life (26M). I understand the importance of socializing but I don't feel like pretending I actually want to have a friendly relationship and hang out with someone when I just want to do my own thing alone. Sure I guess people can call me a loner or a hermit, but at least I am not dependent on other people to have fun. I have had friends in the past, but very few have become ""good friends"" and there is no one I really consider my ""best friend"".   To answer your question i'd say don't bother with friends unless they are someone you would leave the house to actually hang out with. Otherwise I find it is a waste of time and energy pretending you like hanging out with them just to have a friend.   But on the flip side, i'd consider hanging out with the girl, even if she is already dating someone. Just so you can practice talking and hanging out with the opposite sex. It would be a good way to practice dating."
introvert,3clief,nitowl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:05:33 2015 UTC,"I had a decent amount of friends in high school, but after graduation, I've stopped contacting them. I kinda feel bad about it, but they seem to not have a goal like I do (go to college, education, etc.) so I figured I would just do my own thing for a while... not to mention that they're friends with my longterm ex-girlfriend, so I also didn't want my friends to tell her how I was doing, or me finding out that they're fucking her. Anyways, I've enjoyed being alone and started to really understand myself. I currently live in the woods/mountain so I would go road biking and explore by myself, which really helped me understand who I am.  Now, I'm moving to a big city for college in 8 days (have been attending online) to start a new chapter. I don't know anyone there, so making new friends and the thought of leaving my past behind is exciting.   You seem to not have much time. And that's not a bad thing. But it's important to find the right balance. If what you're doing is what is important and love to do, keep pursuing that. If not, why not take a break and start a new hobby? You can just start by yourself like I did. And you mentioned that you can't drive, so getting a $300-500 road bike might work out for you.  Don't force yourself to make friends now if you can't maintain the connection. Wait until you're comfortable with yourself and friends will come to you. Good luck, man."

introvert,3chmsf,TheWhiteNoise1,5,Wed Jul 8 09:04:10 2015 UTC,"Same here. I've always been interested in science and math, but engineering was too much, too long, and too expensive. I was 30 when I decided to go to school - living on my own, single, zero savings. I didn't have a lot of time or money, and I needed a career. Stat.  Decided to try engineering technology. Available at community college, affordable, a 3 year program that you could cut out after 2 years (2 yrs gives you a technician diploma, 3 yrs gives you a technologist diploma...and truth be told I haven't seen much difference between the two as far as advancement/ceiling goes). Sold.  The school I went to was known to be recruited by the municipal government. For 3 years I studied from Sept until May and worked for the City during the summer. With some loans and maxed lines of credit, I made just enough to scrape by. Times were lean. I relied heavily on a classmate (I was seeing) to invite me to eat dinner at her rich parents' house. On my own I ate lots of rice & beans. Cereal with tap water. I even clipped multiple ""free popcorn"" coupons from the newspaper, went to the movie theatre, got the free popcorn, ate it in the lobby, got a refill and took it home for later. I was a freeloading scavenger surviving in a post-apocalyptic videogame, but I never lifted my gaze from the prize.  I was lucky enough to be hired by the City upon graduation. There was a ton of luck there with the timing, no question, but also a lot of dedication and hard work put in. As a 30+ year old I was way more serious than my early 20-something classmates. I also had a decade of life experience on them. When it came time to be interviewed, I think I stood out.  tl;dr: Engineering Technology. 3 years of college. Current salary is $63k (junior level). The actual work I do is a combination of Tetris and Sim City. And yes...headphones all glorious day long.  edit: apologies for going off tangent there with my own personal stuff."

introvert,3chmsf,Geminii27,13,Wed Jul 8 10:45:31 2015 UTC,"I work for a large (Fortune 50) company with a strong commitment to Work-at-Home. I started out in a role for which I was spectacularly unsuited, basically a ""Face-of-the-company"" liaison role that involved 100% face-time with external customers. It was horrible. I didn't understand much about introversion at the time so in true ISTJ fashion I read books like ""How to Deal with Difficult People"" in an attempt to learn my way out of the misery.  One thing I did like about that position was bringing back my customers problems to the office and trying to figure out what went wrong. I became so good at that that I eventually became the ""What the heck happened here"" point person for our department, then other departments, then the entire office, until it became my job to figure out What-the-heck-happened-here.   In order to figure out what the heck happened I wound up having to teach myself a lot about our internal systems, plus Microsoft Access, Excel, and eventually SQL.   I've been doing What-the-Heck-Happened-Here ad hoc analysis for the last 15 years, working from home full-time for the last 10. I haven't met my last two managers face-to-face, have never met most of my coworkers. All my customers are internal to the company and I haven't met most of them either. The work is very hands-off from a management perspective, so you need to be self-directed.  I make about $90 - $100k / year depending on bonus. I live alone in a house on an acre with 4 dogs and 4 cats and no other dependents.  My degrees are in Anthropology so I have no qualifications for this really, it evolved mainly due to the horrible job I originally had and figuring out what I really good at.

About the ""self taught"", since I was a kid, I had a computer and used to play with codes and stuff.

There are plenty of people with social anxiety who have a desire to talk to others, but socializing causes them anxiety. There are also plenty of introverts who don't have social anxiety, who are shut-ins and have no desire for social interaction.  Personally, I dislike social interaction and being around people. I feel calm and I don't experience anxiety when I'm around others, but being around people for even a few minutes drains me of all my energy to the point where I feel numb.

What I was getting at is that based on the post content, many users here believe that introvert = afraid of social interaction, makes hiding from the world okay. That's simply untrue and paints a very dark picture of introversion, and is quite honestly incorrect.  My main personal issue with this is that I feel many of the active subscribers are inappropriately self diagnosing themselves (and therefore causing the lurkers to mis-diagnose themselves too) as introverted and using it as an excuse to ignore actual problems.   The logic I see goes as follows: If introversion is a personality type then that's okay. That's just who I am! Social anxiety on the other hand is a clinical issue which means there's something wrong with me."

introvert,3cg9hc,roadwarder,2,Tue Jul 7 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"I can't give any articles or super solid advice beyond my own experience. Even at that I can't fully relate to him in many ways. I sang in choir all through high school and ended up in my school's top choir my sophomore year, which was a really small group all things considered, and we had to travel frequently and sing at big festivals and collaborate with other groups and go under the direction of other directors and perform for people we had no connection to whatsoever. And I'll tell you, performing is stressful, exhausting, and a little scary no mater how many times you do it. Especially for introverted folks who don't even necessarily like putting themselves in front of others.  What I often ended up doing was spending as much time as possible before shows in solitude to get myself pre-charged. I always ate dinner on my own, took my time getting dressed and ready at home, listened to really calm (or no) music in the car. Then when I got to whatever our venue was (usually our school) I would keep to smaller groups of closer friends and find quieter areas with fewer people before performing. I was never really one to talk during downtime before going on stage either, just to keep myself a little more intact. Then on stage my strategy was always just to focus on the music. I totally tuned out the applause at most concerts and totally ignored the audience, if I wasn't fixated on our conductor I'd usually just focus on a corner, light fixture, smoke detector, door, something completely different from the audience. Even during applause I just tuned it out and thought about our next set, never the audience and who might be out there (and I've had to sing in front of some really big crowds in pretty scary venues too). We would do a three or four concert run around the holidays avery year and that was absolutely exhausting, no doubt about that, but by the end I was just focused on the music and totally ignored the audience, I din't think about what they were feeling or thinking, just what the music was doing around me.   I know a lot of this probably falls apart in a smaller band with a more intimate venue, but maybe what I can say can help just a little. There's nothing wrong with being exhausted after a performance though, it's a draining experience.  If he has to talk between songs or sets to get some information across or hold the audience's attention while somebody tunes or changes an instrument or something, maybe he could hand the mic off to somebody else to do the talking and take a second to recharge, get some water, and get his attention off the audience, after all, he's the lead singer, not necessarily the PR rep. I guess if any advice I have seems like it could hold, it's just to totally ignore the audience, forget that they are even there, don't pay any mind during applause and just focus on the music you're making. I hope at least some of this can help. Sorry I don't have a nice article or something you could send his way though."

introvert,3cg9hc,Crash927,2,Tue Jul 7 20:38:36 2015 UTC,"Not much advice really. I work with a lot of performers as I work in tech theatre. Some performers spend a lot of time in the dressing room on there own just chilling out. Others are pretty talkative and loud. I'd say he should try and find a place where he can just chill out and do his own thing before and after the show. Go for a coffee or a walk after sound check, just for gods sake be back in time for show call!  If he's going to be around the rest of the band hours before the show and for a few hours after it's going to have an effect on him, no matter if they're good friends.  If this band goes on tour he'll have an even worse time by the sounds of things."

Oh how many times I've yelled at him 'Jesus fucking Christ go do your fucking job and let me do mine in peace!' And on the coffee breaks my co workes are always nagging me to come to the break room and chit chat. An acquaintance/friend has the nasty habit of dropping by my place unannounced way too often and it drives me fucking nuts.  I've envied the extroverts over the years though.

One extremely extroverted coworker liked(likes?) me. She has a boyfriend so nothing happened, but it easily could have (it's ok, the chemistry faded).  What did I do to attract her? Nothing, I was just being me. I showed my ability to think deeply, my ability to notice small details. I listened to her. I was always calm (she noticed this and said that I almost never get angry). I just flirted with her with my body language. Smiles, prolonged eye contact, later ""accidental"" touches etc. She liked it that I helped her many times. She openly said a couple of times that I am smart, so that helped.   Basically you have to find the right person that fits your personality. Because lets face it, if the girl is quiet and you are quiet too, you will have a difficult time getting anywhere with her. Show you qualities and let them come to you. Find someone who is curious, she will find you mysterious and will want to dig deeply to find out who you are."

For a few of them, I needed to explain introversion to them, but they've come to an understanding that my introversion is not a personal thing, I just need time to recharge my batteries.   My extraverted friends have helped me tremendously in coming out of my shell.   That said, I absolutely cannot stand extraverts who try to FORCE me out of me shell, or who treat me in a condescending manner due to my quietness. There are many people who have it in their heads that my being quiet means that there's nothing going on in my head, which is not true whatsoever, and they typically come to realize this when we discuss matters that I care about."

introvert,3ca3gy,Jesusourus_Rex,2,Thu Jul 9 16:41:52 2015 UTC,"I've had classes like that, and they suck. When teachers push every single person to participate, a lot of people end up re-phrasing whatever the person before them said, just to get their ""participation score"" for the day out of the way. This happens even more when they start putting people on the spot and calling on them to state their opinion/idea right then and there. It is a waste of time making everyone listen to people repeating things just because they were forced to talk when they didn't really have something to say. Then again it is also frustrating when you know you should participate, but the teacher allows the same people to dominate the conversation all the time.  It sucks when your grade is so dependent on how much you talk in class. I would have a much easier time coming up with something to say if we got a writing prompt first, or if we were discussing an assignment so I had time to think about things beforehand. My brain just doesn't cooperate with class discussions and I don't learn anything from them."
introvert,3ca3gy,resting-orgasm-face,2,Thu Jul 9 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, yes.  I used to have a teacher EXACTLY like that. And when they egged everyone else on to try and get me to talk, I couldn't even hear it! She literally tried to fail me for being deaf.. As if being relatively quiet in the company of others wasn't something they already looked down on.  I'm either really blunt and say every thought that pops into my head (I occasionally talk to myself and I guess that freaks some people out) or I'm withdrawn and mute.   But I agree with what /u/TornCondom said.. There are a few who look out for you and go out of their way to be nice to you. I like those people quite a bit."
introvert,3ca3gy,faloofay,4,Thu Jul 9 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"You can't simply complain about these people -- put yourself in their shoes and think about how they see you. Figure out what bugs them to see how you can change yourself in small ways that might benefit others in the long run. I think a big part of the problem is the implication that they are in the wrong, and that you are in the right. It's always a two-way street, I would be surprised if you were as innocent as you described. Part of the learning process is learning in groups, learning how to function with others cooperatively. As well as speaking in front of class and showing engaged interest. How will the teacher know you're actually learning if you don't show it in class? Tests can only show how well a student studies, not how well they operate with their classmates.  Don't blame extroverts for their outward qualities unless they are asshats on the regular.-- That shit is un-excusable.  If you gave extroverts a chance and explored beyond your personal comfort zone you might discover that these different beasts have hearts and are willing to understand who you are as a person. But you also have to be interested in them as well. Couples in long, lasting relationships contrast each other's qualities in ways that are mutually beneficial. Friendships are exactly the same -- Your best friends will often be completely different people than you. And that's okay! You just have to give them the chance to let them show you who they are.   Optimism, basically."
introvert,3ca3gy,Ooobles,0,Mon Jul 6 15:25:54 2015 UTC,"Lol. Your entire post is telling me to conform to their culture and to do my best to fit in with them, because I should go the whole mile to appease them rather than coming to a bridge point and syncing in harmony. I'll be damned before I ever change myself to better benefit someone else. I'm happy the way I am, but I'm not happy that the world thinks otherwise and persistently tries to change me.   No one here is ""right"" or ""wrong""; I'm a firm believer of what would be called moral nihilism that right or wrong do not exist. However I do feel mistreated and misunderstood, and regardless of what moral category you lump this in the feeling itself has an entire definition on its own.   Their qualities are not what I hold contempt towards them for. It's the way me and other introverts are treated. They could have behavior patterns like sloths and I'd still feel the same way. Your suggestion is only promoting conformity and further propping my point that in order to be at peace I must conform to their culture. Down the road I doubt that's going to happen and spoiler: it won't and never will happen"
introvert,3ca3gy,Ooobles,3,Mon Jul 6 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"Well from the way you worded your post, it's clear that this is a problem you face, but don't want to do anything about. You said it yourself, you think you are right. You think the world needs to change for you because you're living the way you want to, but these people aren't fitting into your world. The very same reason that you aren't fitting into their worlds either. Alright, here we go.   I'll be damned before I ever change myself to better benefit someone else.    This ain't good, dude. The source of all your problems is right there in that sentence. You won't let anyone change your mind, but if you step back and put yourself into the shoes of those around you, you will see the world a whole lot differently than you do now.  I would consider myself a moderately strong introverted person, and I've never been treated like you say (>other introverts are treated) . I've never been treated the way you describe because at a certain point, I realized that in order to function in society I was going to have to conform ever so slightly into society one way or another.   If your views are so firm, and so unchangable, what was the point of the post? You can't generalize all extroverts like that, they're not all the same, just like all introverts are not all the same. The moral nihilism paradox is another ballpark of problems entirely.  Your statements are really extreme. Lots of nevers, and always-es. If you're looking for extroverts to change, but you yourself are unwilling to, isn't that just a wee bit ironic?   I know that it will never change no matter where I go  Down the road I doubt that's going to happen and spoiler: it won't and never will happen  I'll be damned before I ever change myself to better benefit someone else.   Also, it isn't ""All extroverts"" fault that introverts have some sort of societal stigma. Have you ever considered that it's your fault that introverts have the stigma that they do? Don't throw them all into one group as if all extroverts behave the same ways.    it's extrovert's fault   However, I loathe them for the way they treat introverts.    Your views are super selfish;   I'm happy the way I am, but I'm not happy that the world thinks otherwise and persistently tries to change me.   It's okay to want to try to be happy, and it's totally okay to do your thing. But if you're consistently getting signals from your teachers and classmates that they're not happy with what you're doing, that means it's time to change something. Not double down.  /u/OhMrBigshot's comment was on point. And all of it flew right over your head with your reply --   I think you took introversion a bit too far, my friend. It's a nice thing to be if you like it, but I don't think you need to look down on people who aren't like you. I try to learn to get along with everyone.   What's so wrong about just giving others what they want? What's your beef with making others happy at the cost of personal comfort?"
introvert,3ca3gy,Ooobles,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"I really hate acting like everyone else. And while on the subject of non-conformity, I find it problematic to act like the crowd just to fit in. This world has an array of personalities, so why strive to behave like the majority?. Instead of trying to act like one archetype, people should strive to interact peacefully with a flurry of them. This is what I want the most, not for the world to bend at my will.  That's where you're wrong. As I said above, I find it pointless to conform to fit their desires when my own are not being met. Regardless of how much of a farce I put up I know deep down that it's all a facade and a sham, which will cause me more anguish on the inside. And about the mistreatment, I spoke from personal experience (obviously). From stories from my parents to observations of my classmates, the blatant mistreatment is there. Clearly some won't have it, but that doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist for others.   I said this explicitly in another post, but I'll say it again: I don't hate all extroverts. In fact, their temperament is not what I hate about them. It's the mistreatment and misunderstanding I receive from them that I loathe. I know (very few) extroverts that aren't bad, such as my sister for example. But clearly when I say ""all extroverts"" or anything of the sort I'm saying it from a general standpoint to avoid listing every extrovert I've encountered that fits the script.   I know who I am and who I want to be. That being said, just because someone doesn't like it - whether that be a teacher or whoemver else - and tries to change me doesn't mean there's something wrong with me. There is no one on this earth that knows me better than I do myself, so I know what I want to change about myself, not my fucking teacher.   And to end my post, I will reiterate what I said earlier: why change myself to better benefit others, when I won't be getting the good end of the stick? If there was something in it for me, then sure I'd consider changing. But I'm going to lose myself in the process, which is the biggest consequence of them all.   No matter how much of a front I put up, it won't be genuine; I can go to parties and shit, but I won't like it. I can talk up a storm, but I'll be annoyed deep down. I can be a boisterous, back-slapping bastard to everyone I meet, but I know that's not how I'd act normally. But I should do it anyway for the sake of conformity, eh? Or an even better reason, because my teachers recommended I do so"
introvert,3ca3gy,OhMrBigshot,-1,Mon Jul 6 19:11:28 2015 UTC,"This is the last time I'm going to respond to your comments, there's plenty for you to work with.   I find it problematic to act like the crowd just to fit in.   You're not ""acting like the crowd"". You're changing yourself so that other people aren't bothered by your very presence. Which honestly is probably the case, all things considered.   Regardless of how much of a farce I put up I know deep down that it's all a facade and a sham, which will cause me more anguish on the inside.   Have you ever heard the phrase, ""fake it till you make it""? It's essentially saying that if you fake doing something for the sake of your own betterment, even though you know you're faking it, at some point you're going to forget that you're faking it and realize that you're actually enjoying yourself, and having fun.   And about the mistreatment, I spoke from personal experience (obviously).    The way you phrased it in your response, you were speaking on your behalf as well as the behalf of all introverts. Whether or not you meant to, that's the way you wrote it.   I said this explicitly in another post, but I'll say it again: I don't hate all extroverts.   Same as above, albeit just consider re-application of the second sentence.   doesn't mean there's something wrong with me.   There does mean something is wrong if those around you are having trouble just being around you. Teachers and friends don't hate being around you for being introverted. They don't like being around you because you lack empathy and sympathy.   here is no one on this earth that knows me better than I do myself, so I know what I want to change about myself, not my fucking teacher.   Your teacher studied for years to become the person she is. Don't take her wisdom, or the opinion of your friends for granted.    when I won't be getting the good end of the stick?    BECAUSE LIFE ISN'T ALL ABOUT BETTERING YOURSELF.  You'll figure it out when you grow up, but until now, please heed this advice. The effect you have on others is worth more than anything you will ever do to benefit yourself.    And to end my post, I will reiterate what I said earlier: why change myself to better benefit others, when I won't be getting the good end of the stick? If there was something in it for me, then sure I'd consider changing. But I'm going to lose myself in the process, which is the biggest consequence of them all.   This is the pure root of all of your problems, and it's wayy too hard for me to answer all of your possible questions but for god's sake you need to listen to this.

introvert,3ca3gy,OhMrBigshot,3,Mon Jul 6 20:51:48 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if you're going to respond to this or not; I'll make a post anyway.   I'm not downvoting you.  I don't agree with you for the most part, but you do bring up a refresher point that in order to interact with people there needs to be some bridge met. However, unlike what you keep saying, it's not my fault that there's no bridging point. I can accuse Side A of not meeting me, Side B. And vice versa for Side A. It's a back-and-forth argument that's pointless. Fact is, no one's meeting at that bridge. But I digress, I'm not some circus clown that's going to hypnotize the other side to come meet me. If they have no desire to do so on their own interest and will, then I don't really either. I don't expect them to come to me, but there's a mutual interest required on both parties to be met in order for the two parties to come at that bridge. It's not solely mine, like you keep implying. Re-reading your posts, I'm not sure how you think this is good advice at all.    As I said from the beginning, you keep telling me to change myself for others' benefit, not myself.   What's so wrong about just giving others what they want? What's your beef with making others happy at the cost of personal comfort?   Why the fuck am I going to make other people happy before myself? I like pleasing people, but I'm not a tool.    This is the pure root of all of your problems, and it's wayy too hard for me to answer all of your possible questions but for god's sake you need to listen to this. Your beliefs are toxic to those around you, and your relationships will not get any better until you change the attitude you have towards bettering others.   My beliefs are toxic? Look at the advice you're giving me. You've pushed aside my feelings of the matter and implied that the needs of others are what matter most (proof: see the first quote).  Maybe you'll see where you've gone wrong with this advice, because it really is fucking awful. I would never suggest that someone give up their identity to please others. No one understands you better than you, so it's best to take the utmost care of yourself first. Maybe being a tool and conforming to others for their pleasure is how you've gotten through your life, but that's not how I'm going to get through mine."

I guess you can say that I ""look down"" on them because I do hold a great deal of scorn towards them, but I think it's within reason."
introvert,3ca3gy,bluezebra59,3,Mon Jul 6 17:20:08 2015 UTC,"There are a few things I'd like to address looking at your comments in this post.  People change and grow up over time. If you're unwilling to change to better yourself, and change other things for you to fit well with others socially, you're going to have a very miserable and bitter life, because it will be monotonic, slow, and agonizing. People around you will change but you will stay the same. I however, don't believe that will happen. I think most of what you're saying in this post is the introverted version of being a teenager - a little bit of an emo phase. I've been there too, it sucks, but you grow out of it. If I had one tip from myself to past me, I'd say take things easy, live life to have fun, take anything negative people say with a grain of salt, and work on improving yourself.  Second, the whole condescension thing isn't going to end well for you if you keep it up. Let me quote you:   However I do feel mistreated and misunderstood   Emo 101.   I should go the whole mile to appease them rather than coming to a bridge point and syncing in harmony.   I think you're looking at this wrong. No one should go the mile. Both ends should go and meet halfway. But you're not willing to take your step. Would you be surprised no one goes their step towards you?   I'll be damned before I ever change myself to better benefit someone else   There's a difference between forcing yourself into being something you're not, and admitting that people are complex beings that can be both shy and outgoing, dreamers and doers, introverts and extroverts, and that's okay. The key is finding the right balance. But if you tip over to one edge of the scale and refuse to move, well... Good luck.   it's extrovert's fault for putting so much pressure and stigma to introverts where it causes an immense drift between the two   ""It's their fault"" ""they did it"" sound like a 10 year old to you? I have plenty of extrovert friends, and they've always been nothing but awesome to me. Some tried to let me go out a little more, some liked me being the quiet person I am and learning to understand my emotions via my face rather than my words. Some girls thought I was a goofy nerd, some girls liked me being a bit awkward but whole with myself as a person. I didn't come to being truly whole with myself without pursuing what I wanted, even if it did mean changing my behavior. I wanted to be surrounded with close friends and I went out and reached for it. I didn't expect to sit at home and have people always come to me. I wanted to date and have sex and whaddaya know, it worked, albeit slowly. I've had an introverted girlfriend, and we had not been dating if both of us haven't done the effort to come forward for the other. We even went and have been a little ""extroverted"" in order to reach each other at first.   My point is, if you expect things to change, go out there and change them. You might even not try to change yourself but you will end up changing as a result. That doesn't mean you will stop being an introvert. That doesn't mean you'll stop having quiet time to yourself. It means you will find better balance between being with people you care about and having alone quality time.   If I may use myself as an example again, I'll tell you: I'm not extroverted, but I'm not so far deep in my own self 100% of the time either. Mostly I go out on weekends, but sometimes I like to stay in. I play Xbox, I draw, I code, I watch TV/movies. Then later I will go have a beer, coffee, see a movie with friends at the cinema, etc. I don't usually hit on girls the way most people would, and I have a strong dislike for parties. I think all of those things are common ways to describe introverts. So I haven't completely changed from one end to the other. However, I made the effort to find balance around others, so that I get to enjoy time with them and don't end up being on my own for the rest of my life.  If you plan on having things stay the same as they were, then do whatever it is you always do."

However, you keep suggesting that I should change for other people and that's what I refuse to do. Also, I've dealt with these feelings for a big chunk of my life now, even before high school, so don't belittle them by simply calling it an ""emo"" phase.   What sight of compliance is there on the extrovert's end? Constant criticism for not being like them, I see that as an implication of going to their end rather than meeting half way.  I get where you're going. It's not like I've tried recently to take that first step either, but I don't see any effort on their end. And also, I don't expect them to come to my side or to meet me half way. I get exhausted of constant judgement and criticism after a while for being ""different"" to where I don't see the point in trying anymore. They want me to do X, but I want to do Y, and there is no meeting point in between.   I couldn't care less if the OP made me sound like I was 10 years old or a fetus. It was a rant when I wrote it. And regardless of if it was or wasn't it doesn't really matter. I know there's more to it and they aren't (all) to blame, but I'd be delving into another topic if I were to go into that.  As I mentioned above, it's not that I refuse to change in general, it's that I refuse to change for the sake of others; I want to do it for myself, not because others want me to. I want to interact with more people, but going to that bridging point would be in vain for me, because I'd still be nagged to go on their side. Unless I fully conform to them and walk to their side 100%, I will still be hit with the same type of nagging judgement. I'm not sure if you get where I'm going at with this since you said you've never experienced treatment before. Unlike you I haven't had the opportunity to meet understanding extroverts. But don't think that just because you've had the grace of meeting some means that ones that misunderstand and mistreat introverts don't exist for others."
introvert,3ca3gy,bluezebra59,2,Mon Jul 6 20:03:06 2015 UTC,"When you start taking steps towards other people, they will feel more comfortable with you. If you open your eyes after that, they will slowly start taking their steps towards you. And if you see your efforts are useless after a long time, maybe you're hanging with the wrong crowd.   even before high school, so don't belittle them by simply calling it an ""emo"" phase   Like I said said, I've been there too - I'm just trying to make you realize they ARE a phase. If you're still stuck in your 20s with those... You're gonna need to get yourself checked.   Constant criticism for not being like them   Can you give more specific examples? I keep reading this from you. You might a) be overreacting or b) hang out with the wrong people.   it's that I refuse to change for the sake of others   Again, there's a difference between changing completely and maturing in a society. No one told you not to be yourself, but you can always be a better self, and a better self is one that can get along in life with other people. That requires some realizations and modifications to behavior on your end. I'm not saying go against things you believe in, I'm saying you should keep a more open mind in your behavior patterns. That's reality, bud."
introvert,3ca3gy,bluezebra59,-1,Mon Jul 6 20:13:55 2015 UTC,"Whatever you want to call it, yes it's a segment of one's life that will (hopefully) come to pass. However when you call it an emo phase it sounds disparaging to me as if these feelings are insignificant compared to others.  Examples:   The one in the OP. Note: this happened multiple times (we had three in one go once), with the teacher egging students on to ""call out the quiet students.""  related to what I said above, the teacher of this class called me out and asked me why I was so insecure. I asked her what was her purpose of talking to me about this, and she said it was because I don't talk. and proceeded to lecture me on how talking will get me the world's riches.  I'm copying this from a diary I wrote in a doc. I'll edit it some so it's not as redundant as when I first wrote it.   ""One time my freshman year in P.E class I was running. I didn’t really like running back then, but I was practically sprinting around the gym court. This kid in my current English Hon. Class named Ron [we'll call him that for now] decided to comment with a remark and demeanor that I still haven’t forgotten today. As I passed him he decided to make the comment “Wow! Go John! Run!” This alone doesn’t seem like a bad comment. But looking at his face and taking heed of his tone you can tell the rest of the meaning behind his comment. First, his tone was in a way that he was talking to me as if I was mentally retarded. It’s the same tone those teachers give the special kids when they accomplish something. And his look towards me was half-way laughing and half-way fascinated. I think he was genuinely surprised that I could run. I don’t know. I kinda don’t care, but at the same time I do. But what I know is that he was looking down on me.""   i've had similar experiences like this in middle school. people've talked to me like this because I was always quiet, thinking that I was some special case that needed to be dealt with in a unconventional approach.   I appreciate your advice - I really do. I enjoy opinions that challenge my own. But instead of using your experience as a basis for the advice instead of my own, I think you should also note that the environment can be an issue as well. There's such things in this world as cancerous communities."

I can see why you would be apprehensive of extroverts, but I promise that there are more good ones out there than bad.   Tbh, I find myself getting very tired of extroverts quickly, but I don't hate them. I just try to get a moment to myself when I'm feeling annoyed. I think you will find that many extroverts have a hard time understanding introversion, but we also have a hard time understanding extraversion, don't we?"
introvert,3ca3gy,timtoolmantaylor22,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That situation wracked my nerves; I never spoke in defiance to my teacher grading us on something as stupid as social aptitude. I even skipped school a couple of times because of how upsetting the entire thing was.   For me anyway, I don't see what's so hard to misunderstand about extroverts, especially when they're in the limelight and reap the most benefits. I have no problem with the existence of extroverts; I think a counterpart to introverts makes an interesting mesh of people in this world. However, I loathe them for the way they treat introverts. There's nothing more heart-wrenching in this world than being mistreated and misunderstood. This is where my hatred comes from; so deep-rooted to where I can say I despise them for that.   And just to add this out there, I don't think all extroverts are bad. My sister is one and she's fine (I guess because myself and my parents are heavy introverts so she learned to deal with it), but most of the extroverts I encounter come across as disparaging and domineering towards my temperament."
introvert,3ca3gy,YellowKingNoMask,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"I can level with you, there's at least a moment a day where someone will ask me why I'm not talking or make the despicable remark ""you seem quiet today."" It is then that I will start feeling animosity towards those who go that direction (100% extroverts).  The way I ""cope"" with this, so to speak, is have moments of extroversion when necessary (and when I feel like it, I won't be social every opportunity) but otherwise I stick to my introverted roots. This idea is mentioned in a chapter of Quiet by Susan Cain, recommended read.  It does sound deceptive, and while Quiet argues that it isn't deceptive if you're doing so with an ultimately good intent, but I disagree. And mostly because, deception is the way to go in this society (I can elaborate on my theory if anyone is curious!). So being deceptive to bring yourself an advantage is not only preferred, but is only possible by speaking far and loud and projecting yourself unto others. Sadly that's what I've seen and I'm sure most people on this forum agree.  If I had any advice for OP and others feeling a similar way, just flip on your extrovert switch when needed, otherwise, chill out like you normally do."

As a result, I think, I tend to reference other information about people when recalling them, such as their mannerisms or voice.  I've picked people I know out of a crowd of thousands simply by the way they moved or held their head.  I'm informed by someone's general presence more than I am by just their face.

Interesting post, OP."
introvert,3c6lic,dronewarrior4,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what I'm after. I'm actually a bit extroverted, because I need to meet people unless I want to sit around all out of energy and feeling lonely, but I still act as an introvert, because I get so overstimulated so quickly that I need lots of alone time to recharge. So basically I'm an introverted extrovert heh. If I had to choose I would say that I'm introverted, because 95% of the time that is how I act. So being hsp makes me introverted, though I think in reality I am not. And hsps are often more prone to anxiety and such, and I think that is what gives me signs of social anxiety, all though I don't really think I have that. It's just that when I know I will get drained of energy from hanging out with people, i get really anxious about successfully being sociable and nice and funny. And that gives me anxiety, and makes me sometimes want to avoid seeing people at all, which is translated as social anxiety.  I know the end result is the same, but I still think it's interesting, and I thought that maybe someone would read the post and find out about hsp and realize that they are hsp too. Finding out about hsp made it easier to understand myself and cope with some difficult things, and I thought that maybe there are people here on /introvert that would also find it helpful to learn about hsp :)"

Like when people are getting along and subconsciously mirror each other's body language and verbal pace. I'm not pulling this entirely from my ass either...I read it somewhere in a neuro/psyche book.

When I'm in a poor mood, or an analytical observe-humanity kind of mood, I don't laugh unless something is truly funny."

I never found them funny, but I'd do my best to join in - partly to be polite, and partly because I wanted to be 'part of the team'.   One day a few of us were alone in one of the change rooms, and someone made a comment about not always getting Andrea's jokes. Someone else responded with ""oh, neither do I, but I thought that everyone else thought she was hilarious, so I was just laughing to be polite"". After a short discussion we realised that no-one in the room found her jokes funny. Anyway that's kind of a sad story, but it might go some way towards answering the question ""do people fake laugh that often?"""

Just do it in a way which makes it seem like what you said could just not be seen as a joke and still make sense. I do it all the time, and as such have been able to find a small group who shares some degree of a sense of humor with me. It's amazing the degree which humor unites people. One of the reason I've understood to be responsible for this is that it creates an in crowd, so I'll often laugh to open someone up more, or to make them comfortable. That's probably also the case with a lot of other people, though my lack of perspective makes it hard to tell. I'd urge you to laugh with people trying to put themselves out there, as I'm sure most of us can attest to how difficult it is. On the other hand, don't compromise your sense of humor."

introvert,3c64wc,I-like-how-teardrops,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:45:40 2015 UTC,"I find interacting with others at work much easier because there are only so many options. I worked in a coffee shop for some time, and people would either be quiet/irritated because they hadn't had their caffeine (easy to deal with) or somewhere along the spectrum towards overly friendly. But even the overly friendly ones couldn't be overwhelming because I always had shit to do. Cleaning, helping other customers, whatever.  For me, having an extended conversation with a casual acquaintance or stranger is the stuff of nightmares. But a two minute chat about weather or local events - though still taxing - is recyclable.   I don't have to be myself at work. That's what's easy about it. I can make small talk and stuff without freaking out. The trick for me is to avoid working a job like that full time. It was also pretty convenient that there was a never-ending supply of coffee, tea, and related beverages on hand. Running out of energy for social interaction wasn't really an issue.  On breaks, I could sit down and listen to music or read or whatever, disengage for a while.  However, most jobs that deal with the general public pay very little and have very little meaning/purpose/consequence. As a result, changing jobs every two years or so is pretty much a necessity unless I want to end up with a drinking problem or in a psych ward.  It helps to have a ""script"". Improvising takes a lot more energy than a flowchart style conversation. Depending on the workplace and position, the script will vary. It will stick to the flowchart, though. If it doesn't, the person is talking to you about something that it isn't your job to deal with. It is best to have a few scripted responses to that sort of thing as well, to end the conversation or get it back on track."

There's an awesome waterfall in the middle of the village so I went to the resort overlooking it and, much to the confusion of the locals running the place, rented the entire honeymoon suite, a large building that happened to be completely empty and set apart from the rest of the buildings.  Other than going out for dinner I spent the entire day on the deck listening to the white noise of the falls and reading a book.  Glorious.  Happy Birthday!"

If you want them to stop talking with you, make it awkward for them by keeping the conversation 1 sided. Leave a pause before your responses, keep them as short as possible, don't mirror any of their questions, and don't smile. You can try and make it seem like you don't know why they are even talking to you (""hey, how are you?"" ""uh, yeah, ok?"")  They'll either have to cut to the chase or they'll give up."

I'm guessing you're a girl so this might not work as well for you, but I just make myself look really, really angry, and no one wants to talk to me then.  I actually managed to keep my own compartment to myself for most of my railway journey across Europe using this trick.  Whenever we would pull into a new station I would sit there with my fists clenched staring at the wall with a really pissed off expression on my face and everyone would walk up to my compartment, take a look inside and see some psycho and then just walk on to another compartment.  Maybe not the nicest way to manipulate people.. but it works!  But in the end you really shouldn't feel bad about walking away from strangers who want to talk if you don't.  Not to belittle your existence but you're really not that important to people, if you just wander away they'll probably forget you even exist pretty soon, so don't stress over it.  And finally there is the old phone trick, no one knows if your phone is on silent vibrate or not so you can always pretend like it is.  If they won't stop yapping at you you can always just suddenly pull your phone out, look at the screen and say, ""Shit, it's my boss."" and immediately put the phone up to your ear as you say, ""Excuse me I need to take this."" and then walk away.  You can keep the pretend conversation going as long as you like until the threat of unwanted conversation goes away.  Good luck!"

I normally go though phases of one or the other... normally to find a bit of a balance, I guess.  Sometimes being around people can be such a burden having to constantly confirming or compromising everything  and it can sometimes take enjoyment out of the 'little things'. (not that it's always like this)  Although I can be very social and often find myself being the 'leader' or 'logistics manger' of whatever group I'm in.

Not suggesting that older people always ""settle down"" because that simply isn't true, but rather it has been my experience that once my brain has regained control over my body that the desire to fuck everything that moves has somewhat diminished."
introvert,3bt4rk,black-raven-1307,2,Thu Jul 2 00:51:07 2015 UTC,I don't have a disinterest in monogamy. And I'm pretty sure I'm asexual which makes things more interesting lol.
introvert,3bt4rk,SnarkSnout,4,Thu Jul 2 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"I saw a documentary on asexual people a few years ago, and they talked about struggling with not wanting to be alone forever, but not being able to find relationships.  The thing I don't understand is that I've known plenty of men and women whose spouses stopped having sex with them within a year of getting married, and I thought, why can't the people who don't want to have sex find the asexuals?  They could arrange for companionship on whatever level they feel comfortable with.  As far as you saying that any relationship that eventually ends means that all the years in the relationship is a waste of time - that's like saying that everyone running any marathon is wasting their time unless they're declared the winner at the finish line.  Sometimes the journey is itself the reward, even if at the end of the journey, the travelers end up going on their own journeys.  The only relationships that are truly a waste of time are the ones that take advantage of you or hurt you along the way."
introvert,3bt4rk,garlicdeath,3,Thu Jul 2 07:57:10 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I'm asexual too.  Took me a way longer to realize this than it should have and spent so much damn energy in trying to be ""normal"".   Once I embraced this I became so much happier."
introvert,3bt4rk,black-raven-1307,2,Thu Jul 2 04:41:44 2015 UTC,Ah-ha! See that's totally different... lol  I can only say that you should just do you. Don't worry about what people / society says around you about what happens next. As long as you are happy and honest with yourself about that happiness I don't see why a relationship even matters.
introvert,3bt4rk,N0_PR0BLEM,0,Thu Jul 2 01:01:45 2015 UTC,"I know this is a really awkward question, and you don't have to answer it if you don't want to, but how old are you?"
introvert,3bt4rk,IrateHamster,5,Thu Jul 2 11:22:18 2015 UTC,"I'm currently coming to the end of a 5 year relationship.  She's about as close to perfect for me as I think exists, the love is there, we get on well, I trust her, etc.  But she's still another person in my space constantly, requiring attention, time, energy, etc.  The mere act of sharing a house with someone is an issue for me, as it means there is no ""safe space"" where I can be undisturbed.  In fact, the idea of having any kind of serious relationship in which one party needs to spend a decent amount of time pretending the other doesn't exist seems quite counter intuitive.  At 33, I still don't want a marriage or children (that was the deal breaker on her part, with the general lack of attentiveness as a backup convincer), and doubt that I ever will, so I have pretty much come to the same conclusion as OP."
introvert,3bt4rk,SnarkSnout,5,Thu Jul 2 07:09:21 2015 UTC,"One of my friends has been with her boyfriend for over 20 years.  They are not married but are committed and their families co-mingle as if they are married.  They are so happy.  Their secret?  They've never lived together.    They get together on weekends.  Go to family events together.  Travel a time or two a year together.  But during the week, they are at separate houses doing their own thing.  They keep their money separate, so there's no fighting about that either."

I resisted her moving in with me, I thought things would fall apart etc but they haven't. She understands and respects my introversion, and I understand her needs for attention. It has worked out far better than I could have imagined. So it really just comes down to finding the right person imo."
introvert,3bt4rk,holamiamor,2,Thu Jul 2 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"The way that i look at it is on a daily basis. if you're happy with someone today, be with them today. If it changes tomorrow, then it could end tomorrow.   All in all, do what makes you happy today, because when you start planning your happiness for the future, you'll never achieve it"
introvert,3bt4rk,quietplaces,2,Thu Jul 2 02:28:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry that you're feeling lonely. I get the push-pull thing, though. On one hand, companionship is great, on the other, so is freedom.   Question for you: You speak about relationships ending abruptly--that that person can just up and leave. I find it interesting that you put the leaving in their hands. Do you think you would be unlikely to leave and do the hurting, even though you value being independent?   Also, you 100% have the right to be upset about anything you want to be upset about. You may not get the resolution you want, but if something hurts you, that's okay. That's what happens. Has someone gotten upset with you for getting upset?  What do you think when you see people in happy long term relationships? Do you think they're the fluke? The one against the norm?"
introvert,3bt4rk,progmetal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:21:32 2015 UTC,"I guess that's part of the reason I don't want to be in a relationship. I don't want to hurt someone. Since I don't see the point in short term relationships and I don't really want a long term one, that puts me in a weird place."
introvert,3bt4rk,MsAlyssa,2,Fri Jul 3 00:06:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe the answer isn't as difficult as you make it out to be. Perhaps it's not your fear of not being in a relationship, it's the fear of what changes would arise if you were in one. Yes, relationships can be worth it but costly. If it works out, that's great! If not, it torments you for a long time.  In my opinion, relationships shouldn't be approached without careful consideration. What will change if I invest my time with someone? Do we both have the same interests, ways of living, etc? A lot of young people, from what I've been able to observe, set their expectations high from the start. They have to be married at this age, kids following afterward, house with white picket fence, and so on . . Relationships take time and you have to work at it. Approach it carefully and don't give yourself false hope of a promising future because if it doesn't last, you'll have built yourself for disappointment. This would lead you to contemplate on ""what could have been?""   My advice for you would be this; live your life for what it is now, don't feel pressured to commit to someone for the sake of committing, and enjoy being single. Why? It's worth it in the long run when you start to realize, once you've taken that step. You'll see tons of couples and often feel envious, but what false assumptions do you think about those particular people? ""Oh, they must be extremely happy, they must have a satisfying sex life, what do they have that I don't?"" Those kinds of faulty assumptions will only lead to create a false sense of realty of what you must have. Being single has its benefits and focusing on yourself isn't a bad thing. Who knows? You may meet someone one day. Though, if not, don't worry about it. What's worse? Being miserable while with someone or being lonely but in control of your life? I'm certainly i no rush to be in any kind of relationship because I'm happy with how my life is, alone and focused on myself. I hope this helps you."
introvert,3bt4rk,timtoolmantaylor22,2,Fri Jul 3 14:18:43 2015 UTC,"I have these conflicting feelings about it too. I've recently stopped thinking that I have control over things or can make things last and have started accepting that everything is temporary. The only thing that's constant in life is change. It sometimes makes me sad but mostly it makes me appreciate special moments. My nephews laughter the same as his cry because I'll never have this particular moment in time ever again. The person I'm in love with in one moment could be a person who's not in my life next year. Instead of mourning a loss before it happens I appreciate the moment now while I have it. Maybe that appreciation helps make it last, who knows."

introvert,3bsiak,awnomnomnom,61,Thu Jul 2 02:52:20 2015 UTC,"Please don't feel bad. You did nothing wrong.  It was miscommunication on his part. He thought it would escalate and that he sent a clear enough message that you were both on the same page about the situation. He didn't.  ""Watching a movie"" can be more if you both want it to be more. Otherwise, it's just a movie."
introvert,3bsiak,WearWhatWhere,33,Wed Jul 1 20:27:10 2015 UTC,Usually when I invite people over to watch a movie I tell them what movie we're going to watch. But 'movie and hang out' or 'netflix and hang out' has kind of become a code phrase for come over and fuck. Kind of like 'coming up for a coffee' after a date.  If you're okay with casually seeing this guy and seeing where it goes then continue 'watching movies' with him but if you don't want him to touch you any more then make that clear to him and hopefully you two can continue to be friends.
introvert,3bsiak,Joinys,66,Wed Jul 1 21:13:24 2015 UTC,it's totally code for fooling around
introvert,3bsiak,Jesus_Faction,6,Wed Jul 1 21:07:13 2015 UTC,"Please watch this 10 minute video. You really need it.  It's honest, but incredibly forward for someone to say ""hey, do you want to come have sex?""  ""Do you want to come watch a movie"" offers both parties a graceful exit. By asking, there's the implication, but he's not overtly asking for sex. So if you ask ""do you just want to have sex with me"", he can save himself from looking like a horn-dog by going ""oh no, I really just wanted to watch a movie"". If you say no to the invitation, maybe you just really don't want to watch a movie? That saves his feelings, because maybe you're not really rejecting sex with him.  If you're in college and young man invites you to be alone with him, in his room, in the dark, on his bed... he's looking to be physically intimate. 99.999% of the time.  You have no obligation to participate in the seemingly perpetual orgy that is the college years, and can go at your own pace. But you should be aware that many people around you are having sex, and casual invitations to do so aren't unusual.

introvert,3bsiak,sylvan,11,Thu Jul 2 06:57:51 2015 UTC,"Especially in college, it's become a code for ""Let's get in a private area and see what happens"" otherwise you could go to a movie out. That said, sometimes it fits just mean, let's watch a movie. Any time you are in a situation where you are alone with a guy, you should anticipate that he might get fresh."
introvert,3bsiak,RichardPalma,12,Wed Jul 1 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"Basically, any activity that involves going back to one of your places is code for fooling around.  Example: Wanna come up for a cup of coffee?"

introvert,3bsiak,Silverlight42,8,Wed Jul 1 21:16:42 2015 UTC,"The way you described events you were being picked up. If a hetero guy asks you for your number, then immediately goes for a private alone time with few exceptions he has fooling around in mind. At university age that often means sex, younger possibly just making out. This was a typical tactic since at least my teen years in the early 90s.  About the only time I'd consider alone time with a movie as innocent is if you were already good friends. Though even that has the potential to be a somewhat shy guys way of trying to move things toward romance, but there should be physical signs that's the case either in the guys speech patterns when asking or in seeking increasing slightly unusual physical contact if that's the case.  If a guy were looking for friendship he'd probably ask you to a group activity of some kind in a public place. Though at times this is a precursor to asking for a date, unless large amounts of alcohol are involved then it could be a hookup angle.   If interested in serious dating, he'd likely ask you out in public just the two of you in a somewhat formal atmosphere.  You're young and seemingly inexperienced(perhaps a bit lonely?). You didn't understand and didn't do anything wrong beyond that. Learn from the experience and move on. If this guy was just looking for a casual hookup, from your description it seems likely, he may blow you off from here on out and be at most casually friendly. If he's actually interested in you, he'll ask for a proper date. If he asks you to get alone in private again, I'd be really surprised if he's not trying to go a step further than last time. In that case, unless that's what you want I'd suggest cutting contact and trying to talk to other people."

Like you said you enjoy talking to him and that it ""felt good"" till he pushed too far. If so, I would just recommend you tell him straight up. It's not that you mind, it's just that he moved way way too fast, and you'd like to hang out, actually watch movies, and take it step by step with the rest.  If he's mature enough for that."
introvert,3bsiak,TrotBot,3,Wed Jul 1 23:22:18 2015 UTC,"Generally yes, 'lets watch a movie' goes to some sort of sexy times.   I am glad that your friend wasn't a douche about you not wanting to."

introvert,3bsiak,ToolPackinMama,2,Thu Jul 2 03:07:08 2015 UTC,"It is more often than not code for at least getting the ball rolling in that direction. I, like the rest of this subreddit, am pretty introverted myself and as such I tend to move slowly when I meet a girl. With that said, if I were to invite someone over to watch a movie or something (keyword being ""something"") I would be using that time to get to know her more and to try and steer us both into something more intimate.   As others have said, you didn't do anything you shouldn't have and it sounds like this guy is pretty understanding which is definitely a good/rare thing. What you need to decide is whether or not you actually do like him and would want to get on the same level with him. Any time the two of you hang out alone he will be thinking of you the same way, wanting the same thing and unless you tell him otherwise he will likely assume you are on the same page. Regardless, just continue to say what's on your mind and be upfront and honest with him. The rest will work itself out."

You have the right to say no, to say slow down, to just go with it and enjoy.  BUT I find it useful, when a new guy invites me to go somewhere private with him, to state plainly that I am not thinking of sex, nor am I prepared for it.  Say something like, ""OK, but as far as I am concerned this is a social call.  I'd love to spend time getting to know you better, but don't get any big ideas.""  Unless, of course, you want him to have big ideas, in which case carry on."

Back in my college days (80s) a guy would usually invite you back to his place to watch a movie after  we'd gone out and done something else first (dinner, or a party, etc.)  There might be some fooling around but most of them didn't give any full-hearted tries to get down one's pants right away.  Also, this usually didn't happen on the first date.  But nowdays (and after being caught in the same situation as you about six years ago) I know if a guy doesn't want to be out in public with me and goes straight to ""come over and watch a movie"" without a date... yep, I'm only good enough for booty call material for that guy.  And I usually have to pick him up dinner on my way over - that's another clue."

There should at least be an offer for a movie, and him being so forward and assumptive, offers some insight that well, he is a dick wad.   I guess I should've realised you wouldn't know as you don't seem like that kinda girl""   Thats emotional manipulation, he is trying to guild or coerce you into doing what he wants, supported by his laugh, he is trying to make you feel stupid and naive.   maybe he was taken off guard as much as you, and reacted with out thinking.   To avoid this in future, maybe some texting back and forth, about what movie, and other specifics, maybe food and such, should clear up the misunderstanding. I don't think anyone is at fault here, you shouldn't be for assuming there was only going to be a film, so don't give it too much thought.  If you are like me, you may sit around for the rest of your life remembering the awkwardness, don't do that."

introvert,3btwzr,iamlunasol,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:01:43 2015 UTC,"I'm an introvert and in my early childhood i moved around a lot so the friends that I was able to make didn't last very long. As of recently I've tried to get into more friendships but it hasn't worked out too well. Even people that live in the same town as me and I see daily and share many common interests, I have trouble socializing with regularly. I usually stay in my room and play computer games or study/ work on projects. I had a roommate for the past year and we hung out maybe 10 times in the entire year. The friends I had in my hometown are non existent even though in high school we hung out literally everyday. It's just a fact of introvert life that you really have to work to make a relationship work for long periods of time or they have to be the initiator and really try. My most recent ex was also an introvert but had some social grooming and was able to bring me out more with her friends.   What doesn't help is that my ability to recognize faces and connect them to names is pretty much non existent unless I've seen them daily for a week or so."

If it's in work environment i often feel that this person could really be good to spend more time with, and I am very sincere about this feeling. But if the person suddenly isn't in my daily routine, then I forget and loose interest in them immediately. I do have a wife and 2 kids (been dating her for 12 years) so i tend to use that as the reason for my lack of interest in after work socialising. I have one or two friends whom I talk with, one of them perhaps a couple of times each week (IM or texting), the other one sometimes each day, sometimes several months between.  I really dont know anybody who replenishes me if we socialize."

introvert,3brzmh,CaptainBludclot,16,Thu Jul 2 00:55:24 2015 UTC,"Introversion is not the same thing as social anxiety. You should focus on that and not introversion. What helped me get over mine was to stop trying to be normal. It always came off as 10x weirder because it was forced. I'm never going to be smooth in social interaction. I started owning the awkwardness. I play a game where I try to top myself in how unintentionally awkward I can be. I imagine I might give someone a story for later. You should really look into psychological help other than medication. Behavioral therapy is better for social anxiety anyway. As my anxiety has lessened, I've been able to practice social interaction more and improve my social skills with practice. The first 10+ times in a new situation are nerve racking. But the more you do it and get familiar, the more comfortable it becomes and you can start focusing on different aspects. Anxiety is a fear of the unknown/unexpected, right? Make the situation known through repetition to quiet some of those fears. There's a teaching strategy to encourage classroom participation that says once someone has spoken once, they are more likely to continue participating. This is very true for me. I can be very quiet and won't initiate anything myself. But once that floodgate has been opened, I feel more like socializing. Something to keep in mind. I've seen people go from significant social anxiety to social butterflies before, so it's possible."

introvert,3brzmh,Wurstgeist,3,Wed Jul 1 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"So for starters, I think what you expressed in the thread was social anxiety as opposed to introversion. That's fine, the two are often mixed up. If you were to look up either word in the dictionary, the other word would probably come up under synonyms.   With that being said, social anxiety is normal and quite common, so do not feel like you're alone without anyone knowing what it feels to go through situations similar to yours.   From my personal experience, social anxiety is not something that you just get over in a day. What you need to do, in my opinion, is chip away a little at it every day. So in your case, you went out one day without the hood. As it may seem insignificant to an outside ear, it holds great significance for you. So I would continue doing that for a while. Then, think of something a step further than that, and start performing that activity for a while. Within no time you will be not only heading in the right direction, but laughing at the old you.   I too suffered from social anxiety. Once I realized what it was and what it was hindering me from accomplishing, I began chipping away. I now can go out and be ignorant, start conversations, meet new people, dance in clubs, or even do simple things that struck anxiety within me such as: going to the gym, going to the coffee shop, etc.   However, this took me a few years to be able to do. It isn't an over night process. Thus, you don't really notice the progress either until you actually sit down and consciously think about it.   I think you will be just fine, to be honest.

introvert,3brzmh,fonzo223,2,Thu Jul 2 02:47:39 2015 UTC,"the new realization of just how different I really am from most people kept eating at me.   Hmm. So, what's the answer? Just how different really are you? That's a rhetorical question: I mean to say I think the answer is ""kind of different but not all that much really"". The people working in the store are going to have all kinds of bizarre customers who come in regularly. There could be:   Needy old people with mild memory loss who just want to tell rambling anecdotes about their dead spouses while buying random items very slowly Bitter old people in dirty or stained clothing who smell funny and are incredibly, overtly racist and secretly rich, but only buy the cheapest items People who only speak Bulgarian, but try to ask for particular products anyway Somebody in a wheelchair who carries crutches and accidentally on purpose hits the clerks with them and continually asks for products from high shelves but is actually shoplifting Somebody with 12 kids who brings them all, every day Somebody who complains over and over again about the unavailability of a product the store has never even sold   You know, for example. You're not like any of those people, but you're also a lot less trouble than any of those people. You might be disconcerting in conversation, but at least you're not actually malevolent or wasting time on purpose, you don't cause damage, you're not disruptive, and you're there to buy stuff. So you're a solid customer, and any slight perturbation you may cause to an individual assistant makes no difference to that: seen as a single entity, the store likes you and was put there to serve you."

introvert,3bsox2,sheepdogg0311,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:12:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others. Not being sure about marriage has nothing to do with being an introverted person.   I think a lot of people would feel unsure about marriage after just 8 months of dating. I understand that many in your faith may move quickly, but your girlfriend may just not be ready. You also describe her as being independent. This makes me think 2 things.  One, she may worry that her independence will be threatened if she gets married.  Two, typically, Mormon families are big, right? So it's likely that you two would have kids? It's possible that the thought of having kids is not something she wants to deal with right now. Especially if she values her independent time.  Have you tried asking her what would make her feel more comfortable?"
introvert,3bsox2,quietplaces,0,Thu Jul 2 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"Has she said that saying ""I love you"" makes her feel pressured? She says she loves you too right? Unless she asked you to stop, I think withholding that is going to do more harm than good."

introvert,3bsox2,daypenny,5,Thu Jul 2 01:38:50 2015 UTC,"Being introverted has absolutely NOTHING to do with how she feels about marriage.   Introversion is only about where people get their energy from. Intro / intra = internal... Extro / extra = external. It's that simple.   Your girlfriend might also be shy, but that's something else.   You've been dating for 6 months. Chill out dude. We are particular about where we spend our energy, and will choose about whom we spend our time with. If she is spending time with you it means she wants to.   Wanting to spend time with you and wanting to be married to you are two different things. Slow down, or the chances are you'll loose her."

Every week at work during our weekly team meeting, everyone has to go around the table and share a ""new"" and a ""good."" Basically, talk about your personal life or whatever you've been doing outside of work.  When I'm not at work, I go to the gym every day, I eat out a couple times a week, buy groceries, and spend a lot of time just relaxing in my apartment. Apparently that isn't good enough for my co-workers and they're always prompting for more. I'm like, ""That's it. That's all I did. And it was awesome.""  Everyone always seems really disappointed with my weekends. I'm at a point now where I try to think of something cool to do just so I can say I did it during the meeting.  If my co-workers ask me out for drinks after work, I do go though. Doing those kinds of things can help facilitate advancement at work when everyone likes you."
introvert,3bjclq,nonnativetexan,3,Mon Jun 29 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"I would struggle if I had to do what you do at your meetings! Luckily, I only have to talk about it if someone asks.  I get what you mean about getting people to like you. I really wish it didn't work like that, but sadly it does. Like I said, I get on really well with my team, and enjoy working with them. What I don't like about going out is the fact that it involves socialising, which I'm not great at (I do have mild social anxiety, but it's not as bad as it was a few years ago). I struggle with small talk unless it's something I'm interested in, and the whole being in a crowd tires me out. I can get away with the small talk during work, because once it's over, I can just get back to work, but when it's at a social event, I can't 'escape', and sometimes struggle to keep the conversation going, which makes me feel really awkward. I'll go every once in a while, just so they don't think I'm antisocial or whatever. It's just the frequent declines which make me feel bad. I also don't drink alcohol, so while everyone else is getting drunk and being merry, I'm slowly getting bored."

It's nothing to be ashamed of. The reality is they're probably just trying to make Monday morning small talk and don't actually care what you did.  As for the social invitations, if they know you are a gym-goer, you can always tell them you have personal training appointments Friday evenings after work. This or anything family-related are good excuses."
introvert,3bjclq,holamiamor,3,Tue Jun 30 00:24:50 2015 UTC,"As long as you're happy with how you spend your weekends, that's all that matters.  Just hear me out. If someone asks you how your weekend was, you could respond by simply mentioning all you did, like you were reading off a grocery list. But unless they have the same interests as you, they probably won't find that exciting. It's the same thing if someone went to like a Comic-Con but you weren't into that stuff at all. However, if someone were to ask this Comic-Con person and they described their weekend with whatever tone that demonstrates that they enjoyed their weekend, then it shows the other person ""hey, although you might not be into this, i am, and i just had a great weekend for myself"".   So basically, although poorly written, you just have to show people you're content with how you spend your time. If you're not content, then change those weekends. If you are, then if you tell someone ""i watched TV and played video games, and to be honest, i couldn't have wish for any other type of weekend""... they'll get the drift.   Also, the whole pressure to go out and make the most of the ""summer weather"" only exists because a lot of people like summer weather. Once again, if it doesn't apply to you, then do whatever makes you happy instead."

introvert,3bgj7u,Benjabenja,15,Mon Jun 29 11:22:15 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've come to a crossroads. Crossroads are good. Evaluating your life up to this point and thinking about where you want to go from here is good. So now you have to make a decision. Should you continue to live life as you always have? Should you make a change?   Change is often times slow, and changes take time. There's nothing wrong with that. Socializing and making conversation doesn't come easily for everyone, but it can be learned, through practice and persistence. I think many people believe that social skills are inherent. They aren't, at least not for everyone. But if you're ready and willing to learn, you absolutely can. It'll take time, but you can do it if you decide that's what you want to do."
introvert,3bgj7u,kishbish,9,Mon Jun 29 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"Take small steps and start going out to library, supermarket, bookstore. Try to identify your interest. Maybe you can volunteer etc. You might not feel like going out, but go out anyway."
introvert,3bgj7u,nibble25,6,Mon Jun 29 02:10:39 2015 UTC,"I have times where I start to feel lonely when I'm just living my normal routine (which, when I'm not at work, consists of listening to music, reading, and browsing the internet at home), I start to feel like...disconnected from reality or something. Suddenly my little world feels so alien and what was once normal for me feels odd, and I don't really know why.   But I've found a solution. When I start to feel like this, I break habit and do something in public (still by myself, but I expose myself to the outside world). As a matter of fact, the last time I felt this way was just this past weekend on Saturday. I noticed that strange feeling, so I went out to the movies. The movie theater near here sells alcohol so I can drink some beers while watching the movie. It's nice. I saw that new Pixar movie Inside Out.   It was late when I got home, and the next morning I felt like everything was normal again. And I reckon I'll be fine for several weeks - maybe even months. So I suppose the conclusion that I've drawn is that sometimes it's good to expose yourself to the outside world so you don't feel so disconnected from reality. Or at least that's how it works for me. And for what it's worth, I'm also a 23 year old male. I hope this helps in some way."
introvert,3bgj7u,Nihil_,6,Mon Jun 29 12:33:48 2015 UTC,I wasn't born with a huge degree of social drive either. It's important to remember everything has a price. Even doing nothing. Sometimes pushing yourself to change pays off.
introvert,3bgj7u,daypenny,4,Mon Jun 29 03:47:17 2015 UTC,"I just want to let you know that I relate to this a lot. Like, you're not the only person who feels that way.   Especially the having few friends and just sort of being content with it, other people failing to understand and assuming that I have some kind of problem or something, and the response of shutting up entirely when I realize that other people don't value what I have to say.   EDIT: spelling"
introvert,3bgj7u,Gromit43,2,Mon Jun 29 07:11:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, you can always change! It's never too late. I think you should really think about how much interaction you need, and how much is too much for you. ""How much interaction it takes for you to fill up the meter / what's the minimum you'd be happy with"". This way, you will still work toward your goal without overwhelming yourself  (happens to me).  Also, there are some people who will require much more attention/interaction from you than others.. in my opinion, it's important to have both but just as important to realize  how they affect you."
introvert,3bgj7u,chipichipisu,3,Mon Jun 29 03:43:14 2015 UTC,"I feel very similarly to the the way you do albeit a major difference - I avoid people because I genuinely can't stand being around other people. I hate the chaos, the smell, the stupidity. Sometimes (ok, often) I come across as a misanthropic asshole.   Whereas my introversion stems from elsewhere, the way I think and live is very similarly. You wrote:    I found that I regularly said awkward or annoying things, so I started talking to people less.   Me too. I then quickly got labeled the quiet kid. I was fortunate enough to move away from my home town and start again. I was around your age - 23 -(I'm turning 27 in a few days) and made a compromise with myself. There were certain things about me that whilst not perfect I was not willing to change. There were things, however, I could, and did change.   OP, it honestly does not sounds like you want advice. It sounds like you want to know if other people can relate and if other people feel similarly. I hear you, I can relate and I wonder where you're from."
introvert,3bgj7u,RB9,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:13:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you, and you're right about that last part. I actually find advice to be more informative than anything else, I rarely change my behavior based on most advice I'm given, even when I happen to be the one to ask for the advice in the first place.  I've wondered if there were people similar to me, but had never really given it much thought until now. Thanks for sharing and offering understanding, it's what I needed.

introvert,3bgj7u,trigaderzad2606,4,Wed Jul 1 18:09:40 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna come out and say this: you should pursue a job instead of accepting welfare because welfare should be for those who truly can't work.  Think of any hobby or interest of yours that requires a body to make it possible and go find the store/factory/firm near you that has entry level positions. If you're good with computers you're pretty set with being a receptionist, which is a good in for whatever position you'd fit into wherever you're working as a receptionist at; you'll get experience answering phone calls and scheduling appointments, while also working with other human beings. No matter how introverted you are, you can't live a self-respectable life if you literally can't work with people or earn an honest wage. I'd say getting a full time job should be your #1 priority to positively changing your life in the best way possible.  Once you're earning your own way, paying your own rent, buying your own food and toys, living in your own space, see how you feel about your introversion. I love spending time alone in a place I support playing games on the Wii U and self-built PC and big TV I earned for myself (which are essentially all I/most of us want/need...once you buy your electronics you're pretty set as far as big unnecessary expenses go). You have no idea how good it feels to earn your own worth, let me tell you it feels amazing. Go find a job and get out of your parents' house, good luck!"
introvert,3bgj7u,Wurstgeist,4,Mon Jun 29 07:49:56 2015 UTC,"Why do you say full-time? I do fine on part-time work.  I don't accept any magic free government money; in fact, being as I am on a low income, I've probably been entitled to some for years but have never sought it out, partly out of principle but mainly because the interactions and letters and forms would be tiresome.  I see people with full-time jobs constantly complaining about how they don't want to go to work. In theory you could have ""a job you love"", but in practice I suspect the concept is a crock of shit, and people probably lie to themselves about how much they love their work, in many cases. Just because you enjoy a hobby doesn't mean you'll still enjoy the hobby after it's been translated and distorted into a vaguely related employment position: also, it's a huge assumption that a person even has identifiable, coherent, consistent, wholehearted interests.  I view my job as a sort of compromise with society where I do a bit of shitwork for humanity in general and in return they feed me, let me live indoors, and mostly stay out of my way. It's nice not to have the guilt or the vague sense of vulnerability that comes from being dependant on handouts, I'll give you that.  Living in your own space with next to no free time to enjoy it boggles my mind as a concept, however normal it might be, and even though everybody's doing it it doesn't look very sane to me, they all seem like slightly manic zombies leading highly regulated lives alternating with bursts of meaningless activity during holidays and at weekends."
introvert,3bgj7u,trigaderzad2606,3,Mon Jun 29 13:59:59 2015 UTC,It sounds like you're assuming all jobs take place on Wall Street or something. I love my job and know some people who love it as well. Also who said you'd have no free time? I have more free time today than I ever had as a teenager.
introvert,3bgj7u,Wurstgeist,2,Mon Jun 29 19:20:46 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it, I have exactly one friend whose jobs - second hand record sales, something to do with avant garde film production, and then running an art gallery - happened to coincide exactly with the things he loves to do. Last time I saw him though he was freaking out slightly because he found himself obliged to work in web design to make ends meet, and he was unaccustomed to doing something slightly different from exactly what he wanted.  Meanwhile other people I know have had jobs cutting people's toenails, or running around supermarkets, or corralling psychopaths and stopping them from starting fires or swallowing sharp objects, and these jobs exist and nobody particularly wants to do them - regardless of corporate claims about ""passion"" - yet quite a large number of people are somehow doing them anyway.  Then I have friends with ""interesting"" jobs, like the chemical analysis of groundwater or filtering the applications to a patent office, and they'll still come home and bitch about their managers or how everybody they work with is stupid and they haven't had a meaningful conversation in days, and more than anything else, about how exhausted they are. Because if you work nine to five - which is unusually low hours in many countries, considering the pressure to work overtime - that's half your waking hours gone: and it's not as if the remaining half is exactly as good as the half you've lost, because working wears you out. It takes the lions share of you daily energy and devotes it to some boring stupid crap you didn't devise yourself and don't personally care about. This is bad for a person. I don't know what you mean about having more free time than you did as a teenager: I assume school, so I read that as ""and I had no free time as a teenager either, so it's fine""."
introvert,3bgj7u,trigaderzad2606,3,Mon Jun 29 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"I guess we're all different. If I worked part time I'd be bored out of my mind. I had free time as a teenager, but whenever I had free time my parents made me do shit for them. I guess my childhood is part of why I feel I have more free time as an adult.  I also only sleep 4-6 hours a day, and almost half the time I leave work early because we get a surplus of workers come in around half my shift so if I want to go I can go. I have tons of energy to do exactly what I want to do pretty much every day.  I'm not trying to convince you or OP that a job will automatically fulfill you. But OP doesn't seem to have ever had a real job and you have, so he probably needs a full time job more than you or me. Not just for filling the time and getting off welfare, but to gain the work and life experience needed to make it in the real world. Yes, we'd all love to not work or work fun jobs and go on 8 month vacations and accept free money with no guilt, but that's just not the world we live in. I'm trying to tell OP that if he puts a little effort in himself, he will be able to reward himself more than he's capable of doing now. If all we care about is rewarding ourselves, I'd say working a job is a good step towards being able to do more of that."
introvert,3bgj7u,Wurstgeist,2,Mon Jun 29 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Yes, we're all different: I seem to get tired easily, so other people may have better ability to deal with standard 8-hour shifts and still enjoy their evenings, also I was home educated (in an agreeably casual way) so having lots of free time is my norm, I value it very much (you can't buy more of it), and devoting it to anybody else's purposes seems weird and scary to me.  In my current job I don't have to arrive at work until 2 in the afternoon (and I'm usually ten minutes late, and nobody minds). I love that, because I go through the working week feeling more or less human and fairly carefree. So, anyway, who knows what the OP's needs are."

Rinse and repeat for several days at a time.  Occasionally I write some original fiction, adding another piece to the overall story. Over the past few years I've amassed about 250 pages, maybe one day I might decide to try to make it an actual novel, doubtful though.  Most thursdays I spend a couple hours with my D&D group, then return home to my normal routine.  Aside from occasionally going to the store, helping my brother with some project for his house, or taking a short walk to the forest and back, I spend most of my time doing what makes me content."

introvert,3bj4qx,JerryLeRow,3,Mon Jun 29 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"When I was young (I think I was 10), I had an accident in a PE class, my head hit the wall and I fell unconscious. In retrospective, it may have been the point when I gradually started to become more and more introverted, but it's only one option.  Instead of trying to find out whether this event triggered your increase in introversion - what I think is damn hard to prove - I suggest you simply look forward. There are things we can't know, and I'm not a doctor, but 8 years afterwards... don't waste your energy and brainpower on that."
introvert,3bj4qx,holamiamor,2,Mon Jun 29 22:09:33 2015 UTC,"While I have not suffered a traumatic brain injury (and i'm very sorry you have), I am very similar when it comes to social interactions. I don't like small talk -> in turn, limits me to meeting new people -> limits my ability to reach out to someone when i feel lonely. A paradox.  I'm at a college campus so its a little different for me. The end of last semester i ended up texting a friend (pretty extroverted) for dinner. It was one of those ""20 seconds of courage"" type moments, i didn't think about it and it turned out for the better. She unexpectedly brought a friend along with her. It ended up being a rather long dinner, mostly of me asking questions, and then giving long answers. So basically, i used their extravertedness as an advantage to keep on asking questions, something i much more prefer than answering them.  I know this example isn't 100% able to be replicated for you (i'm guessing that you're not in college). Go to a friend, a best friend, or acquaintance, and build up a relationship until you're comfortable to be like ""hey man, i'm shy but i want to meet some people, do you have any friends that you think i'd get along with? Would you mind inviting us over sometime so I can get to know him?""   Another road i can suggest going down is having a logical argument with yourself. What is it about small talk that you don't like? If it's the whole ""the conversation is boring to me"", then throw a curveball at someone, ask them a question that they can answer deeply in the first minute of a conversation. See where that goes.   Lastly, practice. I'm not sure why you want a job at a restaurant if you don't like talking to people; nonetheless, you're not going to wake up one day feeling that you can go infront of a live audience and tell your life story. Think of this kind of like a muscle you have to grow. And grow it, make it your goal to talk to someone new twice a week.   EDIT: Okay, i actually did crack my skull and needed staples in my head in 7th grade. But that was like 8 years ago. Could this head injury have caused this? Probably not, but if we ever find a correlation between head injuries and introvertedness, that'd be pretty fucking cool"
introvert,3bh3fn,dadfigure,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:11:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly... tumblr?? I know I swear I'm not 12. But technically the reason we started talking is because he was best friends with one of my good friends so I already kind of knew who he was. We texted and Skyped for a few weeks and then he asked me out and that was that! Which is very strange, because I have never actually met someone in person that I knew just from online, I never thought I could do it, but it was different this time! It's been 6 months, but honestly it's already a million times better than my last relationship, which was 2 and a half years."

We are still figuring out logistics but we see each other every weekend.

I had a crush on her and she had a crush on me, but we were both dating mediocre other people so we just sort of dealt with it. Our SO's at the time were both in drama club, so we sort of got dragged along but we did get to see each other quite a bit and spent a lot of time there talking about stuff. It made my girlfriend and her boyfriend both jealous, which I thought was funny.   Anyways, I eventually left town for a couple of years. Not because of her, that's just how my life was going.    I eventually do come back and one day while I was out running errands with my father, out of nowhere he's like ""hey, let's go get some groceries,"" which is weird because dude never went grocery shopping and besides we were all already out and about and I'd have rather gone home but hey, sure.  So I'm screwing around in the grocery store when I see her. It'd been three years but I still recognized her, adorable as ever. She ran through the store and gave me a giant hug and was super surprised to see me and she made absolutely sure that I had her number before we left. In her words (later on) she said ""I wanted to make absolutely sure you didn't get away again.""   I had to go out of town for work for a couple of weeks, but when I came back I texted her and we went on a date at a mall. It was wonderful; we were just supposed to get lunch but instead we were out until past midnight, just hanging out any place that was open. Being around her was (and is) restful and exciting at the same time, and I've never gotten tired of just being near her.  So, I guess, for me it was dumb luck. I've always either dated people I knew from school or friends of friends. It helps that I'm a very independent person. I didn't mind being single, although obviously being married to somebody you're in love with is much nicer."

Anyway we talked during the first day of school and found out that we both like this radio show quiz that's on saturday mornings, so we developed a habit of meeting up at his place (his kitchen was far better than mine) and making breakfast and listening to the morning quiz. Still totally platonic. After a while he got dumped. Then a few months later I got dumped too. Things went on as usual, but after a few more months our saturday breakfasts turned into brunches, then brunch and a walk. Then brunch a morning walk and a movie on netflix. And then we started meeting up in the evenings again and make dinner together and watch netflix. And then it suddenly turned into sleepovers, and after that fwb. And after two months of doing that we kind of realized we were fooling ourselves thinking we were not in love. So we became a couple and it's been great. I think being close friends before you become a couple is a good thing. It makes it easier to communicate and talk about stuff. I mean, he had heard a thousand of my embarassing stories way before we started having sex, so I didn't have to hide anything from him when we started going out.

introvert,3bh3fn,idontknow745,3,Tue Jun 30 21:14:42 2015 UTC,"Tinder has been my favorite method of online dating, personally. I like it because the profiles are brief (so you have to talk to them to learn about them) and only people you're attracted to can message you. That, and since it also seems to be the most socially acceptable form of online dating there is most amount of people on there.   I'm a girl and kinda spent way too much time on the app, so it was pretty typical for me to get 100+ matches a day. I would exchange messages with probably half of them, gave my number to a handful, and only met 3 in person during the 4 months I used it.   As far as meeting new people goes, my best tips I have are to be the instigator, make sure to smile/act friendly, and ask open ended questions. I suffer from resting bitch face, so I've learned that if I don't talk to someone first they most likely won't talk to me at all. If you're nervous, just pretend the stranger is a long lost friend that you're reconnecting with- the more comfortable you are with a person, the more comfortable they will be with you."

introvert,3bh3fn,Downstockforwhat,4,Tue Jun 30 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"I met mine in a bar, by accident. I was out with a friend for her birthday, on a weeknight in a small town. This is the sole time I have ever been to that particular bar. He initiated; he is an extrovert. He was eavesdropping on my conversation with my friend and decided to interject. We got to know each other casually for a few weeks before beginning dating and then becoming a couple. We have been together for 3 years, living together for 2. I consider our meeting pretty serendipitous; I just got lucky."

I said I didn't know, because I hadn't seen her in a few months.  Next thing I know it's 2am and he's asking me about movies. Following day we talked a bunch more, then went and saw The Cave.   Turns out we were practically neighbors, living only a few blocks from each other. We've had ups and downs but it's been a great ten years. :)"

To make a day productive, I get dressed to go out (even if I'm not going anywhere important) and set myself up to do productive things in a place other than my personal space - having said that, nobody said you had to interact with other people when you do it :) libraries, parks, hell make a space in your garage (if you have one) or ask someone you know if they can lend you a space while they're away at work or something (tell them its for a personal project)."

I can take a little rest going to a room with few or zero people and just stay there for a few minutes, sometimes I do nothing, sometimes I mindlessly search my phone, anything works as long as I get away from the place with most people.  2) For me time, I really don't feel like doing anything, even if I'm physically well rested my mind is still exhausted, so gaming and binge watching Netflix is the norm, I can do some cleaning up but that's when I start feeling guilty for not doing any productive stuff."

introvert,3bh1f9,thebrklynbrtt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"Signs - with small groups, I just get more and more tense. I can feel the pressure building (although I am often not aware enough of it at the time, just afterwards), will begin to focus on the particular faults and fury-inducing habits of each of them, speak only when necessary and then in short clipped terms, and generally become intolerant and snappy. The pressure lifts instantly once I am away, and then I will slump both mentally and physically until recharged.    With larger groups, I will often get a buzz, which feels pretty good to start with but then just leaves me with a coffee-jag/hungover sensation. This jag will continue when I am away from them, and lead into the usual rehearsals of conversations and other flashbacks from the event until the recharge is well underway.    Recharge - sometimes I can put it to use. Almost always what I want to do really is to crawl under the duvet and mindlessly surf, but if I can get over that initial hurdle, then tidying, filing, washing up and other chores are good ones to start with – pretty mindless, although not entirely, with enough mental distraction and with some physical component which both help. Maybe I’ll listen to an audiobook or something at the time too. After that, possibly a little time working out – which I can’t do straightway, since there is not enough mental distraction -  and then a shower. After that – reading, usually with a short burst of reddit between chapters.  That's ideal, as I say, not what I actually end up doing half the time.  EDIT: typos."

introvert,3bh1f9,Verivus,2,Mon Jun 29 10:33:49 2015 UTC,"Signs that I feel drained :  Not being able to follow conversations as well, and thinking to myself more than talking. I normally just want to leave without saying goodbye to anyone if I feel to drained too.  My favortie thing to do after I've been hanging out with a bunch of people is to get home,  put on a rain sounds video coupled with a Brain Eno album (Ambient music) and I just lie on my bed and relax / semi-meditate. You'll be surprised how quickly your mood lifts after you've listened to music that is literally designed to relax you :)     Even though it's not productive, it really feels like I gain stuff from doing this - where as when I watch stuff I do feel like it's a bit of a waste of time.  Other than that I just browse the internet, play games or make music, anything I enjoy."

introvert,3bfx8q,beyondtheridge,2,Sun Jun 28 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"Being alone in public is an interesting kind of solitude. I don't really find it as fulfilling, though.  I studied abroad in Europe, similar to OP, but for a shorter time. It was draining, but I combated it by going for strolls as you suggested, in addition to wearing headphones when I didn't want anyone to talk to me. Doing something as simple as going to a park early in the morning can buy you some solid time alone."
introvert,3bfx8q,dadfigure,3,Sun Jun 28 23:44:59 2015 UTC,"Depending on how your schedule looks you could try breaking up your sleep in ""rounds"" - have a few hours for yourself at night/morning and get some rest during the day.   Check the bus-table for any rides outside the city-core. I find it quite peaceful to sit in a less crowded bus and just look out the window.  Pen and paper. In all the buzz writing down thoughts might clear your head a little.   Parks. Libraries. Headphones (with/out music!) + earplugs). Sunglasses. Whisky.   Good luck and enjoy Italy, take some time exploring it by your own!"
introvert,3bfx8q,Aehan,2,Mon Jun 29 02:54:53 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what that's like. I studied abroad in Italy for three months and shared a room with one other girl and another roommate who were also very chatty. I used to take long walks to get out of the house and recharge.   The walks ended up being the best thing for me, not only because I was able to find really amazing hidden gems, but I also discovered lots of the city outside of the touristy areas that locals tended to hang out in. That helped me reset myself and be around other people again. Otherwise I often used headphones when she was in the room with me. It wasn't as effective, but it helped when I didn't want to be social and not be rude about it.  In the end I just couldn't handle sharing so much space and I ended up completely ignoring my roommates towards the end of the trip, but I very much regretted it one I got home. So don't make the same mistake I did!  You can also set up a temporary space in a common area, like the kitchen or if you have a living room."
introvert,3bfx8q,lipchaps,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:37:55 2015 UTC,"Hey OP. I know your pain (sort of) I just got back from a month long trip in Europe where I mostly stayed with AirBnB hosts. As you can imagine, this was pretty exhausting since people who host travelers do it for the social aspect (most of the time) and I didn't want to be rude since I was a guest in their homes.  Anyway, I loved Italy but found that it was super crowded and hot. One of my favorite things to do was to find a church (there are ton of them and going inside is free). Even though I'm not religious, they're beautiful inside, nice and cool, and generally quiet. If there's not a service happening, you can just sit down and read or draw or write or whatever. Churches became a quiet alone-time sanctuary for me.   Going for walks in the early morning on your own also sounds really nice. I utilize morning time to be alone even at home since I live with room mates but none of them are early risers.  Otherwise if you want to stay home, like most other people here suggested: headphones are pure gold.   Good luck and enjoy! Eat some gelato for me!"
introvert,3bfx8q,Kitchenjunkie,0,Tue Jun 30 17:09:00 2015 UTC,I had this problem when I went to school in the Philippines. Filipinos are really loud. So big headphones helped a lot. And you might consider studying outside or in a library if you have the option. A tactic I also used was reading out loud. If people can talk loud so can you. I did this to annoy other people also it helped me with reading comprehension.

They're the type to have a laugh and joke around constantly and if you're not taking part, they'll openly assume there's something wrong with you.  My desk is situated in the middle of the office so people walking through walk right next to me and have a glance at what's on my monitors (so no privacy whatsoever). Because of this, people in the office (13 of us in total) having a natter tend to do it while stood by my desk which makes it even noisier - infuriating when you're on the phone especially.  After nearly 3 years in this job, I can have 'serious' chats about TV/video games/football but this week, one of them tried to put me off by putting his motorcycle helmet on me while I was on the phone in the middle of a difficult call (with everyone else in the office having a chuckle at my expense). I don't take part in the joking around and talking bollocks anyway but this was a step too far - I didn't know how to handle it and just scowled, my body just shrinking away.

introvert,3bb8wp,Siddak90,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:43:35 2015 UTC,"I think everyone has one of ""those"" days, introvert or not. For me the hard part was when a boss would come in to talk to me about ""my work experience"" if I been having a string of days where I wasn't really chit-chatting. It would be in that situation where I would explain what was going on, that I preferred to work alone - and I wouldn't appreciate those who called me ""moody"" as that never helps (gossips always gets around) - and me being bad at confronting problems would just let the comments sit. My boss then actually defended my behavior and he made me and the other person who was making those comments sit down to talk in his office.   His approach was extremely personal, which I enjoyed highly and value. We were able to reach a compromise by talking about our feelings, now I know that for some (especially here on this sub) talking about more personal things is even harder than chit-chat - but when it is in that protective environment, I had little difficulty.   Will every boss care as much as mine? Probably not, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that in the work place environment, if you don't make friends with everyone, it might be more important to make ONE good friend as public appearances are important for an overall healthy work place."

Mind you, I've spent the majority of my life in extroverted settings with extroverted obligations (I used to manage a lot of clients and employees) .    Alas, all of that interaction brought me to the point where I am now. Speaking is one of my least favorite things to do. I don't like expelling energy expressing meaningless things and I feel I've heard just about everything a human being can say.  It goes much deeper than that, but this will suffice. Unfortunately, this has also been my bane since it's been challenging trying  to work and earn money.  The only time I go out, is if there's something specific I need to get done. I go, take care of the business as efficiently as possible, then I'm on my way back to headquarters. I avoid any opportunity to interact with people beyond a genuine smile. And even those smiles I reserve for special occasions.  Of course, if our meeting was unavoidable, you would never be able to tell I was introverted at all.

My husband and I usually just go for maybe 1-2hrs each time but we took his sister who had never been there, so we ended up staying 6hours there. It was hell.

(I am also dreadful on the phone-- I don't like knowing that the person on the other end could be ANYONE and I don't have a good enough gauge on their expectations for the conversation.) That being said, I don't enjoy talking just to talk. I recently started a new job in an office environment and I've noticed that I talk less than my colleagues, but many people seem to say something obvious just to feel like they are contributing to the conversation.

introvert,3b9h6z,dadfigure,10,Sat Jun 27 03:32:28 2015 UTC,"I think socializing with people you don't know well demands a certain amount of guises when it calls for them (feigned apathy, exaggeration, drama, etc.). The problem is that when you're introverted, all of these are really exhausting to fake, and I find myself faking them a lot because I feel that I need to express emotions I don't have/feel strongly in order to show someone that I'm listening to them and that they can confide in me. I don't know if other people do this. This is just what I find myself doing a lot.  Do it enough and you start to notice that a lot of people don't do it for you, and it makes you bitter. But I guess it's kind of selfish. It's this demanding social reciprocity that's sort of uncalled for. Do any of you find yourselves expressing emotions in an exaggerated/toned down way?"
introvert,3b9h6z,shatmepanties,5,Sat Jun 27 03:58:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that exaggerating expressions of emotion can become draining after a brief time. It is probably expected a bit more than I'd like in general conversation. I guess I tend to show polite disinterest - acknowledge that a person has spoken to me while I try to appear friendly but not particularly interested in hearing more. Most people pick up on this pretty quickly and understand that I don't want to talk too much of the time. They still seem receptive when I am interested in talking a bit, so hopefully that means I don't come across as a complete asshole, lol. It helps that I mostly run into these situations at work, and I can just look busy (which I usually am) so I (hopefully) don't seem rude."
introvert,3b9h6z,MinervasOwl,2,Sat Jun 27 04:38:18 2015 UTC,"That's so interesting. I feel this way often, and always wondered if other people did too. I find myself presenting exaggerated (for me, at least) reactions and emotions during conversations with people I don't know that well—it's my way of trying to bond with them and, I suppose, mimicking the personalities of people I know who are really good at connecting with other people, especially right off the bat. It's also, I admit, sort of a panic reaction to be uncomfortable (just smile and laugh and agree, they won't know you're uncomfortable!). But, it's not the real me, and I know deep down that I'd be much better at... people if I stopped doing it. But I can't seem to, unless I have some sort of stronger emotion going on in my brain that distracts me; I might be the only person in the world better at meeting people when I'm in a bad mood :)"

We humans are complex beings. Like Jung said, nobody is a pure introvert or a pure extrovert. Such a man would be in an asylum. I am a quiet person and an introspective thinker. I gain energy from solitude, and expend it through social interaction. However, that does not mean I am not extroverted from time to time."
introvert,3b40lj,beatlejuicex,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:19:55 2015 UTC,"Very true. I don't think of it solely as an extreme difference. We all have shades of both.

Still agree with you, though."

We have to call it something, so people can understand and (hopefully) accommodate a different type of personality.   A few weeks ago somebody replied to a comment I made in /r/rant. Amidst various assertions about me as a person and how big of an asshole I must be, this person complained that extroverts are oppressed in today's world. That us quiet thinkers are given everything because we can control our emotions. I couldn't believe someone would think that. I've been denied jobs and passed over for promotions because I'm too introspective. Companies today want the bright, radiant, emphatic people. They don't want the quiet, brooding, often pessimistic (though I prefer the term ""realist"") introverts. It's even a problem in America's military, or so I've been told. They want the extroverts, even if an introvert might make a better leader.   My point in all this rambling is that you're right. We have to have some distinction, if for no other reason than to make people aware that two main different personality types exist. Both operate in different ways, and the introvert's methods are generally foreign and even offensive to extroverted people. Not that one is better than the other, but we think, feel, and live in totally different ways."

I heartily agree with that assessment of myself.   I like this concept because I'm pretty significantly introverted, but I'm really not at all shy or socially awkward and in certain settings I'm not even all that quiet. I can be confident and outgoing and even sometimes rambunctious, but I'm also very analytical and introspective and at the end of the day I just want to curl up and be alone for a bit. I think it's useful to make these distinctions to make it clear how much variability there is between introverts, and show that introverts are perfectly capable of taking on leadership roles and public speaking roles and being in management and things like that."

introvert,3b58n8,Coral_Sea_Dolphin,2,Fri Jun 26 13:47:03 2015 UTC,"Depending exactly what it is about crowds that you dislike, it might be OK. I remember working in a nightclub for a year. I find other people's music, and overheard conversations, intrusive (as in, they stop me thinking about anything other than the words I'm hearing, and I often take a strong dislike to the sound of the song or the voice). So in that respect it wasn't great. Irritating earworms would last all through my days off, too. It was much easier than a year of continuous parties would be, though, since as an employee you don't actually have to talk to anyone, beyond perhaps saying ""would you like ice"" and so forth. The main thing I hate is the effort of proper conversation. I struggle to understand people quickly, and struggle to come up with good replies quickly, and if I get past both of those problems, I struggle to care about what they're saying. Scripted conversation that's the same every day is pretty easy."
introvert,3b58n8,Wurstgeist,2,Fri Jun 26 12:15:07 2015 UTC,"You're definitely an introvert. I work around people all day and when I come home I usually lock my bedroom door so I can just be by myself.  I think about going out a lot, and usually tag along with whoever but in reality its not that great.   I hate to sound rude, but you sort of have to come out of your shell sometimes to make it in this world and its not a great feeling either."
introvert,3b3f55,demafrost,24,Thu Jun 25 17:27:13 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite. I've stopped feeling guilty for not liking big parties, and started being more aware of my energy levels in social situations, which actually helps me to get out more than before.   Like in your example, I'd let my friend know that I reserved the right to cut out early. Go hang out, but if the crawl gets too big or too long I would go home."

introvert,3b3f55,SlipShodBovine,14,Thu Jun 25 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"One of the big misunderstood things about  being an introvert is that your allowed to like being around people. There are times and certain groups that I absolutely love being around, that I light up around. That doesn't mean that at the end of the day I don't need time by myself. Honestly no one is 100% introvert or extrovert. If you think the label is changing you negatively then drop the label. It's all a sliding scale anyway. It's helpful to me to have language to explain how I feel to my extroverted husband and how to understand what I need at certain times."
introvert,3b3f55,qrook,8,Thu Jun 25 18:03:41 2015 UTC,"No. It's helped me socialize more strategically. I have pushed myself so hard to be an extrovert in the past and the result has always been the same: me being burnt out, frustrated, annoyed, and exhausted.   Now I know I have to be judicious with how I spend my social time and making sure I have alone time, because i really need it.  I just can't be a social butterfly all the time."
introvert,3b3f55,fisheye32,3,Thu Jun 25 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"No,  not at all.  It helps me figure out a little more how to save and expend energy, and gives me a little more insight into how and why I'm developing relationships and friendships."
introvert,3b3f55,madcowbomber,4,Thu Jun 25 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"I've felt something similar in this sub. A lot of people here are like ""social interaction? No plz"", but for me social interaction is a necessity for life, I'll need it or I'll go crazy. But, because I'm introverted, I need it less than other people, and I need to recharge, and I only enjoy being with certain people. So don't let the painted concept of introversion limit you (maybe there's more than one type or degree of introversion). Do what you feel you want to do, and not what an introvert would do."

Eventually it'll become mandatory for getting a job. It is technically possible to ""fail"" a personality test if the place you're applying to doesn't have a ""fit"" for where you score on the various scales.  Time magazine last week had a whole front-page cover story about the increasing reliance that companies place on personality tests as preliminary qualifiers before the interview. It's part of this whole fixation with quantifying metrics and ""big data"" that companies have in this day and age. Ironically, the people who designed the tests are hardcore, Moneyball-type stats nerds who tend to reduce everything to quantifying metrics and don't really even seem to know how to integrate the ""people"" part of this into the equation.  In the long run it's just going to be another way that companies can avoid hiring people and then complain that they can't find anyone qualified enough to fill available jobs. Then politicians will try and come up with ""solutions,"" yell back and forth at each other, make empty promises to constituents that they're going to something about jobs, and... the whole hiring situation still remains status quo."

I'm getting more reclusive since I graduated college and my mother constantly nitpicks to try and get me to go out.  I don't really have a problem being people-averse, though. I just see it as who I am and brush off people because they're mostly assholes anyway. I don't see friends or companionship as a requirement akin to water and food. The only problems it creates are when people (mostly family members) try to make me ""come out of my shell"" and be more outgoing.  I think by the time I'm 30 I'll be a full-blown hikikomori."

I have definitely grown more introverted over the past 3 years; which is around the same time I got my first real job. I work with people all day long and just dont have the energy to do anything after work, I feel like I'm robbing myself of my free time.  As far as planning for things in the future I am the same way, gotta cut out time to be alone. If I'm doing something Saturday then I sure as hell am not doing anything on Sunday."

I avoid things all the time, sometimes saying to myself ""Yeah it's fine, I'm an introvert"" but really I know it's just an excuse because I over-think about going out too much).   I also do use being an introvert as an excuse to not be social. Sometimes when I'm feeling a bit anxious when with people or don't fancy talking I just tell myself ""yeah, it's fine. It's built in to me, I can't help it"" when really I should at least make an effort.   On the other hand though I don't mind going out because I know I can just leave whenever.

introvert,3b3kyr,demafrost,4,Thu Jun 25 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"Introverts get exhausted by social interaction and need solitude to recharge.     Extroverts get anxious when left alone and get energy from social interaction.   That’s it. There’s nothing about shyness, being a homebody, or how adventurous you are. Both types can be social, both can creative, both can be leaders, and so on.   THANK YOU JESUS LORD. I'm so tired of people thinking that introverted = shy and socially awkward!"
introvert,3b3kyr,zenlittleplatypus,-2,Thu Jun 25 18:15:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced introversion is all that different from social anxiety.  Mental energy (or ""psychic energy"") is a Jungian concept, as is introversion itself. I'm a bit worried that it might be bullshit, though. Do introverts literally, physiologically get tired as a result of social interaction, and if so why would that be - are they metabolising at an unusual rate? Because of runaway thoughts, or a flight-or-fight reaction? Because of, say, anxiety?  Alternatively, is ""exhaustion"" a metaphor here? (And if not, WTF does ""get energy"" mean, when it comes to extroverts gaining energy from socializing - are they eating the people they talk to?) If it's a metaphor, it represents some unpleasant psychological state. So that seems to be the same as saying that introverts don't like socialising. So, social discomfort, let's say, if not actual social anxiety."
introvert,3b3kyr,Wurstgeist,2,Thu Jun 25 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"I've had the same thoughts, and personally after years of research, believe that you are on to something and this is probably true for a lot of people. Not sure why you are being downvoted. It may be easier for some people to blame introversion or a sensitive nervous system for what is, in actuality, shyness, but it doesn't make sense to me why some people would become more tired socializing than others, unless they are thinking deeply about the interaction, feel insecure and anxious or are sensitive and pick up on social curs and assign them wrongly. It seems a true introvert could be in social environments for long periods of time but just not talk much and be ok with that. Also, a true introvert may not care about people as much and be more interested in their own internal thoughts and dialogue. That's why extraverts might gain energy- they simply feel good when connecting to others and are bored with their thought at times. An introvert likes their internal world. For some reason it seems ok for me to say this, since I am, and have been, the anxious type for many years. Perhaps even a shy extravert, which is not fun."
introvert,3b3kyr,innocencelost44,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:33:39 2015 UTC,"I have anxiety, but it's not social anxiety. Panic attacks and social interaction both make me tired, but the aftermath of each doesn't feel the same to me at all.  I actually feel like I just get overstimulated by my environment very easily, and other people, as part of my environment, are responsible for some of that. When I'm around a bunch of people for too long it feels like I get overwhelmed and my brain shuts off, and it doesn't turn back on again until I've had a lot of time to regroup. But too much loud music, obnoxious TV, or noise in general can have the same effect on me even if I'm not socializing with anyone.   Neither anxiety nor social interaction make me feel tired in exactly the same way that strenuous exercise or lack of sleep or a blood sugar crash/spike do, but to me they do mesh well with the ""exhaustion"" and ""energy"" terminology."
introvert,3b3kyr,resting-orgasm-face,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:22:21 2015 UTC,"OK, that ties in with what somebody said in another thread about this same article. Sure, being overwhelmed is different from being anxious.  I theorise (seems obvious) that traits cluster. Stereotypes might not be accurate: like the article says, to paraphrase, introverts might be just as foolish, unimaginative, stupid and crass as anyone else. The same goes for being anxious, shy, or an asshole, but even so I'd expect the stereotypes to be partly true and for these things to go together to some extent, because it seems easy to go from fearing people to resenting them to hating them, or for social anxiety and the ""overwhelmed"" feeling you mention to feed into each other, or for feeling overwhelmed to lead to resentment, and all sorts of other combinations of traits if any of them can feasibly reinforce the others.  The thing about everybody's personality type being as good as every other type is a bit convenient, too. It might not be my fault that I have my personality (for example), and it might not be a good idea for me to try to change it, and it might not be anything I should apologise for: even so, that doesn't make it as good (even for me) as some other personality might theoretically be."

As a psych student I would like to say that social anxiety usually develops from some major past stressors and perpetuates itself through conditioning (""home"" feels good, so you don't leave, etc.) i would suggest to visit a therapist if that is financially possible. It's important to work thru your stressors that is causing the anxiety and they can guide you through ways to lose your fear of social situations. It's hard by your self. At least look up CBT therapies. Ok good luck"

I have been seeing a therapist for under a year now and it's a very slow process, an hour a week. Maybe I should steer my sessions towards figuring out what is causing so much anxiety.

I know this game, same for me but I also go red which makes it even worse. I've found the best way to deal with these situations is to wait until it passes. Just wait. You may be suprised how quick it passes once you have decided to wait. During the waiting you should not be thinking about how you messed up or about how to get out of the situation. You should just wait. (maybe observe the people around you).  After you recover just try again. Everytime it happens just wait. Doing this lead to great improvement for me (although took some time). Now I don't even worry about those occasions, and they happen far less.  Good luck!"

The only thing, is that in these moments where I feel my anxiety creeping in, my immediate reaction is to try to push it away which makes it worse and then the battle against myself begins. No wonder why my mind goes blank. Also, I am a little shocked at hearing myself speak sometimes, because my inner critic  is watching my every mood. So I guess taking the time to wait it out, will allow the anxiety to come up and pass, without getting caught in its trap. Just being mindful of the tip will take some work, but i think it can be really helpful.  Thanks so much!"

As a bonus, cellphones and especially smartphones also take up the attention of their owners near you who might otherwise want to interact. Finally, modern phones mean that people who really want to send you a message can leave you voicemail or a text instead of physically tracking you down and blathering at you, then expecting instant, animated, and engaged replies.

Whenever I'm visiting him or vice versa I just know I'll be there for the rest of the afternoon or evening and I plan accordingly. I don't see it as a negative thing.

I used to work in various local restaurants and fast-food, and everytime, considering the fact that i'm both not very talkative (it depends on my mood actually) and not very made for this kind of job, I felt like the useless guy in the room.  You did good talking about this with your managers, don't hesitate to ask for explanation, nobody will reproach you that. And by the way, are you the only one to have seen his hours reduced that way ? Maybe you're not the only one in that case. My point here is it is important to make sure that there is no other reason that would provoke that.  Anyways, don't take any decision about your job too quickly, there is always ups and downs at the workplace, I hope for you your situation will get better with time."

introvert,3awacn,Be-Bop-Brew,0,Wed Jun 24 14:59:08 2015 UTC,"I have found reading in public at very therapeutic. I have always found it a little odd that as an introvert I actually enjoy the challenge of being on stage and performing. Every now and then I attend open mic nights and try out a few poems or a character I have in my head. I feel that it is giving that side of me a safe space to go and play, although I have no idea why I think it's safe.   I'd be interested to know why you got into weightlifting, wondering if you did it (mostly) solo? I find the weightlifting section of any gym really intimidating, that thing your supposed to do looking in the mirror (which I guess is to watch your form), all that testosterone, the loud noises of weights hitting the floor all of which to me just makes me want to hide in a corner until it all goes away.  You'd think that even as a bi-sexual man this side of the gym would be like a playground to me, this again is not the case, not into muscle bound guys (or girls for that matter). Plus when I go to the gym I go to do my thing and zone everyone else out, never go to pick up. I even go to clubs mostly to dance and let loose and very rarely pick up but do sometimes talk to randoms which can be fun."

introvert,3awacn,Arggghhhhhhh,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:31:05 2015 UTC,I totally agree... I completely lost my fear of public speaking when I worked as a sound guy and got to teach some very very public people how to get used to microphones and speaking clearly without having to be self conscious about it in front of crowds thru a PA without myself having done it a lot either.   I had never realized somebody famous could be uncomfortable with such a thing and suddenly all my reasons to be were gone entirely.  Being introverted in that regard only means I'd rather not do it without having something actually useful to say and actually wanting to say it.   Instead of learning how to pretend I do.

introvert,3av5m2,Vuh_ness_auhh,3,Tue Jun 23 19:56:38 2015 UTC,Went to Bonnaroo a couple of weeks ago for 6 days. Never had a moment alone other than the bathroom. It wasn't too bad.  Remember that everyone is going to be enjoying the music and drugs.   If you don't want to talk you can always says you're just having a really good time/tripping really hard. That's what I did when people were worried I wasn't having fun or wondering why I was so quiet.   Don't be scared to just go chill on your own for a minute.   The best part of festivals is that nobody is too concerned about what anyone else is doing so you can kind of phase people out after a while.   Watch how others are interacting and try to ride their same wavelength if you want to try to converse/interact.

introvert,3av5m2,business_time_,2,Tue Jun 23 23:20:13 2015 UTC,"Having been to many, many festivals, I just suggest being mindful of your social fuel tank and take the time to recharge before you burn out. My favorite events have lots of little nooks and crannies to sneak away to, but even at those that are basically just a big open field, you can usually find some space to sit and relax around the edges. Also, I have the worst time when my friends try to do everything as a group; don't be afraid to say, ""I think I'll wander around by myself for a while. I'll meet up with you guys later."""
introvert,3av5m2,stopitbrrruce,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"Get plenty of sleep before (hopefully you are doing that now). Don't be afraid to take some time away from the crowd and chill and sit somewhere. Even if it's on the pavement or grass. It will give you valuable time to recharge your batteries a little bit. I LOVE festivals, but being around so many people for long amounts of time can wear me out. Your goal though is to make it through so you can watch your favorite bands and have fun with friends. So listen to your body and your head and take breaks when you need to. And if you ever find yourself amongst a  part of the crowd that you don't vibe with for whatever reason, explore and find another. I have had great experiences farther back than in the front sometimes.   Oh and eat! And drink water! Avoiding dehydration and hunger pains will take you a long way from depressed (or grumpy) town as well. Have fun!"

When I speak, I do not sound intelligent, eloquent, or even all that literate. I have this terrible habit of dumbing myself down because I'm afraid people won't understand what I'm saying. Combine that with my naturally quiet, reserved personality, and I often appear aloof, slow, even stupid. I can tell by the way people explain things to me. At jobs I've had, people would carefully over-explain things as if speaking to a child. Things that I fully comprehend because I've been observing and contemplating them since I walked in the room.

About two years ago I talked about how different I was to most others, with a coworker and she told me she reads this book called the silent revolution ( Swedish author). Her husband is introverted and she tries to understand him better, she told me that I sound exactly like this book described. Got myself a copy on my iPad and read it. Like you said, it made sense. It's a good feeling finally knowing what you are, helps avoiding those situations where you get low, I'm actually on a trip with my ""big"" family and we only been here  for a couple days but I make sure to get alone time and people try to respect it, however ""they"" think it's a disorder even though they don't say it out loud, I don't bother trying to educate them on that anymore."

Thank you. His job is very stimulating and often on the weekends he needs to just sleep it off, lights off, maybe some tv or music, but that's it. I'm lucky enough to be able to plug in headphones most of my day at my job, and have nights to my self to quietly browse the internet, doodle, listen to music, or sleep. Even go to the diner with my best friend and discuss life if I'm so inclined. He doesn't have that luxury, so by the time the weekend comes, I'm wired and ready to hang and go out, but he needs the time to have silence because he's firing on all cylinders about 15 hours a day."

People have enough difficulty differentiating between introversion and social anxiety even in this sub, so do be careful to use terms properly (ninjaedit: unless you only meant to imply that you are actually an introverted type A personality and that for MOST people sharing traits similar to yours the experience would be more fun because they are likely to be farther toward ambi/extraversion).

introvert,3alnrq,shywanderer1,8,Sun Jun 21 12:51:30 2015 UTC,"I believe knowledge is power. You've fallen into the popular condonation that introversion is bad. It's not. It's just different from the norm. Around 30-40% of people are introverts. Extrovert tendencies are more numerous and visual so we assume it's ""normal."" Introversion is normal too.  I highly recommend the book Quiet by Susan Cain. It delves into the truth and science of introversion. Knowing why I act of feel the way I do has let me address the causes, not the symptoms. One example: introverts hate small talk, but love deeper conversation. We have trouble breaking the ice, but hold our on once the topic is ""meaningful."" You might trying going to places that facilitate that. Go to intimate pubs instead of crazy bars. Join a book club. Go to events for causes where you'll have a topic to discuss with others. Ask questions more than making statements. Other people like talking about themselves, and the more words they spew, the more things you'll be able to comment on.  Remember that your Facebook newsfeed is not real life. People only post the good things in their life. Since you have one place to hear it all about it, it seems like everyone is doing something cool all the time. They're not. You're doing something awesome by traveling the world. 9/10 of your Facebook friends would be jealous of your experiences. When you feel like you're missing out, ask yourself, ""if I could go, would I want to?"" You'll find that you would actually choose not to most of the time. How can you miss out on something you don't actually want? Art of Manliness did a article exploring this feeling.  EDIT: Now with links!"

If you are feeling a disconnect from him, he might feel it too. It's not that he tries to ramble on or repeat himself, it's that he's having trouble finding things to talk about. He might have an idea of what he wants or what he expects you to achieve (because he wants what's best for you!), but he doesn't want to make it sound like he is forcing you into a corner. So he ""implies"" things. Bringing them up in obvious ways in order to get you to open up. Example:  ""Maybe if I told him how important job stability is, he can give his input on what his goals are.""   VS   ""I better tell him how important job stability is because he's still too young to realize it.""  The underlying problem should be brought to light. Explain yourself. It'll show your point of view and prove that you're not just all talk. You've got an internship lined up and you're taking on classes in the summer. Those things show that you know what to do and that you're able to take responsibility.  If you're still in college, it's the perfect time to ""find yourself."" I know, cliche, but it's the truth. People tend to forget about this part because there's always the looming contradiction where you better decide your major, think of your future, get good grades, study hard, etc. College isn't just an advanced education opportunity. The experiences are supposed to help you grow up and learn about yourself. So I don't think you're in trouble at all- it actually sounds like you're on the right track to me!  Lastly, don't be afraid to cut phone conversations short. Classes give you more than enough reasons for being busy. You have to study, you have a paper, some project, meeting friends, study group, need sleep, homework, email, etc. Just be sure to let him know that when you have time, you'll call back. Then, and this is very important, follow through! Keep your promise and call back. I'm sure after doing this once or twice, he'll understand."

That being said, he probably doesn't have a clue of how things work in my field.

I've struggled to shake the thought of this mainly due to my fourth generational Asian-American upbringing, which feels like a fusion of Confucian and Puritanical work ethic. I have a really tough major that requires a lot of work, and makes it difficult to get involved in non-academic things. Long story short, I screwed up and now I'm 22 years old with at least 2 more semesters to go before I graduate and now I feel so behind. I keep trying to remind myself that no one is telling me I have to achieve x and y by a certain age and that kind of thinking caused me to have problems to begin with, but it still lingers. I feel like I should be perfectly capable of feeling out and thinking through how much play I should have from time to time.

I'm 24 and live at home (trying to save up to move out) so it seems like we're in a similar situation.   Believe it or not, my mom actually comes into my bedroom on days that I'm just relaxing, reading, and enjoying time to myself and sits down on my bed and goes ""honey, are you depressed?"" and then seriously tries to have a conversation with me trying to determine if I'm mentally ill because, for one whole day, I don't feel like hanging out with people. I am 10000% not depressed by the way, I'm actually generally a very happy person, so I think it's really ridiculous when she does this lol.   I've tried sending my parents articles that I've found online explaining introversion to them so that they can try to understand why I need time alone once in awhile. I found this has helped a bit but I can tell they still don't fully understand. I also recently read Susan Cain's book and plan on getting my mom to read it because I feel it explains introversion (and puts a very positive light on it) very well.   It's tough when your parents have different ideas than you but you just have to live your life in a way that will make you happy. Yes, our parents do know what's best for us 98% of the time but we reach an age where we know ourselves and what we want and we have to stay true to that or else we'll be miserable in the long run. Try to make sure you don't get too distanced from your dad, he probably just wants the best for you and when he sees that you're happy and doing well on your own terms, he should come around and be happy for you too."

Social anxiety, misanthropy, and asocial leanings are all pretty obviously connected to introversion. Yes, there are meaningful distinctions to be made (especially in the case of misanthropy), but there is a reason that these are recurring topics here. So long as they are not being conflated, why should that not be the case?"

introvert,3akgfs,quietLife1,6,Sun Jun 21 02:05:09 2015 UTC,"Does introversion automatically socially code to boring?   No.  You're an undergraduate. I hate to sound condescending, but you have all your twenties to grow as a person and experience things.  I hated parties (I like going to pubs though). I still hate massive parties.   I'm in my late twenties AND in graduate school and am still experiencing stuff and growing.   College is a great time to join a club, go on field trips, take a class for an elective that you'd never take. I have no problem going on a trip and then heading out on my own to do my own thing.  Ya you can be a boring introvert, but it has nothing to do with introversion and has everything to do with perception.  Not everyone likes the stereotypical (emphasis, because that is the stereotype for the college experience) things that people in their twenties enjoy. I like going to coffee shops and walks in the woods and cooking and running. That has to do with me as an individual."

I did that all my freshman year and that's what got me into this whole thing. As for my personal interests, besides having little time for them I can't seem to find anyone who shares them. I actually enjoy all of the things that you mentioned, plus obviously some others. I did most of my ""growing"" as a child and teenager (not me being presumptuous, that's what I've been told for many years), so that is yet another thing I don't have in common with the people by which I'm surrounded and will be for a long time.

I've met 40 year olds that still are growing. There is no end to that process. I'm starting to do things that I'm interested in because I really didn't have the resources to do that as a kid. I am going to continue that into my thirties, forties, and fifties. If I wasn't investing in the things I was interested in, if I wasn't growing and exploring who I was, I'd be stagnating."

introvert,3akgfs,UnicornPenguinCat,2,Sun Jun 21 16:08:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly this is an interpersonal issue that (and I'm not trying to insult you) can either be dealt with by 1.) going to a therapist 2.) accepting that it's going to take awhile for you to make the friends you want 3.) Realizing that these things are really not in control.  There is a reason I mentioned the growing part of it. I've lost and gained friends multiple times in my twenties, and it's annoying but I'm glad to have met the people I'm close friends with even if they are just a few.  I do attract people I don't like, I also attract people I do like, but I can't really control their actions, I can just be happy with myself and do what makes me happy.   No one makes anyone do anything except themselves."

Keep on growing. There is no silver bullet to loneliness, and it's not an introvert issue. It's an individual issue.   I'd love if I had better closer friends, but that's not reality, so I have to suck it up and make do with what I have. There is no book that I can turn to that will tell me what to do, the only thing I can do is take care of myself."

I honestly would just tell the owner what you are experiencing and ask for some extra hours of training so that when you DO fill in, you won't feel like you're completely lost. You kind of have to make the owner feel like it's going to benefit him, so sell it to him... Say like, ""I really feel like I don't know as much as I should about what we sell. Is it okay if I can get in some extra hours with the other guys until I get the hang of things? That way I can make more sales because I would be more knowledgeable about what we sell?""  If you make it sound like it will benefit him and his store I am sure he would go for it. And then you wouldn't feel like you have no idea what you're doing.  If you're still not happy there, then it's probably the job you dislike and the stress wouldn't be worth the extra $40 or so. But you never know, something might happen to the other guys that work there and they might need you full time. Doesn't hurt to ask for some help!"

It's frustrating when the label is misused as a rationalization of those character traits. Why does introversion have to be viewed negatively? People shouldn't label every type of loner or anti-social being as ""introverted."" They make it sound as if it's a stigma upon society. Unbelievable."

introvert,3ac9yn,ShockinglyAccurate,6,Sat Jun 20 06:08:00 2015 UTC,I love when people think someone's character determines their propensity to kill/commit other crimes. There's many a serial killer who were found to be charming and even 'normal'.   All this mumbo-jumbo is just so people can feel like there was an explanation besides the fact that this kid was a racist fuck and clearly mentally disturbed.   EDIT: People also like to mistake Introversion with being Antisocial when they are two different things.

Criminals, especially those involved in mass casualty incidents are always described as:   Quiet Kept to himself Didn't talk much  Liked to be alone   Admittedly, being into South African apartheid-era apparel and wanting to incite a race war is pretty strange, to say the least. But then just say that. Say that he was into these things. There's nothing wrong with being ""quiet,"" but there is certainly a problem if you're a racist piece of shit.

People keep on replying to you saying that Fox news is making it out to seem as though him being ""apparently introverted"" contributed to him murdering those people. I mean come on guys, did we read the same article and watch the same video?   For one, the video of the interview with the professional. They start off immediately by bringing up the fact that ""this was a hate motivated crime."" They continue chiming upon that fact for a while, and the only time they ever talk about his social life was when they brought up that he had ~80 friends on Facebook and such. All the professional said about that is that finding correlates to the nature of other killers, and he goes out to mention mental instability and the desire to bask in some kind of glory.   The article itself talks a little more about his quiet nature and also about other facts regarding the crime. Fox news is just reporting their findings on the suspect: they're not saying his secluded nature directly influenced his murder spree. The guy just killed a bunch of people, the public wants answers, and Fox news is capitalizing on a breaking story by putting out as many facts as they can. There's no real implication anywhere in the video or article that his being ""apparently introverted"" directly influenced his decision to murder people. They're just reporting what they find.   I think you guys are looking too far into the title. Not to mention they said he was, again, apparently introverted - in the form of an assumption, not a fact - and it's not really an unreasonble assumption if you ask me.   Welp, that's just my two cents. I'm ready for the downvotes."

introvert,3ad4a1,daypenny,11,Fri Jun 19 03:25:54 2015 UTC,"For an extrovert, being very social is energizing, it's what gives them life. So they can't understand someone who doesn't want to socialize as much. To them it is like we are not living life and missing out. And they think in order for us introverts to live life we have to be like them and socialize. I think they associate our introvert tendencies to being very shy, which is not always the case. Introverts are not shy, we just can't tolerate social interaction as much as extroverts can who feed off it. Not sure if that answered your question."
introvert,3ad4a1,sum1rand0m,3,Fri Jun 19 08:37:11 2015 UTC,"This is one of the best and concise answers I've seen to this question. One thing worth noting also is in terms of tolerating social interaction, this is due to something called social energy. This is the energy we use to socialise. Introverts get this by spending time with themselves, formulating thoughts, where as extroverts get this from being around others. The reasons for this is obviously different per person but interestingly for me personally this is because I like to almost ""practice"" social interaction with myself in my head to then use (in moderation!) in the most draining situations, which for me is group social interaction. Another thing id like to add is that some extroverts really understand introversion and sometimes even brand themselves introverts. The ENFP type for example shares the most attributes with introverts than any other extrovert personality type, which makes them far more tolerant of introverts preferences socially."

They think that you're like them: they're extroverted and they spend lots of time hanging out with other extroverts, so clearly you're extroverted too. You just need a push, like those other extroverts they know! Here's the push! Come out and do this giant group lunch with us you know you want to it'll be good for you and you'll have fun and everybody wants you to be there and you have to go anyways because everybody's expecting you and and and and...  My advice: Just be firm with them and they'll get it eventually, even if they think that you're ""just shy"" or you're anti-social. It sounds like you're very young, so let me just say: If they are really your friends, they will respect your desires and stop trying to push what they enjoy onto you. Be firm in your wishes- nobody gets to tell you what to do other than you and if they continue to try to do so, they are not really your close friends."

But they are pretty cool with me, except this. So yeah I'm sure they'll get it, i just get a bit pissed.

Tell your friends you can't handle crowds but you'd love to try something with just 3 or 4 people. Maybe a smaller group would work better for you. You're going to have to be firm about the size limit because extroverts think if 3 or 4 is ok, then 15 is even better.  For me, the bigger the crowd the more I shut down and build a shell around me. So I'm essentially alone in a very busy, noisy environment. Why would I want to do that when I can stay home and have peace and quiet?"

introvert,3a8rnm,micmea1,4,Thu Jun 18 03:13:31 2015 UTC,"Your friends want you involved with their activities because you're part of their friend group. Part of being a friend is sometimes doing something that is not your favorite option for that day. Sure, they shouldn't expect you to go out of your way to hang out every time they ask, and they will ask every time, but there are times where you should indulge them. Who knows, you might have fun. If not, you'll always wind up back home eventually.   The trick is to understand that just as you can't put yourself into their shoes, they can't put themselves into yours. Try to be understanding because they have feelings and frustrations of their own."
introvert,3a8rnm,hobo112,5,Thu Jun 18 16:43:42 2015 UTC,"My humble opinion: I understand exactly what you mean. But, I'd encourage you to not always push them away. Especially while you're young, socializing and making new friends is a good thing. As long as you like the activity itself, that is. Yeah, it can be exhausting after awhile, and you probably wouldn't want to do it as often as others. But you can always show up for a short while and enjoy your downtime later. Always avoiding these activities can and probably will lead to loneliness later, trust me."

Unfortunately, they're not social enough to respect your wishes (although part of that is not recognizing them as such), and are unlikely to be until they mature enough to know that people are different.  You could try showing them (individually) articles on extroverts, and saying ""Hey, this sounds like you!"" Hopefully that'd get the point across that not everyone is like them.  Showing them articles on introversion won't help; they'll assume it is talking about a medical condition affecting maybe one person in a million, and even if you convince them that you're one, they won't know how to respond to someone who 'has that thing', and may even redouble their efforts, assuming that this 'problem' can be partied out of you."

If you've told them to stop pestering you and they keep doing it anyway, then that's another thing. They aren't respecting you and your decisions, and if they aren't doing that, I'd hesitate to call them friends."

It's meant well but they simply don't understand or believe that you know happiness without a lot of social interaction. They feel that they know something about life that you don't and their encouragement will help you in some way. Meanwhile to us, as introverts, we sometimes feel the same way about them.

I am a huge introvert, and for the past week or so my fiance's family has been in town and we've been saying yes to way too much in terms of social stuff to the point we're both feeling incredibly drained and are talking about learning to set boundaries with our time because while we always have fun when we go out with them, we're both having a hard time because we haven't had time to recharge.   Friends will respect boundaries you set. If they don't, then they aren't friends. It's tough as a teenager, because a lot of your peers will think there's something wrong with you, that you're shy or socially anxious, but there isn't. You are an introvert. That's not a bad thing. I don't know your friends, so I can't tell you their motivations, but it's possible they just don't understand that you are not an extrovert like them.   Try not getting angry, but extend your empathy and compassion out to them. Try to understand their point of view- look at it from their perspective. Exercising empathy has helped me not be so reactive, and it has made me a better person. Set your boundaries, but extend empathy and compassion toward them. Extend it toward everyone. Introverts have a unique advantage in that we generally find it easier to do this because we live so much more in our own heads. Why do you get so riled up about it? Why are you experiencing such upset about it? Try to understand your emotions about it, don't judge your emotion, just try to understand why you are feeling what you are feeling. When you understand why it upsets you, tell your friends why. If it's because you feel like they aren't respecting your boundaries, or if it's because you feel like they aren't listening to you, or if it's because you feel like they don't really know you, tell them kindly. ""I feel upset when you continue to ask me about going to [event] because it makes me feel like [you aren't listening to me/aren't respecting my answer/aren't respecting my boundary/you want me to show interest in your stuff but you don't show interest in my stuff/ etc]""   If you need anyone to talk to, feel free to pm me. I know it's really tough as an introvert as a teenager with a peer group that is extroverted. My whole family growing up was very extroverted and it was very hard feeling like no one understood. It gets better when you find a group of people who share your introversion, be it online or offline, and it gets even better when you are on your own and are able to dictate your life. Stay strong- Smooth seas never made skillful sailors. You have an opportunity to learn from this."

While you may feel comfortable with it now, you may start to feel differently later in life.  Just something to keep in mind.  However, I do feel that it's important to point out that there's nothing inherently ""wrong"" with being shy or experiencing social anxiety.    I was (and mostly still am) in a very similar situation.  I was very comfortable being alone 90% of the time, and in retrospect, that's because I was avoiding potential social anxiety.  Once I moved to an entirely different city with almost zero daily social interaction (I'm a software developer that works from home a lot), it started to wear on me quite a bit, and has driven me to do something about my personal social anxieties that I thought I would have grown out of by now (I'm 28).  Overall, I think it's only a negative if you feel like it is.  But don't shut out social skill development.  Introvert or not, it's important."
introvert,3a65e7,paleblued0t,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"I have tried working on my social skills, anxiety or not. I'm at least told that I'm a good listener and can keep up a conversation fairly well. However, I know for a fact that if it wasn't for me having to go to uni I'd have nothing besides a job or shopping to compel me to leave the house, and I'd quickly lose those social skills.  Right now I just feel like it isn't worth trying to overcome my social anxiety just for the sake of doing something I don't enjoy in the first place. I feel like I'm not doing anything wrong by being antisocial. However, you're right that it may very well change in the future and make a good point."
introvert,3a65e7,RandyHoward,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"just for the sake of doing something I don't enjoy in the first place   So do something you actually enjoy. Don't go out for the social aspect, go out and do things you like to do. If you like art, go to a museum. Like music, go to concerts. Etc. There are people everywhere, all it takes is a simple hello to start socializing. If you're already doing something you enjoy then you instantly have something in common to talk about."
introvert,3a65e7,xTur,5,Thu Jun 18 11:25:14 2015 UTC,"The problem with asking personal questions like these online is that the answer will be very different depending on who you're asking. I'm personally completely content with spending weeks and months only having minor social interactions. There is nothing like coming home to an empty house and just do nothing for a while. Other people (most people?) will say the opposite. Coming home to an empty house could be the worst to them.  I'm 22 now but I felt much like you do now, at first. Am I not supposed to be depressed and sad by this? Why do I enjoy this so much? What's wrong with me?  It's just a personal thing. Some people will always associate aloneness with loneliness. That's just what most of the world is like I'm afraid. I'd say it's important for you to find out if you're only content with being alone because it's an escape from your social anxiety, or if that's who you really are and what you enjoy."
introvert,3a65e7,tehzephyrsong,2,Wed Jun 17 18:29:03 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I feel like I'm both introverted and socially anxious at the same time. What really annoys me is when people tell me I'm not trying hard enough to fit in, and that my reaction to socialising is just out of stubbornness. It really isn't.  I don't know, the consensus seems to be that I need to socialise, introvert or not. I hate it, but I might come to like it if I kept trying, maybe."
introvert,3a65e7,kirbac,6,Wed Jun 17 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"You should really accept the occasional invitation to go do something with the friends you have, or you're not likely to have them much longer. Eventually, they will just stop inviting you out because they know you'll never say yes. They're inviting you because they want to spend time with you in particular, and just as seeing the disappointment on your friends' faces stings for you, constantly being turned down hurts their feelings, too. I'm sure some of your friends have started to wonder if maybe you don't like them anymore, since you never seem to want to be around them."
introvert,3a65e7,biohazard930,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:18:38 2015 UTC,"I try and make it clear that when I say no, it's not because I dislike them, but because I want to avoid socialising. They've known me long enough to expect that answer from me but they still keep asking.  I used to accept the occasional invitation, but... I dunno, it just felt like a total waste of time. I'd go see a movie with them or have dinner or whatever, and I'd just want it to end all the time. Then, when it finally does end, I feel like I wasted a night. I can't bring myself to fit in.  I think I will try and be more sociable though, based on the general consensus."
introvert,3a65e7,kirbac,5,Wed Jun 17 19:55:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely try to break out of your comfort zone and learn to be more sociable. But definitely go at your own pace. You don't want to get so overwhelmed that you'll crawl back into your shell.  Being able to form connections with people is very important. It's good for your well being and it helps with networking and finding resources. Being able to make friends is nothing but beneficial.  There will always be emotional pain and mental draining along the way, but it's well worth it when you find what works for you.  Your social anxiety does not need to define you"
introvert,3a65e7,biohazard930,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:24:33 2015 UTC,"What makes keeping up with friends ""worth it,"" as you say? Is it just for the access to resources you mentioned earlier?"
introvert,3a65e7,kirbac,2,Wed Jun 17 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"Not just the resources. Spending time with them is great when you have the energy. Sharing your life with your friends is an amazing feeling. Sharing stories, celebrating each other's accomplishments, being part of a support system and having a support system, etc. :)"
introvert,3a65e7,biohazard930,3,Wed Jun 17 17:25:25 2015 UTC,"Do you think it's possible for some individuals to not find the same degree of value from friendships as you imply? Can some people be happy without camaraderie? That seems to be what OP is implying. If so, what other reasons make the effort of maintaining friendships ""worth it?"""
introvert,3a65e7,kirbac,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:28:55 2015 UTC,If you have good friends you'll have good experiences. Only bad friendships give unrewarding experiences. Have you ever had friends before?

However, I can relate to OP in that he seems to be happy without much socialization and camaraderie. In this case, I feel that it's not just ""bad friendships"" that are unrewarding. Instead, the issue seems to be that most socialization itself is unrewarding. Do you think it's possible for an individual to view the maintenance required for friendship to often outweigh even the benefits from ""good friendships?"" I think that is possible, and I think that may be the crux of the matter here.    The question then, is whether it's okay to be this way if one is happy? Thus, like OP stated, ""how important is social interaction"" [if I'm perfectly happy without it]? Can one do without it and live a rewarding or fulfilling life?"
introvert,3a65e7,kirbac,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:50:03 2015 UTC,Do you think you would enjoy living your entire life without ever interacting with someone else?

introvert,3a65e7,DigitalDiatribes,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:14:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think a person needs to interact socially on a daily basis if they do not choose to. However, the claim you make to avoid social interaction altogether while still being able to be happy seems too unrealistic. Yeah, introverts like to be alone (social anxiety sufferers even more so) but regardless of that, we are all humans, and humans are social animals. We flourish through the connections we make.   If you choose to avoid human nature and not socialize or make friends, and you're happy with that, then go for it. I just know that solitary confinement never has good results."
introvert,3a65e7,DigitalDiatribes,2,Wed Jun 17 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to pitch in and say that for now, I feel like I'm perfectly content without socialising, and /u/bioharzard930 makes a really good point about it.  I think friends are certainly important, but I don't necessarily view them as people I need to physically be with often. I communicate with my close friends practically everyday via WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype, etc. What I'm worried about is if I eventually lose contact with them due to my reluctance to accept meeting up with them.  It seems a lot of people are saying that I absolutely need to socialise, at least a little. I think I'll try and make more of an effort, and see how far I go."
introvert,3a65e7,cerement,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:35:13 2015 UTC,"Notice that no one mentioned total social isolation. I just responded that I don't think I could live without any social interaction. Part of that is due to the structure of our society and part due to my own (seemingly minimal) needs. OP mentioned frequent online interaction.    The idea that I wanted to question was why so many think that one needs a deep pool of friends from which to draw fulfillment. I also see that very statement, ""humans are social animals,"" often. While true, I think that statement is too often used as ""evidence"" as to why individuals should pursue that deep pool of friends I mentioned. While it may be true for some, I think it's a farce to apply the idea as a blanket or default statement. Some flourish through many social connections, and some do not. I have trouble understanding this as a rare or unhealthy position.     Musing: Perhaps the reason I hear such blanketed and absolute advice so often is simply because the ones who would be more likely to offer it are the ones who pursue that interaction in the first place. And perhaps also it's because some may have trouble identifying with the others' position."
introvert,3a65e7,Deejer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:37:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can agree 100% that I can't just cut out all connections I have with people. They are definitely important.  This is what I wanted to hear, really. I posted this on multiple subreddits, including /r/socialanxiety, and on here, and I wanted to see if the results were consistent, which they are. I'll definitely consider trying harder at being sociable then."
introvert,3a65e7,balswing,6,Wed Jun 17 18:16:34 2015 UTC,"Introversion is one thing, social anxiety another thing entirely. The fact that you are already able to successfully differentiate between the two is a good thing, but it is important to note that they are considered two separate things for a reason. One is a widely accepted personality trait, yes, but the other is most definitely a problem.  That isn't to say your preference for online interaction over face-to-face contact is something to be ashamed of. Some people are like that, and that's ok. But considering the world you live in is quite literally overflowing with people, I think you should probably consider addressing the fear you seem to have with the idea of bumping into one who recognizes you every now and again.  tl:dr: it's ok to prefer online contact over face-to-face contact. It's not so good to be flat out afraid of face-to-face contact."
introvert,3a65e7,machaham,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"Right. Yeah, my social anxiety is definitely annoying. I get nervous buying something from the store, let alone talking with friends or even meeting new people. I think that at the very least I'll try and overcome it.  Do you have any suggestions? Do I just take baby steps, starting with voice chatting on TeamSpeak, then accepting invitations to smaller social events, etc?"
introvert,3a65e7,rafi_kamal,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, baby steps are perfectly acceptable. I think the reason many people with social anxiety have such a problem overcoming it is that so many people around them find it so easy to socialize with others. Then an idea is planted: ""well, if it's so easy to what seems like literally everyone else around me, why can't I do it?"" That of course leads to the setting of completely unreasonable goals and the inevitable despair and overwhelming desire to give up when those unreasonable goals aren't met.  I speak from experience, if that helps. The little things matter, and in the end they do add up. When I was younger I had the benefit of an extremely outgoing roommate. He dragged me out to more social events than I was comfortable with, but in many cases being around him in those situations had the benefit of allowing me to remain a silent observer as he did most of the talking. His encouragement along with the experience of watching how he did things eventually gave me the courage to speak up every once in a while, put in a word here and there. If I faltered, he did a good job of stepping in for me.   In the end I'm far more sociable than I ever thought I was capable of (though I do still find it extremely draining to be so), and I largely have my old roommate to thank for that."

introvert,3a65e7,littlehandsk,2,Thu Jun 18 03:15:46 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I'm the same age as you and in a somewhat similar situation, although less extreme. I've made the choice to actively work on my social development, a big part of which is mitigating the social anxiety I've dealt with for some time. So, in answer to your title question: For me at least, social interaction is paramount. My philosophy, which is an amalgamation of what little psychology I know and reflection on my own experience, is that challenge is good. Discomfort is a sign that we are unprepared to deal with that aspect of our environment, in this case the social aspect, and that we need to practice certain skills in order to effectively meet the challenge being posed to us.  To some degree to you are correct that it comes down to preference. No one can force you to prioritize social interaction or your own social development. To my mind, however, it's self-defeating not to recognize the importance of both. Do you think that the social skills you might develop at a party are not going to be useful in work-related social interaction? How do you expect to build the social skills required for work if not by being socially active to a degree?  If you do decide to prioritize your social development, realize that it will not be an easy, nor a quick, process. It will be long and arduous. I've been consciously working on my social skills for two years and I still feel like an idiot at least once a day. But when I look back at how far I've come since then, I would never make the opposite choice and continue to avoid social interaction. I still have setbacks. But as long as I continuously improve, even if at a slow pace, I know that all of those small improvements I make will have a huge impact on my life.  In short, I would encourage you to at least give social interaction a shot. A real shot, not the ""I don't like it, so I'm not going to do it"" shot that you seem to have given it so far. You may be like me and realize the value of human connection, even from simple rituals like small talk, and that will motivate you to continue pursuing social development. But if this is simply not an important part of your life and you don't see it being so for the foreseeable future, then don't bother.  Good luck."
introvert,3a65e7,Miczkus,2,Thu Jun 18 06:47:02 2015 UTC,"I'm 22, I'm an introvert and I've problems with social interaction. The first half of your writing exactly applies to me. I hate any social gathering where most of the  people are strangers or acquaintances. What worries me is that you don't accept social invitation even from your close friends. Now whether it's a problem or not depends on you. If you are happy about the life you live, and be sure that you wouldn't change in the future, I don't see any problem. But what's the guarantee that you would be happy with your current situation five years from now?  Let me share my story. I've been with a girl for four years and she broke up with me six months ago. It wasn't unexpected to me (neither of us was very happy with our relationship), so I got over her quickly. One of the reasons she broke up with me was I'm a very boring person. And after she left, I realized very soon that she was right, my life was a sum of study, coding, facebooking, doing some other random stuff on the internet and watching movie. Just take away my PC from and my life is gone. I had friends but I didn't like hanging out with them much - most of the them were friends with me just because we read in the same department or we've done something together in past.  So I started trying some outdoor activities which interested me but I never thought about giving a shot before (like playing tennis, learning karate, doing roller skating etc). Besides, I started building stronger relationship with some my friends who were not very close to me before, but have similar mindset or common interests with me. Guess what? I enjoy my life much more than before, and now I've some friends with whom I would really like to watch movie, dance on a concert or go on an adventure. I still hate large social gathering, but I feel much more comfortable in a social occasion when there are friends around me.  So think again why don't you want to watch movies with your friends, is it because you don't like watching movies with friends, or is it because you don't have any friends with whom you would like to watch movie?"
introvert,3a65e7,Pavian_Schade,2,Thu Jun 18 08:23:32 2015 UTC,"Hi, Fellow introverted musician here, 24.(INFJ/INFP on the myers briggs scale) What you are describing is something I have dealt with MY WHOLE LIFE and have overcome over the last year or so wanted to weigh in.  I also suffered with some social anxiety but once I accepted my introversion it has passed. First off, regardless of your age, what your describing is ABSOLUTELY FINE. In fact it is fucking brilliant being an introvert. But I think the internet is a safe haven for us, and gives us an excuse to not socialise ""organically"". I too hate small talk and will go to great lengths to avoid it, yet online, behind a computer I have no issue with it. Its because we get so drained by socialising, having a way to do it that doesn't drain us is like GOLD.  Unfortunately, as life goes on, you need to be able to talk to people IRL in order to achieve goals. Its a fact of life. The best way to properly come to terms with this is to accept that people are not as harsh on you as you are... That is one of the distortions of the socially anxious mind. Once you truly accept this, this will make socialising much easier (or as easy as it can be as an Introvert). By no means try and be someone your not, if your an introvert, keep doing what your doing! I don't enjoy socialising, going for drinks with friends and whatnot, but unfortunately the sad fact is, its social convention to socialise in that way. That does not mean you should go and do it even though don't like it, it just means for the sake of friendships and what not, its a requirement to at least show your face occasionally.. otherwise you lose touch, and in some cases alienate yourself. (bare in mind good friends will accept you just the way you are, any that don't can fuck right off).  I saw on a comment reply that you are going to uni. University as an introvert is difficult because socialising is perceived to be the main part of it. The best way to deal with university is to socialise JUST AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO AND DONT APOLOGISE FOR IT. I suffered with depression at uni because I didn't know I was and introvert and thought there was something wrong with me for not wanting to go out all the time like everyone else seemed to.  I am actually in work and have gone over my lunch to give you this comment because I feel so strongly that you should know about how ok it is to be this way.  Anybody who tells you otherwise is ignorant to the spectrum of human experience and should be ripped out of your life like an ingrown hair.  Good luck."

Thanks a million for taking time out of your day to write this! Uni for me hasn't been that bad actually because I tend to just stick with two other friends of mine who happen to be in the same course as me, which is MUCH better than meeting new people.  Oh and I appreciate the advice on overcoming social anxiety. I know how irrational social anxiety is, and I need to figure out how to stop feeling so nervous. You're right that nobody is going to be as harsh on myself as I am.  Thanks again!"

No one tells him to shut the fuck up because we all suspect he's depressed enough to be suicidal, but if he were a little more out there socially we'd tell him to shut it with that shit.

Extroverts on the other hand start talking immediately and just hope that the word producing part of their brain will keep up so they don't have a buffer underrun.  Mind you extroverts are well-practiced at keeping the wordflow up without actually saying anything meaningful so buffer underruns are rare."

introvert,3a1iep,sum1rand0m,2,Wed Jun 17 09:19:20 2015 UTC,"It's not that hard too. Last week I attended some teacher's jubilee. Went alone, in this room full of year long colleagues. Repressed myself from talking a lot, but at times I actually chatted a bit with some. Even went to ask that teacher an autograph. Felt liberating. That feeling made me think we're killing ourselves.  ps: actually I had a few really bad moments. It was a full day event, with a lunch pause. Sitting at talks is easy, but eating between stranger groups .. almost scared me shitless. I planned to runaway before and forget the afternoon talks. Then thought to go at mcdonalds and come back. But I stood there, sometimes by myself sometimes not. I spotted some loners too. Got me thinking, maybe many people are anxious or not fully at ease socially too. Helped me relax a tiny bit.  The hardest part is not how to start but how to land a discussion ending. Ha.. anxiety.  Anyway, tickle your comfort zone people. Tickle hard."
introvert,3a1iep,fightswithbears,2,Wed Jun 17 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"Just literally dealt with this yesterday.   I've been with Wal-Mart for 8 years, 2 of them most recently as a Department Manager. It has been my only job and the only place that I interviewed with after I graduated High School and went job searching. I just recently applied for a new Support Manager position in the store to further my career with the company.  In the company, if you apply for a higher position, you have to do a panel interview with management that requires you to give detailed answers to situational questions. They won't just promote you without the interview.  After doing my interview and answering the questions, my Co-Manager told me she could have given about 5-6 answers that were different than what I answered, because she knows me, and knows my work ethic, and that they were looking for more detailed responses. I told her honestly that I wasn't good at doing interviews, and that it was literally only the third interview I have done in my life.   All that aside, she did say that obviously the interview questions are not the only thing they take into consideration when moving people up, and the fact that she knows my work ethic and knows me is helpful. I hope I still get the job, even though i'm extremely terrible at interviews. I'm supposed to know relatively quickly whether or not I got it via my Store Manager."

introvert,39zdeg,douglasr007,-1,Tue Jun 16 06:19:34 2015 UTC,"I normally go to festivals based on the Burning man festival in Nevada. At those festivals, the participants make thier own interactive spaces that are free for people to use. This ends up with a huge diversity in things to do. At Bonnaroo, the only real things to do were watch the bands and maybe buy a beer. Meanwhile, the portalets were badly maintained and had a long line in the mornings.  There are other things I didn't like, like prior are a lot more closed off than at burningman events. The public interactive spaces make it so that people are a lot more open. Another thing is burningman is a leave no trace event so the participants mostly keep the woke event clean, whereas Bonnaroovians just trashed the place I have a picture of literally piles and piles of garbage in the field). Really all Bonnaroo is, is a several day long concert where you get to live in uncomfortable conditions and get over charged for food."

We never go out aside from going out to eat occasionally with each other as well as movies or maybe the mall with each other.

If so, why not indulge in the same activities she enjoys? After all, they don't have to be lonesome. You could try gaming with her or even reading the same book so that she can discuss it with you. Perhaps the issues you mention are due to lack of common interests.  My boyfriend and I are both introverted types. We've lived together for going on 3 years now and we have a happy relationship. Often we'll be in the same room for hours and not say a word to each other. It sounds strange but it's natural for us. Just his presence there is comforting to me and I know he feels the same way. What works for us is having separate interests in addition to activities we can both enjoy together.   Also, have you talked to your wife about this? I don't know much about your situation, but could she simply be oblivious to your feelings?"

Yeah, it could also be lack of common interests... But I just find it so hard to be interested in what she plays or what she reads. Have you guys had any experience with overcoming this issue? Any tips?"
introvert,3a3ske,haileah2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:07:22 2015 UTC,"If she doesn't think it's the issue, how about trying a different approach? Try to avoid focusing on the negative and let her know that you simply want to spend more time together. I think most people need, or at least desire, that validation of being wanted. Being a quiet introspective type, this is especially true for me.   What's helped my boyfriend and I become closer is spending time outdoors together, without any distractions or interruptions, and just enjoying each other's company. We have a ""secret"" spot- a large pond you can swim in about a quarter mile into the woods that's usually deserted and quiet. We bring our dogs along, grab our swimsuits and some food, and make a day of it. We manage to make trips to our spot every other weekend or so while both working 40+ hours a week and with my boyfriend on-call. Making that time happen can be an effort but it's so worth it.   And about the lack of common interests, I think that's pretty typical. You're not going to like everything the other person does and you shouldn't feel you have to. I sometimes find it annoying when my boyfriend practices guitar, repeating the same riff again and again, but when I make an effort to get involved with what he's doing I actually start to enjoy myself too. Like, I might say, ""Hey, that sounds kind of like ______. Ever hear that song?"" or ""What key is that in?"" and then try to follow along with the piano (and I'm not very musically inclined). Likewise, he makes an effort to ask me about my drawings and the video games I like to play even though I know he has little interest in those things. It just boils down to actively participating in the relationship."
introvert,3a4fkh,sallyKapoor,5,Wed Jun 17 03:45:01 2015 UTC,"The author just comes across as someone who likes to complain. They complain about spending time alone, they complain about spending time with others, they complain about having no one to talk to, they complain about talking to others, they complain about being ""forced"" to enjoy the nightlife. I don't know how you'd enjoy anything, ever, with that kind of attitude.   You hear all the time on this sub the complaint about people getting pissy when a person declines plans and wants to ""recharge"", it's in this article that people they met took them to be snobbish and rude for declining plans.   I have to assume the people making these complaints are just assholes when it comes to declining plans and dealing with people. People don't like when others dick them around and flake on plans. A lot of people use introversion as an excuse to be flaky. If you're straight with people, you're not going to have a problem.   The author went into the trip not wanting to meet new people, being terrified of new experiences and finding activities like eating solo awkward. This has very little to do with introversion and extroversion, this author was never going to have a good time."

introvert,39zhra,windom_earle,5,Tue Jun 16 01:21:40 2015 UTC,"Given the choice, I'd much rather be an introvert, because introverts can do anything that extroverts can do (but not vice versa.)   Except it's not a choice. Ya I'm happy I'm an introvert, but only because that's part of who I am. I didn't choose to be this way but I can't be anyone else. I have no problem with extroverts, I have issues with people not accepting my boundaries.  Extroverts are great, introverts are great. Both excel at different things."
introvert,39zhra,fisheye32,2,Tue Jun 16 17:23:34 2015 UTC,"Nice find.   We (introverts) have been told over and over again that how we are is wrong, and that we need to be more extroverted.   I have never been an extrovert to know any other way of life, so I can't sit here and blatantly degrade extroverts on their behavioural patterns but I can be happy with who and what I am.   Mutant Introvert and Proud."
introvert,39zhra,black-raven-1307,2,Tue Jun 16 06:45:24 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be good to mythologise it, and to start claiming introversion is great just because it's an identity to defend. Cheerfulness, friendliness and regular communication are all generally good things that introverts tend to be patchy on, and there are plenty of deep thinkers who are extroverts. Pros and cons, horses for courses, takes all sorts to make a world, do what you like. Being proud of it sounds a bit dodgy to me, potentially cliquey."
introvert,39z0ad,Lean-N-Mean,4,Mon Jun 15 22:58:19 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely all for this. Being broken down just builds invulnerability to the next knock in humans (mostly).

Be proud of yourself! I know we are!"

introvert,39z0ad,Wurstgeist,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:41:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds uncomfortable.  Less facetiously: this has advantages once in a while when it seems like bold changes in life are desirable. Then if you really want to, you can make it into an entire lifestyle and live in a constant adrenaline-pumped struggle full of excitement and stress. I'd decline that offer, personally.  It's true that you shouldn't fear mistakes, though. Ideally mistakes shouldn't be harmful, and ideally people shouldn't be embarrassed if they haven't been dishonest, and rejection shouldn't be unkind. In which case, none of that would be outside your comfort zone and you could make all kinds of mistakes and experiments without even having to confront anything really alarming."

introvert,39sei7,soyunamariposa,3,Mon Jun 15 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"It is a long survey, and difficult for people to complete if they had parents who ignored/neglected them growing up.  For example, you have a question for mother and father that asked if they ""directed the activities and decisions of the children through reasoning and discipline.""  Well, my parents used discipline without reasoning.  You never knew what behavior was expected day-to-day, and on whims my parents would get mad at you for doing something you've always done.  You got the discipline part, without the expected behaviors being outlined, and without rationalization.  Since you combine these stand-alone traits in questions, it makes it difficult to answer."
introvert,39sei7,PixelMagic,2,Sun Jun 14 23:31:16 2015 UTC,You make good points. The scale you describe has a fourth sub-scale (there are three used in this survey) that deals with parenting style that you have defined. It was left out of this survey because it was not something I was trying to measure in this particular instance. I realise this is a problem but if I included everything I wanted to this survey would take way too long to fill out. Your feedback is useful though : )
introvert,39sei7,Pieecake,2,Mon Jun 15 04:34:58 2015 UTC,Yes I agree that the assumption that everyone has parents who pay attention to them will skew your results since you seem to be hoping to demonstrate a link between authoritarian style parenting and a particular political persuasion (gee I wonder which one).  By the by there is a robust political science literature that demonstrates children usually adopt the political persuasion of their parents (although sometimes with a collegiate interregnum).

Triggered a panic attack and I guess I hadn't completely calmed down. Later that night I went out with my SO and her friends. Music was good but too loud. My SO and her friends are all architects, which means often I get lost in conversation and feel left out. The end result of all this means I spend all night looking at my phone or just generally spacing out. I'm not trying to be rude or not engage with the group.

introvert,39py7p,Be-Bop-Brew,5,Sat Jun 13 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"Other than the sporadic barging in, do you get along with your brother okay? If you do, then I would straight up tell him that after a long day of work/school, you need at least an hour (or however long you need) of alone time to just unwind. You could even say you picked up meditating and need that time to do it alone (or have him join you as bonding time in silence since it sounds like he just likes hanging out with you and talk. So maybe having him participate but quietly will let him feel included without stressing you out?).  I usually have the door to my room closed as a sign to other people that I need my me-time. Otherwise my door is half open. Since you don't have locks, try setting a heavy box in front of the door? It'll at least slow down the barging in maybe."

He's your brother so he's one of the very few people who will be in your life, for life, and will have your back - provided you both get along. It's worth nurturing that.  Talk to him. You give a little. Ask him to give a little. You won't be in the same house forever.  My sister and I are the same, but we live 3 hours apart now. We talk once a week on the phone and visit 4 times a year. She would like more, I would like less. We compromise and we make it work."

I think that's one of the reasons why I'm taking is pretty hard ATM, I'm normally living away for university, and I'm used to living my life my own way. We get along fine while I'm away, because I rarely have to speak to him or see him, so I make an effort when I do.   Thanks for the input though, it helps just to talk about it anyway  :)"

It's important to you that you're not enemies with your coworkers.  For entry-level jobs, fortunately a lot of the questions won't matter anyway. If they're hiring, they'll prefer to hire the first bunch of people who apply. They might have some scoring system but probably aren't going to fuss about all the answers, or want to spend lots of time deciding. You just have to seem OK and be lucky.  Like you say, an application might be automatically filtered out at an early stage due to failing a pre-interview personality test, but that implies a huge volume of applications to work at some particular customer service desk somewhere, and also implies that they prioritise the personality test over other filters like ""lives in feasible commuting range"" and ""has basic literacy and numeracy"" (another common test). So I'm not convinced it would be automatic, or that a few points off would mean a fail."

introvert,39o6mv,JohnDalrymple,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:29:03 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I could be way off here, but wanted to share my experience as an introvert with similar type tendencies (we all have them). Not sure about the narcissism label, but I do know many people love attention because they are insecure deep down inside, which sounds rude, but I don't mean it in an accusatory way toward you. The reason is usually not the persons fault - maybe they had overcritical parents and they did not validate the person as a child growing up? Or perhaps they were an only child and received a lot of attention from parents who were overbearing? Whatever the cause may be, typically not the child's fault.   Attention seeking can be an addictive behavior that people do when they crave love, validation or acknowledgment from others, which sometimes means it is lacking, deep down, inside ourselves. Everything in moderation though, really. People have accomplished a lot through the desire for fame, but the most successful usually do it for their own enjoyment.   Sometimes we become hyper focused on ourselves when we missed out on something fundamental growing up. It is not a great way to live, in my opinion. That's how I've been for many years. It causes serious anxiety and perfectionism, and makes us and others feel disconnected. If we lack as much empathy, interest and the ability to put ourselves in others' shoes, people take notice. It doesn't preclude someone from having friends, but the friendships might just be more superficial, or the other person might harbor some resentment if they sense we don't care.  This was a rant based on a lot of research I've done into narcissistic-type personalities and how they originate. It's not saying you are one, as you expressed concern about others, it's very unlikely. But as someone with similar attributes as you described, and a love of performance, I might suggest finding little ways to think about other people every once in awhile. What I mean is, when you're talking or interacting with people, or even watching a show, you can try to imagine what it would feel like to be that other person, what kinds of tribulations they must be experiencing, or other emotions or thoughts. It has helped me get outside myself some days. If you truly want to be loved and remembered, having no need for outside acknowledgment is, ironically, the best path to go. Sorry for the rant, hope it wasn't offensive."

I've gone to a couple movies by myself the last couple weeks (I'm new to a city and don't have friends to just go with anyway) and plan on going to see Jurassic world too at my own leisure. I love movies and I love alone time. If the theater isn't  crowded it's great because you feel like you went out and did something but you got to be by yourself.

I used to go to movies by myself all the time (only reason I don't anymore is 'cause I don't watch movies in theaters anymore, it's too expensive and you can't drink beer or pause to go to the bathroom 'cause you've been drinking too much beer. Plus I watch most stuff on the computer now.) The first time I did it I felt pretty awkward, but afterwards I realized it was no big deal at all & I started doing it all of the time, and then would go have coffee by myself and people-watch. I started to really enjoy my own company & gained confidence from that. It's great when you're introverted to be able to do things like this by yourself, it's very freeing to not have to worry about other people showing up to things you've planned to do, & not having to care if what you want to watch/do matches up with your friends."

I do remember the last time I brought beer into the theaters. I think it was Django that I saw... I got pretty hammered and starting making clanging noises with the bottles... And then I got the hiccups. It was pretty comical, but you really shouldn't do what I did and get hammered."

Where Kevin Bacon goes invisible, goes insane and starts murdering people. The last line in the preview was ""Just because you think you're alone doesn't mean you really are""    Let's just say I was a little weirded out after that.

No-one whose opinion is worth anything cares if you see a movie without being surrounded by talkers and loud eaters, or if you attend a concert for your own entertainment rather than anyone else's. And there's a reason that ""table for one"" is a cliché restaurant phrase - plenty of every place's clientèle fits that category. Sure, given the choice they'd prefer having every chair at a table filled, but that's just business, not a social judgment, and one paying customer at a table is better than none, particularly if they're served well enough to recommend the place to others.  Hell, I've gone out and done all these things and more on my own even while in a relationship, simply because we weren't clones of each other and therefore we had our own things we liked doing - and didn't expect each other to submit to being dragged along to something they had no interest in.

It sounds strange but I get really frustrating having to share the pavements with other people. I like daydreaming and I get really distracted when there's people ahead of me or walking towards me from afar. I get this really strong rush of irritation.  So I prefer to go in the evenings and take certain routes I know are quieter. Going out on a Saturday afternoon when there's loads of slow old people and screaming kids around is just not worth it. I try and do my shopping and errands early or late in the evening on weekdays. I live in a quiet area but I hate how crowded and louder it is in summer all the time.  It's really hard to explain it to people, I'm not an unkind or bad tempered person I just hate sharing my personal space! Noise counts into my radius as well."
introvert,39jv6a,Clunkbot,10,Fri Jun 12 06:08:27 2015 UTC,"I recognise the feeling, but there are a lot of details to add:  First of all, I'd hate to be forgotten, left out of the loop, and friendless.  Then, I do sometimes reflect that I had a pretty good time socialising.  Besides, when I spend time on my own, I'm not usually constructive with it.  I do typically feel resentful in a part of my mind, when people contact me to go out and do fun things - even if its somebody who I've been missing, or was worried about. Then after it's over I might feel regretful about the lost day. I think this might be to do with chronically failing to find satisfaction, in self-directed ways.  I don't necessarily mind ""wasting"" my own time (by, say, browsing Reddit), so long as the experience is satisfying. On the other hand that satisfaction implies some kind of overall coherence and purposefulness, which I'm generally failing to attain. I think if I spent my own time ""well"" - whatever that means, which is a big question - I won't be so resentful about socialising. The problem with time spent socialising is that it's guaranteed to have no purpose (apart from entertainment, and inspiration, and learning dozens of little things at random). It adds to a sense of incoherence which already burdens me."

This evening I will attend a barbecue with some old high school friends (about 12), but I'm only really close with maybe 3-4 of them. I don't really look forward to this because I know I have to hang out with everyone and that means a lot of small talk.   However, in a few weeks I will go camping (2 Days) with two of my closest friends, and I can barely wait. Sure, it is a lot longer then just a barbecue, but since I'm really good friends with these two I will enjoy it a lot more.   So in conclusion, I think your enjoyment depends a lot on how close the friends are that you will spend your time with.   When you spend time with your closest friends it shouldn't be draining, only a lot of fun!"

I should be practicing guitar right now or doing something more productive. Can't wait till next weekend when I have no obligations.""   Which I've realized isn't fair. All the while I'm spending time with them, I'm not really ""there"". It's not fair to them and it's not fair to me if that's not really what I want to do. So I've started to say no and not feel guilty about it.  But I've also started to not feel guilty about spending or ""wasting"" a weekend with close friends or family. I'm realizing in the adult world, work takes a lot of time that was once free to me during college to relax or pursue hobbies, and then still have time and energy for a social life.   However, some of my best memories I have I've realized are the days I've ""wasted"" with people I love.  I love being alone. But it's hard to have an impact on the world, share what you've learned in your alone time, or put your life into perspective when your not ""there"" to share time with the people who love you.

Besides being introverted I have social anxiety, so being the center of attention like that was a terrifying experience.   The good thing was that the novelty wore off in a couple of days and I returned to being the ""shy and quiet girl""."

I have a huge beard and part of the reason that I'm not shaving it is because of the attention the difference would cause in my daily interactions with people. I like to get haircuts on Friday to have the weekend to get used to it before going to work on Monday. Even when I have a pair of new shoes I feel like they pop too much and draw too much attention. I really like blending in as much as I can to my background.

Whether I want it cut or not, I'm afraid to because of the reputation and identity that has been built for me around it. Not to mention, everyone I know went crazy when I recently changed from a full beard to a balbo (Robert Downey Jr's facial hair, basically), so I couldn't imagine what would happen if I basically cut off a foot of hair."
introvert,39h3g2,SilverSpooky,5,Thu Jun 11 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"I sometimes love larger events, particularly if I go with an extroverted friend, because they can do all the talking for me, and I can listen along with the conversation and laugh with everyone but I never have to talk.  I also love the autonomous/invisible aspect - I would also find that appealing to be in a larger clan like that where I'm not under as much OBLIGATION to be present, to be active, to be noticed, to do what is expected socially.  However, it sounds like your friend is different than you. For him, this small group is probably something sort of like a group of friends to him. He gets lonely when he is alone, and likes having a closer-knit group of people who he can get to know and build a 'relationship' with, even if it's just online through a game.  It is meeting his needs for friendship, companionship, group conversation, belonging, participation in a group, etc.  It would be very hard for him to understand why everyone wouldn't want the same thing as he does."

They're extroverts, but not particularly confident extroverts, they use it as a front for their insecurities.  And this type of person loves introverts. I think it's something about them being quieter, that their personalities aren't so forceful. So they get to dominate the relationship, in a sense. They use the introvert as their validation.

Eventually, the right person will come along, and they and your daughter will become fast friends.  I know it's probably not the answer you were looking for, but honestly, there's nothing more you can do.  If you try to intervene at school, or even try talking to your daughter about it, you'll only bring attention to the situation, likely causing embarrassment and worsening the issue.  I understand how difficult it is to watch something like this from a parent's perspective, but just give it time; she'll find someone she can form a close bond with, and she'll make a lifelong friend."
introvert,39b94u,jimbojones230,68,Wed Jun 10 17:19:51 2015 UTC,"THIS!!! I'm an introvert, been this all my life. My parents pressured me (in elementary school) to be friends with someone. Go be friends with X. Go get friends. Talk to them. Go do that. I hated that, hated hated hated.   Because I couldn't relate to anything that anyone else had/was doing/etc. Those didn't interest me, so why should I spend time with a person when I dislike what activity they're doing? Pressuring me was not a smart thing to do.   So, as others say, quiet activities might be better. Pay attention now on what she really likes to do; read, write, draw, specific flavors of movies/shows? See what you can draw out from that, and apply it to groups, find out if there are any, and ask if she MIGHT like to TRY one for a day or two. Throw to wolves, raw into a group, no. My kid is 5, and he's not exactly extroverted. So what I do when we're at a park, is get someone else over near us and ask him, ""hey is it ok if Sally comes and does chalk with us?"" So, sometimes he does. Then I sit back a little and see if they start playing together. The kids might make up their own game, and that's social practice for my guy. Does this make sense?"
introvert,39b94u,catloving,22,Wed Jun 10 18:22:55 2015 UTC,"This is so perfecrt. Please don't pressure your kid to be like you. They'll feel inadequate or just make a friend to please you.

Go to the library, museum.. there are lots of good places for her to meet kids her age that may be more like her."
introvert,39b94u,jojotoughasnails,43,Wed Jun 10 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"For what's it's worth, she sounds like a delightful little girl.   If she actually wants friends, act on her strengths. She may be comfortable going to a library and possibly finding someone with mutual interests. It's not guaranteed to work, but it exposes her to a quiet environment with people who like to do the same things as her (that is, reading). So she's able to still be in her comfort zone, but also able to branch out if the opportunity arises.   What you should definitely not do is try to expose her to predominantly social activities. If you try and get her to do a group activity with classmates for example, she'll just feel more alienated. I hope that makes sense.  And lastly, don't worry so much about her! She'll manage. One thing I hated is when my parents would treat me like I had some kind of problem that needed to be 'cured' or 'fixed'. There's nothing at all wrong with being introverted.   Well anyway, that's just my two cents."
introvert,39b94u,Nihil_,12,Wed Jun 10 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"Extracurriculars that she would enjoy - particularly with kids outside of her school-class.   Dance, swimming, gymnastics, skating, art, any kind of activity at the local library.  One thing that I think you and your wife can do as the extroverts, is keep an eye out when you're with her at any sort of event, and look for what look to be any OTHER introverted kids. If you're at the park with her and you see a kid sitting under a tree reading a book, encourage her to go over and interact with them. This could even be cleared with the other kid's parents first - (they'd likely appreciate the help getting their kid to socialize). They likely won't get up and start running around together, but maybe they can sit quietly and read together, and talk about books.  I was an introverted kid growing up, and although it was a while ago I seem to recall that's what my parents did in my case and I made some great friends."
introvert,39b94u,daddytorgo,11,Wed Jun 10 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, the common misconception about introverts versus extroverts is that it's a dichotomy, and it's not. There are situations where primarily introverted people can be extroverted and visa versa. Where that happens is different for each individual but it seems to me you want your daughter to feel comfortable in expressing herself with others, and I applaud that.   I was a camp councilor for a time and tended to hang out with all the introverted young artists that attended,  at lunch my girls and I would talk about books and things. I think it's important to think about what ideas are said and give your thoughts without saying ""this is the way,"" even if that's what you want to say.   For interests Most people who identify as primary introverts tend to have niche interests, and generally find little interest in small talk. When an interest is expressed it can be really passionate and oftentimes this is when the extrovert side comes out, expressing said passion.   You seem to know your daughter well, she might not be of age to be a part of a community book club but I know there are often poetry recitals that tailor to local community. Poetry readings are a good idea I think because it allows your daughter to see people expressing themselves and be accepted regardless of what the expression is. She might want to watch at first but it has potential for growing that comfortability with sharing her feelings and being accepted for it.   For understanding For me small talk doesn't touch on true feelings and is almost insulting (I don't like the tone of this word but can't think of another at the moment) especially when I know something is on the mind of the speaker and it hurts they don't feel comfortable just saying it in the first place. It's not about wasting time or impatience, rather every sentence has a true literal meaning, a context meaning and an emotional meaning. Sifting through all this can be overwhelming and generally trying to navigate what to say when you know what was intended can be daunting.   So when we hear a sentence we hear: literal, contextual, and hidden meanings.   Sometimes listening in on a conversation you can find out really weird or sad things about people when all they were talking about was the weather.   I (we?) appreciate speaking from the heart, and collected calm. I feel so much I have to analyze the feelings to keep them in check, letting a feeling overwhelm is like losing control and it's not something I want to do. I have feelings but letting them make my decisions would be like letting go of the steering wheel on the highway. Making informed decisions and checking on my heart is what I try to do, steer with the mind aim with the heart."
introvert,39b94u,gatesthree,8,Wed Jun 10 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"Just give her the time and support she needs. If she shows interest in another kid help her out by inviting them over. She probably won't do it herself. But if she doesn't have fun, don't force her to continue the friendship. She will make friends but it will take longer. She will probably leave school with one or two intensely strong friendships that will continue her entire life. I feel like this is a huge benefit. I have very few people I consider to be my friends and I cherish all of them. The longest has been in my life 25 years."

(As early as kindergarten.)  Even up until middle school, my mom always made me do little exercises to try and ""become more social.""  Maybe a second grader won't understand the word ""introvert,"" but if you could explain that concept, she'll understand that she's different in a way that doesn't also make her believe that it's a bad thing.

introvert,39b94u,Simple377,9,Wed Jun 10 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"Encourage friendships between her and her classmates that she could see herself becoming friends with. Tell her that sometimes you can have a few close friends instead of one best friend. I agree with extracurricular activities being a great way to get her in touch with kids her age.  Consider the Girl Scouts, 4-H, and similar groups. See what activities the local library has planned for the summer. Most libraries have a summer reading program starting soon,  and it may be a good way to meet other kids that have similar interests.   Whatever you do,  don't push her into a particular activity just to have an activity. My parents did that and it made the problem even worse. Let her do things that come natural to her. She will then be more comfortable and at ease, which will allow her to open up around other kids and make friends."
introvert,39b94u,MamaD_Cooks,15,Wed Jun 10 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"She probably would do well being put in an extracurricular activity that has kids like her doing something that lends itself to her personality. Maybe dance or gymnastics classes where the kids have to focus on following directions, a swim class maybe? .. A group outside of her class that she has interest in. I'm sure you could even find an art class I bet she'd like that. I wonder if you've talked to her teacher about it? Sometimes the teacher can gently encourage other kids to befriend the ones that feel left out. Some kids are just sensitive to loud noise which might mean nothing, but if you haven't already I would encourage you to check with the doctor about it on your next visit. Might be a leap but I wouldn't want you to overlook asperger syndrome as sensory issues are a common part of that. Is she's sensitive to any other sensory issues like clothing or foods? I don't work in the medical field at all and only have your post to go by but maybe read about it and see if it holds true about her."

First thing first, props for not jumping to the knee jerk extrovert reaction of ""busting you daughter out of her shell"". As the only kid of extroverted parents, I have first-hand experience riding that train and can tell you it was never a good time. Since your are already getting a crap ton of solid feedback, I'll make this short and sweet and give you a couple of tips I wish I could have given my parents.   Don't try to change me into you. It will never happen and you'll be disappointed when it doesn't. Even though I won't like it, I STILL NEED TO LEARN SOCIAL SKILLS. There are tons of books written for ""shy"" kids like me! Check Amazon. ""How to make friends for 8 y/o = Parenting gold. Practice with me on what/how to talk to kids my own age. For some strange reason, most of us are left to figure out these skills on our own and introverts often don't get to learn/practice useful social techniques. If you really want to help me, buy some books and lets STUDY them together. Keep an eye out for the bullies. Since the beginning of time introverts have had issues with bullies. Stay vigilant. Bullies can ruin a childhood. Please don't let that happen to me. Get me involved it activities doing stuff with kids my own age. If I don't like it, let's try something else. It would help if you find friends with kids my own sex/age. Your army buddies may be funny, but their teenage kids are jerks and tease me when you are not around. Don't mock me for being a ""loner"". Sure, I wish I had a dozen friends like my brother, but I'm OK with that. You should be too.   So there you go... my two cents. Hope it helps with your kid."
introvert,39b94u,Stat_Zombie,3,Thu Jun 11 03:57:55 2015 UTC,"Your daughter sounds a lot like I was at her age.  Is there anyone in her class she likes to be around?  Or talks about at all?  If so, maybe you could invite that kid out to a water park or the zoo or whatever activity gets your daughter excited and talking.  Too many kids is overwhelming, but one or three (not two because they might pair up) kids can be a lot of fun.  Also if any of your son's friends has a sibling your daughter's age, that could be a good way to introduce them.  Good luck."
introvert,39b94u,MyLittleTarget,4,Wed Jun 10 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"Finishing second grade is still really young; so whatever personality she's going to have, whatever coping mechanisms she's going to end up with, aren't necessarially set. She may even become more of an extrovert as she ages.  that's pretty unlikely, but I do want to point out that some of this might be due to 'introversion' and some of it might be due to 'still a little kid'.  To start, and it sounds like you already know, that the answer isn't to cure her of her introversion or make her into an extrovert.  Introverts can still have friends and a social life without adopting the extrovert lifestyle, so to speak.  It all comes down to what's practical.   If she was thrust into a group of new people she would be quiet and let the class happen around her and never speak up.   I'd be surprized if this is actually the case.  School is a crap way to make friends, because you're always focused on something else (the schoolwork) and there's a central authority figure that's usually there to arbitrate everything.  What's better is activities.  Are there any activities that your daughter likes?  Art, softball, chess, reading, writing, whatever?  Find an activity, hopefully connected to the school she attends, or at least that would include kids from the same school district, and suggest she join.  She'd be doing what she likes AND it gives common ground for her to make friends AND the groups are typically smaller AND they're forced to work together, usually.  When I went through a drought of friends early in High School, this was how I got out of it.  The people you go to school with are just random, so it's hard to know who might be your friend, or who should be your friend.  But if you're both playing chess .  . . you've got that in common, at least.  She may not need any direct intervention beyond that.  It may be that as soon as the group shrinks a bit, and the focus tightens a bit, she may have the room to form connections to other kids.  Maybe other introverts, maybe other extroverts.  On the internal side, let her know that making friends and talking with people you don't know is scary or, at least, can be scary.  You may have never felt this way, but she does.  And if she waits until her fear is resolved, making friends may never happen.  Let her know that talking with people and making friends is something that we might be scared of but do anyway (rather than being something we eventually are not scared of).  This is tough, because everybody has their own internal calculus regarding the risk/reward of new people.  But let her know that friends can be a numbers game, talk to more people, connect with more people, and the opportunities for friendships increases.  Less people, less opportunity.  It's not about her or who she is or what people think of her, it's just numbers.  Let  her know that if she decides to open up and talk to someone, that she does not have to do it all the time.  She still gets to decide how many friends she has.  People usually emphasise skill when it comes to talking with others, but that usually backfires with introverts.  Giving us smalltalk does nothing, because we don't value smalltalk.  If we get better at it, we're still nowhere and the interaction isn't at all organic.  The important thing is talking about whatever."

introvert,39b94u,skywyze,3,Wed Jun 10 18:03:46 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is talk to the teacher and see if there are any other students that are a little less shy/introverted that you could then make a play date. Small groups or one on one is the most comfortable for an introvert. I loved reading and I would have really enjoyed doing a small group parent/child book club. Or you can get her into an art class where she can meet other creative people. Also there are probably writing classes for children. Your library might have groups to join as well. Introverts love other people and having friends but we need it on a smaller scale. Good luck and its awesome to see you trying so hard to let your daughter be who she is and still be""normal""."

DO NOT force change, it will likely only cause harm through creating discomfort and negative feelings that wasn't previously there. Like the others said, then you can only wait."
introvert,39b94u,Natanael_L,3,Wed Jun 10 21:12:51 2015 UTC,"Growing up was difficult for me for quite a while, simply because I always felt like I wanted more friends but would have a hard time actually enjoying my time with others. It took many years for me to really understand that I was introvert and what that actually meant. The best I can say is to support her and help her feel happy at home. Help her learn more about introversion and what it means, why it's not a bad thing and let her know that she is not strange for being the way she is. These, however, are all probably things you are already doing for her."
introvert,39b94u,PM_ME_YOUR_ART_PLZ,2,Wed Jun 10 22:24:20 2015 UTC,"Are you or your wife friends with any of the other parents? if so, perhaps you can talk to them to setup a play date or invite them over with their child.  From my personal experience, I've made lifelong friendships growing up attending church in sunday school classes (even though many of them are no longer religious).  I am still a bit quiet and shy to this day but I remember I broke out of my shell in late middle school and throughout high school so don't fret too much as she is still very young"
introvert,39b94u,devrish1,2,Wed Jun 10 17:45:24 2015 UTC,"First of all, good on you for coming here and asking for help from other introverts. No one in the comments has told you yet, but the fact that you've already acknowledged that you're both extroverts and not sure how to help her says a lot. You want to help her without pushing her out of her comfort zone, and that's fantastic.  With that said, let's get down to business. With summer break upon us (in some countries anyway), school is going to take a backseat for a while, and that's probably a good ting now that you're actively trying to make some progress. A lot of people have suggested extracurricular, and now is the perfect time for what's been suggested quite a bit here: swimming. It's fun, it's good in this weather, and it serves a long-term purpose. It's also very structured, which will probably be helpful. Especially since without school, there won't be as much for her to keep her mind busy, and to this day that's always been hard for me. Giving her something to do will probably help a lot.  If you want to sign her up for something, make absolutely sure to ask her what kind of things she likes. My favorite summer activities were always the short science day-camps - usually about two weeks long - that the natural history museum would have for kids.  I personally didn't have a good experience with Girl Scouts because our den mother (I think that's what she was called? It's been a while) was kind of overbearing and wanted us to be socializing with each other all the time. I don't know if that's a commonality in the Girl Scouts, but that's something to keep in mind.  It also might be fun to have some family movie nights at home if she's feeling under-stimulated. The focus is on the movie, and if she feels like leaving in the middle or talking about it afterwards, that's her choice. (I would definitely recommend Matilda if she hasn't seen it simply because Matilda seems like a protagonist she might relate to.)  All in all, this is for her, so it's good to ask her what she's interested in and comfortable with rather than just throwing her into the deep end. But since you seem to be aware of this, that shouldn't be too much of a problem for you. I wish you all the best of luck. :)"
introvert,39b94u,Xanthera,2,Thu Jun 11 00:17:00 2015 UTC,"Howdy, I am an introvert and I work in Higher Education. I teach several courses and the one book that I strongly recommend to extroverts and introverts alike is called Quiet by Susan Cain. It's an excellent reader on introverts written by an extrovert for other extroverts. Her TED talk, linked over in the sidebar, is a nice sampling of some of the thoughts that are in her book.  I also think there is tremendous value in activities that allow her to use and channel her introspection. Activities such as writing, to painting, running, or meditation. Some structured activities to learn how to internally focus her consciousness, stay aware, and have the kinds of interactions she wants to have. Whatever activities she enjoys doing that channels her and she enjoys, support and encourage.  The last thought I have to share is related to helping with public speaking discomfort, probably later in life. DO NOT TELL HER TO TRY TO KEEP CALM/STAY CALM. It's like telling someone to not smile. If she starts to feel anxious then she may feel badly about getting anxious and not being able to comply with your advice. I always encourage my quiet students to think about public speaking as a challenge, or a performance they get to rock out. That motivational shift changes the way they approach the task I think.  I have used that mental trick for years when I have to address a large crowd."
introvert,39b94u,Q1875,2,Thu Jun 11 00:21:26 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to sympathize with your daughter covering her ears.  I'm 40 and still almost burst into tears if my environment is too loud and I can't get away.  It's a very real issue that she will have to learn how to deal with in her own way and it is one that you can help her with!  First of all, pay attention to when she is having an issue (she might seems like she is flinching or squinting before covering her ears) and maybe offer her a break.  Ask her to go see if she can help in the kitchen at a party, have her go check to see if the car is locked (just as an excuse to get fresh air) or if she wants to go to the bathroom and get a drink of water.  A small break can work wonders and she will love you for it!"
introvert,39b94u,omecronpersei8,2,Thu Jun 11 02:24:17 2015 UTC,"If your daughter has friends, then don't worry. While extroverts typically enjoy having large groups of friends, introverts will often only maintain a small group of friends, and there's nothing bad about that. The best thing you can do for her is respect her dislike of large and loud groups, and letting her grow and develop as she wishes. She's far more likely to make friends when she's doing things she enjoys and loves, but it is nothing that you can try and push her to do."
introvert,39b94u,Furah,2,Thu Jun 11 02:46:31 2015 UTC,"Find hobbies that are good for introverts. I liked playing an instrument, it's a great group activity that I didn't really need to actively socialize to interact with people. Active things that she can do by herself (archery, fencing, horseback riding, dancing, martial arts, etc).   I'd suggest reading Quiet and Me, Myself, and Us if you want a better understanding of introversion.   Really, the best thing you can do is encourage her to pursue her own interests. As long as she's doing that, I think she'll be fine."

introvert,39b94u,starlit_moon,2,Thu Jun 11 04:18:33 2015 UTC,"Would she be interested in signing up for an after school activity? Even if it's just an hour, it will expose her to more people and give her something to talk about in class. When I was little I would have liked a book club, computer class, art class, pottery, or piano lessons. All of those are fairly quiet activities and don't need a lot of people around."
introvert,39b94u,sh2003,2,Thu Jun 11 05:19:44 2015 UTC,"first, does she happen to be smaller and/or younger than everyone else? sometimes the smaller, younger kids will not get along with everyone as easily. if this is the case, it might be worth it to hold her back a grade.   but besides that, realize she will always gravitate towards having less friends than more as a preference. there's nothing you can do to change that.  and also, you need to follow up on her observation that she doesn't have any friends by asking her if that makes her sad or not. there's a chance she was simply making an observation that she noticed something different about her compared to others rather than that she's expressing a feeling about it. if she is sad about it, it might not be because she wants a friend, it might be because she doesn't like being different by not having a friend. she could be perfectly fine not having a friend but doesn't like being different. a similar analogy would be someone who's gay among heterosexuals will have negative feelings that they don't share the same interests in the opposite sex that everyone else does but does not feel sad that they don't like the opposite sex.  so very similarly to having a gay child, you need to know that you can't change her and let her know she's fine the way she is, and that it's okay to not want to be social and not have friends if she doesn't want to. forcing her to make friends would be like trying to force a a gay kid to be straight. however, to take care of her potential problem of not liking being different, let her know that being able to socialize can be a good skill to have like reading, writing, and math. she may not enjoy learning how to do it but she can and benefit from it. so, be very accepting in her decision and desire for solitude but also be very supportive while challenging her and helping her engage in social situations.  i think the best way to develop social skills in children without forcing them to do so is to get them in a group structured extracurricular activity or hobby. a sport (but not one that's team based. so gymnastics, dance, a martial art, fencing, archery...), arts n crafts classes, choir, band, girl scouts, brownies... something along these lines. she'll be forced to be around people without having to engage with them socially, however there will be opportunities for her to be social and if it's something she enjoys, she's more likely to talk about it and meet people with similar interests.  Be prepared that she may never have friends at school and will only have a friend or two outside of school.  one of my friends who's very shy but very pleasant to converse with was forced to go to a weekly church youth group. his parents didn't even go to the church but directly told him that he didn't need to believe in god but that it's good to know how to talk to and get along with people. i don't recommend this specifically, but being clear about your intentions like my friend's parents is recommended.   kids like to be challenged and taught how to survive whether they're extrovert or introvert..."
introvert,39b94u,DayDreaminBoy,2,Thu Jun 11 08:55:46 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one thinking she may have some sensory difficulties? ""Covering her ears at loud sounds"" does this happen often? Did you ever have her assessed for Autism? It may not be that, but sometimes children, (especially girls) can go unnoticed for a long time when they have problems like this. As a parent of one diagnosed boy and a girl who sounds exactly like your daughter, but has not been diagnosed.  I'd urge you to keep your options open, for her sake.  Nevertheless, urge her attend meditation classes, or some form of fitness.  Besides growing confidence and learning new skills, she could find some like-minded people. Let her be happy in her comfort zone to a large extent, don't force her too much to become like you and the rest of your family.  She's her own person. All the best."
introvert,39b94u,yummykam,2,Thu Jun 11 10:02:48 2015 UTC,"Not a parent, so I can't give parental advice with a straight face. However, I can talk from experience of what not to do, and what I felt would've helped when growing up.  For what NOT to do: Don't pester, don't interfere, don't make playdates for her, don't point out how she's standing out or being different, yet on the flipside, don't pretend she's a social butterfly either, just acknowledge she's different without sending the subconscious message that there's something wrong with it. Easier said than done, though.  Eg: At some sort of hootenany, everyone else is laughing and playing, but she's sitting by herself and reading, or playing videogames, or doing something else solitary, just let her.   Rather than trying to cajole her into socializing, which is a bad idea all around, start figuring out what her interests are, and push her a bit to do them. So: karate, book readings at the library, magic tricks, arts and crafts, music lessons, sports, whatever she starts showing interest in, support those things. Research and suggest events that get her out of the house and around new kids without trying to actually force a friendship, and there's a high chance she'll start connecting through one of those avenues. Remember though, the focus has to be on the actual activity, and not the socializing.   Rather than developing pastimes through her social niche, she's probably going to instead develop a social niche through her pastimes, so don't be surprised if her friends aren't from her class, or even school."
introvert,39b94u,RingsOfYourAnus,2,Thu Jun 11 10:40:36 2015 UTC,"Lots of great answers here. I wholeheartedly agree with many of these comments! Here's something I don't think too many people have touched on yet -- it's not what you asked, but it might be helpful.  I'm an introverted woman, and as a young girl growing up around extroverted people I always felt like something was wrong with me or like I was defective, or different but didn't know why.   I think it's really important that if you talk to your daughter about introversion, that you tell her it's ok to be different and that it doesn't mean she is any worse than anyone else.  Sometimes it'll seem to her like everyone is laughing and joking around, and the jokes won't be as funny to her as they are to the other kids, and she might feel a sense of isolation. At times she might get frustrated that no one seems to like her or that she doesn't have as much fun playing with the other kids as everyone else.    Tell her it's ok that she isn't running around screaming and dancing like the other girls in her class. Tell her it's ok if she needs to excuse herself to have a moment alone, and tell her not to be afraid to ask for the space she needs.    Or, if she decides she wants to try and make friends, tell her you're proud of her for being brave. And tell her that it might not always go the way she expects -- sometimes she might say something awkward and the other kids will laugh at her. Or she'll hear that someone said she was a weirdo for always being alone.   But if that happens, well, you can't control the way other people are going to act; you can't control the way people will see you. What you can control is the way you react to that. So what if making friends didn't work this time? She'll try again with some new kids tomorrow. Sometimes kids do stupid and mean things, but that doesn't mean all people are like that. So what if a classmate misinterpreted her silence and mistakenly thought she was stuck-up, or mean, or boring? They're wrong. She's not any of those things. She may not be bubbly and loud but she's got her own strengths, things that she's good at that those other kids would never be able to do. Maybe she's a good listener; maybe she's compassionate and empathetic. Make sure you tell her that.   The thing about introverted people is that she could be thinking any or all of these things and you might not ever know. You have to start the conversation and try to anticipate how she might feel and what might happen. But as extroverts, try and remember that she might see things completely differently than you, and try to be open to that.   I think it's wonderful that you're reaching out and trying to understand what might be helpful for an introvert rather than trying to change her. You sound like caring people and I think your daughter will be just fine."

You need to recognize this because the world will treat her like she is broken.  She just naturally sees the world differently.  If you haven't yet, please watch this TED Talk by Susan Cain: The Power of Introverts.  And if, this really strikes a note with you, I'd highly recommend her book as well by the same name.

I also have an extremely introverted son. I don't know if anything could have helped me ""make friends"" in school, classes are random and my interests were odd. What my mom did was just encourage me to be me. School was hell, but once it was done, the message she conveyed helped me to find my own friends that share interests.   What I haven't seen on here yet is computers. If you have the funds, getting into playing with, coding, and fixing computers can really bring out a kid, if they are interested. It's a puzzle, and invites a child to start interacting, at least online, with people they share interests with. My son started at about 8 with the simple stuff, and now (high school) does repairs for cash for classmates and has not only friends with that shared interest, but a possible career.

Once you get confident in your skills, seek other people who are in to the same things. Then, boom, you'll have something to talk about. A lot of my anxiety comes from being in social situations and having NOTHING to say to most people. You'll probably feel more comfortable if you can get lost in deep conversation.

Making friends usually means a group setting so find something you enjoy, a hobby or activity, and make friends there.

introvert,398ush,chattyyogalady,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:24:23 2015 UTC,"To some extent, I can relate to that, although I have always considered myself to be an introvert. I'm not really shy, but I am a bookworm and a creative type, and somehow the things that interest me most are always things that are typically done alone (reading, writing, mosaic art, drawing, swimming etc.) But I was definitely more outgoing when I was younger. In my early 20's I would still go out and socialize quite a lot. However, I was also single and student back then and did not work yet, so I knew that I'd also have enough time for myself and my hobbies when I got home or the next day.  Now I'm 28 and I've noticed that I've changed. If I had to say when it started, I'd guess it was around the time when I got my first full-time job. After work I was already tired and preferred to spent the little time left of the day with my ""introvert"" hobbies instead of socializing. I am also in a serious relationship now. My boyfriend is living with me and he's an introvert, too. We like spending our time together one on one, but we almost never have other people over for dinner etc. I still have my small circle of friends and meet up with them every now and then, but not as often as it used to be.  I think time plays an important role here - once you have a job and a serious relationship, you simply have less ""free"" time that you can entirely decide on your own how to spend it, and if your job is demanding, you get tired sooner, too. When did this transition from being more on the extroverted side to being an introvert start in your case?"
introvert,398ush,unholy_mantra,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:40:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful response! It sounds like you and I have a very similar situation, and I appreciate the empathy and understanding!  Let's so, when did things change... I think the more work I've done as a therapist, the less I've wanted to socialize. And I wonder if some of that is because I put more pressure on myself to listen and be present in general, so instead of being fun, socializing has become draining.  Also, during my last long term relationship (ages 28-31) my ex was insanely social, and I would socialize a lot with him. Before that I went out all the time on my own, but I think a lot of it was to meet guys, and fill the space of not having a partner with tons of friends. When I was with my ex for those 3 years, I remember not wanting to go out as much and getting annoyed that he wanted to go out all the time. After we broke up, I went out a lot again, but that was mainly to meet guys and fill the space again. Now I'm in a relationship with a mostly introverted boyfriend and we live together, so it's very easy to just do that every day, and super enjoyable.  I feel like I perceive myself as an extrovert. I have about 10 people that would consider me a best friend, I text with people constantly, I a excessively open with my thoughts and feelings, I love meeting new people and having new experiences and I connect pretty instantly to many people. However, like I said above, lately all of that has been so tiring, physically exhausting, and I prefer to use my free time to cook, take walks, binge watch shows, read things online, listen to podcasts... Basically do things where I can just receive and not give to anyone. And again, a lot of this may be because my job is so focused on giving that in my free time I'm just done giving!!"

Sure, you can't just pick out people who precisely will fit these parameters, but if you decide on what you want, you can go about getting it.  I used to look for reason to justify going separate ways, but then I realise that most people will naturally have to go their separate ways anyways, it's just how life works out."

When I was very young (middle/high school), I got into a fight with a friend because he failed to contact me to tell me he couldn't meet with me at a scheduled time. He thought I only wanted to be contacted if we were still going to meet. We called each other some pretty horrible things, then apologized like an hour later, after realizing how idiotic that was.

I learned a while back that cutting off people, because they or I was fallible, or disagreed on something 'that matters' isn't a good enough reason to burn that bridge. You can simply agree to disagree. (and ya might have to train them that this is where ""We agree to disagree, get it?!"")  Those low-maintenance friends are rare. Be very sure you HAVE to to burn that connection. (Because your ""wants"" will change over time.)  Good Luck."

If I'm passionate about something, chances are, I've thought it many times over. MANY times over- and I've been on both sides of the argument against myself. If something is worth being passionate over, it's worth finding out why. Why do I take such a strong stand? It's because points A, B, C. If point X happens to debunk my belief then I'll start over again and check out the other side of the argument starting from where my reasoning failed. There is always a chance that I am wrong.  Arguments aren't always about winning or losing them. There should always be a reservation for learning from them. If someone happens to bring up a point I had not thought of yet, then I will seriously consider it. It may change my mind and maybe it won't, but the point is to take that new perspective into account. If it forces you to change then accept it. If you can counter their point then your argument just got even stronger.

But then I thought to myself, ""why do something that makes me unhappy?"" So I stopped socializing almost entirely. I may seem aloof and avoidant to other people as you say, and I am. Why does that have to be a bad thing? I'd rather be honest with myself and other people than force myself to be someone I'm not. I don't care how other people perceive me, because I'm happy this way and if other people can't accept that, then I don't want to be their friend anyway. I'm not going to feel guilty over it because I'm simply happier this way.  What I'm trying to say is that you have nothing to be ashamed of and I don't see anything wrong with being more open about your preferences. There's nothing to feel guilty about if you don't enjoy socializing; you're just self aware and that's great!  I also think it's ridiculous that your mom reacted like that when you were younger. I mean seriously? So you didn't feel like hanging out with someone, big deal. And she actually cried about that? That's just unbelievable. I ignore calls and texts all the time (unless it appears to be important). Do my friends think I'm a dick because of it? Probably. Do I care? Nope. I reckon having social interaction put up on such a high pedestal when you were a kid is why you feel so guilty as an adult, and that's a real shame.  Bottom line is that there may have been a time where I felt guilty over not socializing, but that's long in the past now. I'm fully self-aware and I know what makes me happy, and I'm not afraid to be upfront about it. I am who I am and if someone doesn't like it then screw them.   I hope I helped you in some way."

My mom's reaction at the time was painful (one of those iconic memories from youth- I felt terrible after that happened and that's when the shame started).

introvert,392hn6,FurriesRuinEverythin,2,Tue Jun 9 00:06:55 2015 UTC,"I tend to think of socialising as like healthy exercise that I ought to do regularly but don't like all that much. How much it actually matters must depend on your situation.  You might have some sort of duty to stay in touch with friends or family, for reasons. Their opinion about how often you should visit isn't necessarily the correct opinion, but it's a factor. I don't get any pressure from my friends, but if I don't see them for, say, a year, catching up again can be stilted and awkward, so I aim to see them moderately often. (Falling out of touch with all my friends seems like a poor life strategy.) Also, since I live alone, if I go for, say, a couple of weeks without talking to anyone, later on when I do have to talk to somebody it's a bit daunting, and when I'm out somewhere I start to feel weird and awkward and generally intimidated. I socialise to stay in practice, just for practicality.  If I had somebody similarly introverted to live with, I think I'd just turtle up with her, and everybody else could sod off, and that would be fine - but that's only possible because I don't have any particular duty to anyone; I mean nobody is attached enough to me to be needy about visits. I'd probably still go to one or two birthday parties over a year, but I wouldn't feel so concerned about whether I was socialising enough, so long as I had just that one other person with me to ensure that I get a second opinion about everything I do, and remember how to speak.  It's up to you to decide exactly what duty you think you have, but you might have some duty, if people want your attention and deserve it. It can be a kind of necessary upkeep. Like exercise, I find it's not so bad once I begin. Still kind of boring though."
introvert,392hn6,skeletorsbutt,2,Tue Jun 9 03:34:51 2015 UTC,"Don't take this as me carrying on about myself, but I have had similar experiences. I used to feel bad. I used to ""want"" friends, and felt bad that I was alone, it used to depress me. In recent years I've started discovering myself a bit. Now I realise that I didn't actually want friends, or to be around other people. I just wanted to do what society, other people really, expected of me. I was very confused about myself.   Now I stay home all the time, save for my bike rides, work and grocery shopping. I don't like to go out - so I don't. I find socialising difficult and awkward, I don't know how to talk to people, and I really don't enjoy it at all - so I don't do it. I have absolutely no desire to find a partner, I like the aloneness and I don't want somebody else ruining it.   And all of that will never change about me. I've learned to accept that that's the way I am, and that it's not wrong. And that I'm not antisocial at all, no matter what people tell me. That it's everyone else expecting this of me that are the problem. And I get it from all kinds of places, even from doctors and so called ""health professionals."" But I don't let that bullshit affect me any more. I don't feel any guilt whatsoever anymore.   You do what makes you happy as a person, fuck other peoples expectations on socialising, and other peoples opinions of you. Let them think what they want, what they think doesn't affect you. And don't put those expectations on yourself either."

I know they love me and understand that I get tired easily from all the social interaction, but I can't help but feel guilty about it. For example, my husband gets a text this morning that one of our buds is incredibly depressed - and he just grabs his stuff and runs to their rescue. He loves rushing in to be a helping hand and all...but I've been down that road. I used to be the ""on call"" friend that would rush over at a moment's notice if someone was going through depression. It left me exhausted and emotionally wiped out, but people reached out to me - so I helped. After he left, I just felt kind of sad that no one really reaches out to me like that anymore. I mean, I know he's more social than I am, and they know I like my space, but it still makes me feel guilty for taking time out for myself.

introvert,392hn6,johnsmcjohn,2,Tue Jun 9 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"I have realized that ""being alone"" is different than ""being lonely.""  The introvert prefers being alone. This is a scale: some like to take one evening a week to just ""do whatever"" to recharge, then party/socialize all week. While others can only take one hour a week to make themselves socialize, and come away exhausted.  Being lonely, wanting to socialize, yet being exhausted by the actions of socialization is one of our biggest hurdles, IMO. Like managing any other situation, it takes time and experience to realize what works and what doesn't. Some would say 'like managing any other mental illness' to which I raise an eyebrow and shake my head - this is not an illness. This is a state of being.  While we are deviants from the standard 'Social Animal' of a human, we are normal. I equivocate Introverts like the rare lone wolf. Wolves are pack animals: They have a mentality that loan themselves to a social hierarchy. there is a Alpha- the leader, the Beta and so on down to the Omega - the whipping boy.  But the Lone Wolf is truly separate from the pack. They don't participate in the pack's 'pecking order.'  They roam, occasionally grouping with other Lone Wolves to hunt, mate or travel/run.        Introverts are humanity's Lone Wolves.  (I recommend the book by the researcher of the last name Mech, an authority on wolf behavior. Dry, but an interesting read. I also recommend the SF book ""Wolf and Iron"" by Gordon R. Dickson, the author did a great job of personifying a lone wolf.)  [small edit] reworded a sentence."

introvert,38x00r,number12345678909876,7,Sun Jun 7 15:38:22 2015 UTC,"I had a friend that I met and wanted to get closer to. We seemed to have a lot in common.  She wanted to hang out like...every day. She would text me every day wanting to hang out. I'd go to her place. She had no plans. No ideas of stuff to DO. So we'd just sit around, watch TV, talk..etc.  We aren't friends anymore. The few friends I have are friends I'll never give up. I've moved away from them, but I can still see them a few times a year and it's like we pick right up where we left off. I love it. I can't be around someone every day unless I'm going to marry them."
introvert,38x00r,jojotoughasnails,3,Sun Jun 7 16:00:10 2015 UTC,"I deal with it by not having these kinds of friends, but that's a trick that comes with time, and not everyone is comfortable with letting people get distant just because they're occasionally annoying.  Maybe giving it a framework would help? Like setting aside one or two days a week where social stuff takes priority and, when people contact you, saying you can't make it tonight but how about Saturday?  There's also the active aspect - you can gain some control over this situation by being the person who initiates social actions, contacts people asking to hang out (on your preferred day/s), and so on. If someone's already seen you in the last three to seven days, and they know you're usually only available on certain days, it's less likely they'll try and keep getting you to randomly hang out on other days."
introvert,38x00r,Geminii27,3,Sun Jun 7 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"I respond similarly. Its pretty rare that I straight up ignore people. But I don't feel obligated to pick up my phone or text back immediately. These days I mostly just hang out with my gf because we are both very introverted. I think my friends are getting frustrated but... they like to drink and I don't for one thing. Hate parties. Also, it sounds bad but a decent percentage of the time it feels like people are kicking in my door to go do shit they like and that I'm not crazy about. I am slowly turning into a hermit."
introvert,38x00r,Shutup_Baby_I_knowit,3,Sun Jun 7 23:41:47 2015 UTC,"I have the exact problem you described in your final sentence.   I went out with my friends a week ago Friday. I was sort of dreading it all week, but went because I knew it would be fine once I got there. One friend insisted on driving together, I said ""No, I'll just meet you there..."" No dice. She ended up inviting herself into my house for two hours. I pretty much know it's because she didn't want to go home and be alone. She even hinted at staying the night, but I shot that down. I had one friend invite herself to go grocery shopping with me once, who does that???  I have couple friends that completely get it and know that when I say no sometimes it's just because I need to be alone - nothing against them, it's just the way I am. I have a few though that do not like to be alone at all and they just can't accept that it doesn't bother me. They get extremely pushy about plans, want to know what I'm doing instead, who I'm with, it's nuts. If I have to fib a little every now and then to get some alone time I'm completely fine with that.  This weekend there was another event planned. Rather than try to explain why I just didn't want to go I told them I was going out of town."
introvert,38x00r,W0NDERMUTT,3,Sun Jun 7 23:44:54 2015 UTC,"I can relate to most of what you said OP except for the athletic part. I wasn't very athletic but still had enough friends from High School and early College years that I got many messages asking me to hang out with them.   The outcome is rather grim. I ignored the majority of their requests and eventually alienated myself from most of my friends. Currently I am a 23 year old male with a job and very few friends, but that's how I'm happy. I just want to be left alone and I'm perfectly happy that way. Alienating those close to me was just a necessary step to reach this outcome, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Truly.   That said, there are still many options for you. You could wish that your friends are understanding of your introverted nature and will respond to advances you make, or you could alienate all of your friends like I have and focus on your profession, or you could put on a 'mask' and follow the whims of your friends even when you'd rather not.   I'll end by saying that there's nothing wrong with being selfish. You don't need to have people around you at all times if you aren't comfortable that way. Just do what feels right to you and be happy that you can react to your feelings."
introvert,38x00r,Nihil_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"Last time I had this problem I didn't even know I was an introvert, let alone what an introvert was. That was back in Elementary school.  Though based on my experiences back then, I think an introvert can have a great time with an extrovert anytime so long as it's just you two and you're doing stuff that's more fun together to begin with. Whether it's playing video games, climbing trees or what have you. And since they're an extrovert they shouldn't pester you to hang out too often since they likely have other friends too. This is how you know they treat you as an individual friend instead of another contact to call out to hang at random times to boost their social meter or whatever.  The people around me these days all seem to realize that I'm not really the sorta person to hang out randomly for no reason. I think you just need to try and make your friends aware of this and maybe they'll realize that you're more the sorta person to wants to spend genuine quality time with friends when hanging out, which tends to lead to better friendships as well."
introvert,38x00r,glowaru,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:47:12 2015 UTC,"It depends what they want to do. I don't really like going out to bars or clubs, unless it is for a special occasion then I suck it up. My friends are similar to me though. When they want to hang out it usually means play video games, watch youtube, get high, have a few beers, shoot the shit. So I usually take them up on the offer."

introvert,38v93i,skywyze,19,Sun Jun 7 03:02:49 2015 UTC,"I rarely, if ever, get lonely and am at my most relaxed when alone.  What makes this bad (in my mind) is that I have kids and a husband, I feel like I should want to spend my down time with them but I need a break even from them sometimes."
introvert,38v93i,Oz_ghoti,8,Sun Jun 7 03:49:03 2015 UTC,Does this strain your relationship? I'm not married or anything but I feel my introversion sometimes strains relationships with my friends and family.
introvert,38v93i,kennyeast,5,Sun Jun 7 04:13:26 2015 UTC,"It's not too bad, my husband is also an introvert so he gets it.  I feel bad that I sometimes need space from the kids but I think every parent feels this way at times.  We make sure to take outings in turns - sometimes all of us will do something together and sometimes I'll take the kids to the zoo or something and give my husband a few hours 'off' and he does the same.  I think it's important to be able to compromise.  We also have no issue doing things independently of each other, there is no need to be constantly in each other's pockets.  With regards to family and friends I think they get it by now - I am generally one of the first to leave a party if I don't know a lot of people and am FAR better at handling dinner parties with one or two other couples than a whole horde.  I think it's a matter of finding friends who get you and who are okay with you needing time alone to recharge.  If they are dicks about it I would reevaluate the value of the friendship.  Can't do much about family I'm afraid, except to maybe say explain to them that you require time by yourself in order to recharge your social batteries and that it's not that you're avoiding being with them - make it about you rather than them.  It's amazing what a little communication can do."

I was talking to my husband about this post last night and he said he feels like he couldn't have any other type of relationship which is good.  We definitely still have our issues but we're in the same boat with regards to wanting to work on them.   He's planning on taking the kids to the zoo today so WOOT WOOT!"
introvert,38v93i,redditmoose,5,Sun Jun 7 22:42:04 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat.  I only ever want two things from people.   to discuss sociological and technological shift and their take on it about once a week to validate and expand on my paradigms intimacy   Instead she wants to talk about food and shopping for things we need and.. and..

introvert,38v93i,JamesonJenn,8,Sun Jun 7 09:05:52 2015 UTC,"I once dated someone extremely extroverted. He would get seriously depressed if he didn't go hangout with a group of people. I also would constantly wonder about how it would feel to need to be around people all of the time. It didn't seem like the best hand to be dealt in life. You either spend your time getting friends together to hang out, or you get depressed when it doesn't happen. I know this last part is probably a ridiculous thought, but I always find myself wondering - if you're always spending every waking minute trying to be around a bunch of people, how do you find the time to grow yourself or work on the things you want to do in your life? I think that's why we broke up."
introvert,38v93i,infiniteloooop,3,Sun Jun 7 15:59:18 2015 UTC,I had an ex like this once too. Constant sense of restlessness and need to be around and to be known by throngs of people.

introvert,38v93i,MIGHTeeMau5,5,Sun Jun 7 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"The same thought came across me this past week that maybe I SHOULD be lonely for interaction with others once a while.  After being invited to a party and going & since it was national donut day, I picked a couple dozen for everyone for those I know to be munchie appetites .  45 minutes in after listening to the horde of party attendees drunk banter on about supposedly necessary things to a say out loud or even have conversations about? felt the most bored and ""lonely"" while being around all these people, made the good for me and without hesitation decision its time to head home.  TL;DR delivered donuts only to discover I'm not lonely.   ^ If this phrase becomes a plot of the next shitty movie, i want a cut. ^"
introvert,38v93i,infiniteloooop,5,Sun Jun 7 11:13:11 2015 UTC,"I think your story illustrates that being lonely is not the same as feeling lonely and thinking that you are lonely. And just because for the sake of social adherence, we don't need to feel lonely because we are not 'sociable' enough for extroverts. Are we often alone? Yes. Do we feel alone? No.  For me though, and to be honest, I sometimes do crave for a few people around me, but only close friends. It is rare, but it does happen."
introvert,38v93i,Furah,2,Sun Jun 7 12:43:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, even as an extremely introverted where I will crave and count down the time til my next alone opportunity...Sometime and some few I won't mind being around to share thoughts & ideas with."
introvert,38v93i,Furah,6,Mon Jun 8 03:44:00 2015 UTC,"Not really ever lonely. In fact, the only thing that makes me feel weird/bad is the stigma that being alone is wasting time, or that I'm some kind of loser for spending so much time not with friends. It's an accepted social standard that lots of friends = happy/healthy/normal. Best I can do is justify that I do it in order to focus on practicing my art. But in reality, I'm just enjoying the millions of thoughts that race through my head, and the patience I give myself to entertain them and make something out of them.  Edit: to address your last point about being misanthropic, I don't think not feeling lonely can alone be correlated to disliking people. I feel other factors have to be present too, like being annoyed at a lot of tiny mannerisms of the public, or even just a few people you run into daily. Or just generally having a negative outlook of humankind/social situations. I don't think you subconsciously dislike people with out really acting on it just by liking yourself enough to not need company. :)"
introvert,38v93i,Furah,4,Sun Jun 7 16:02:19 2015 UTC,"Prior to struggling with depression, I've never cared. A day, a week, a month without people made no difference to me. My girlfriend wasn't pleased with this apathy towards consistent human contact.  Now? I mostly don't care. The only real difference is that I don't feel the same way towards my girlfriend. I get sad if I don't see her often. More annoyingly, I get depressed if I go more than a few days without sex."

It was glorious not wanting sex, ever. I felt so free. If you'd like to try it, it's called Propecia, and it's a really liberating feeling.

introvert,38wjdj,4cb,6,Sun Jun 7 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"I just feel like saying here you don't need to be an extrovert to be able to do crazy stuff. In fact, the best part of being an introvert is it doesn't take much for you to experience new / crazy (on a relative scale to what you're used to)! Also, travelling alone is excellent way to go if you'd like to try a ""different persona"", not having to be the person you are expected to be! I love travelling alone and getting lost in the moment - it brings for exciting adventures and no one to have to answer to, making decisions at whim. Some of my best travel experiences :   Glastonbury festival. Multiple days of multiple stages of music, performing arts and everything you could ever dream of, where you could make a new friend even if you aren't trying.  Watching a total solar eclipse from a catamaran on the Great Barrier Reef. I honestly had no idea what to expect - but it was at that surreal moment that everything went completely quiet for the few minutes of totality, speechless and in awe. Iceland. Did the drive along the ring road and witnessed all forms of natural beauty that pictures just won't do it justice, a spectacular Northern Lights show, freaking out over multiple snowstorms when driving along the mountain trail, eating (what tasted like)rotten shark!"
introvert,38wjdj,FunkyHairBalls,3,Sun Jun 7 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"Some kind of a multi-day festival (music, tradition, celebration, holiday, etc.). They usually include a lot of drunk happy people. Pretty much anything can happen when you have a town full of people that reach that state. Doesn't even matter if you don't speak their language- you'll understand each other through laughs, gestures, and attempts at pronouncing words from each other's language. I suggest bringing a friend. You can divide and conquer or stick together. The stories you share after the event will be great fun. Plus you have an extra set of trusted eyes. Las Vegas seems like the classic answer. Especially if you get lucky and make a couple bucks. Not sure how much you're willing to spend though. Macau. It's supposed to be an upgraded Las Vegas. Hong Kong. It's supposed to have very busy night life. Again, price might be up there. Amsterdam. Cafes and redlight district. Mexico. I've been once with a friend for a few days. The whole trip is a big blur to me. I remember that I watched cock fights, people fights, ate fresh food everyday (I actually met the calf that I later ate...), shopped, drank- it was really fun. I talked to a lot of people too, apparently. I don't speak Spanish."

It was not expensive at all, but that was because I went with a friend who had family there. So I lived with them. BUT I remember buying a round of drinks for a group of people. I don't know how many people it was, but everyone who was standing around me at that bar got a drink on me. Total was ~200 peso, which comes out to $12.73 USD based on exchange rates according to Google.  There were street food vendors as well. Fresh delicious fruits/juice, ceviche, tacos/wraps, burgers, etc. were all very cheap. So food cost was not an issue.  Edit: Oh, also on day2, I went out to exchange some money. I think I exchanged a total of $300 USD. I didn't get to spend it all. The trip was in 2008."

introvert,38u5wl,saladdaysareover,9,Sat Jun 6 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"they would never make an effort to hangout with me outside of their shows   One thing that I learned after enduring a lot of crippling loneliness because of this is that most people, including myself, have this mindset of ""If they like me, they will initiate something and hang out with me"". But what happens when everyone is waiting for the other person to pursue a friendship? Instead of feeling like our value is based on how many people pursue us, we should be making all of the efforts to pursue friendships as we desire them. If you want to be someone's friend, ask them to hang out with you. Say ""Hey, wanna meet up and get some coffee? Wanna go to this show with me? Are you going to X this year? What are you up to this weekend?"" Don't allow yourself to not do it because you've convinced yourself that they are not interested. It's so silly! People are busy. But people love friends.  People stop talking to me all the time. Even my closest friends. But what I've learned is that when people stop talking to me, it is not because they don't like me. It's not because I have pushed them away. It's because they are busy with other aspects of their life, especially at our age (I'm 19 as well). I know that we all want to be everyone's top priority, but it's just unrealistic. We have to pursue all that we want relentlessly and do not allow this silly fear of ""what if they don't like me"" to keep us from making friends with awesome people that love us and care about us.   People love people who are persistent in upholding relationships. I know I do. So I try to be that person."
introvert,38u5wl,barkleyf2,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yep I been working on this and learned that I have a big influence in a lot of circles (having different types of friends helps), so I can pop up, group 3-5 ppl, enjoy their company and go back to hiding for a few weeks/months.

introvert,38u5wl,elausto,3,Wed Jun 10 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"Hey OP read through the thread and there's some really great advice. Wanted to add in my own as someone in a similar boat.    Don't off yourself. It isn't worth it. I'm not going to bs you and say it gets better, but you can win friends.  for some people having a bazillion people like them and want to hang out with them is a purely effortless thing. For the rest of us mere mortals there's a ton of work involved in gaining and keeping friends. You're going to have to initiate inside and outside of your scene. By that i mean ask those musicians about their other hobbies, tell them about yours and offer / ask to hang out for both. learn to be OK by yourself. If you're not OK by yourself other people aren't going to be OK around you. Besides you rock (literally). Don't get hung up on other people being a panacea.  Fact is we've been sold a pretty tale about life and most of it is crap. Not everyone gets hitched, has kids, or wins at love or life. That's why is important to be OK with who you are, even if the world collapses if you're OK with you you'll be OK anywhere.   [Edit: Formatting.]"
introvert,38u5wl,Shibboleeth,2,Sun Jun 7 03:07:19 2015 UTC,"I was like this in High School and in my early College years. That is, I wasn't particularly gifted at holding on to friendships. It seemed like the more I got to know someone, the more I would start to dislike being around them. So really my actual issue was that I was living in a widely social world and grew up thinking I had to be the same way, but I would kind of subconsciously push people away and then wonder why a particular relationship was botched.   Over time, I became more and more self aware. I was forcing myself to try and be someone I'm not, and as a result I was wholly unhappy. Eventually I accepted that I'm an introverted individual and that I very much prefer to be on my own, and furthermore I'm kind of misanthropic. My past relationships weren't successful because as I said, I just dislike individuals the more I get to know them. I don't have any close 'best friends' and I don't want any. Having someone know so much about me and I about them makes me uncomfortable. So now I build 'walls', so to speak, and keep people at a distance. To some people I know that probably sounds depressing and lonely, but or me it's not. It's how I'm the happiest. I feel more in touch with reality when I'm home alone reading a book and listening to music than if I were at a bar socializing. No - instead, for me I feel more lonely and uncomfortable when I'm surrounded by more people. I'm positive there are people here who can relate to that sentiment. There's nothing wrong with feeling like that.   So. You ask: ""what the fuck am I doing wrong?"" Based on what little bit I know about you and from my personal experience that I outlined above, I'd say that perhaps what's wrong is that you may lack a sense of self. What truly makes you happy? Are you actually upset when a friendship doesn't go anywhere, or are you just trying so hard to meet a kind of social quota that may not actually fit your personal agenda? You say you see people in massive groups of friends and that you're stuck with only a few people that you know. So what? If a person has a ton of friends it doesn't make them a better person than a person with fewer friends. Why are you comparing yourself to them? What makes you think you need to be like them in order to be happy? I'm much more comfortable having a handful of friends that I know very well. In fact, I'd say that at the moment I have 3 actual friends and some acquaintances, and all of my friends I know strictly through the internet. I'm happy that way. Being self aware, understanding, and accepting myself for who I am was the defining moment where I finally felt free and unchained. Don't evaluate yourself based on society's apparent criteria. Learn who you are and embrace it - don't try and be somebody you're not. Know thyself.   I hope this helps somehow."

Don't try to fit in, I understand it's a bit of a high school thing (something that I'm trying to unlearn) but I've learned I really enjoy doing things that I want and I end up talking about those things with people.

This means wide body jets can't come here. The airport is mostly for freight and what not. There is one commercial airline though. The planes they fly are tiny Saab 340's. On the left side of the plane there are single seats, on the right there are double. I love flying on them, when you book by yourself you always get to be on the single seat side, it's awesome. Usually this is only half of my holiday travel, once I get to Adelaide I have to go on a larger plane with 3 seats each side :("

Also try to convey that how outgoing you are and how intro/extroverted you are is comparing apples and oranges.   Take me for an example - I'm extremely friendly and outgoing, and can hold a conversation with just about anyone due to my natural curiosity in how others' live their lives. But at the same time, I am 110% an introvert. After like 4 or so hours being constantly engaged with people, I need to recharge.   If she can't accept this, then the harsh reality is that it probably won't work out in the long run. I remember I once dated a very extroverted girl who took it personally when I didn't want to hang out with her every single day for 6+ hours. I kept trying to explain to her that it wasn't any lack of interest in her, but rather my introvertedness. Oddly enough, this was a prime reason that we ended up breaking up."

I can switch from one to the other the very next day. It's quite frustrating because I still haven't figured out what things trigger the times when I'm socially inept. At first I thought it was my clothes that gave me that confidence boost but nope, today I looked like a complete bum but I was still able to socialize better than I normally could.  It's not that it's social anxiety (I do have it though, in some situations, like meeting new people) but it's just days where I feel slightly more extroverted. It's weird."

I was so ‘on’ socially it was amazing but when I fell off the cliff it hit me hard cause I realized what I could be, and what I had fallen back into.  But I actually believe self-acceptance and self-love is the way out. When you are nice to yourself you come out of funks faster I find, and don’t beat yourself up when your just finding your way into conversations at the start of the day.

Coffee on the other which is a socially accepted thing along with the social aspect of sipping java is much better at this.  I completely agree on the ""self-acceptance and self-love"" thing.

If I now I will be in a social environment that I cannot avoid, or I need to attend, I will prepare myself mentally, and then 'flip the switch', if you will.

I can recall moments where socializing was inevitable and necessary and though my mood wasn't there for the taking it appeared eventually. Almost like I just decided, ""this is how it's gonna be"". It sort of forced me into this mindset. This event expects you to socialize!  Have you found some magic ""flip switching"" method?  It may be some kind of mania though as well. I mean confidence tends to be a little firmer and cognition also seems more sharp, but again that may be due to me feeling more at ease and in control socially."
introvert,38jh7k,mccandel,5,Thu Jun 4 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I have a 'magic method'.  It has just developed mostly over the past year.  I am a Cadet, and so the close-knit and face-to-face nature of the Academy has kind of forced me to pick up cues, and also to value my alone time more.  But if it is an even I know will be quite social, I definitely need 10-15 minutes to mentally prep myself with thoughts like ""be energetic, you're gonna have to interact with people, but it won't be too long"".  Sometimes thinking of world happenings or topics that personally get me excited can help change emotions and my frame of mind.  The best suggestion I have is try to deflect the conversation's focus to the person you end up speaking with.  The easiest question to ask is ""what have you been up to recently"", if you are acquainted with the person, but not super close friends.  If you don't know them, simple questions about where they study, work, live, etc.  If they are asking you about yourself, you can give a short answer, and then ask them the same question.  Odds are, if they are more extroverted, they'll talk a little more.   The FORD acronym is helpful too, I have found: Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams/Aspirations.  Ask them questions about those topics, as they are relatively neutral and self-focused (If you are Batman, the information from those topics can be useful...)  Generally, though, if I don't like the conversation, I will say that I need to grab a drink or use the restroom.  This take more time to get down, but being dry and straightforward (something we introverts can do fairly well) to a very mildly abrasive extent can shorten the small talk too as it can make the other person feel slightly awkward.  Also, and the end of a conversation, pulling out your phone and looking like you are busy (no, you don't have to have a phone call with yourself, but you can if you want) helps. I use that one a lot to create space around me and to give me 5-7 minutes of personal time to get that 'recharge' we introverts need.  Conversation/small talk is an art.  It isn't easy, but the more I did it, the better I  got at it, but that doesn't mean I like it  more!"

introvert,38jq29,Hello-their,3,Thu Jun 4 18:56:19 2015 UTC,I don't really have a problem with public speaking.  I think it's because I get to skip the smalltalk and banality that comes from conversations with people I don't know.  I get to talk about something I am interested in and passionate about.
introvert,38jq29,jward,2,Thu Jun 4 22:11:50 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way as you do.  I am typically the only introverted person in my group.  I find this means I am a lot more focused on the task at hand, and I end up knowing the material much more.  I have also observed this of other introverted people I have worked with.  Public speaking is a drain on energy, but because it isn't a conversation, and it is more or less an in-depth examination of information (something I can normally interest myself with), speaking about it articulately becomes sort of easy (but I also rehearse, I have to be knowledgeable on a subject before I can talk about it in an impromptu scenario).  I think part of this comes from how I look at the writing process.  The difference for me between presentations and essays is really only a matter of tone.  Having said that, I think that this also involves inherent skills and strengths.  Some people just happen to be good and public speaking, whether or not they are introverted or extroverted.  Despite my inclinations to not want to communicate with people frequently, I find that I am pretty good at communication skills."

And if people aren't interested in those ideas, then it offers us a chance to make them interested.   I don't agree about the continual practice part through. I'm also a final year student, and I don't think I've ever practised for a public presentation in my life. Obviously I jot down my ideas, but I get too distracted with prepared speeches and cue cards, and never stick with them anyway.   What really makes a great speaker, is someone that can be (or at least appear) comfortable in front of an audience. There's nothing about extroverts that make them any more suited for public speaking than introverts. It's true that good speakers will connect with their audience, but such connections are far more nuanced than the typical day to day interactions that extroverts seem to thrive off."

If you are prepared for the presentation, you will know the information. Introvert or extrovert doesn't matter at this point.

I can relate especially to the mental health misdiagnosis of depression/anxiety for introversion. I really hate how this country is so predominantly extroverted that anyone who is introverted is not only considered different but considered abnormal and defective. I didn't face a whole lot of bullying but I was definitely treated and am treated differently, by people because I am not an extrovert. You're right, the bullying and past experiences really do stick, it's not something that you can just let go of and move on about too easily.  It's really empowering to hear you talk about this. Thank you."
introvert,38hboz,Gromit43,7,Thu Jun 4 06:32:34 2015 UTC,"When I was started grade school my mother was beginning to notice that something was different (wrong) with me. I never played enough with any of my cousins, friends and hid too much in my room. She was embarrassed by my strange behavior and consistently forced me into awkward social situations, to ""break me out of my shell.""   I can relate to this so much.  I'm not introverted, ambiverted if anything, but this is my life right now.  My mum's incredibly extroverted and she believes that people who find it hard to socialise have something wrong with themselves.  My boyfriend's probably the most introverted person I know, and I love him, but Mum thinks that due to his quietness he doesn't have an opinion or something.  Social awkwardness to her is one of the worse things.  I have been coached on how to act in certain situations and she often voices that people acting in certain ways is 'odd' or 'weird' when in all honesty the people have probably just had enough of her."

Maybe in a one-off situation you can just look past it and forget about it, but when it's continuous and goes of daily for up to years - it really does take it's toll. It makes the introverted more introverted I'd say, and leaves deep scars.   I feel I got luck with my life, I got into a very social circle when i hit my late teens and although I've always been introverted and enjoyed spending most of my time alone I have learned how to come out of my shell a bit more than if I wasn't in this social circle.   Cool post, looking forward to part #2 :)  edit; I did also self diagnose with social-anxiety - but I think my anxiety was more to do with my introversion... being frustrated that I wasn't a social butterfly and really beating myself up about it."
introvert,38hboz,Be-Bop-Brew,2,Thu Jun 4 10:14:58 2015 UTC,"being frustrated that I wasn't a social butterfly and really beating myself up about it.   This is my story too. Except, for a long time, I felt rejected by society just because I wasn't treated well by a few people. This feeling of being rejected was mixed with an authoritarian egocentric father, emotionally absent mother and an egocentric sister. I am not sure which thing did more damage.  I am in therapy and it helped me a lot. I am trying to figure out what I want. Currently I am in the stage where I don't know what I want.  Edit: I know I am introverted because I remember that in kindergarten I used play alone or sometimes joining someone else at the table. I always built something using bricks and I don't remember running around the room or anything like that. I also often observed other children running around and playing.  Ofc I also know I have social anxiety."
introvert,38hboz,anintrovert2,2,Thu Jun 4 18:23:34 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the fact you grew up constantly surrounded by people and forced into social situations, with no time alone, contributed at all to your introversion.    It may have nothing to do with it, and I've done no research into the 'science of introversion' or anything, but I grew up with a lot of interaction and socialising at all times, and I wonder whether it made me more desiring of alone time. Many friends I know who crave company at all times could have time alone whenever they wanted. I wonder if the history of being forced into socialising, causes one to prefer solitude. Just a thought."

introvert,38hboz,JerryLeRow,2,Thu Jun 4 11:06:47 2015 UTC,"Yup! You hit it spot on about the fad of introversion. It pretty much goes along with the hipster scene- everyone wants to be different because we're all so ""connected"" through the internet. Mass media sites like BuzzFeed eat this stuff up and then throw it back to the people who are waiting for the opportunity to claim their piece.   Even the MBTI can be manipulated. I've posted the flaws of the test once here on Reddit and it got downvoted hard. The worst part was that it was a post in an introvert sub! No one wants the truth, they just want what they are looking to hear.  Honestly, after reading your story, I couldn't say for sure if you are an introvert. There seems to be a lot more there than just introversion. Bullies do leave behind scars that aren't so easily ""let go of"" and having parents who don't acknowledge/support you through those times properly only adds fuel to the fire.   ""Develop a sense of pride.""   If introversion is the only thing at play here and I'm wrong about the deeper issues- then developing a sense of pride is, very much so, great advice.   You should realize that introversion isn't something to be looked down on. You don't need any procedures to follow for children! Just be a good parent/adult to them! Listen to what kids say! Don't assume that just because you're older you automatically know how to solve every problem that kids have. The world changes and your experiences don't always translate well to their problems- sounds so simple on paper!  A sense of pride in who you are. If you're an introvert, own it. You can turn down that invitation. Reason? 'Cuz you're an adult and you can do whatever you want. Low self esteem does sound right here if you don't know what a sense of pride is. Know your capabilities and your limits. Accept your limits, but work to break them.  Sure your father wasn't always there. Your mother pushed you in to things you didn't want. You had bullies. Your therapists misdiagnosed you and were no help. People have tainted the word introvert. But what have you done to change it all?"
introvert,38hboz,WearWhatWhere,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:59:50 2015 UTC,Re: introversion as a fad  It's important to remember that one of the reasons more people are identifying as introverted because they're finally finding a word for it and are feeling comfortable doing so.
introvert,38hboz,Crushgaunt,2,Thu Jun 4 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"Introversion is not something one needs coping strategies for, nor is it something that should be spoken of like it is a mental health issue. It is personality type present in ~50% of the population, possibly significantly more.   The US us undoubtedly the current pinnacle of extraversion and that is likely a pain in the ass to most intriverts. But.

I would always want to have a friend over at my house or be at theirs, and I would frequently be the kid in class who needed to be told to shut up.    Middle school was rough, as it is for most people (or so I have observed).  It was really just three years of me trying and competing for recognition from my peers.  Confidence was always an issue for me.  It wasn't until I made my fourth international move that I realized that my peers weren't worth the time, and any gratification I got from their recognition or interaction with them was meaningless.  From that point on, it was just an inward journey of discovery and reflection."

introvert,38jlx2,mccandel,3,Fri Jun 5 06:58:03 2015 UTC,I think it's hard to tell. The time I spend being social is usually 50/50 fun vs regrettable. It depends on who you would have been spending that time with I guess.
introvert,38jlx2,ghostchief,8,Thu Jun 4 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"No, I don't. Introvert's who I am. I don't need socializing to be happy. All I need to smile is have an interesting hobby I can spend my time on. Maybe I'm more introverted than average (I sometime feel so), but I really couldn't care less about being social.   [edit] Damn, someone replied to this comment of mine and now their comment went missing.  I can only see it in Reddit Mail (and only in Now for Reddit). Wtf?"
introvert,38irt7,Smithers66,7,Thu Jun 4 14:20:19 2015 UTC,"First thing to get out of the way: having anxiety isn't a hallmark of introversion and isn't necessarily related. Sometimes people with an introverted personality have anxiety issues, sometimes we don't; sometimes people with an extraverted personality have anxiety issues, sometimes they don't.  To answer your question itself, I'd recommend keeping in mind that if you as parents are the ones that mention it it comes across as him having a problem and he definitely looks like a child. If he mentions it it's questionable as to if they'll respect to severity of what's going on.  You may want to have him do it but be prepared to vouch for him."
introvert,38irt7,Crushgaunt,3,Thu Jun 4 15:54:09 2015 UTC,This might not be possible depending on the nature of anxiety but it'd be best for him to talk to them himself (along with some supporting documentation). It would be difficult but he would learn some valuable communication skills and if the anxiety is a long term problem then he would learn to handle it in a work environment. Technically if you have a medical problem that affects your work it's best to disclose it because it saves both parties some frustration and miscommunication.
introvert,38irt7,statmarker,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"Unless his anxiety is very severe, he should handle this himself. Behavior therapy really helped me with my anxiety. You have to find the right person, but he's likely going to have it the rest of his life so needs to learn how to manage it, especially coupled with introversion in an extroverted-facing society."

Then my mother moved us from Southern California, to the middle of nowhere in Arkansas. Needless to say I had a bad case of culture shock and became withdrawn and self-conscious and never really recovered. I was 14 when we made the move."
introvert,38fgvk,ixiz0,3,Wed Jun 3 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Happened to me during my last years of primary school. I had plenty of friends and was a popular kid so I was pretty out there at the time. I went to a completely different highschool compared to most kids, so I didn't know anyone and that's when I changed over completely. Things just haven't been the same since. But after being in uni now for my second year I'm trying my best to do stuff and go out even if I don't want to."
introvert,38fgvk,Pattyyy,3,Thu Jun 4 00:16:09 2015 UTC,"This happened to me when I started middle school. My very first day I walked into class and was unable to say a word to anyone. All through out grade school I was loud, always getting in trouble for talking, so I'm not really sure what happened. I try not to think about it because it really weirds me out. It's like as soon as I got to school someone stole my personality."
introvert,38fgvk,kellygreenkitty,3,Thu Jun 4 01:37:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. I remember having lots of friends in elementary and part of middle school. In 7th grade when i went through puberty i became very self concious and became an introvert. It was a weird change since before that i used to be straight A student, i used to raise my hand for everything, loved reading aloud to the class and reading my stories. After puberty? Bad grades, hated attention, never participated in class. It was very strange."
introvert,38fgvk,griss0,2,Thu Jun 4 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"Extroverts are people who's thoughts travel along a certain brain pathway called the dopamine sympathetic passageway. This neurological pathway for thoughts is very short, (compared to the acetylcholine pathway that intriverts use, which is long) and extroverts use this pathway to quickly process information. As I'm sure you know, extroverts are very energenic and get their ""batteries"" recharged by having social interaction; this occurs because the excitement from socialising with others produces the dopamine (hence dopamine sympathetic passageway) that they feed on. Eventually, most extroverts start to become less sensitive to this dopamine as they age. During puberty, it is likely that some people produce certain chemicals that change the way that their thoughts travel in their brains - from the dopamine sympathetic passageway (extroverted) to the acetylcholine parasympathetic passageway (introverted). I might be a little wrong, however, as I'm just learning this in class right now."

For instance I went to Boston last year, spent all day walking around seeing the sights, got a burger at a bar for lunch and had a couple beers while not talking to this cute girl sitting next to me, then hung out in a park for a couple hours before heading back to the hotel, ordering food from the downstairs restaurant and while I waited for that to be ready I popped around the corner and picked up a six pack, headed up to my room and drank beer, ate delicious food and watched free premium channels.  I had a great time and barely talked to anyone all day!  Point being, I too find socializing tiring, but you don't need to socialize while traveling any more than at home."

I'd love to know what her thoughts are on Hypersensitivity and introversion and how to cope without the use of prescription drugs, and how closely they relate to ADHD. One of the unfortunate things that happened with my switch from night shift to day shift was I started smoking after quitting for a year and a half because I'm hypersensitive when it comes to noise and other things, and cigarettes give the real/fake effect of decreasing my sensitivity to these things that just using e-cigarettes alone didn't do."

introvert,38bjzz,Soccadude123,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:18:51 2015 UTC,"Hi Susan! I'm a huge fan of your book! I laughed out loud reading it because I could relate so much. I have a question about introverts living with roommates in perhaps a more social environment than they would like.   I currently have 3 roommates. I live in a large city, so having roomies is a must in this economy, I imagine for most twenty-somethings. In the past, I have experienced feeling judged for staying in a lot more than my other roommates. When I told one roomie that I needed time alone to recharge our first year living together, she asked me why hanging out with friends couldn't be recharging time. I had a hard time explaining what I needed, and at that time I didn't even understand quite what I needed, so I felt guilty and asahmed for not being more social. Since reading your book, I'm much more ok with who I am and feel infinitely less guilty for taking time to recharge.  For people who might be struggling with this still: do you have any tips for how introverts living with roommates/living in social living situations can balance alone and social time?"

introvert,38glmj,Willbo,5,Thu Jun 4 01:56:29 2015 UTC,"If she says she wants to go out yet declines when you invite her, that probably has more to do with her depression than her introversion.  Maybe just try inviting her over to your place for dinner with some friends, or just to hang out. She'll be getting out and socializing, but she'll still be somewhere familiar and comfortable.   Since she's depressed, this question is a little harder to answer. I've felt this way before (not depressed, but you know, everyone gets a little down sometimes) and really I just had to force myself out of it."
introvert,38glmj,r-aze,4,Thu Jun 4 02:12:27 2015 UTC,"I am very introverted, lazy, and depressed. My best friend tries to get me out of the house pretty often. I usually decline but every now and again I go out. When I do take him up on an offer it is because everything works out me. The destination, the people that will be with us, the people that will be there, how long I will be away from home, how easy i can leave, how long in advance was i asked, how am i feeling at that exact moment, what I have to do the next day.  My advice to you is never stop inviting her to things. You could be the best thing in her life, and she needs you. get a little pushier but not too pushy. Look at times she went out with you and the times she didnt, there is probably some pattern there."

introvert,38cqaw,PrimusCaesar,3,Wed Jun 3 11:08:10 2015 UTC,"I have adopted the affected air of ""asshole"" and embraced it fully to the point that I propagate my own reputation now.  Turns out if people are scared of you, they only ask for things when they really actually need it. Which I think is the same concept you've done, but taken further.  Mostly it's just because I used to be really nice - then people would take advantage of me, or otherwise stab me in the back (specifically at work, in my personal life I just don't socialize with people I don't want to). So I changed."

introvert,386xbv,SchuminWeb,5,Tue Jun 2 07:53:13 2015 UTC,"Jeez, I think that was all very harsh of you, and I say that as someone whose idea of a birthday celebration is to turn down all celebration offers, buy snacks, and play video games alone in the dark. People are giving you birthday wishes because they care about you at least a little bit; if they didn't care then they wouldn't say anything. They're not doing it to make you uncomfortable. You're projecting a lot of negativity onto something that's innocuous."
introvert,386xbv,FormatOnceAYear,2,Tue Jun 2 12:41:47 2015 UTC,"imo your reaction was a little harsh, take into consideration that they probably were only wishing the best and didn't realise it made you uncomfortable. I've reacted in similar ways before i guess but it only really weakened friendships and made things worse and looking back i do regret it. Sometimes people project their negative feelings (i.e your negativity about your day being ruined) onto others unintentionally, but it is a habit that can really push people away."

Introverts don't care. I personally just don't attend parties if I can avoid it. Not interested in being part of the crowd. If I am there, I'll just do whatever I want. I'll talk if someone talks to me. Or just find a comfy spot to sip a drink. If people make you nervous because you fear rejection, then you are implicitly craving validation from them which is the opposite of introversion."

But the other three definitely apply, and here's why:     First one: ""The Phone Call."" Introverts often feel like they communicate better through written word, therefore they prefer to text rather than talk on the phone.     Second One: ""The Unexpected Guests."" As we all know, introverts value their alone time. If someone shows up unexpectedly, this can be disruptive to that alone time, and an introvert might find that distressing.     Fourth one: ""Attack of the overly chatty waiter."" Introverts aren't that crazy about small talk, so this would probably be irritating to them.      People with social anxiety (myself included) would dislike all of these things too, but for a different reason."

Theres obviously a lot of overlap between the two groups (I'm including myself in the overlap so people know where I stand).    Every time one of these relatively benign posts comes along, you always have posters chirping in with their ""this isn't introversion, this is social anxiety"" as if to imply that they're ashamed that introversion is being labeled in that way.  I'd just like to point out that it certainly doesn't help the person with social anxiety to be outcast yet again in a community where they think they can safely post and share their ideas with (what they believe to be) people with similar minds.  I know that by definition there is a difference between introversion and social anxiety, but do people not realize that these posters are just reaching out looking for someone who can share in these ideas with them?  If you don't share the idea, ignore the post.  I don't understand why someone always has to come in here and point out the difference.  You just look like an asshole IMO."
introvert,37yjsc,gimme3steps101,12,Sun May 31 16:17:15 2015 UTC,"Hi. Chirping asshole here. As a fellow introvert with social anxiety, I like to think I'm pretty aware of where the two overlap (at least in my case) and I agree that introverts and the socially anxious do share a lot of qualities, behaviorally speaking. By pointing out the differences between the two, I'm not trying to cast anyone out; I just think it's important that we not let the two become one and the same in a cultural sense. The fact is, introversion is a state of being: a type of personality. Social anxiety is a mental disorder. It's important for everyone to be able to find the kind of support they need to live a happy life and feel validated in their choices, but you wouldn't go to AA for grief counseling. There is another subreddit for talking about social anxiety, and we aren't doing anyone any favors by misrepresenting one as the other.  I don't think OP's post is doing any harm. The fact that it's stimulating this kind of conversation is actually a good thing, I think. I hope that he/she takes my challenging the subject matter, not as an attack on his/her intelligence or well-being, but as a sharing of a viewpoint that can help him/her to clarify their own perspective on the matter, whether they end up agreeing or not. You're right that these kinds of boards need to be a safe place for people to share ideas, but they also need to be a place where we are honest with each other, rather than patronizing."

They all seem happy to see me, but I feel disconnected. Maybe it's social anxiety making me feel this way. My old excuse was that I didn't have a smartphone- but since I'm always in front of a computer (work), I'm always connected. Now that I have the phone, I continue as if I didn't. I still consider them friends but, with the exception of maybe one out of the group, I don't think I could have a sit-down meal + conversation with any of them alone and have it not be awkward.

introvert,37zce4,permaculture,1 point,Sun May 31 18:39:07 2015 UTC,"Very interesting you mention this. I had forgotten about that. I remember reading about Eysenck's theory about introversion-extroversion that basically stated that depressants cause introverts to become more extroverted while stimulants cause introversion in extroverts due to cortical arousal. Though this was disputed in some study in 1984: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6725590  A thing I find strange considering you mentioning ""oversimulating enviroment"". Introverts are generally more likely to become depressed based on what I've read. Whether this is due to the overstimulation itself or the lack of social interaction is not mine to tell, but considering that depression is often fueled by boredom, anhedonia and fatigue. Overstimulated introverts should by first assumption be less likely to become depressed - because there is so much interesting/stimulation to experience.  This is probably wrong though, but I just find these connections a little odd."

It's so weird that my most favorite activity on the planet is going to shows/festivals/raves where I'm surrounded by noise and other people. But what I really love is being surrounded and lifted up by the energy of the crowd. I like to dance by myself and feel the sensory overload of the bass and flashing lights. It satisfies a very deep and primitive need to be a part of my ""tribe."" I feel like the people around me at shows understand something that many of my friends, family, and coworkers never will. We are all kind of weird and different but in this one special place for a few hours at a time our jobs and status and responsibilities don't matter. All that matters is the music lifting us up together. It's absolutely cathartic. I have so much energy and can dance for hours without recharging.   And then I go back to be alone in my house where I pump up the music on my speakers and dance alone and remember what it felt like."

I don't advertise.  also if I really really want to, when the moon is waxing and/or close to or full as it is right now.....   I can actually do the social thing.  I can be close to the best guy in the bar.    everyone likes me.   I could be wearing anything.   Don't think this shirt would even make sense to most.   I'm not even sure it makes sense to me.   I understand the need for a reset and recharge and be alone for a while.  just I don't think a dead battery that is charging up is the best way to represent... as for me... a recharge is being alone.   you aren't charging up if this tshirt can be seen.  plus... (quiet, please.) no.  not an introvert thing.  I am TOTALLY FINE in a huge crowd.   i'm anonymous.  i'm not gonna give a speech, etc.  Noise is no big deal for me.   I can understand that a lot of introverts wouldn't like it but I think it's from other factors other than being introvert.   just complimentary things.  anyway thanks for showing me and asking for my opinion.  The design though is good.   It's solid.   Love the graphics, font, everything purely looking at it as design.  Objectively if that's the message you want to send... perfect.  Love it.  Maybe a couple pixels to the left on the quiet please.  I'm really good at eyeballing shit like that and it looks slightly off.  anyway happy to converse on stuff like this all day."

introvert,37sfqj,SpecialFester,5,Sat May 30 02:59:24 2015 UTC,"I'm same way.My personality is like a magnet and ppl like to invite me out but I usually decline.I don't like to put myself in situations I don't wanna be in.I too find myself drifting off in my own thoughts when someone is talking,so you're not alone on that.I personally don't think being an introvert is bad.I'v struggled with coming into my own being that I'm a loner and it seems NO ONE understands.But I feel it's really one of the best qualities someone can have that alot of ppl lack.Some ppl don't know how to be alone but I personally find my most peace and happiness being to myself"

I'm the same way, I find the average young extrovert to be obnoxious and small talk to be downright abrasive. Most people aren't like this, they LITERALLY enjoy talking for the sake of talking. To me that's not even communication, that's just making noise.  Try setting up things for more intimate small-group get togethers, maybe u and bae could host little dinner parties for like 6 or 7 quality people instead of going to big loud keggars lol.

I love it. I can spend as much or as little time with people as I want and it rocks. I did get a little lonely so I joined an intramural sports team at school to get a little socialization in and meet some people, and that was a solid amount for me. :)"

MOST cases though, best of luck to you and your pal!"
introvert,37ss0o,Geminii27,3,Sat May 30 18:53:10 2015 UTC,"I never really thought about it. I was working at the time, so I just rented a tiny place of my own. Anything I didn't know how to do, I either guessed at or looked up (alternatives: asking other people or, these days, looking up How-Tos or youtube videos on the net).  I didn't really consider it a transition, just a series of things to do. I needed to eat, so I needed to (a) shop for food and cooking tools, and (b) learn to cook (and shop for / eat things I didn't need to cook until I learned how). Which means I need money to shop with, a supermarket or other source of food to shop at, and time and an internet connection to learn what kinds of tools I will need and what kinds of things I can start learning to cook.  Really, it all comes down to time, money, and internet (or other source of information). Pretty much everything you will need to learn how to do can be solved with those three items. And in most cases of domestic stuff, there are services of sorts (fast food, laundries, cleaners) which are more expensive but can fill in temporarily until you learn the basics yourself."

introvert,37ss0o,waywardmuffin,3,Sat May 30 16:39:30 2015 UTC,"Nope. In all fairness, I don't get lonely. It's not something that happens to me. But just because you don't have other people in the house doesn't mean you're cut off from the world; it simply means you have more control over when and where you meet people, and how much time you spend with them.  You still have neighbors, friends, family, social circles, and so on. But you're not forced to share your kitchen and bathroom with them every day, and you have the option of a place you can spend some time alone to recharge, on whichever schedule you prefer, on zero notice.  Roomies are all very well, but the lack of them means you can arrange the living areas to suit yourself, all the amenities are 100% for your own personal use, you'll never be confronted without warning by people your roomies decided to bring home on the spur of the moment, and when you need quiet time you can have it in the whole house, not just a single room.  Also you have '3am time', meaning you can do whatever you like at whatever time without ever having to worry about scheduling around roommates or waking them up. You can play video games, watch movies, make grilled cheese sandwiches, clatter around in the kitchen, exercise, learn the accordion, and so forth, whenever you like. (To a degree; if you're in an apartment building with thin walls some noiser activities may not be the way to go, but the principle applies.)"
introvert,37ss0o,chipichipisu,5,Sat May 30 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"I'm way older than you so I feel like I can answer this. Moving out of your parents house or university living is AWESOME. Having a roommate SUCKS. It's a good lesson on how to deal with people though. Make sure you have your own space for when you want to get away. As an introvert, it can be really tough living with another person, especially if they are completely different than you. If anything, it will be a good lesson in how to live on your own and prepare you for having your own place. Good luck!"

introvert,37qs7r,dodginbullets,7,Fri May 29 17:27:20 2015 UTC,"I don't want to give you advice, even though in this case you did ask ""How do I go about this?""  I do want to acknowledge what you already know, but may need to hear from another person.  The job you've taken -- probably the job you needed to take in order to pay the bills -- is going to cost you energy every day.  What will it give you back in return?  Sometimes nothing.  Sometimes quite a bit, depending on where you look.  But maybe a better question than what will it give you is what will you be able to give that others can't?    Largely because of your introversion gift, you will be thoughtful in situations where thoughtfulness is not expected.  You will disarm at times when other customer service agents may escalate.  You have a chance to be the customer service agent few others are.  One who actually listens.  One who actually empathizes.  In short, the kind of person I'd hope to hear on the other end of the line or across the desk when I'm stressed or in need.  Will every customer recognize this gift you give?  Will your co-workers and superiors recognize it?  For you, I hope, but this is far from guaranteed.  My question is whether you will recognize your gift.  Whether you will come to see it as worth giving regardless of whether it is received well, much less reciprocated.  Because I believe that someone like you is in this world because someone like you is needed here.  And I believe that -- far from the ""randomness"" we often ascribe to our life situations and social engagements -- you have a chance to see yourself in exactly the right place at exactly the right time.  And, yes, it will cost you something.  Your energy.  Your sense of being in control.  Your tranquility.  But you may find that what you give is what you get -- not because others give it back to you in return -- but because the opportunity to give of yourself is its own gift.  It's called love.  And introverts love in ways the world is starving to receive, if only we will love ourselves enough to give away our love for free.  Your sexuality may be misunderstood, too.  Oh how we long for understanding from others, and rarely find it.  Yet, you may turn this, too, into a gift.  The fear of being misunderstood by others can be converted into the desire to understand others.  That's the kind of customer service the world needs.  That's the kind of friendship the world needs.  In the end, I hope that some part of this is encouraging to you.  I'm pulling for you."

In my younger years, I had a hard time with it but as I have gotten older, I have felt more comfortable just being myself. At work, I am very pleasant and superficially friendly but minimally disclosive about my personal life. I talk about movies, TV shows, the weather and I ask questions of others. Everyone loves to talk about themselves. I can always deflect questions about anything by asking someone about what TV show they liked, what movies they saw, how they are feeling. In a bit, they simply forget about me. That is fine with me. I am out but don't talk much about my GF. As you age, people seem to care less about details.hang in there and practice being interested in others. It pretty much always works!"

The key is to show interest in your co-workers. Even if you think the questions you're asking are unimportant, ask them anyways because they could lead to fun conversations. Like, when they come back from break, you can say, ""How was your break? Eat anything good?"" They might make it a habit to ask you those same questions in return and it will help you to feel like you can approach each other.  With the gay thing, the opportunity to tell my co-workers hasn't come up. It doesn't mean they don't know me at all. They just don't know this one thing about me. Don't worry about coming out to them. It will happen or it may not. Enjoy your time with them, anyways."

introvert,37r22f,fisheye32,7,Sat May 30 07:40:18 2015 UTC,There is only one requirement for introversion. Social activities or things that are stimulating drain you.

introvert,37r22f,fisheye32,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:03:11 2015 UTC,No social anxiety has to do with fear and is associated with the amygdala. Edit: introversion has to do with the level of arousal in the neocortex where introverts are easily overstimulated. Different parts of the brain for two separate things.
introvert,37r22f,popsicleinyou2,6,Mon Jun 1 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"There is a spectrum scale. People fall on different parts of it. When I took the personality test (infj) they gave percentages of each of the types. I am an introvert who was an EMT. My job required a lot of small talk when on the non emergency bit of it. I am very friendly and able to mingle. But it wears me out. If I force myself to too much socialization I will become a hermit and refuse to answer calls. I simply did puzzles and played music contently in peace. My SO accused me of not being introverted when we first met and it made me angry. I didn't know the word introvert till maybe only for years ago but once I did my while childhood and college life made sense. I thought there was something really really wrong with me. Maybe all that trying to be normal gave me my social skills, which to be honest still suck. Finding out what an introvert was and knowing i wasn't alone boosted my self esteem so much. I am not crazy! I hate large crowds and big parties and tend not to talk till it is one on one. I know a lot of the folks in this subreddit are pretty severely introverted. They fall further down on the spectrum. I am more like you OP. I can can fake an extrovert but suffer the consequences extroverts don't. I also geocache."

Being an introvert doesn't mean you can't do public speaking or talk to strangers or be loud and have friends.  Too many people on here are antisocial or have social anxiety and they're giving us a bad name.
introvert,37r22f,Sojoez,3,Fri May 29 21:23:11 2015 UTC,"I'm the same. My job is actually pretty social and I spend the day talking to members of the public, making decisions that effect other people, and serving as a lead on special projects. None of that is a problem for me and I can't imagine a job where I'd be shut away all day, every day. I love hanging out with people and meeting new friends.  But I need my recharging time. That's all being an introvert is, really - social interactions, given enough of them, drain you and you need ""me"" time away from people sometimes.

I am into religion and talking to an atheist is generally far less interesting than talking to someone that shares an interest in religion.  There was interesting article an interlocution and perlocution in relation to what is going on when someone is speaking in one of the other subs I subscribe to.  I mention this in case it helps others like me that had difficulty with small talk because I had difficulty understanding how it acted as a gateway to find common ground.  That said, in relation to OP I think it is important to have at least one person that will just listen when it is needed.  It is a skill that can be hard to find in others, likely because they are looking for that common ground that helps convey the meaning behind what they are listening to."

introvert,37onnl,Natrix03,1 point,Fri May 29 12:33:13 2015 UTC,"I find it more relaxing as an introvert to puzzle over my own thoughts and feelings. To figure who I AM out. I have a very few select friends who I 'share' anything with, but for the most part my friends are just companions to satisfy my social needs. they are very wonderful friends but thats what it comes down to.   why are you trying to be more extroverted? honestly it doesn't seem like your trying to be more extroverted rather than your trying to find those few friends you can talk to, because your friends seem like shallow extroverted friends who just want to 'hang out' or have someone listen to their problems without emotionally burdening themselves with someone else's issues. This isn't new, and its a problem everyone faces, problems 'connecting' to people. Really connecting. Its rare, and hard to find, your not alone in this. I'd recommend stop trying to be more extroverted. If you have hobbies invite others who can quietly join you, going out of your way will exhaust you and make you feel emotionally invalidated because of how out of the way your making yourself go only to not get what you need. It will only make you build resentment for your friends who find hanging out easy and just wont understand.   If you invite friends to do things just quietly with you and see how they respond. even if only one or two do, then you know which friendships you might be able to work on to be more satisfying for you both. if none of them do you face the challenge every adult faces, trying to find some genuine adult friends that you haven't known your whole life and building a relationship from scratch."

Simply because something is interesting to you, doesn't make it interesting to others.  It sounds obvious, but we forget to objectively look at themselves and ask ""would I talk to me?  would I be my friend?"".  And as introverts, we must go the extra mile and understand that the majority of the people we meet aren't like us, so we must do a little more if we expect to make friends and be social outside of our own world.  Don't sell out or stress yourself, but a little discomfort now and then for the purpose of bridging gaps is a good thing.  Coincidentally this is why introverts are generally better at understanding others.  We don't have the solipsistic view that everyone is like us or that everyone should be like us."
introvert,37onnl,ben-gives-advice,1 point,Fri May 29 16:49:25 2015 UTC,"Part of it is that as we get older, it gets harder to open ourselves up to others while simultaneously being receptive to the deep details of others.

Even if that's not an issue, it's important to realize that as people mature, things that seemed of critical importance can start to seem juvenile, overly dramatic, or pedantic to some people."
introvert,37onnl,Zaboomafood,1 point,Fri May 29 17:16:48 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean, I have frequently felt this way throughout my life. If I had to boil all of my experiences down, I can make a few hopefully helpful suggestions. 1. If you have known someone for any period of time, you have established a balance with that person, even if it is weighed in their favor. When you change the way you communicate, and change what you communicate, it is a change to the whole relationship. That is never easy. Some people intuitively adapt, and others do not. Some people will never want to change, but some just don't know that you want a change. I found that telling my wife that I really wanted more engagement from her when I open up really helped a lot.  2. Try to look at your relationship objectively. It sounds like you have friends who talk to you frequently, but who don't listen when you open up. But are you ALWAYS open to listening and engaging when they open up? Extroverted people may open up like this OFTEN, and its very likely that there have been many occasions where you have NOT wanted to listen. If you then try to open up once or twice, and it happens to be on their bad day, or whatever, it may feel like they are being totally selfish and unfair, but if you keep trying, you will build that relationship, they will get better at recognizing your cues, and they might turn out to be great listeners.  3. Again, because of how easily many people open up, they may think nothing of ignoring occasional attempts at conversation. Perhaps they have many friends who talk all the time, and they really like being around someone quiet.   Being a quiet introvert is an amazing thing, and people genuinely value these types of friendships. When you need a bit more, do not be afraid to say so in simple terms. it might be awkward, and asking for help and support is never easy, but it is well worth it. Nothing bridges an emotional divide like asking for help from a trusted friend.  I hope this helps! Best of luck with all of your relationships."

Pictures of yourself are different however, because people are more likely to scrutinize over small details and bring them up. The same goes with what clothes you wear or what tech you're into.

Your mother taking over your family vacation sounds a bit rude to me, but as it's done I don't know that there's much you can do. Maybe take the time for activities with just your hubby and toddler though so you can both can find some mental space from the chaos.

introvert,37gb3g,66loki99,2,Thu May 28 10:19:33 2015 UTC,"So for me as a fairly strong introvert, there's  multiple levels of difficult social interaction. Like hanging out with friends is different than hanging out with my SO is different than hanging out with my parents. Each is exhausting in its own way and sometimes I just want to only try to tackle one at a time. Perhaps it's hard for him to hang out with you AND his friends at the same time and he just gets worn out faster. Either way, try not to take it personally. My SO, a similarly very introverted guy, always stays up 1-2 hours after I go to sleep every night.

Drove 16 hours on a trip last summer with a girl I met in one of my classes, while we were awake we just kept talking. Too bad that in the end she showed her crazy, because up until that point she's one of the people I was most comfortable around.  But besides that, yes driving alone is better. Can listen to my music or more recently my podcasts."

introvert,37caj5,gobacktobed,2,Wed May 27 01:49:09 2015 UTC,"I presume by 'random person' you mean a stranger.  I have/had mild social anxiety and used to hate interactions with strangers. I got over it by talking to strangers. Instead of doing everything I could to avoid interacting with strangers I would force myself to talk to them if I had to. After a while I just got used to it and now it doesn't bother me at all. So my no.1 piece of advice is to keep trying, you will get better.  Remember most people are nervous talking to you as well."
introvert,37caj5,Thread_water,2,Wed May 27 08:48:41 2015 UTC,"I'm mildly over the struggle. Hanging out with someone super amped helps out even though it can be a chore. You make new friends and then get to know those peoples friends.   I did it through a bar though so drinks fo help. Also going to the same bar, expecting the same people because it's ""the bar"" and them being there helps with talking to the people you see around but never talked to due to your normal group giving you some kind of comfort zone."
introvert,37caj5,Breezyb15,3,Sat May 30 11:39:37 2015 UTC,"The best advice I got was in the 'just do it' vein, but it was more specific, which really led to a helpful framing of the situation.  It basically amounted to 'Don't wait until you're comfortable / Don't wait until the anxiety is gone.'  This was helpful because 'just do it' is so obviously flawed.  What if you really weren't ready, what if there really was a better time.  But, 'don't wait until you're comfortable' takes that into account.  Go ahead and plan and think about it if you want to, but you'll eventually reach the point where there's nothing left but your own tendency not to approach.  That's the part you have to ignore."
introvert,37caj5,YellowKingNoMask,1 point,Tue May 26 19:39:07 2015 UTC,"I unfortunately am not over the anxiety of meeting new people or approaching random people. I would have to say, don't look at it as approaching a random person. If u are at a music festival, for example, these people aren't random they are there for the same reason or similar reasons you are. So just say whatever comes to mind about why you are there. If you there for the drugs you might say ""Molly!"" Or if you are waiting in line for a drink or food and you are thinking ""I wonder when X band comes on,"" maybe say it out loud to some people next to you....then they might talk to you about X band and other bands and where they are from and so on.....if you want to jump right into intellectual conversation, Idk, go to a seminar about a high level topic and talk about stuff before and after speakers. It's like like Marco polo, u just say what ever and if you hear some reciprocate they wanna talk or flirt or also need some body."
introvert,37caj5,TheInvention,2,Tue May 26 18:35:07 2015 UTC,I'll also add that if you do approach random people be open minded and it helps if you love who you are because this will help you be more like able to a extent. But don't go narcissistic on them.   I have found just being a nice guy meeting people you tend to fall through the cracks. I hate to say this but people want to entertained at first like your a clown or comedian or someone with a plan for fun(  loving yourself and your passions translates well to this).

I recently felt the same and I still feel so lonely. I wish I had someone just to spend time with e.g. lying next to each other in the silence. You think it's impossible to find someone like that when everybody is hiding. So you need to take the first step and be a bit outgoing. And you don't need necessarily an introvert.

introvert,377j8r,paul-b,11,Mon May 25 14:57:41 2015 UTC,"There definitely are women who like shy guys. When I was younger, I was really extroverted. Most of my friends were introverts. I'd have a lot of female friends comment on how they thought my shy, reserved friends were extremely attractive.  On one hand, my aunt is the most introverted person I know. She's 50 now and she never had a boyfriend in her life. She didn't like socializing, so she didn't do it, and she's just as happy as everyone else.   On the other hand, I totally understand your desire. It's only natural, after all. I'd say that your best bet is to find a situation (place, time, and mindset included) where socializing seems like something you'd want to do. The obvious choice is a bar, but I find that picking up girls at a bar is more of a mythical feat than TV shows would have you think.  Don't push yourself to do things that make you unhappy to find girls. It's not worth it and any relationship you develop with them will probably become unhealthy."

There are many of them, I have come to know a few myself. Unfortunately, the only way you will ever find one is to look for one. You simply will never meet anyone staying home and reading, something I'm sure you have realized already. Socializing is a chore. It's something I simply choose not to do most days, but without it you will not find anyone to spend your time with.

introvert,377j8r,Jaseeka,3,Mon May 25 16:54:25 2015 UTC,"Not completely.. I'm painfully shy(28 yo female). I went to work 8 hrs or more a day, came home & stayed online most times. I even drank by myself. :/ I couldn't go out with any friends because I hadn't met any new ones in years(was in a 9 yr. possessive/controlling relationship, didn't allow me to make new friends). The ones I did have were 'bad apples' & I'd end up risking getting in trouble/going to jail..    I spent a lot of my time on Youtube/Facebook. One day I got a regular reply from a man on a Youtube video. We started writing each other. Then became something of Penpals. I was from America, he was from India. We got to know each other very well & I started developing feelings for him. I told him finally & he reciprocated. Fast forward now, I'm living in India with him, planning to marry.    I get that it may be rare, but the internet really has allowed for relationships to take place - real relationships - that could've never been possible 50 years ago. Even 30 years ago. OP may have a chance to meet someone really great, online. In my experience it could be hard to meet someone in real life, as I was so shy & the only guys who hit on me were kind of douchebags.. Online relationships enabled me to tell things I would've never told irl, or it would've taken me much longer to become comfortable. You can lay your cards out more, online, I think.. Anyway, I wish OP luck! I know once I gave up/stopped looking for love, it found me. It will happen. :)"

I also wonder if it would help if you had a long period of time over the internet or if you could do a lot of communicating that way--or if it is easier. It could give someone a chance to get to know you. Maybe the issue is also people don't get to know you. But if you are good on email--maybe that will help the person form the connection. I think a lot of the problem of introversion is the first connection."
introvert,377j8r,quietlilboat,3,Mon May 25 17:45:56 2015 UTC,"I'd try online dating.  You can weed out the ones whose interests are concerts, restaurants, etc...   look for ones who like movies at home, picnics, museums, etc.  They want to appear interesting, but can't really come out and just say 'hey, I'd like to meet someone, but mostly I prefer to read'.  lol    Fwiw: I'm a female introvert who met a male introvert online.  After many emails back and forth we figured out both are home bodies and prefer our own space and quiet time.  There are some out there."

introvert,377j8r,Competenthenchman,1 point,Mon May 25 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, online dating (OK cupid) worked for me, too. My boyfriend and me are both quite introverted and we met online. However, I had been using the site for a year already before we found each other and there were plenty of party people to weed out before that, so it was frustrating at times. But now... my SO and me have been together for about a year, living together since 2 months."
introvert,377j8r,bsrulz,2,Tue May 26 06:30:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's introversion holding you back. I'm introverted and I've dated both introverts and extroverts. I still maintain my alone time and let them know that I have limited energy. It sounds more like a lack of knowledge and practice on attracting a female. Attracting a mate can be learned. There's a book called, How to make anyone fall in love with you. Read it, test the ideas, see what works for you.  I used to be super shy and I never went up and talked to girls. However, over time I learned to be more attractive and not hold back. I'm still introverted, but it doesn't stop me from getting dates.  Just know that it is TOTALLY POSSIBLE to change. It takes work, but as long as you're willing to do it, you'll find love. Much like anything worthwhile, it won't typically just fall in your lap.  Hope this helps."

I'd say if you took a mass poll of introverts and extroverts, you'd find an equal amount in both camps that are self-aware and those that are oblivious"
introvert,373ig6,Rawtoast24,6,Sun May 24 22:01:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, I definitely feel more aware of myself and my thoughts/feelings than it appears many other people in my life do, which can be kind of frustrating. I've wanted to have discussions with people on why things are the way they are, why people are certain ways, and everyone just goes ""Hm, I've never thought about that before."" How!? I really like being that way, because it makes me understand myself better, but it also can get exhausting from just thinking so much, which sounds strange but it's true.  Also, for me personally, this is why I can't be around kids. They are so oblivious to other people and the way things are — not their fault, obviously, they just don't know it yet — that I get frustrated with children more than anyone else. So I have to be very careful around them."

introvert,373ig6,PrimusCaesar,9,Sun May 24 20:01:22 2015 UTC,"It is probable that this is somehow connected with introverts having a higher intrapersonal intelligence, where we can recognise and understand our emotions and feelings better than those with a low intrapersonal and a higher interpersonal intelligence (those people are usually extroverts). Check out the multiple intelligences theory."
introvert,373ig6,kittysballs,18,Sun May 24 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting question! I can't speak for everyone, but I self-identify as an introvert and I spend a significant amount of time being introspective and getting to know my true preferences and motivations and assessing how I'm feeling at every moment. I live ""up in my head"". Because of this I find staring into space and thinking and (on the flip side) meditation to be amusing pastimes. I also find I observe a lot of situations from afar and how I relate to them with a ""meta awareness"", sometimes feeling a bit removed from social situations. I don't think this makes me better/smarter than anyone else, I just think it's because I process the world differently and have a lot of internal stimulation, as many introverts do. It's something I like about myself."

introvert,375tls,crowbusiness,2,Mon May 25 03:16:27 2015 UTC,"Human interaction is largely non-verbal. People move their hands, their eyes change, smiles, scowl, etc. If you start to take notice of this, it gets harder to get in that isolation situation.  When the speaker gestures, you react.   Try to maintain your eye contact (this is the hardest part of it) even when they are not looking at you. They will eventually notice. When your eyes lock, they've just acknowledged you as part of the conversation. Bring in a smile or whatever expression fits their topic- it's also a great time to speak up because eye contact can act as a prompt to verbal interaction. Something like this.  A: ""Talk Blah Speak Blab Words""  Eye contact  B: Whaat? Really? (Other options include: ""That's so cool!"" ""I could never do that."" ""Oh! I've done that before"" ""Seriously?"" A laugh. A smile. A surprised face. A confused face. And many more options for all sorts of occasions!)  A: Oh, this dude is interested! Let me talk to him more."
introvert,3751gr,SocietyIsAGame,6,Sun May 24 23:02:15 2015 UTC,"You're not inconsistent, it frankly sounds like you're just an extrovert. Depression =/= introversion. Introversion means spending time by yourself because you enjoy it and find it energizing. But even extroverts enjoy spending time by themselves sometimes, just like introverts enjoy spending time alone. Its about what you to do more often, and what you find energizing (a hallmark of introversion is the frequent occurrence of a certain type of fatigue that can only really be solved by time alone to 'recharge'). Same with frequency - a lot of my extroverted friends claim to have weekends where they spend most of their time by themselves, but this does not make them introverts. Usually they spend this time doing something productive (like homework) so that they have free time to socialize. This is very different from what I mean when I say that I spend a weekend alone, since doing homework by myself is necessary but doesn't count as 'recharging.' Another thing you may consider is how often you seek out socializing - not that introverts never seek it out, but I'm much more inclined to seek out alone time than I am social situations. I encourage you to read more about introversion, obviously I don't know you and I realize I probably come across as an 'introvert snob' who acts like being introverted is part of some secret club. I guess I just resent stereotypes that introverts are socially awkward, or depressed, etc. and may be hyper-sensitive to that. You could also be an ambivert."
introvert,3751gr,white_crust_delivery,2,Mon May 25 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"It sounds like that experience changed you, which is what life does pretty often. You may have changed from an extrovert into an ambivert, or a person who show traits of both intro- and extraverts. Ambiverts can have a moderate stance or can jump back and forth between extremes.   It could also be that you're trying to hold up a facade about being an always successful, popular, bubbly person, and it's ok to not be that person all the time. It's totally normal to take breaks from being around people."

The problem is I am usually OK if there is some task that needs to be done, but I am not good at socializing with others because I do not have the energy to talk to people much. My brain doesn't work fast enough to come up with something to say...other than really basic small talk, but even that becomes tiresome after several seconds.  I was just at a family memorial day party and left after 2 hours, I think I said hello to a few people, sat outside with them and left.  I think I give the false sense of being extraverted or really motivated because if we're studying or at work I am usually talkative for some reason (smaller group of people), but when more people start to come around I just ""shut down"""

Being an introvert doesn't mean you always have to stay in! Say you can meet up for an hour, and then bounce.

introvert,36w0rm,kelpwave,15,Fri May 22 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"My best flying experience was when my row, the row to the left, and lots of other ones were empty. It felt so comfortable to fly. I just popped the arms up and stretched out."
introvert,36w0rm,WiretapStudios,3,Fri May 22 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"Now, when I fly, I like having an empty row notsomuch because I need the social space, but because I'm 6'3"" and I need that goddamn legroom."
introvert,36w0rm,xthorgoldx,3,Fri May 22 21:44:15 2015 UTC,"I'm 6' and my brother is like 6'4"" so I feel you on that one. My knees touch the seat in front of me, so I imagine it's torture for you."

introvert,36w0rm,Mildy_Annoyed,9,Fri May 22 16:55:00 2015 UTC,I think that everyone enjoys this...
introvert,36w0rm,deletedLink,14,Fri May 22 17:42:07 2015 UTC,Yea this isn't an introvert thing. It's more like an everyone who has ever flown thing.
introvert,36w0rm,jojotoughasnails,0,Fri May 22 18:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I think most flyers find it annoying because people can be annoying, where as it is extra enjoyable for an introvert who enjoys the solitude. If that makes sense."
introvert,36w0rm,Fanscope,3,Fri May 22 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"It's not so much ""people are annoying"" as ""cramped spaces are annoying.""  Seriously, especially in the nosebleed seats, planes are friggin' packed. If you're like me, the only places you'll be going on a plane are the ""commuter routes"" - lots of flights, but all of 'em are packed with businessmen jumping between one big city and another. At 6'3"", if the seat next to me is empty, it means I can actually move during the flight, both my legs and arms!"
introvert,36w0rm,xthorgoldx,4,Fri May 22 21:46:09 2015 UTC,"Not really. Everyone likes people to be quiet on a plane. I have yet to meet a person, even an extrovert, who wants to mingle and talk while on a plane.  Flying sucks for everyone."
introvert,36w0rm,jojotoughasnails,5,Fri May 22 18:49:50 2015 UTC,You have yet to meet that seat mate who wants to show you pictures of his kids and talk about how he's scared the plane will go down? Lucky.
introvert,36w0rm,mentaljewelry,3,Sat May 23 01:46:20 2015 UTC,The only thing that's better is a seat in an empty exit row.

introvert,36w0rm,jk3us,0,Fri May 22 21:10:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think there was just 1 door, I could be wrong but most of the plane was empty.  The first thing the flight attendant[?] said to me was actually, ""Are you flying by yourself?"" Because he thought I was under 16 (or whatever young age)...I was freakin' 21 at the time! Anyway, after my age was verified, he did give a brief summary."

introvert,36w0rm,toodleoo77,2,Fri May 22 22:25:37 2015 UTC,"My favorite was several years ago, coming from from a work trip late at night. Was on one of the smaller regional jets - 3 to a row, single seat one side of the aisle, two seats on other side. There's ~10 of us who boarded. All of us had this stupid shit-eating grin on, like we had all won the plane lottery.  I personally just wanted to run up and down the aisles, and then pass out in the aisle like a 3yo."

introvert,36vwym,purple_cats,2,Sat May 23 05:35:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with the dishwasher part. I used to work at Chipotle. The front line was just draining and i hated it. But i would do dishes and i absolutely loved it. I would be back there all by myself. Barely anyone would go back there except to give me a few dishes and wash what they needed washing but most of the time, it would just be me. Loved it. Except for the part where at the end of my shift, my shoes and pants would be soaking wet"
introvert,36vwym,KourageWolf,2,Sun May 24 04:30:11 2015 UTC,"College or high school? If high school I'd recommend something quiet like office work, nursing home, or mowing lawns. Obviously steer clear of fast food if you can!   If college, you could do any of the aforementioned or an internship that would add to your resume. Depending on your major an internship could be draining, but you gotta do what you gotta do... and on that note a draining job is better than no job."

introvert,36t9bj,caffeinetedbeverage,22,Thu May 21 22:58:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be that hard for me.     I am introverted, I prefer solitude and self reflection but I am not afraid of talking to people,  and if I am prepared public speaking.   Filibuster is just filling the void by oration, so that no one can vote right?   Why not give them a treatise on why blue is better than red,  or reading a novel you wrote.   If you felt strongly about an issue I don't think you should have too much trouble, unless you have social anxiety etc.     But... If you had issues with speaking to groups, you'd most likely not be a politician right?"
introvert,36t9bj,Purple-mastadon,5,Thu May 21 23:51:06 2015 UTC,Me too. I like to be alone but I can speak in public.  There is shyness and there is introversion. I'm introverted by not shy.
introvert,36t9bj,iamyo,0,Fri May 22 03:45:52 2015 UTC,"Shy is one thing,  social anxiety is much worse.   I truly feel for those that suffer from it.   If you're shy, you can practice with any people that you encounter , don't just say it to yourself, ya know!?   I can't imagine how terrifying it can be for some, the mind can do some amazing and horrible things to us."
introvert,36t9bj,Purple-mastadon,2,Fri May 22 04:11:12 2015 UTC,Yes. I have some kind of social anxiety but it is all retrospective. Like I can 'perform' in groups but I find it really stressful and unpleasant later. It's actually lucky. I'm a lucky introvert--because my ability to be social--even if I dislike being social--is an asset in life. It really sucks if you can't do it when you need to. I used to be unable to look people in the eye so this skill can be learned over time.
introvert,36t9bj,iamyo,1 point,Fri May 22 05:27:22 2015 UTC,"Replaying every conversation or interaction can be annoying, trust me I feel you!    I've found that being myself, reflecting on it later and trying to not be mean but getting my point across, helps me in further communications.  Being honest really helps in almost every situation too."

introvert,36t9bj,balswing,5,Fri May 22 03:00:39 2015 UTC,The whole time is to yourself! You can talk about whatever you want. I can see this seeming unpleasant though if you don't like public speaking.
introvert,36t9bj,Fact_checking_cuz,3,Fri May 22 02:10:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know why anyone's bringing up the whole social anxiety is not introversion thing on this one, this is pretty clear cut introversion. Doesn't matter how comfortable I am public speaking, it is a social thing and doing it for hours and hours on end sounds like a pain in the ass. Even if I am passionate about the topic.   It's a real problem on this sub how introversion that could be conceivably explained by social anxiety is too quickly assumed to be social anxiety and not introversion. Bringing it up could be helpful, but the replies in this thread were prematurely jumping straight to the social anxiety assumption.   Sorry if this is angrier than warranted, but the social-anxiety-is-not-introversion thing has started to interfere with validation even for ""pure"" introversion in this sub"
introvert,36t9bj,otakuman,1 point,Fri May 22 06:58:38 2015 UTC,"I preached for a local church group when I was younger. Since it wasn't about me, but about something I really cared about, I didn't mind being in a group or speaking for an audience. But don't ask me to spend more than 2 hours in a family reunion."
introvert,36t9bj,xthorgoldx,1 point,Fri May 22 13:44:42 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's called extemporaneous speaking when done in a competitive environment, and I am a goddamn beast at it.  The thing about public speaking is that you don't have to be socially acceptable. If it's just you talking, it's not a conversation - it's a narration. While I have to think on the fly and don't have as much time to structure my arguments, it's no different than what I do all the time - that is, write up overly-long responses to issues of trivial significance that I happen to be a subject matter expert in.  Give me a topic and a bit of time to research it and I can hold the floor like goddamn Mr. Smith."
introvert,36t9bj,Geminii27,1 point,Fri May 22 07:14:02 2015 UTC,Meh. I can talk at people until my lips fall off. Particularly if I don't really care what their reactions are going to be.
