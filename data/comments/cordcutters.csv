I have starter tv through time warner, no adapter, and all of the channels work fine on my tv with the built in tuner. Just saying. Still I am curious about this roku 3 app, I might check it out and see if the interface is more responsive than using the tuner."
cordcutters,3e3rry,RugerRedhawk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:34:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did the research. If you had the built in tuner it was basically flipping through channels, but if you got the adapter it was basically flipping through channels, but now with the added value of spending $3/mo to do it. You could lease a cable box from them, which would have the guide, but that was $11/mo. Or, a Roku HDMI stick with the TWC app is $50, or a Roku3 is $100. For more cordcutting nonsense, you could also get a free Roku stick if you pre-purchase 3 months of Sling TV ($60) or half off a Roku 3 ($50)"
cordcutters,3e3rry,Halo-One,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like where I live we just get screwed on internet.  Basically the options I have are Cox cable internet and AT&T U-verse.  Cox has by far the fastest speed but the price reflects it.  I pay $67.00 a month, after taxes, for 50 Mbps.  There is no way to reduce that price as that is their lowest tier.  Any TV package would add to the cost.  I have never heard anything good about AT&T U-verse.    I cut the cable (DirecTV) about 8 months ago and have been relying on OTA for local (with a TabloTV DVR) and Netflix & Hulu for most everything else."

cordcutters,3e3eus,broncosfanatico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:18 2015 UTC,"Based just on the TV fool report, you may be trying too hard. That report shows outstanding signal strength; in cases like that, adding an amp tends to be overkill, and your TV can't handle it; so having too much signal can give the same results as having too little.  Normally the best thing to do in your situation is try the cheapest little table top antenna you can find, sitting right next to your TV, with no amp, before going bigger. A general purpose set of rabbit ears that get both UHF and VHF would be good.  Plus, if your current antennas point in different directions even slightly, that can cause signal problems too, which can be complicated to deal with hardware wise, and could all by itself be the source of your present problems.  The line of sight blockage of course could render your TV fool report wildly inaccurate, but trying a cheap indoor antenna would take so little time and effort that I'd go for it, before doing anything else.  ADDED A FEW MINUTES LATER:  We here use the same exact antennas you do, except for the C2, where we use a version that's like two of those put together. We also use 2 different amps, and a total cable run that easily 150 foot from antenna to TVs. We also don't have line of sight to the broadcast towers. But our TV fool report is basically the opposite of yours (and I mean in a bad way), since we're around 45 miles from the towers, besides the light of sight blockage of a hill only 2 blocks from us. So our only signal is what bounces or bleeds over the hill, leaving us with basically about 50% of the minimal signal needed to deliver our channels, even with all the amps and great antennas. That means around 2-3% of the time we have problems getting maybe half our channels. But both our antennas point in the same direction, too. More documentation is available here."
cordcutters,3e3eus,therealjerrystaute,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:25 2015 UTC,What are you using as a signal combiner? You should probably be using a UVSJ since you are combining separate bands.  As already mentioned by therealjerrystaute your signals are predicted to be quite strong. You might want to get an attenuator for use with your outdoor antenna(s).

cordcutters,3e3eus,upofadown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"Note that the signals coming from the 318Â° direction are blocked by a hill. So you can expect that there will be dead spots. You might want to move your antenna around (both vertically and horizontally). You might find that lower is better.  You might have to aim the antenna up at the ridge line.  You might want to consider an antenna with some directivity (what you have there would be antennas described as ""multi-directional"").   http://www.hdtvprimer.com/ANTENNAS/siting.html"

In some cases you can replace the dish with a OTA antenna and use the existing cable connection to the TV(s).  You can leave the dish out in the back lane and hope someone wants it. Or try to sell it on Craig's list.
