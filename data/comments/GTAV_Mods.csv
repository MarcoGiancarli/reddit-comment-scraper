GTAV_Mods,3dr5b6,BadAdvice101,6,Sat Jul 18 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"I use a mod manager that has you store mods in a seperate directory, then you activate only the ones you want and it will make symlinks.  Haven't played online though since 1. 12 yr old script kiddies and 2. Lag and horrible fps"
GTAV_Mods,3dr5b6,tezkr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the only safe way. Technically, if something like VirtualFileSystem by Neodymium was fixed, we could just delete dsound.dll since ScriotHookV disables loading while online, but for now delete EVERYTHING. You can keep your mods folder for rpf mods and be logged into Social Club during single player, but restore everything else and verify all files using Steam. Don't bother with a mod manager unless you suck at using File Explorer to move your mods.   I personally have a conspiracy-theory level idea that there is no automated banning based on checksum, just an automatic ban after several reports."
GTAV_Mods,3dr5b6,GeneralEchidna,2,Sat Jul 18 23:46:06 2015 UTC,"I'm beginning to think this too. A while ago a modder gave me 5 million, a few weeks later another gave 4 million. I learned to run these scripts and would only give myself cash in solo sessions and did this for weeks to support my custom car habit. Never did anything in front of anyone, if I spawned shit I did it away from people while in multiplayer online sessions. Never got popped, and I think it's because I've never done anything to anyone to warrant a report."

GTAV_Mods,3d3uul,darkpivot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:10:18 2015 UTC,"It looks kinda cool in my opinion. I like some post processing effects. Plus when done right, subtle motion blur gives players context as to how fast they're going. For example games like Forza use it in tandem with a dynamic focal length, it's subtle and non distracting though.   I play Assetto Corsa on PC and the motion blur actually helps me differentiate where my braking points are for the different cars I drive."

I've not been able to completely figure out why it breaks in some situations however I feel it might be due to certain file types. I'm hoping he's still working on the project!  If Neo has abandoned it then it would be cool if we could find the source for the whole plugin since I know someone that could continue it on.  Does anyone know where else we could find this person?

In the future, to prevent this hassle, I'd suggest keeping both files on the install folder, and rename them accordingly for playing online or singleplayer modded."

Along with this goes the vendetta system which is, basically, a system that shapes gang relationships based on the player's actions.   killing members of one gang causes rep with rival gangs to go up  unless you spawn into a gang, members of any gang will follow you around and harass you if you're on their turf and attack you if you hang around too long  all gang members attack rival gang members on sight  X number of kills against Gang A means they will start attacking you on sight (despite whether or not you spawn into their gang), Rival Gang B will no longer harass you  Y number of kills against Gang A will make Rival Gang B start following you around on their turf, Gang A may randomly start fights on Gang B's turf and vice versa  Z number of kills against Gang A will cause Gang A to send hitsquads after you, and Rival Gang B will send bodyguards to protect you, fights constantly rage on both turfs  Relationships between gangs will carry over into next character, but not with the perks that the last ped had   i post this everywhere"
GTAV_Mods,3bv2dc,Audax2,3,Tue Jul 7 07:08:12 2015 UTC,"Someone made ""GTA Online Random Events for Single Player."" Would be cool to have the Gang Attacks too. Maybe make them a bit more like Red Dead Redemption's gang hideouts.  A script or something to lock the protagonists stats at their default stat values? Would certainly help with making it feel like you're playing as a different character a bit more.  EDIT: Also, a Hardcore mod strictly based off of Red Dead Redemption's Hardcore mode."

GTA V's ""one and done"" random events system sucks compared to Red Dead Redemption's.  The only ones that repeat are ATM Robberies and Security Vans. How about giving people lifts into town, drunks or random hitchhikers. Cop chasing a criminal and you can help one or the other. People having their vehicle stolen. Girls luring you into an alleyway ambush. The gang/cop shootout where the criminals drop cases of money.  All of these should be recreated, use random ped models, and be scattered all over the map. These are all in the game, but once you finish them you can never do them again. It's easier to understand if you've played Red Dead Redemption."

When you get to certain distance from npcs they stop what theyre doing and start looking at you. If you go away they start following. If you start running or get in a a car theyre coming to kill you.   Btw, if someone could give me links for some basic tutorials on how to start making mods I would appreciate it.

GTAV_Mods,3ao29o,philiplis,2,Mon Jun 22 03:39:38 2015 UTC,I am making my own color palettes / LUTs to use with a ReShade feature of LuciferHawk besides Luma Sharpen and Ambient Light also by the talented LuciferHawk. LUTs control the contrast and the colors. I build a ReShade preset called SH8 which already has a library of different Looks you can choose from if you are interested. In this week I plan to release another color scheme pack for SH8 including this one I posted here.
GTAV_Mods,3ao29o,galazam_jones,2,Mon Jun 22 11:58:16 2015 UTC,The daytime actually looks good. I can't say the same for other SweetFX effects because they make daytime look mildy better and night time look much much better.

Maybe even include an ASI mod and LUA scripts manager? Basically workflow would be like:   Program checkes if ASI Loader and ScripthookV are installed (if not, prompts to download and install) Program analyzes for installed ASI scripts, enables ASI manager to manage all your ASI mods Program checks for LUA plugin, if not, prompts to install If installed, LUA mod manager is enabled to manage LUA mods Checks for VirtualFileSystem (Including the required OpenIV.asi), if not installed, prompt for install. Enables RPF Mod Manager within this VFS and the mods folder   So basically after this is done, the program would have 3 tabs for different mods  Just my expansion on the idea. Count on me on whatever you may need, this sounds like it would be awesome!"

I wish someone would make this come true and a ModLoader for GTA V comes! =)  EDIT: Just found out this is somewhat real. Silly me!

You seem to like photography then you know the effect with bright light and the shadows - like in the hangar picture. 180 degree camera turned and the tones are back to normal - pretty cool dynamic effect ingame. Can't tell three things tho. What made you think this mod claims to be photographic correct? What has compression to do with contrasts? And why do you post so respectless about other peoples work?

GTAV_Mods,39zdvi,_TheEndGame,5,Tue Jun 16 10:56:34 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to offend. I just don't think it looks good in my opinion. It's not subtle enough. When I talk about compression, I'm referring to the difference between editing a RAW photo vs a compressed one. The RAW photo has a lot more data and therefore the details are preserved when color correcting and/or grading to give it a stylistic look, a compressed image however has less data because the purpose was to make it smaller for sharing and uploading etc. this means there is less data and much more of the images spectrum of color, highs, shadows and midtones are affected by color correction/grading which means you can't push it as far as you would be able to with a RAW format image and the result is a muddy image with overexposed highlights. It's the same reason I hate Instagram ""photographers"". They're just a bunch of people who thinks a pre-made artificial filter makes a photo look professional and makes them artistic.  I've been a filmmaker and photographer for 8 years now and the one most important thing I've learned in any aspect of dealing with moving or still images is that subtlety of effect is key. You want your audience to barely notice what you've done. They know they like it but they don't know why. You always want to add a small amount of camera shake, you want to add just a tinge of contrast and sharpening to your image, you want that vfx shot to last a second or two at most instead of dragging it on for 10, you want to tint the highlights a very slight orange and the shadows a very slight blue, you want your audience to pick up on little analytical parts and metaphors of your story/script instead of being force fed like they're stupid or something etc. etc.  My point is that a stylistic look for a video game is very similar to grading a film and subtlety in your effect may benefit you a lot more and while you may think it's not enough and you can barely notice it, your audience will."

GTAV_Mods,39r5uo,FuckMiniBabybel,2,Sun Jun 14 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"That's not quite right - Script Hook V in practice has support for .NET, LUA and I don't know what else, albeit via third party support rather than direct from the creator, so noone's really preventing non-C++ coders from doing their thing as it is."
GTAV_Mods,39r5uo,EnforcerZhukov,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:49:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but maybe the RAGE plugin hook can ""natively"" run those scripts, when ScriptHookV can just one native language, and other languages (LUA, .NET and Python as i know they're compatible now) need external plugins running as a native SCripthookV script? (i don't know if this is true, i'm just asking it :B"
GTAV_Mods,39r5uo,FuckMiniBabybel,2,Mon Jun 15 13:29:37 2015 UTC,"Well, kind of. The main hook itself is inevitably written in one particular language (basically a DLL) and then it offers up support to its users - either modules or other plugins. The definition of ""native"" here becomes a bit blurred.  It looks like the difference between SC and RAGE is just going to be that other languages are supported from the outset by the hook author(s), which is good news for the community since it's focused on one project, but doesn't make much difference to what can be achieved, nor is there necessarily a performance advantage."
GTAV_Mods,39r5uo,BenCaplan,5,Mon Jun 15 15:26:48 2015 UTC,An example of what this lets modders do: Create custom cut scenes for the game and also create custom random events that spawn around the map. The LSPDFR team is using the Rage Plugin Hook in order to make an awesome police mod coming soon.

Mostly because I thought I had your solution right away.  When it says 'back up' your file don't think of it that way.  In my way it's not best to think of it that way.  When installing mods first step is    1. read the instructions/description for the file(s) you will be modifying. 2.  Find those very files and copy them into a separate 'mods' folder.  2.b. Since you'll probably mod the same original file more than once make sub folders in your mods folder naming it what the mod is. 3.  Using openIV mod those recently copied files in your mod folder. 4. Follow the import rpf instructions.  1st link to the modded file in you mods folder, 2nd link to the original file in the main directory, 3rd name it."

Thanks for clarifying the 'back-up' part.   I have followed these steps, misunderstanding the backup thing, but it didn't result in any differences between what I have been doing and what you list.   My problem would be with Step 4. involving modmanager: After following what you say in step 4 (as per the video as well) the game just uses the original RPF file, not the one we are 'redirecting' to. I will try again shortly with a clean 'install' of all mods, openIV and MM.   Also I will try this way instead of what the OpeniV tutorial states, since they area really just talking about their specific case and not managing multiple mods.   I would normally not put this much effort in trying to  sort out a mod this way, but as MM keep deleting all mods rather than the one selected, it makes this much more of a headache than fun :)"

Right now I am adding most of my mods to the same rpf files one at a time while backing them up as to use all the mods I want to at the same time.   The help was great and I am on my way.

GTAV_Mods,39jgpt,Therokinrolla,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:49:31 2015 UTC,Install Scriothook and LUA by dropping them in the root folder (the one with GTA.exe in it.) Some mods go in this folder as well. The one ending in .lua go in the 'addins' folder which is inside the 'scripts' folder.  Backup any files you change. DO NOT go online with mods enabled. You'll get banned if you do.
GTAV_Mods,39jgpt,foolishnun,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:59:05 2015 UTC,"You'll need to use OpenIV for a lot of mods that modify the games' files rather than using an additional script/LUA file.  Fortunately, OpenIV is very easy to use and has a ton of helpful video guides if you're looking to implement your own mods But like Willywanker said, most mods will either have instructions on gta5mods.com or will come with a readme file included in the .zip.

GTAV_Mods,39aopb,Knapperx,3,Wed Jun 10 16:31:38 2015 UTC,"Because it still modifies some of the core files of the game.  The scripthook (and some trainers) are geared to work with the exact version of the game they were designed for.  Changing the version number alone is enough to break games, as they are specifically designed to detect the proper version.  Not that it really matters, but the update also applies to single player as well.  You can purchase the new vehicles in single player."

GTAV_Mods,39aopb,Techman-,2,Thu Jun 11 01:30:19 2015 UTC,There were Diablo trainers in 1995. Not new.
GTAV_Mods,39aopb,EnforcerZhukov,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"Some people call the mod menus ""trainers"" (such as the simple trainer and native trainer), but historically, trainers have referred to independent programs that you run alongside the game you're playing.  As an example, if there was a ""trainer"" for Battlefield 2, it would likely be a program you run outside the game, and you use specific shortcut keys to give yourself god mode, or unlimited ammo, or whatever.  In GTA, the in game mods are referred to as trainers when they give these same benefits.  The original idea was that it was ""training"" you to get better at the game by making it easier to play.  Now it just refers to any program that gives you advantages in game."
GTAV_Mods,39aopb,jroddie4,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:32:45 2015 UTC,I see. So it's basically the same thing.
GTAV_Mods,39aopb,flarn2006,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:02:31 2015 UTC,"But not exactly the same as the scripts. As i know the classic trainers modify parts of the game on the system memory.

(Not meant as an advertisement just saying I totally agree and I personally think the current modders out there should group up to make an insane big filled to the the max menu with all the tiny mods out there.)
GTAV_Mods,398h57,sodanakin,3,Wed Jun 10 02:14:53 2015 UTC,"You say this, but there's at least one open source, GitHub-hosted mod that you can contribute to, so if you are writing or can write in C++, why don't you add to that?  I've asked various interesting mod authors if they want to contribute their stuff, and I think every single time so far, I've got silence.  Don't get me wrong, it's entirely legitimate for people to say no and do their own thing, but the fragmented nature of the community is a bit silly. As far as I'm concerned, it is what it is and I'll get on with it, but it seems like a lot of lost opportunities."
GTAV_Mods,398h57,FuckMiniBabybel,2,Wed Jun 10 08:30:41 2015 UTC,I already have to keep up 2 mods currently and I work with a few people from the GTALua irc on a menu and I also got a job. X) I would if I had more time.

GTAV_Mods,391qwl,awsanswers,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"That would be a very intensive mod I think, but it be really cool to play. The camera angle would work well, but Im not sure how the modder would lock the aim. It would have to be locked to a horizontal axis only. Im sure it would be a bit more graphic intensive, I feel like it would have to be zoomed out fairly far to make it an enjoyable experience."
GTAV_Mods,391qwl,SyntheticEmerald,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"Good thinking about shooting requiring a fixed aim lock.  They could draw a line on the screen for your aiming direction (in Lua, using the same graphics overlay some mods use for menus or a status indicator).    For the actual camera angle - I'd start with the furthest zoom cinematic camera and go from there.  It's a blast to drive in that view if nothing else."
GTAV_Mods,391qwl,SyntheticEmerald,2,Tue Jun 9 01:10:51 2015 UTC,"It would. although there would be difficulties here and there.  Such as:    GTAV's game world isnt very flat by any means, shadows might have to be reworked to provide proper depth knowledge (idk, theorizing) superjump cinematic cameras horizontal aim lock and headshot effects (maybe random chance?) building interiors (such as suburban or ammunation, i dont think removing the roofs of every building would be easy) flying would be very difficult, but maybe an enhanced elevation meter would fix that (text based, not graph based). Shooting wouldnt change much with flying, since most people use the homing missiles anyways.   Im sure a talented and dedicated modder could pull it off. I, however know approximatly 0% about modding GTA. I, for one, would be interested in playing it as well. It would be a cool throwback to the older GTA games."

GTAV_Mods,38vv89,Gygsqt,6,Sun Jun 7 07:05:02 2015 UTC,"A turbo shouldn't increase top speed, nor should engine mods. Only transmission changes should increase top speed. I'll admit that I would like to be able to jack offroaders up, and perhaps install ""crawler"" gearboxes as well."
GTAV_Mods,38vv89,PM_ME_UR_BIKE,2,Sun Jun 7 10:22:38 2015 UTC,Let's assume that by engine they also mean gearbox.
GTAV_Mods,38vv89,continous,-5,Wed Jun 10 18:01:46 2015 UTC,engine mods should absolutely increase top speed. transmission mods should increase acceleration.

GTAV_Mods,38vv89,PM_ME_UR_BIKE,-3,Sun Jun 7 22:42:57 2015 UTC,what. if you put a better engine in a car it will have a higher top speed. end of story.
GTAV_Mods,38vv89,gtavshit,2,Sun Jun 7 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"Nope. You'll increase horsepower and torque. Making it faster to get to your redline, which is tied directly into how fast your wheels turn, through your gearbox. Won't increase the red line very much. Changing your gear ratios will allow you to change the ratio between the engine speed and wheel speed, allowing you to travel at a higher speed. source: a decade spent as a mechanic."
GTAV_Mods,38vv89,PM_ME_UR_BIKE,-1,Sun Jun 7 22:59:39 2015 UTC,"source: my buddy engine swapped with his car, it goes faster because he changed his gear ratio and upgraded his engine"
GTAV_Mods,38vv89,gtavshit,6,Sun Jun 7 23:12:07 2015 UTC,"""changed his gear ratio""  So you're agreeing with me that by changing the gear ratio, which has nothing to do with an engine, changed the top speed?"
GTAV_Mods,38vv89,PM_ME_UR_BIKE,-1,Sun Jun 7 23:13:17 2015 UTC,"oh so theres no scenario were getting a better engine, or upgrading your engine makes you car go faster? ok source: mechanic"
GTAV_Mods,38vv89,gtavshit,2,Mon Jun 8 00:30:32 2015 UTC,"It's all down to ratios. Your engine speed is more or less set, and there's a ratio between the engine speed and wheel speed that can't be changed without transmission mods. Your top speed will remain the same if you don't change that ratio between the engine speed and wheel speed. What sort of mechanic are you mate?"
GTAV_Mods,38vv89,PM_ME_UR_BIKE,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:02:23 2015 UTC,"technically an engine with a higher red line would have a higher top speed with the same transmission, and more horsepower and torque would get you there quicker.  Thats not even including the fact that properly installed performance parts go hand in hand with engine tuning.  You dont just slap a turbo on something, you should be changing internals and adjusting things like compression ratios etc, which also effect acceleration and/or red line.  Just saying, mr mechanic.  But on the other hand, you cant just swap a transmission without adding the power to get through longer gear ratios and increased wind resistance, but you would have to change transmission gears/ratios to change top speed drastically.    You both are arguing like each is wrong when you need both to succeed."
GTAV_Mods,38vv89,DACtype,-2,Mon Jun 8 01:37:36 2015 UTC,its yes or no question. is there no scenario were the engine increases your top speed?

They change a couple or single values in one file so you can adjust how high you want the water.  I have mine right up to downtown vinewood.  And it's funny you should mention that type of mod because it works (and kind of only works) best with zero traffic/pedestrians as peds cause the game to crash if they are in water and arent supposed to be.

Is possible to remove all the traffic and peds from the game, and then with scripts, a few enemy peds could be randomly spawned, as well as some running cars.  Not post-apocalyptic but some kind of ""apocalyptic"" mods, you have 2 zombie mods if you're interested on, and we had the Angry Planes mod that, sadly, contained malware (but it was a nice mod :( like a ""effect 2k"" with lots of planes falling from the sky.

Would there be a way that I could install these files without the ridiculous recoil and just have the better range for the weapons? Or m I going to have to go in and edit all this by myself? :D

The moment your bike touches the car, you are instantaneously dead.  Not only is it unrealistic, but it deprives you of seeing your character fly into something and die.  Note, this simply never happened in GTA IV.  I'm not sure how they managed to take so many steps backwards with GTA V."
GTAV_Mods,38htdc,killkount,2,Thu Jun 4 17:45:19 2015 UTC,Ohhh okay I know what you mean now. Yeah that is something that shouldn't happen. I havent heard of any mods that would do that.

But as i know, he actually deleted the mod indeed!"
GTAV_Mods,38fo0r,TGRHavoc,7,Wed Jun 3 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"GTA V loads the library dinput8.dll. When a programme on Windows needs to load a DLL it will look in a number of places for it. First it will check the folder that the running programme is in, then check various system folders. Script Hook V puts a modified version of that DLL in the GTA V folder so it loads that one instead of the system one. Inside this modified DLL a function called by the game has been replaced with one that does all the magic Script Hook does. So even though it doesn't look like you're replacing any files when you install Script Hook, you kind of are, and in doing so modifying the games code."
GTAV_Mods,38fo0r,ZenDragon,2,Thu Jun 4 02:06:35 2015 UTC,"Hey, I was wondering the same thing. This is pretty interesting, thanks :)"
GTAV_Mods,38fo0r,KaktitsM,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:15:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer, i asked the same!  So, do you think any game could be moddeable by just modifying some DLL file that needs to be loaded? For example, the Assassin's Creed saga could be EPIC AWESOME to be modded, but it's not possible at this time, just a few graphical mods and nothing else. I was wondering if that saga is not moddeable (with scripts) yet since it's hard to mod, or maybe the modding community for AC is not big enough =/"
GTAV_Mods,38fo0r,EnforcerZhukov,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:04:21 2015 UTC,I think it would depend on what external code is being replaced and how much the game trusts/checks the results of said code.

GTAV_Mods,386xpk,ExiledLife,7,Tue Jun 2 07:58:17 2015 UTC,"Realistic is subjective, but here are mods I use that I think add more immersion to the game:  Graphics  Thinner Rain Drops Makes the rain drops thinner.  VisualV Graphics overhaul, however hasn't been updated in a while and there may be better ones out and more suited to your personal taste.  Enhanced Wallets More realistic than videogame-y floating wads of cash.  Controls & Handling  Car Handling Pack Best/most realistic car handling pack IMO.  Simple Foot Controls If you're using a KB/M this is is great.  Player  Basic Needs Great for role playing.  Glasses/Tint Remover Including this because I find the helmet visor is far too dark at night, plus the tint has an annoying way of slowly fading and then abruptly returning if you switch cam or use cinematic view.  FOV Self explanatory.  Lose Weapons When Busted/Wasted Makes you feel like you have more to lose.  HUD  Immersive HUD This can be hit and miss, Sometimes I prefer to just turn off all HUD elements.  No Police Blips If you can't live without the GPS, this is great for making police chases more thrilling.  Police, Enemies & NPC's  Arrest Warrant Loved this mod in IV, haven't tested it that much on V.  Rebalanced Authority Best, most comprehensive Police overhaul IMO.  NPC's of Los Santos Makes NPC's more dangerous, but not annoyingly aggressive.  World/Map  Rare Vehicles in SP  Heist Vehicles in SP These two can add more variety to what you can find parked around LS  Open All Interiors More places to explore  Time Scaler I find V's time still moves too quickly, so this is great for customising how quickly time can pass in the game.  Lastly, I've tried plenty of traffic mods however I've found that this simple tweak Does it far more naturally and successfully. It really alters the game but can be a bit of a hog on performance.  Also a special shout out to Vehicle Export Missions as it's a good, refreshing way of making money in SP. You can do a similar thing in GTAO but it's far more restrictive and online is a mess anyway.  There are plenty more but those are the ones I've used mostly, plus I can vouch that they all behave well together. Looking forward to what other mods people find immersive!"

Can you clear player's weapons with a mod? For immersion purposes, it would be nice to force assassinations of certain targets with specific weapons: only silenced pistol, only melee (knife/hatchet/hammer), only sniper rifle. On certain targets, encourage stealth approach. Maybe combine this with Open Interiors Mod and place targets inside LifeInvader Office, or the FIB building - there are many options! Place target driving around in a Tank and give them an escort convoy (a la Sleeping Dogs). Don't take weapons away in this case. Place target on top of a building so a flying approach is required. Is it possible to make player wanted by NPCs (not police) with a mod? Make a contract that places a bounty on YOUR head. Spawn a group of heavily armed NPCs for the player to escape from AND THEN assassinate target.   TLDR: Take this all with a grain of salt, I just make things up as I go."

Sjaaks simple trainer has really good ped/bodyguard options as well as savable vehicles.

It won't let you fuck with other players (because you can only match with other people on 1.24) which is awesome. I've never been a fan of it myself.  And it'll still let you keep Outfits, Vehicles, and cash that you use the menu for.  Endeavor and 11ZERO11 are my two favorites for online and are super popular right now. They both work in SP as well they just seem to have some fun exclusive online options.  I've also heard decent things about Menyoo which is currently in beta and is restricted to SP for the public. It seems to have a lot of fun options.  As for the best SP mod menu, I'm honestly the wrong person to ask. Online is more my realm."

GTAV_Mods,384m5b,connorbarabe,2,Mon Jun 1 21:21:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the lack of mods for console is because of poor decision making, or greed. Modding goes against everything consoles are about. With a console, you plug it in, it works. Everything works, and a monkey could learn how to use it. Throwing mods into the mix would complicate the user experience, and likely make it worse with hackers and whatnot. I'm not saying the small learning curve to join the PC master race isn't totally worth it for a lot of people, including me, but casual gamers don't really want, or care for, the pros that come with the freedom of gaming on PC, and they certainly don't want any of the con's."

It can be downloaded here: https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/arrest-warrant and i recommend you to use a mod to spawn patrolling cops, since are the patrolling cops who will recognise you once you're not wanted.

Or can mod managers like bilago's http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV_PC/comments/35u4k1/release_version_gtav_mod_manager_by_bilago/  load multiple copies of the same file?
GTAV_Mods,37xlry,GRIMshadow,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:02:22 2015 UTC,"no, beacuse they will overwrite each other.   I use Bilago's, and my process is like this.  I have copied out update.rpf and whichever other rpfs I'm modding to a new folder (I keep mine on desktop) I've never once modified or even touched the one in the GTA root directory. ALL the modifications I do, I make sure that I am doing them in my external copy (on my desktop). In bilagos, When I go to import them, I load up the modded RPF, select the default RPF in the GTA directory, and call the file 'moddedUpdate' - exactly as I always do.   works well for me so far."
GTAV_Mods,37xlry,GRIMshadow,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:26:53 2015 UTC,Ok I got how to safely mod more or less.  What I'm trying to clarify is if I mod a single .rpf tonight with 2 mod but a week from now find another mod that modifies the same .rpf can I just add in the new mod?  With bilagos do I need to re-import for the new mod to work or would that be something necessary only to make a new 'friendly' name for the mod in the list?
GTAV_Mods,37xlry,GRIMshadow,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:44:17 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't actually know.  I would assume so, because I think, that when you do the RPF wizard on bilagos, it creates a copy of the rpf you're editing, stored locally (well, in your modding folder).  I likely could be wrong there, but any time I make any changes or additions to any of my RPFs, I re-import them in bilagos anyway, no matter how big/small, as the whole process only takes about 10-15 seconds.  I guess the downside to my method (and partially understanding your question?) is that I can't keep track of what file is what in a modded RPF, like a traditional mod manager. IE, if I have a mod that retextures cops, and a mod that retextures a car, for me and my method, that is in a single RPF/instance of it.   I don't know if it's possible to have a modded update RPF with each respective mod, and call it somethign like 'copMod_updateRPF', and run multiple rpfs of the same type alongside each other. I would assume it's not possible"

Various templates are available on modding sites too. But programming a mod has a steeper learning curve and models can't be replaced yet.

GTAV_Mods,37lm4m,Whitepubes,1 point,Thu May 28 14:53:38 2015 UTC,"Decided to stop messing with native files and start doing a script mod instead. I'll keep the post up just in case anyone still wants to discuss this.  In case anyone's curious, the mod will treat territory, fronts, vehicles, members, weapons, affiliations and rivalries etc the same way the gta ""gang lore"" does. That's the main focus. I'm currently using the GTAWikia for it. Secondary focus is on making it smoothly blend in with the gameplay enough that a shootout feels unique and surprising, instead of there being a fight in every corner at every time.  Groundwork features:   When you go to a territory controlled by a gang, there's a chance that an enemy gang will show up to attack the territory and fight the gang that controls it. (Territory takeover/defense may/may not be a thing in the far future) They will spawn in either vehicles or on foot They will always use weapons The outcome will always be unpredictable. Unless the player decides to help one of the sides.   Possible features:   Drive-by shooting (enemy gang shows up on vehicle, shoots current gang and drives away) Player Respect (when you help a gang, their respect for you increases. The enemy gang will hate you more though) Multiple gangs shootout (gang + allies VS enemies + enemies' allies, or any combination as long as it is balanced) Territory Takeover & Defense (think GTA SA gang mechanic) Etc....as long as I can write the code for it"

GTAV_Mods,37bfih,earofdearth,3,Tue May 26 15:13:47 2015 UTC,"From Boris' website enbdev.com   ENBSeries is 3d graphic modification for games like TES Skyrim, TES Oblivion, GTA, Deus Ex, Fallout, and many others. It work by modifying render functions calls of the games and applying additional effects.  It's divided to generic versions and exclusive. First category allow to run it on thousands of games, not all effects will work, but you can try several versions of mod to find best suited. Second, exclusive types of the mod, are games specific versions which developed to work with some game and rarely with same game engine.  Available effects are SSAO, SSIL, Depth Of Field, Lens FX, Bloom, HDR, Tone Mapping, Sharpening, Vignette, Sun Rays, Shadows, Detailed Shadows, Reflection and others in various versions of them.  ENBoost is patch from ENBSeries which reduce memory usage of the games, so you may install much more modifications without crashes and errors, also it better utilize video memory of modern videocard."

GTAV_Mods,379u6c,Frostav,1 point,Tue May 26 01:34:48 2015 UTC,"The wheels don't camber in like they do with the shooting wheels trick, though."
GTAV_Mods,379u6c,SMN_Design,2,Tue May 26 03:41:19 2015 UTC,You can change the handling.meta line suspensionsRaiseValue and modify CamberStiffness to +5 and it will stance out. I made a mod that includes a few cars like this here. There are other mods as well that do similar for one single car. All of them require editing .rpf files which will restrict you to offline play only. There is a video on the download page i linked with a tutorial on how to do this if you do not know how to mod your game.
GTAV_Mods,379u6c,fortinwithwill,2,Fri May 29 22:06:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I tried messing with CamberStiffnesss but it didn't do anything other than make the car handle weirdly. So does it matter how much you lower the car with SuspensionRaiseValue? I'd try myself but I'm away from my PC.   Honestly I wouldn't have bought GTA V if it wasn't for modding haha, I was so pumped once OIV released 2.6. Helps that I don't enjoy Online much either."
GTAV_Mods,379u6c,SMN_Design,2,Fri May 29 22:33:30 2015 UTC,"We feel similarly to GTA V, I also bought it for modding.   The camber stiffness is tricky. A negative value will cause the wheels to have a positive camber when at the lowest point in the suspension. A positive value will allow negative camber IF the suspension force value is low enough to allow the car to sit lower than the center point of its up/down suspension range.   So camber stiffness up, suspension force down, suspensions raise value down= negative camber."
GTAV_Mods,379u6c,fortinwithwill,2,Fri May 29 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks again! Definitely gonna spend a few hours messing with it next time I play."

GTAV_Mods,37ayqj,Pandassaurus,3,Tue May 26 07:57:37 2015 UTC,"First of all, you are on the right track :).  I can truly understand that it may look somehow of confusing and I'll try to clear that up for you.  There are 3 kinds of script mods, you already said that a lot of people write scripts in LUA but you can also write in in C# or C++, it's your choice.  The guide you linked is a guide of the ScriptHookDotNet and where the scripts are written in C#.  If you want to write scripts in C# you need the ScriptHookDotNet(it's what you've linked) , if you want to write scripts in LUA you need the LuaHook( I don't know the name , cuz I script in C#). Or the third option is to write the scripts directly in c++.  So based on your choice you need to follow the installation process of the selected Hook. As I am on work right now I can't get more into detail. If you still have any questions PM me and I'll help you as soon as possible. (I'm doing C#, jfyi)  I hope I could clear it up , a bit at least."
GTAV_Mods,37ayqj,Graphicscore,3,Tue May 26 08:27:40 2015 UTC,LUA is the best in my opinion because you could write it in notepad if you really wanted (but you should use Brackets) and just paste it into the game. You can also reload the script in-game to re-write and test it without closing the game. Also it's open for anyone to peek at the code and tweak it to their liking.

It doesn't even fix the zombie attack limit and 95% of them just stand there and wait until another is shot. There is also no variety and cops/peds don't interact with them.

GTAV_Mods,36mhyy,neil454,2,Wed May 20 18:27:38 2015 UTC,I love bilagos not only does it have the ability to symlink it can also physically move all your mods in and out of your game folder when launching/closing... for online and single player also you can load multiple rpfs into it and just check off which ones you want to use... (think the no water mod) but being able to enable it and disable it on launch.. quite useful!

GTAV_Mods,36let1,SEND-ME-YOUR-SELFIE,3,Wed May 20 08:08:09 2015 UTC,Every time you run the game it tries to verify the files. It sees the files are missing and/or are modded and it tries to refresh the installation with the official files.

Went over to the gtaforums to get a better understanding.  The creator of the OpenIV program posted a beta version of the OpenIV.asi which pushes all modded files into its own folder, so you leave the original files as is, and modify the files in the separate folder.  So I made a copy of the file that needed editing, put it in a folder called mods, added the new clothing, loaded the game and bam, works!!  Thanks though for your assistance.

GTAV_Mods,36iqnu,penisinthepeanutbttr,4,Tue May 19 18:09:23 2015 UTC,I was just thinking about this one.  I think it would be neat to drive a bike and have 3-6 bodyguards on bikes of their own just cruising alongside.   I feel it would just take a few clever edits of a standard bodyguard mod.
GTAV_Mods,36iqnu,Senseless-Insult,1 point,Tue May 19 18:14:52 2015 UTC,Thats a good idea I never even thought about having a biker gang. Right now what I really want is for all of the body guards to get into a city bus and we can drive around shooting cops with it. But its really frustrating that only 4 body guards actually get in the bus.  I'd do it myself but I don't know where to look for that setting or if its a problem with the bus or the bodyguards.
GTAV_Mods,36iqnu,m21ml,2,Tue May 19 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"The Titan can carry 16 people.    Also the Granger is a car that can take 8 people, but four will be hanging off the side so you have to drive carefully."
GTAV_Mods,36iqnu,m21ml,1 point,Wed May 20 04:54:42 2015 UTC,True but what I'm editing together only works in a bus or the barracks so unfortunately I can't use either of those.  EDIT: Actually I tried getting the npcs to get in the titan with me and after the first guy got in the rest refused to get in. The only plane that holds multiple passengers is the 5 person velum and that's still not enough.
GTAV_Mods,36kpat,pittguy578,5,Wed May 20 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"No, because most mod managers need the files installed in the mod manager directly, and when you activate them, puts them in the GTA folder, so if the mods are off, they aren't even in the GTA directory."

GTAV_Mods,36g85u,YAMETE_ONII_CHAN,3,Tue May 19 11:57:26 2015 UTC,"This would require so much work, but online cops vs robbers.  You can choose to join the police or have a life of crime. If you become a cop, you level up by making good traffic stops, good arrests, respond to shots fired and stuff. You get more rp if you deal with online players than npc criminals. You take part in heists (from the police side) trying to stop the crime or recover the property. Once you rank up to sergeant, you can plan raids on known gangs/criminals. Once you rank up to detective you can choose to be crooked or clean.  Then on the other side, being a criminal and having a record makes life more dangerous. If you're arrested or killed with stars, you spend the next day in prison. Working out or leveling up your criminal abilities (because let's face it, American prisons aren't good at rehabilitation). If your level is high enough you can call out hits on snitches or the cop that put you away.   I fear this would more likely need Rockstar to make it happen than the community, but I'd have so much fun playing in gta online as a cop."

Most, if not all the rusty cars in the game when spawned have a hidden type of paintjob that can't be acquired on LSC, it's called ""Worn"". Trevor's car, however, never had it. My best but still random bet is that the opacity of the rust on the car was lowered a lot, intentionally or not."

If I can see a person, I should be able to take them out with any of the accurate rifles.  Request#5: PLEASE, if you make mods, make your mods capable of custom key bindings!"

But the facts that all your comments are automatically removed and I have to manually approve them and when you view your account page it comes up as empty (try using viewing your account in another browser you're not already signed in on) make it clear you have being shadowbanned.

If you want to be confident in the mod you're using, download Visual Studio Express, and compile them yourself. It's not too hard of a process, and it's hard to hide a virus in uncompiled plain-text code.  When downloading an .asi, think about it like you're downloading a .exe from an unknown source.

GTAV_Mods,362w62,killmekillmekillmeki,2,Sat May 16 20:26:43 2015 UTC,You should add a Green color for the ones you really enjoyed(or think are really worth a look!)
GTAV_Mods,362w62,EnforcerZhukov,3,Sat May 16 20:30:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think they all are worth it (unless they're that red color, but that just means a better mod is on the list). If it's the normal blue color, it's definitely worth a shot. I do like your suggestion though, and I might add a separate list of ""fun"" mods that I like."

I've yet to mod, but I've got Scripthook V ready [thanks Alexander Blade ;) ] - I've been studying a lot of the mission coding. Sucks all opcodes have been hashed. I do remember the SCM design with San Andreas and it was a beautiful thing. I can't believe they had to hardbreak for opcodes in V. Clever, but definitely a last resort. They're still debunking all of the parameters for all of the opcodes [or whatever you call them]. Hopefully we get more answers out there. If you haven't been into modding before, now's a great time man.. Unfortunately we have this hurdle of hashed natives for those who'd like to program missions. If C++ is too much, .net's much easier to learn and the wrapper's been implemented for ScriptHook.  I'm really waiting for model editing to come :) Haven't seen any thus far. Seems to be paint schema changes."

The game won't work properly if it can't find its files in that location. You can try editing your registry manually or perhaps write a script to do it for you whenever you want to switch install directories.  It was the same in IV IIRC. It's silly IMO that the developers can't just use relative paths."

For all we know it could be an RNG inside the mod that determines whether or not to activate it. (Done to decrease likelihood of detection.)   In other words, someone could link you to a download which didn't give them the malware, but still contains it and could infect you. It's safest now to wait until another modder releases a clean (preferably open source) version which we can be absolutely sure doesn't contain anything similar."

Second, unzip that bad boy and place it in your GTA V directory (if you bought the Steam version it is at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V).  Then, you're good to go. GTA V Mods has a ton of mods for you. NOTE: If you want to install other mods such as Carmaggedon or mods that change weapons you need to install Open IV which can also be found on the GTA V mods website.

GTAV_Mods,3635m5,kschmidt91,2,Fri May 15 21:05:21 2015 UTC,"First you have to go to Open IV on GTA V Mods. Download and install it (I recommend on the desktop) launch it and select GTA V. It will then ask you to steer it to our GTA V directory which if you bought the Steam version is the path I specified in my first comment. Once you steered it in your GTA V directory it may download an update if so just let it run through it and you may have to launch it again and select GTA V one more time. And then you have it installed.   If you download a mod that requires Open IV if will say the files and location that have to be replaced in the read me or on the GTA V website. When you go to change the files make sure you have edit mode turned on (you can find that in the bar above everything in the Open IV window). Once you enable editing mode it may come up with a popup saying you need to install the Open IV .asi script. In that case just press install and you're good on that. Then when you download your mod and have the file that needs to be replace in a zip file head on to the folder in Open IV where the read me says is located (all the mods I have installed told me to go to update/update.rpf/common/data) but it may be different depending on the mod. When you get to the right folder location enable that edit mode if it isn't already and drag the modded file into the specified directory. It will autosave and apply the change. At that point go ahead and close Open IV and when you go to launch GTA it should work. NOTE: using these nodded files should disable online, if it doesn't I highly recommend not attempting to go only for R* will most likely ban you."

This does NOT mean every other mod is safe.  You can find more complete details in the link above, but the bad files associated are Fade.exe and init..exe, as well as some changes to the registry and some temp folders/.ini files.  It is highly recommended that you have a strong anti-malware running on your computer.  A number of users mentioned Malwarebytes stopped these mod files from fully installing onto their computer.

On my computer, with Panda Free and Malwarebytes, scanning both C:/Users and my mods folder, looks like the first version (the one i have) is clean, but... who knows, maybe i've been infected too, although my system looks clear now... or maybe both Panda and Malwarebytes are failing."
GTAV_Mods,35xxt1,EnforcerZhukov,2,Thu May 14 14:59:03 2015 UTC,If you have the password stored in a browser you could literally just copy the browsers files to another computer and log in.
GTAV_Mods,35xxt1,s2514,2,Thu May 14 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"That's true, i deleted the password file from my browser some months ago and i don't save any passwords now on the browser. Now I use a small notebook where I write all my passwords, so if somebody want to steal them... must go into my house and take it :V"
GTAV_Mods,35xxt1,FlyingAce1015,1 point,Thu May 14 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"Protip: use LastPass or KeePass with a very long secure master password and two factor authentication then generate secure passwords for everything except your email which you also use two factor with. This way, if any single password gets compromised you simply generate a new one and best of all if you use two factor correctly people can't even gain access to your passwords with the master password alone."
GTAV_Mods,35xxt1,prophobia,1 point,Thu May 14 23:10:52 2015 UTC,Im just also afraid to change my passwords yet.. encase there is still something that could catch them when I change them xD
GTAV_Mods,35xxt1,prophobia,1 point,Thu May 14 15:06:56 2015 UTC,You would be worried about keyloggers. There are programs designed to spoof your keystrokes to trick keyloggers and prevent them from grabbing information. Maybe look into one of these: (https://www.raymond.cc/blog/what-is-the-best-anti-keylogger-and-anti-screen-capture-software/)
GTAV_Mods,35xxt1,FlyingAce1015,1 point,Thu May 14 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"Most likely the type of malware he was trying to spread was some form of bot for a botnet or a Remote Administration Tool. Both of those types of malware could easily fetch passwords for him as well as a number of other things including keylogs. It is also possible that he could have used them to send other types of malware to infected computers as well. That being said I would do nothing short of a complete scan and change passwords.  In the future be sure that all mods you download are scanned as well. While scanning them is not fool proof, it is the first line of defense against malware."
GTAV_Mods,35xxt1,prophobia,1 point,Thu May 14 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks didnt even know you could scan asi files and have it detect anything xD also.. thought most AV programs scan a file right as soon as you download, write it to a folder :I"

GTAV_Mods,35xxt1,EnforcerZhukov,2,Thu May 14 15:36:57 2015 UTC,I used both of those versions and have it... the thing is sometimes it removes the .exe or your AV catches it but misses the other init.exe and the registry infection.. so you still need to remove those and change passwords

For example, on GTA V you can got the original version installed on your native place, and a copy. BUT you just have to copy the files you mod (update.rpf and... whatever you mod, scripts don't count). Then you just have to copy and paste those files, the rest of files, you create symbolic links from the original place to the modded. And them you save ~60GB of HDD space. You'll read the original files you linked to."

GTAV_Mods,3605ru,falnes,2,Thu May 14 23:50:02 2015 UTC,"I suggest you start with either .net or Lua mods, in which case, head to GTAForums and look for .net/Lua hook threads and SDK for them. You could also check out the coding help subforum for help.  If you have no idea how to code at all, then I suggest reading up Lua or .net coding guides and trying to write simple mods as syntax learning experience. Afaik, you can reload Lua plugins in-game without reloading anything else, which is convenient for learning.  Other than that, I also recommend downloading other Lua/.net mods and looking at the source code. It helps tremendously, and helps you learn some tricks along the way."
GTAV_Mods,3605ru,maqzek,1 point,Fri May 15 05:18:08 2015 UTC,Probably a stupid question but why dont GTA IV La mods work on GTA V? I thought it was all the same language
GTAV_Mods,3605ru,iWasAwesome,1 point,Fri May 15 10:38:49 2015 UTC,"It takes a little more than being the same language. GTA5 has different names for same stuff or it just works a bit differently.  Like for example, all weapons names are different now, so you wouldn't be able to check what weapons the player has using the old plugin, because it doesn't know about any of the new weapons.

GTAV_Mods,3605ru,maqzek,2,Fri May 15 23:29:52 2015 UTC,"As in general you have to define what mod you want to make.  There are countless ways to make a mod, but the way depends on which kind of mod you want to make.  If you want to make a script mod , you have to define, which language you want to code the script in. You have the possibility to choose between C++,C#/.net and Lua.  C# is easier for newcomers, if you're new to programming I would recommend you go and try the .net Hook and write your mods in C#. But it's your choice :)  If I remember right there are a lot of ingame functions and calls you can start and If I remember right there was some kind of Database where you can find all deciphered functions (I think Alexander Blade linked it in his GTAForum post of the C++ Script Hook).

GTAV_Mods,35vg4k,WeAreChris,1 point,Thu May 14 00:46:18 2015 UTC,"Its the GTA IV handling mod. It feels very similar to default handling in GTA V, so it wont make you crash more like some of the others.  I think it tweaked just enough to feel a bit better overall."
GTAV_Mods,35tszv,Rare-Human,4,Wed May 13 13:26:16 2015 UTC,"Expanding from what /u/Graphicscore said: If you downloaded it from steam, you can right click the game in your Steam Library and click Properties, go to the ""Local Files"" tab, and hit ""VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE"". It'll search your game files for any unoriginal files, reinstall only the ones it needs and you're good to go after about 10-15 mins depending on your rig. It won't delete any saves. This also helps if your game becomes corrupt.   Note that this will uninstall all mods."

With police mods, it works almost natively since the way police work in GTA V, where NPCs are part of a ""faction"" and anything tagged with ""Police"" is friendly and won't get shot by any of that faction, for example."
GTAV_Mods,35mfit,GeneralEchidna,9,Mon May 11 18:29:10 2015 UTC,I was thinking about doing this last night. It'd be cool if we could take the Military response to 5 stars mod and just add all of those effects to the 6th star instead.
GTAV_Mods,35mfit,BIack,13,Mon May 11 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I tried doing. I tried adding it to the file from the Better Wanted Level System Police Spawning so that I'd instantly know it worked when military appeared.  In other news, I have gotten 6 stars to appear visually, but we already knew that was possible from the video. I think I almost got it, I just have no idea how to make a ""complete profile"" for the 6th star. If I can get that, then I should be able to make an infinite number of stars work. It would be cool to have 12 stars, and just mod the graphic to be half a star each. Then we could have a smoother wanted system. The problem would be flipping each half though. But that's thinking way too ahead - I just want 6 star military for now."

That's why when you teleport using the trainer, the ground looks shitty, and then loads the normal brush and texture."

You're not really buying a game on disk these days, you're paying for a CDkey; the disks are merely a way to save some download, as you need to register it online anyway.

I would try and find a used copy of one of those (for the map) and go as far as starting an online career and transfer that over to PC to be considered a ""returning"" player and get the additional dlc as well.

GTAV_Mods,35if55,TheFireMarshal,6,Sun May 10 19:40:10 2015 UTC,I know.. I just thought you could only replace them didnt realize people ever found a way to add new ones and retain all the original content

Most mods will come with a read me on how to install their mods and how to use them.  Hopefully someone else will be able to tell you how to use OpenIV as i have not used that yet as I'm waiting for vehicle add ins :) but as far as i know any mod that would require you to use OpenIV comes with instructions on how to apply the mod.

GTAV_Mods,35jtes,continous,3,Mon May 11 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"I really want to understand how I can play with more than one at a time.   As it stands right now we're technically only loading one mod, that is the update add-on you're told to add files to. In order to properly load multiple mods of conflicting nature we need to devise a packaging system and a loading system. This could range from stupidly simple such as convincing the game to load assets from loose file, to making a plug-in system akin to Skyrim."

GTAV_Mods,35jtes,GeneralEchidna,2,Mon May 11 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"Well there isn't at the moment. OpenIV 2.6 hasn't even been out a week yet, there's still a lot of work to be done to get V to IV's level of modding and that's without some mod manager that has the ability to backup and keep user mistakes from happening. If you're gonna mod the rpf archives, you should back up the original files or else you're SOL if your game starts crashing, and it will sooner or later.  Clear some space and duplicate the folder if you want to mod and still have access to vanilla and Online. If you're gonna be using one folder it'll be single player only until alternatives to GTA Online come out."

You also can download some mods and open they to check their code and how are they written. LUA and .NET scripts can be opened with a notepad, ASI scripts, i think you need to see the source if the author uploaded it somewhere, so i recommend you to start with LUA and NET.  BTW, i recommend you too to use Sublime Text to open the scripts, it's a cool editor. And remember, GTA IV mods are usually written on .NET, so you can learn some things with them (if they're on .cs format). Although they won't work on GTA V, you can see their syntaxis."

What i don't know is how will the weapon models work... because on GTA IV was quite easy since the magazines of the weapons wasn't dynamic, but on GTA V, the mags fall from the weapon... so i suppose it'll be needed to mod the models and textures, and also some effects."

Advantage of writing scripts is they can be reloaded without re launching game, so you can alt tab, tweak your script, then back in game hit Ctrl+R to reload all scripts.   List of native functions is here . Another helpful thing is this launcher  which allows to you launch the game with mods/on or off so you can easily avoid bans."

There are probably way better mods which do the same thing but I thought it couldn't hurt to share my work. This mod only works with the ScriptHookV LUA plugin installed. Feel free to give feedback and tell me what to improve. I'm still learning and my code is probably terrible so I'd love to hear your suggestions.

GTAV_Mods,3535kv,gtavshit,15,Wed May 6 21:10:42 2015 UTC,Rockstar has proven they seem to care very little about the wishes of the consumers.

GTAV_Mods,3535kv,Focker_,24,Wed May 6 22:16:39 2015 UTC,The consumers also want MODS you stupid fucking CEO. People have been begging for the PC release of GTA V before it was even released on consoles SPECIFICALLY so we could make and play with mods. He's so full of shit.
GTAV_Mods,3535kv,WhereIsMyMime,5,Wed May 6 23:41:40 2015 UTC,"link  They say that their stance on Single player mode modding is the same as it was for GTA 4.  Some patches will unintentionally break mods.  This has always happened in PC gaming.  It's up to the modder to update the mod to be compatible for the newer version, or to anyone willing and capable of undertaking the task."

GTAV_Mods,3535kv,McsnoogiesMaps,1 point,Thu May 7 20:21:46 2015 UTC,The reason you have probably not been banned is because all your mods are Script Hook V based and it disables itself upon going online.
GTAV_Mods,3535kv,s2514,3,Fri May 8 23:26:15 2015 UTC,The reason i'm not banned is because i remove them manually before I go online.
GTAV_Mods,3535kv,McsnoogiesMaps,3,Sat May 9 00:26:35 2015 UTC,That works too. I didn't manually remove them and it worked fine for me. In any case there is now a launcher to disable mods automatically.
GTAV_Mods,3535kv,s2514,-1,Sat May 9 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"Looks like Rockstar just now changed their views according to a few new articles I saw, because it wasn't always like that. Up until then they'd ban you even if the mods only worked on Single Player. Unless they were using mods that affected both modes."

GTAV_Mods,3535kv,No_respecto,1 point,Thu May 7 12:22:01 2015 UTC,"That's true. I originally wrote that with the mentality that the EULA banning mods meant that the potential Online ban could extend to my RSSC key revocation. I was definitely wrong about it being superior, but if the multiplayer mods entice a lot of people from paid versions, it'll be interesting to see how they work with pirated copies."
GTAV_Mods,3535kv,GeneralEchidna,1 point,Thu May 7 12:27:49 2015 UTC,I didn't think about that actually. Have their been reports of people being banned from single player as well?
GTAV_Mods,3535kv,No_respecto,1 point,Thu May 7 13:13:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's hard to know if these people actually went online at any point. Because the current mods are really just executing scripted code, even single player RSSC could be compromised. It's a shame that it works this way, but I don't have a ton of anger for R* being safe."
GTAV_Mods,3535kv,GeneralEchidna,1 point,Thu May 7 15:05:07 2015 UTC,Probably; if they're tied to a throwaway SC account then most likely yeah.

GTAV_Mods,3535kv,GeneralEchidna,0,Fri May 8 00:32:18 2015 UTC,"I think that script mods can't be detected, but I think the problem is that if you use them in Online to get money/godmode/etc., then people will report you."

They knew the game was going to be modded before it was even released, so why they didn't say anything about it seems crazy"

GTAV_Mods,358c39,GeneralEchidna,1 point,Thu May 7 23:23:54 2015 UTC,Long-story short -- uninstall any mods before playing online. There's no way to disable them unless every file is reverted back to stock and ALL the additional files are deleted. Then you'll be perfectly fine. You can make sure you don't accidentally launch in online mode by putting -SCOffline in commandline.txt
GTAV_Mods,352w3c,dead_gamer,3,Wed May 6 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, not worth the risk. We don't really know how Rockstar's ban detection works yet. Better save your online privileges instead of losing 10 seconds of your life."

GTAV_Mods,3529yt,gtavshit,0,Wed May 6 21:09:45 2015 UTC,It looks slightly sharper and less washed out. Subtle difference but it really makes you consider the value of user made mods. Rockstar had their vision and each user has their own as well. Rockstar gets the money and the user gets  the experience they want for their money. The modder gets experience and gratification for their art. Everyone wins. If u don't want it don't install it but don't bash if unless it breaks the game.  Edit: modder not modded
GTAV_Mods,3529yt,animan222,1 point,Fri May 8 03:53:30 2015 UTC,"im bashing it because Its ignorant, everything this mod changes you can change yourself by calibrating your monitor or changing the setting in nvidia control panel, your also adding more fxaa which blurs during movement. use it if you want but you changing the image not gaining quality, in fact due to fxaa your losing quality during busy scenes, and tweaking colors slightly."

GTAV_Mods,34zaj7,EnforcerZhukov,1 point,Tue May 5 20:17:36 2015 UTC,"Ped Riot Mode mod has been updated by the creator, Trumple, with new features. What this mod does is, basically, spawning lots of random peds with random weapons fighting each other and also attacking the player, recreating a chaotic battlefield on San Andreas.  The new features include changing some options, like the rioter peds weapons, if we can be chased by the police during the riot, and also, we can activate an option to disable the fight between the peds, so they'll focus on the player.  This epic feature performs a new kind of gameplay: HORDE MODE!!! What means, you'll be chased by lot of random attackers, so you can cover somewhere and defend yourself, or any property, building or something you want.  On this video, i made two examples: an airfield (the big one near Sandy Shores) and the hospital near the first Franklin's house. With this mod, those epic shootouts can be done, and i think we also can have the first zombie mod with this, but it's needed to change the peds behaviour, so they don't run away if you show a gun.  The mod can be downloaded from gta5-mods.com: https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/ped-riot-chaos-mode  GTAForums thread: http://gtaforums.com/topic/790606-vrel-ped-riot-mode/"

Assault rifles only work to a hundred feet or so, then the bullets stop registering. If the game treated all the players bullets the way it treated sniper rifle bullets then that range could be extended to almost a km. Same with the cannons on military jets/helicopters, you have to be really close in order for the shots to register whereas the missiles have a much longer range.   Also kind of a pipe dream, but it would be sweet to have bullet simulation, like travel distance and drop. I think the game uses hitscan, but maybe if all bullets were treated like much faster and smaller grenades (eg. from a grenade launcher), since apparently its possible to replace bullets with other objects"

But lets say you fired a gun which left a red or whatever colour mission marker (entrance portal) and logged those exact co-ordinates, then the 2nd blue marker (exit portal) you fired somewhere else, could you not use the teleport function so you step into red marker, and it teleports you straight to blue marker co-ordinates.   I reckon with fairly close proximity, it might be quite instant like when you switch between 3 characters. I wonder if this would break continuity i.e peds dissapearing and loading somewhere else. I guess if there is a teleport mod that does waypoints, already, you could test this out in close proximity to where you are stood.

Unfortunately this was patched shortly later and I regretted the updated. But I found this to be a cool glitch because the AI moved out of the way for you and it mimics quite realistic operations with certain emergency situations.

A mod like this where you can choose via menu what object or prop is fired would be great e..g soccor balls, basket balls, large orange balls, chickens, cats, water from fire hose etc (or even a mix at the same time)  I guess you could replace the object or prop ID in script and compile, no?"
GTAV_Mods,34vu0i,kistaahz,4,Tue May 5 17:07:49 2015 UTC,"One other idea, albeit a difficult one, but which will open things up a lot for everyone is to allow Trevor, Franklin and Michael to be next to each other in the world:    Without a scripted scene kicking in,  Without AI forcing one of them to drive off / walk off from the player ""we'll hang out another time"" You're only able to do this on missions or activities.  Without them getting upset when they are hit / shot.   Maybe the character who you are not controlling just stands near you idle / follows you, or maybe some smarter AI scripts like defending you in a police shoot out, or they are able to continue AI driving when you switch from them in car (by using taxi driver navigation AI code to go to a waypoint / location).   I imagine being able to choose any skin for each one, and having instant switch between all 3 would be incredibly useful and a lot of fun. This was how I imagined the game when it was announced in first previews.  Might aswell use the switch function to its full potential in future mods.

I've been trying to look for what native functions could be used to achieve this. Anyone have any ideas at all?   I had thought that maybe using some vehicle movement functions to the standing player might work, but not sure if this would interfere with animations, or how other peds behave. Having the player bound to / near the ground is useful.  I was hoping to have a 0.00-9.99 decimal numeric parameter to set a fixed speed of movement via menu: 9.99 being superman fast and 0.00 being snail fast.   I'm hoping to have toggle control to intiate and stop movement, for example pressing w would start and keep movement occuring until pressing W or a stop key to stop movement again. It does not matter if the player is stopped by other peds, environment obstructions, although a noclipping option could be useful, not essential.  This is about the only mod I actually need and i'll admit I have posted this request a fair few times around different places. I've looked at sample LUA scripts and tbh, I have no idea where to start as I can't write C++. I really wish I had time to learn programming but I just don't at the moment. I understand that constant mod requests is annoying as they have their own ideas and projects. Its good we now have this sticky.  I would say if anyone is up for creating this mod for me, and its not a huge undertaking / time commitment for them, I would be willing to donate to whatever projects you have going on, and will credit / advertise the modder(s) work.

GTAV_Mods,34vu0i,m21ml,8,Tue May 5 01:01:42 2015 UTC,The way an EMP works is that everything in range of it when it goes off won't work for quite a while. The helicopter is flying out of range of the EMP when it detonates and as such it and the nv goggles are totally fine.
GTAV_Mods,34vu0i,galazam_jones,5,Thu May 14 17:44:34 2015 UTC,But if all the lights in the entire city go out too then the helicopters flying right about the Humane Labs should definitely be in range.

And for those unaware, cheater pool means your money is totally wiped. Your cars and guns will remain, however."
GTAV_Mods,34urw5,Hipp013,4,Mon May 4 23:11:02 2015 UTC,"Shit, honestly, I wouldn't even mind the cheater pool.  At least I could keep modding there."

GTAV_Mods,34vmwu,TerrinUK,1 point,Sat May 9 13:22:53 2015 UTC,Well Script Hook disables on it's own when you go online so really you don't even need to do that this is just for those worried about how steam detects mods.

This other script has got the same options but on an independent menu: https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/bodyguard-menu  And this is the script i prefeer, but doesn't work for me: https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/ped-spawner"
GTAV_Mods,34uunc,Rockydo,1 point,Mon May 4 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks a lot! I've been using the bodyguard spawner as a separate mod but this seems much cleaner and organized.

GTAV_Mods,34we45,0510521,2,Tue May 5 02:45:12 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't. At least now that it cant modify the RPF files, so it doesnt alter your game."

GTAV_Mods,34trzx,Jucie_Potatochip,3,Mon May 4 14:28:12 2015 UTC,I prefer to make a clean copy for your legit stuff online. and the other one for your modding stuff I think you have to apply a crack since the game needs to be online for periodic entitlement verification.  if you don't want to get banned. or go offline mod on launcher
GTAV_Mods,34trzx,Diiijkstra,2,Mon May 4 14:51:47 2015 UTC,I click of line and it does not work.

GTAV_Mods,34trzx,-Pao,1 point,Mon May 4 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"Well the scripthook has been updated for the newest version if that is what you are using the old version for.

GTAV_Mods,34trzx,fabiou202,2,Mon May 4 16:34:03 2015 UTC,"One reason I could think of this happening is when you downgraded your version, you didn't downgrade gtav launcher.exe, having gtav.exe and the launcher exe be two different versions will cause it to ask for your CD key. Which it did for me. You should be able to use the latest version of the game with mods so long as you just take the mod files out of the game folder when you play while connected to the internet."
GTAV_Mods,34trzx,EnforcerZhukov,2,Mon May 4 18:54:05 2015 UTC,"I finally find a way ! Download the 1.0.335.2 patch (the .exe version), then launch your launcher in online mode. If it prompts for administrator rights, just click ""No"". When it logs you in, quit the launcher, go offline, install the patch and launch your game. It worked for me."

GTAV_Mods,34qoyw,continous,4,Sun May 3 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, me and a friend are sourcing ideas from here on what mods we should attempt to create - Mods that the larger community might appreciate.  We've created numerous mods for the other games in the series previously, but most of them were niche mods which only a handful of people appreciated. We were okay with this at the time because we were part of a couple of small communities who we wanted to help out.  Now with the release of GTA 5 on PC, we've come out of retirement and we're looking to go more mainstream with our mods. What better place to source ideas than from a modding subreddit forum?     I agree with the other post though. A stickied request thread would clean things up a bit and make it look more organised. "
GTAV_Mods,34qoyw,Bren926,2,Mon May 4 15:53:42 2015 UTC,This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bpEevq7TlI was someone's request a week ago.
GTAV_Mods,34qoyw,VonUnderduck,-21,Mon May 4 00:55:02 2015 UTC,"aaand they had the same mod for gtaiv. its an inevitable mod. for example just because someone requests a riot mode mod and someone makes it doesn't mean they made it for them or because of them. i bet a bunch of requested mods are going to come out eventually, doesn't mean that they made it because someone requested it."
GTAV_Mods,34qoyw,Russianspaceprogram,4,Mon May 4 01:01:57 2015 UTC,"So what you are saying is in no way do requests work to give modders ideas in any shape or form?

That's a good idea maybe I should try that!'"

I just wish R* would get on board and realise that this is what PC gamers do, and we respond much more kindly when they support that than try to hamper it; I mean PC modders always seem to find ways around their DRM anyway.

GTAV_Mods,34t6ju,Danny41294,1 point,Mon May 4 12:07:16 2015 UTC,"it's a small part of the mod.  ex. If the character buys a gun, the money got deducted == to the price of the gun.  so I want to learn the syntax, specific lib how to subtract character's money."
GTAV_Mods,34t6ju,Danny41294,1 point,Mon May 4 12:49:03 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. When you buy say a gun, the game deducts that amount from your current funds, what do you want your mod to do differently than that?"

I program in LUA and this is what I assume you should do:     PED.SET_PED_MONEY(GET_PLAYER_PED(PLAYER.PLAYER_PED_ID()), PED.GET_PED_MONEY(PLAYER.PLAYER_PED_ID()) - x) Where x is the money subtracted   Might not be 100% correct but this should be the general id  We are basically setting the money of the PED of PLAYER_PED_ID() to the money you have currently - x  Is that what you are looking for?

GTAV_Mods,34s6l8,balancespec2,2,Mon May 4 02:38:47 2015 UTC,"There is one mod tool we're all waiting for that will allow this. OpenIV. Idk how far along they are but I do know you can currently view the decrypted files, but not edit them. As i understand it, the issue is we can't re-encrypt the files in a way that the game will allow.  OpenIV is closed source, and primarily Russian(I think?) So even if you had the necessary experience to do so they probably won't want your help.  So in short, sit tight, because there's really not anything we can do until the guys that work on OpenIV crack it, or some other program blindsides us from out of the woodwork."
GTAV_Mods,34s6l8,BIack,1 point,Mon May 4 04:01:26 2015 UTC,Do you think open iv will be able to reencrypt The files to he used with the game? Or is that what you were referring to As the feature we're waiting on?
GTAV_Mods,34s6l8,BIack,3,Mon May 4 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I was referring to. They are working on it right now, but its been over two weeks since their update that added GTA V support (just viewing the files), with little to no news since then.   The program/its development is rather weird. OpenIV a stripped down version of a stronger program called .black that they won't release to the public.   I'd love it if someone else came along and took a crack at making it happen, but it seems like no one is. Or if they are they're keeping quiet about it."
GTAV_Mods,34s6l8,spioner,1 point,Mon May 4 05:10:34 2015 UTC,"That is indeed what the OpenIV guys are working on, supposedly. Decrypting the archives already works, you can use OpenIV to look at a bunch of assets the game uses. You just can't change them yet.  Source: just spent 30 minutes watching commercials from the game. You'll find them in x64d.rpf. And I'm seriously impressed by the production value."
GTAV_Mods,34s6l8,EnforcerZhukov,0,Mon May 4 13:34:42 2015 UTC,"It only can be possible when OpenIV team can modify RPF game files. Those files contain all the textures and sounds and things like these, so if you want textures, or new car models, you need to mod the RPF files, and then, mod the vehicles model image to change the model of certain car.  But OpenIV team announced It's difficult to mod those files. Despite of that problem, the team is still working on it, but with the new R* updates, it's more difficult each time."

GTAV_Mods,34pmvx,Alienstyles_,10,Sun May 3 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"I think all this does is limit the vehicle speed to a certain number and then whenever a key is pressed to ""shift up"" it increases the speed the car can achieve.

GTAV_Mods,34rm24,s2514,2,Mon May 4 12:27:41 2015 UTC,"If you use shift click then click ""open command window here"" you can pull up command prompt in that folder. Then type the following command:  ren *.extension1 *.extension2   The ren command is rename, replace extension1 with the extension of your mods and extension2 with ""extension1.extension2. An example would be:  ren *.asi *.asi.disable ren *.lua *.lua.disable   Used, for example, on the default trainer ""NativeTrainer.asi"" becomes ""NativeTrainer.asi.disable"" cause the mods to not run. Alternately if you only use Script Hook V mods make a script that renames the files required for Script Hook V to run.  To reenable simply do the opposite:  ren *.asi.disable *.asi ren *.lua.disable *.lua   Edit: You may have to turn on file extensions, in Windows you can type ""file extensions"" into search and click ""Show or hide file extensions.""  Edit 2: if the mods are dll files make sure you use the exact name of the dll or you will change all dll files and the game wont work. Example:  ren exactname.dll exactname.dll.disable   Note the lack of asterisks, that's because you are using the exact path.  Edit: I made a full in depth guide on turning this into a script here including a method of moving the files rather than naming them."

But that would break the immersion, wouldn't it?   I love the radio and the option to add your own songs in. I also love the fact that the radio in GTA V is somewhat realistic with all the stations that go on in the background making you feel like you are really listening to a radio. But it would be way better to have a real radio included, just for the fun."
GTAV_Mods,34lyjc,101001010101,5,Sat May 2 13:44:01 2015 UTC,"Alright well I don't want to make this, but here's how I would implement online stations if anyone else wants to do it.  -Load list of online radio station URLs that directly play music (like this url http://www.jango.com/music/Fetty+Wap?l=0).  -In-game UI for selecting from the stations and disable in-game radio while online radio is enabled.  -Play stations using a embedded web frame like wxWebView or Chromium."

GTAV_Mods,34k4m7,GrandTheftModcast,3,Fri May 1 21:36:44 2015 UTC,It would have to do with slowing down the game using say... Franklin's abilities. Then increasing the player movement speed so maybe the effect just doesn't occur. I'm just thinking out of the box and haven't really looked at the natives to see if there are ways to edit these sorts of things.

Don't forget to place files in their corresponding folders. I can't guarantee using  these won't have any repercussions, but it seems to work perfectly for me.  As I don't own a copy of the social club version I can't verify any of the social club methods work nor offer any guarantees but here it is anyway:  Retail Version downgrade files.  The method however is slightly different and more complex as the launcher will constantly try update to the latest version so you must either    Blacklist GTA V and social club launcher to prevent auto update or just disconnect from internet altogether    or    Start the updated GTA and then induce force quit using task manager so you see this screen then replace GTA5.exe with the old version and put the old update.rpf in the update folder (again replacing the latest version) Once files are replaced press retry and you should be able to carry on playing game with mod."

GTAV_Mods,34evbf,DasGunterlie,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:59:57 2015 UTC,The update.rpf is at least for me a very large file so I assume there is important content in there that the game requires to run. Which is why I'm wary at the concept of mixing files from different versions.

GTAV_Mods,34evbf,thekeanu,1 point,Fri May 1 21:22:12 2015 UTC,Solved this with right clicking Grand Theft Auto V in Steam --> Properties --> Local files --> Verify integrity of game cache. Then after verifying it said that it's going to restore the 3 files that I replaced! :)

It's just over two weeks since the game came out and we already have a Riot Mode?  This mod (and the reent FSPD mod or whatever it was called) gives me hope more than anything that this purchase, as buggy and messed up the release ended up being, probably one of the greatest gaming purchases I'll ever make.  edit: My only complaint is that once riot mode is disabled, it seems the pedestrians need to kill themselves off for it to completely end, rather than their behavior just halting.  Or you can drive away and spawn new pedestrians which don't have this behavior.  Hopefully in future version, if possible, we can have an immediate on/off switch. Either way, I love it.

GTAV_Mods,34fqid,BRPW1693,1 point,Fri May 1 06:51:35 2015 UTC,The way this could work is by force enabling the snow/winter feature the game already has built in so there is snow everywhere.  A Custom vehicle with a different seat animation (Just replace it with a standing animation that moves the hip axis to the way you move left and right)  The custom vehicle just needs to have a property that makes you never fall off (Similar to the never fall off motorcycles cheats you used to get) At least that would probably make it a lot more fun.  That seems about it. Easy to implement if somebody is bored enough.

GTAV_Mods,34brtl,Yiggz,4,Wed Apr 29 21:56:47 2015 UTC,I love the idea of a zombie mod I just hope they don't take too much inspiration from DAYZ. DayZ works well in the environment it was created for but it would be way more fun to have the whole city swarmed with zombies and you have to try and survive. In DAYZ there's a relatively small amount of zombies.
GTAV_Mods,34brtl,Rbeattie98,3,Wed Apr 29 23:06:56 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer they make more of a zombie horde, Killing Floor type game where you have to get from one side of the city to another...that would be awesome. Leave Day Z in Day Z."
GTAV_Mods,34brtl,The_Pharoah,3,Wed Apr 29 23:49:32 2015 UTC,"As far as DayZ goes if it's fun there why not bring it over?  I'm a long time player/fan of Left4dead2 (the inspiration for my user name).   Somewhat random hordes, players taking on zombie or super zombie models would be awesome.  Think of watching 10 people fighting a tank as it tosses cars around - from the safety of your high rise apartment."
GTAV_Mods,34brtl,dead_gamer,2,Thu Apr 30 04:46:53 2015 UTC,There has got to be people working on GTA: Day Z. I noticed in single player a wheel is able to come off a car. It would be cool to be able to loot for parts and fix cars just like in Day Z. The first team or person to come out with a stable zombie mod will be as big as Dean Hall

GTAV_Mods,34brtl,GrandTheftModcast,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:27:49 2015 UTC,Seriously. I feel the hunger system in games is overwhelming at times. Yes it's a neat feature but maybe it's time to substitute it for something less daunting.
GTAV_Mods,34brtl,reedmaster16,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:01:14 2015 UTC,I would definitely love something like this. Even something simple as a survival type zombies mode where movement speed increases as the rounds progress and maybe they begin to wield basic weapons or gain hit points.

GTAV_Mods,3481vu,SMN_Design,3,Wed Apr 29 02:45:49 2015 UTC,"Well Michael's ability doesn't make it slow enough, but I know the game is able to real slow, for example in the editor it can go as slow as 5%. If it is possible to go even below 5%, maybe 1% or even lower, it would be amazing. I've thought about it a lot. Even though I know.. pretty much nothing about creating a mod. But still, I think it would be possible. Just want to know what the people who know more about this think. Also, for gun shots I believe there are ways to manipulate the effect. Even though I haven't seen actual bullet models in the game when you shoot them (just blurry light streaks) don't think it's that necessary, modding that in would make things way way more complicated."

GTAV_Mods,345tnt,DeZiReKappa,5,Tue Apr 28 15:14:25 2015 UTC,"Speaking of drifting in GTA, anyone know if it'll be possible to make it not suck once the rpf files are cracked? You get sideways and the revs just die, even with the slidey cars cheat on it still feels like there's traction control keeping the wheels from spinning, hitting the e brake to keep it going just flings the camera around too.  The workarounds for IV were to make the cars really powerful/less grippy/mess with the transmission settings to stop it from shifting mid drift. I'd be fine with that since I know it works but I'm really hoping there will be a better solution this time around."
GTAV_Mods,345tnt,SMN_Design,3,Tue Apr 28 16:09:33 2015 UTC,Only time can really tell at this point. We don't have enough information about the engines to fully understand how they work in this version of Rockstar's engine.

GTAV_Mods,345tnt,Da7K,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that on a few handling lines that came with cars, I made a few of the existing cars in IV into drift cars by simply making them have crazy torque and a larger steering angle, sometimes less or more grippy, I always set it to six gears too. A lot of the custom lines from others seemed to like four gears as well.  Gears didn't matter much when you have the torque set crazy high since the lack of traction let you fly through all the gears until you're banging the rev limiter in sixth.  Honestly I just want manual transmissions that keep their torque in the high end of each gear. Not exactly sure how the transmissions work in V so not sure if that's even possible."

GTAV_Mods,343o92,Ryan_Fitz94,8,Tue Apr 28 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"I definitely expect this to happen (There was a similar mod with GTA IV) but not anytime soon. AI isn't easy, but it is one of the most important parts of the game. Rockstar definitely skipped out on the Police AI this time around."
GTAV_Mods,343o92,Cognittie,8,Tue Apr 28 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"I would love this, but please also make the mod get me wanted for speeding and running lights if a policeman sees me. easier to get wanted, easier to get away."
GTAV_Mods,343o92,shadowgoat,5,Tue Apr 28 04:11:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. I like this. Mafia 2 had something along those lines,it wasn't perfect,but cops would give chase if you ran a light or were speeding. They were also fairly easy to get away from.  Ide love to see a game like gta make getting pulled over an actual possibility without it feeling like a hindrance to your gameplay. Getting rammed off the road for going 10mph over the limit would break the immersion quite a bit."
GTAV_Mods,343o92,sample_material,2,Tue Apr 28 04:16:17 2015 UTC,I'd love a minigame of trying to talk the cop out of a ticket.
GTAV_Mods,343o92,shadowgoat,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"if you're running, you're fair game!   there was a script for IV that introduced strict road rules, however, i believe it was global (rather than when cops were around), so it got old pretty quick. I'm sure it wont be too long."
GTAV_Mods,343o92,XXLpeanuts,2,Tue Apr 28 04:26:58 2015 UTC,"Actually there was arrest warrant for gta iv which did all this and more and wasnt global, it was based on whether a cop could actually see you. It was amazing."

Gta IV online was far from being perfect, but gta 5 online was a step back in about 2 dozen different ways.   The single player is really solid,and with a bit of modding I'm sure will be pheominal."

GTAV_Mods,346ym1,FixingG00D,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:08:57 2015 UTC,That is very promising. Cheers. I don't quite get what no clip does but it's close to what I had in mind. Shame the stance is in a fixed position and the idle animations don't trigger.   I wonder why the city is empty on the noclip videos? Is that a bug of the mod?  Hopefully I can get in touch with that modder(s).   Thanks.
GTAV_Mods,346ym1,HGMIV926,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"I am really hoping I can get somewhere with this mod idea as other modders are starting to implement mods for custom peds / bodyguards and animations,  I have tried to understand the technicalities of it and posted this over on GTAforums.  *I wanted to create a way to move a standing / idle player forwards, backwards and sideways along x y and z paths, while maintaining full control of what they do, as if they are just standing.   This gives an idea of the functionality https://youtu.be/F3RsejET0zc?t=27s  I'm trying to search out what native functions would help to facilitate this. Any ideas?  Is there any function to bound the player to / near ground level so they would not end up hovering in mid air over a hill for example? I guess if not, then user control of Y axis movement would be necessary.  I planned to have a function to set the speed of movement via menu.  I'm hoping to get somewhere with this and have toggle control to intiate and stop movement, for example pressing w would start and keep movement occuring until pressing W to stop again.   If anyone has any advice to put me on the right path, it would help me out and save a lot of time!  ...Come to think of it, maybe its possible to apply vehicle movement functions to a standing character (although this limits sideways movement), then play about with setting and regulating ""vehicle"" speeds at a constant level. Not sure if this would interfere or cause fixed animations, or lose standing character controls. I don't want to turn character / ped models into cars*  I know these mod requests are getting annoying for people but I just wanted to say this and then i'll stop banging on.   If any modder out there knows a clear way to achieve the above with player characters (bonus if npcs / bodyguards can also do this!), and knows it's not a huge amount of work / code required - maybe a few hours, I would be happy to compensate your time and donate money to whatever mod project you are doing, and fully credit you on videos.  This type of mod would make A LOT of difference to me, and i'm sure a lot of other video editors out there too.  Any technical feedback would be useful too."

GTAV_Mods,341wg4,eklat92i,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:47:40 2015 UTC,An example of #1 is when NPCs get scared and run/drive at crazy speed even in vehicles that cannot go that fast.  Or during certain races where NPCs can catch up or pass you going far faster than their vehicle is capable of going. (i.e. the bikes in triathlons) Or the Father/Son mission where the truck with boat trailer is able to accelerate like a sports car.  For #3 I tried using the same vehicle on and offroad with street vs offroad tires and could not tell any difference.  I also noticed that the only vehicle that seems to be actually 4x4 is the Sandking.

That can all be modified with simple file editing of the handling.meta, once we have the ability to inject modified text files in the game archives.  You might wish to check out the realistic driving mods made for the 360 and PS3."

Chase missions aren't even chase missions, they're just ""follow this guy til he gets where he's going and we let you catch up with him"". Maybe I was just an awful player then, but I don't remember this being in the older games."
GTAV_Mods,341wg4,VladVladVladykins,0,Wed Apr 29 04:05:53 2015 UTC,"mine:   fix the shitty cop AI, make it so that they don't spawn randomly and home on my position regardless if they can see me (not sure if its even possible in this engine to change the AI and how they can be seen or what ever)  Also introduce patrolling police, there are  no patrolling police and they just spawn randomly when ever a crime happens within 100 yards of you.  Also when I'm out in the wilderness, please fix cops randomly spawning near me or get rid of the stupid detection system that it gives, this didn't happen in GTA4 (not even sure if this is possible) remove their stupid touch the bumper and your steering wheel jerks one way for a second (this should be possible, simply removing this jerking motion the game injects would fix this issue) when a tire pops remove the stupid steering wheel jerk to one direction for a second. (this should also be easy, simply remove this stupid physics jerk thats injected when you pop a tire, its not real at all) make driving better, GTA4 had it right, cars shouldn't oversteer as hardcore as they do in GTA5 (waiting for those better driving mods) introduce Traction Control Units, cars shouldn't spin tires as hard as they do, this makes launching from zero really hard, theres no way to ease on the throttle with a keyboard. (not sure about this one, a car would have to know when it has no traction with the road and regular torque in response, somehow creating a ""differential"" of sorts to help this, it would also have to be easily enable-able, and disable-able for things like dirt driving) make NPC civilians not try and aim at me, its really annoying for some reason when the NPC's randomly try to drive at me despite not crossing them at all. (I have no idea how this can be fixed) a mod to change your default car, its icon and its spawning to your home garage, this should be simple with a swap that if you save your car in your main garage that car will be your default go to car like in missions and shit."

GTAV_Mods,340emk,SpeziZer0,2,Mon Apr 27 08:56:14 2015 UTC,My favourite word too. The word epic is epic :D
GTAV_Mods,340emk,EnforcerZhukov,8,Mon Apr 27 09:55:08 2015 UTC,We don't even have the archives unpacked yet. We don't even have the multiplayer clients yet. We don't have so many things but oh man... it's looking so good.
GTAV_Mods,340emk,GrandTheftModcast,4,Mon Apr 27 09:42:43 2015 UTC,"They're unpackable, we just can't repack them after making edits yet."
GTAV_Mods,340emk,Xiexe,6,Mon Apr 27 19:38:47 2015 UTC,All I want is my multiplayer character in single player.
GTAV_Mods,340emk,SirFireHydrant,2,Tue Apr 28 03:05:16 2015 UTC,Just use director mode! All I want is to be able to play as Director Mode characters (includes online characters) in story mode.
GTAV_Mods,340emk,InitialEyes,5,Tue Apr 28 04:33:47 2015 UTC,It's possible to view and extract nearly all the files in the game with OpenIV.  As soon as repacking and editing support comes to OpenIV we will be able to do mods to the same scale as GTAIV and more.  Custom cars. guns and other crazy mods are not a dream anymore. This is the real deal.
GTAV_Mods,340emk,Crystalwolf,4,Mon Apr 27 10:27:41 2015 UTC,"Better than what I expected. We can make and use scripts, and we are waiting now for OpenIV writing support on RPF files."
GTAV_Mods,340emk,EnforcerZhukov,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:53:25 2015 UTC,It's looking very very good so far. We've had almost nothing but good news modding wise since launch.
