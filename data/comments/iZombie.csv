iZombie,3dqqqc,JBB1986,-9,Sun Jul 19 07:36:48 2015 UTC,"Meh... I think Joss Whedon is overrated. Buffy seasons 4-7 were pretty bad, Angel also started to fall apart in its second half, and Avengers 2 was massive disappointment- killing off their most promising new character and completely ruining the romantic chemistry of Hawkeye and Black Widow in the first one just so he could shoehorn more Hulk scenes in.  Though I will admit Dr. Horrible and Cabin in the Woods were pretty great."

We're so ingrained in our culture to shoot zombies first and don't bother asking questions, she felt she couldn't.  Another reason Liv broke it off was because she had no idea how it could be transmitted, and she could've been carrying the motherfucker of all STDs, she just couldn't let herself be responsible for that."
iZombie,3cwdxs,2meterrichard,2,Sat Jul 11 11:44:28 2015 UTC,"I end up playing devil's advocate on this issue a lot, just because so many people on this sub are of this opinion.      Liv is not Flash or Arrow, she's not a crime-fighting vigilante or a person with super powers.  She is a literal monster, who is undead, and who sustains herself on the death of others.      Her initial decision to keep it a secret makes perfect sense. And after a certain amount of time proven by his reaction when he does find out it becomes even more difficult to tell because of the initial lie.     Add to that the fact that she has some wildly differing emotions on a fairly regular basis, and the mindfuck of the Astroburger episode, and I think her fears and confusion are understandable."

Ah, I can barely remember) that Liv had just eaten some teenage brains. Hence a lot of the times in the episode where she made a lot of decisions emotionally rather than thinking rationally. It's a bit of a poor excuse, but it is one.  ( Tbh, Liv's not my FAVORITE character in the world. She's good enough, but I feel like sometimes they sacrifice personality for plot twists. And that we don't see her personality often enough because we're unsure if what we're seeing is HER or the brains she's on. Ravi4lyf though.)"

iZombie,3b9x3n,fluffynubkin,2,Sat Jun 27 05:13:54 2015 UTC,I found that glowy red look kinda cheesy and tacky but to each his own I guess...
iZombie,3b47l5,Taylor7500,29,Thu Jun 25 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"He can't spread it anymore. He will be a lot less frightening when dealing with his clients because what would zombies have to fear of just another human. Blaine found power in his zombie-ism, power he lost when he got cured."
iZombie,3b47l5,Mathy16,3,Thu Jun 25 21:08:35 2015 UTC,But are we sure he can't be reinfected?
iZombie,3b47l5,sighclone,3,Fri Jun 26 01:58:40 2015 UTC,"No, but do think that will be the case. That way they can not simply undo what happened to Blaine and Major + they can further develop the relation between Major and Liv. Maybe they can now physically be together again, but Major doesn't want to be with her anymore because they've drifted apart. We'll have to wait till this fall to know for sure"
iZombie,3b47l5,Mathy16,3,Fri Jun 26 12:16:57 2015 UTC,"This being a Rob Thomas show, I think you're right that there will be constant tension between Liv and Major - but I really wish that wasn't the case.  Liv has just screwed Major over to such an extent that it just doesn't make sense for her to be redeemable to him.  I mean, I get that his character is basically ""Mr. Perfect"" but still.  Leaving aside the fact that she broke off the engagement without any explanation, Liv has:   Kept the identities of the people responsible for murdering the homeless kids a secret, so they avoided justice Kept the zombiism a secret, thus allowing Blaine to grow in power, kill more kids, and allowing Major to believe he was going insane. Turned Major into a zombie against his will Used the last remaining bit of zombie cure on Major, thus making sure that the rest of the zombies couldn't be cured in the near future.  Again, she made a decision for him, putting his immediate humanity over the health and safety of so many others - including her brother.   The finale really hit on it, but it bears repeating - Liv is incredibly self-centered.  She justifies doing things that benefit her by trying to say they are helping people - even if those people are committing themselves into mental institutions.  Liv has got a loooooot of heavy lifting with regards to her own redemption if this show wants to make Liv + Major a believable thing."
iZombie,3b47l5,sighclone,4,Fri Jun 26 13:08:25 2015 UTC,"With as much social work as he does, I think Major would have above-average understanding of broken people and their mistakes. But then I tend to defend/justify Liv's decisions, so idk."
iZombie,3b47l5,Drake1701,2,Fri Jun 26 17:54:19 2015 UTC,"I think that either he cannot be reinfected, or reinfecting him would cause some kind of unknown reaction that he will be smart enough not to try."
iZombie,3b47l5,goldd3000,3,Fri Jun 26 14:04:54 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking that, given the source material deals with things other than zombies, perhaps the 'cure' doesn't turn them back into humans, but perhaps something else?"
iZombie,3b47l5,sighclone,3,Fri Jun 26 14:15:22 2015 UTC,Doubtful since the creators said they'd be keeping only the zombies and not the other creatures from the comics. Though that ideology may change !
iZombie,3b47l5,Aterisk,3,Fri Jun 26 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  I just hope they change whatever ideology led them to name a zombie character Liv Moore and another main character ""Major Lilywhite.""  Cringeworthy!  It's so weird, if one just takes my comments in this post, you'd think I hate the show.  But it's so fun, the few details like this just make me wonder what the creative process was like."
iZombie,3b47l5,sighclone,2,Fri Jun 26 20:50:56 2015 UTC,"I personally thought it was pretty clever. It got an ugly laugh once I realized it. As for majors name, they wanted to give him the most ""Mary Sue"" name possible.  I am definitely looking forward to the second season, I hope they keep the cringy-ness of it, kinda adds to the charm for me"
iZombie,3b47l5,Aterisk,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"I was okay with it because I initially thought it was a vestige of campy source material. When I found out the names were created for the show, I was really surprised. Personally, I would have liked those names more if they upped the camp factor, but honestly I like the show and will just ignore how ridiculous the names are."

iZombie,3b47l5,goldd3000,3,Fri Jun 26 16:13:55 2015 UTC,"He rarely used his zombie powers. Clients pay Blaine because they are brain addicts, not because they are afraid."
iZombie,3b47l5,Kinrany,7,Fri Jun 26 02:45:23 2015 UTC,"He turned them all into zombies, though. He preyed on people he knew could afford to keep him in business (and couldn't afford to let anyone know their secret). Now he can't do that."
iZombie,3b47l5,Hintobean,-4,Fri Jun 26 03:35:43 2015 UTC,He doesn't need to be a zombie himself to infect people. The only thing he really lost is convenience.
iZombie,3b47l5,Kinrany,3,Fri Jun 26 05:02:59 2015 UTC,"Then how did he infect them in the first place if he didn't need to be a zombie?   you can see him scratching Liv to turn her in the first episode, and I assume he did the same to all those others."
iZombie,3b47l5,Ironhead2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:06:21 2015 UTC,"Then how did he infect them in the first place if he didn't need to be a zombie?   I don't know how this is relevant. He did infect all those people by scratching them, but he has other options, i.e. zombie blood."
iZombie,3b47l5,Kinrany,3,Fri Jun 26 11:37:35 2015 UTC,"Now he is much more susceptible to injury, and any of his disgruntled clients can just go into zombie mode and kill him. He really wouldn't stand much of a have against that."
iZombie,3b47l5,Hintobean,2,Fri Jun 26 22:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but where will he find new customers? How will he handle his employees. He previous employees feared him because of what he could do to them, but no zombie employee has any reason to be loyal to him anymore because he can't do anything."
iZombie,3b47l5,Mathy16,2,Fri Jun 26 12:18:21 2015 UTC,"First, his employees were loyal because he killed those who weren't, not because they were afraid of him.  Second, he has a friggin gun, and it's much more effective at killing zombies than his zombie powers."
iZombie,3b47l5,Kinrany,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"The employees were very afraid of him just because he killed the guys that failed him or were unloyal. Sure, you could argue that he can use a gun from now on, but he still is unable to create new employees. I doubt many humans would want to have anything to do with zombies, especially since the only payment they receive was probably brains."
iZombie,3b47l5,Mathy16,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:29:58 2015 UTC,still is unable to create new employees   Nope. Making new zombies is easy when you have zombie customers who are interested in your business running smoothly. Either ask them to scratch someone or just get some blood and use it to poison people.
iZombie,3b47l5,Kinrany,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:20:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, because the rich and famous have time to go and scratch some low lives for a brain dealer."

iZombie,3b47l5,Kinrany,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:52:51 2015 UTC,I think the rich people would be more likely to freak out and kill Blaine when they find out he isn't a zombie anymore and his business has been destroyed and doesn't have anymore brains readily available for them
iZombie,3b47l5,hmpsnj,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:36:33 2015 UTC,rich people would be more likely to freak out and kill Blaine   I think most of them are smarter than that. And he only needs one of them to cooperate.   doesn't have anymore brains readily available for them   He has the brains Liv gave him.
iZombie,3b47l5,Kinrany,10,Fri Jun 26 22:02:56 2015 UTC,He can't make any more new zombies. No more zombie strength or invulnerability to common wounds. No new clients. Just old clients who are now much stronger than him and may want to taste his brains. No new zombie henchmen either. I suppose he can get non-zombie henchmen to do his bidding.
iZombie,3b47l5,iwishiwasamoose,4,Thu Jun 25 21:53:09 2015 UTC,It seems like it would be easy to just go to one of his clients and trade brains for getting scratched.
iZombie,3b47l5,orangecamo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:03:50 2015 UTC,"I thought of that too, but what if Liv gave Blaine a permanent cure, which means he's screwed? That would also mean Major is forever safe of becoming a zombie again."
iZombie,3b47l5,ansibility,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:49:03 2015 UTC,At the expense of curing the other zombies.  I'm assuming this will be another thing Major will be understandably pissed about.
iZombie,3b47l5,sighclone,0,Fri Jun 26 01:59:32 2015 UTC,He doesn't have to scratch his victims personally. He can also use zombie blood instead of scratching.
iZombie,3b47l5,Kinrany,4,Fri Jun 26 02:46:20 2015 UTC,I thought it was because she had no idea if it would work and was using him as a test. If it killed him then no big loss and if it cured him then she had enough left for herself
iZombie,3b47l5,Oskowski,3,Thu Jun 25 23:29:08 2015 UTC,"But none to cure any other zombies or make more serum. Honestly, every decision Liv makes is the exact wrong one."
iZombie,3b47l5,sighclone,2,Fri Jun 26 02:00:26 2015 UTC,"Yep. Not to mention that making it much more difficult for Blaine to continue his business essentially defeats the purpose of letting him live.  I mean, if the only reason he's left alive is because he's the only one who knows who the zombies are and can continue to supply them brains (in order to prevent god knows how many zombies from schizing out at the same time and murdering people at random), then taking away his ability to do that easily is just.....stupid.   Obviously he's going to have to find a way to deal with it (because the next season is supposed to pick up some time after this has happened, and Armageddon hasn't yet descended on Seattle) but that's FAR from being the most likely outcome. And Liv should have KNOWN that......"
iZombie,3b47l5,JBB1986,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:45:21 2015 UTC,Right but who says she would cure herself right away. She was already going to wait to test it so once they could recreate the formula she could cure reself
iZombie,3b47l5,Starrystars,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:10:55 2015 UTC,"Uh.........Liv literally grabbed the cure and was going to use it on herself in the finale, regardless of Ravi's well-reasoned arguments against it. The ONLY reason she didn't, was that she saw ""Major"" calling her, and decided to answer the phone first."
iZombie,3b47l5,JBB1986,0,Sat Jun 27 12:57:42 2015 UTC,"The person I was responding to said that.  I mean, no matter how you slice it, Liv handled that situation like an idiot.  First off, Liv has no idea what the effects of the serum would be on a human, and Ravi has no way of reproducing the serum without those two doses.  Liv is convinced to not kill Blaine because Blaine may be the only thing stopping the many zombies he has created from going full-on Walking Dead.  So instead, she decides to use half of this precious serum (which could kill him, she has no idea) on him, after she's shot him, so that he can't heal (which could also kill him).  She and Blaine part ways and she has no idea if he survives the night (or even if he remains cured).  So she decides to use the last dose of the serum on Major despite:   The fact that it could very well kill him The serum might not be enough to cure him (as Ravi noted, there were maybe two doses in there) The fact that Major would probably rather the dose be used to create a serum to cure everyone if it could actually be shown to work   Don't get me wrong, I like the show, but Liv has to be one of the dumbest main characters ever."
iZombie,3b47l5,sighclone,2,Fri Jun 26 16:58:25 2015 UTC,"It's also for testing if the cure works or not. Seeing as Zombie rat II died and she was about to use it on herself, it would be worth on testing it on a ""disposable"" test subject."
iZombie,3b47l5,DakobaBlue,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:49:54 2015 UTC,"But what if the cure kills, but not immediately?  Hell, she doesn't even know what happened to Blaine, but she still just gave it to Major.  Liv is just mind-bogglingly stupid/irresponsible."

iZombie,3b47l5,DakobaBlue,0,Fri Jun 26 13:19:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe?  Though that seems like more an irresponsible guess than a logical assumption.  Sorry, I just watched the finale last night, and while I really like the show/premise, Liv (like Veronica Mars) makes decisions that are just objectively terrible and I had to vent."
iZombie,3b47l5,sighclone,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:29:30 2015 UTC,"My thinking was that if he isn't a zombie, he holds little power over his minions and he'd have to stop his whole operation. He ruled by power and fear, but if he's human he is not really much of a threat anymore, and he can't even turn new zombies to start over somewhere else.  Although in theory he could just get the zombie virus again, so. Unless I guess the serum creates immunity...."
iZombie,3b47l5,crimsonfury73,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:42:38 2015 UTC,but if he's human he is not really much of a threat anymore   He doesn't need to be a zombie to make headshots.
iZombie,3b47l5,Kinrany,2,Fri Jun 26 05:05:00 2015 UTC,"True, but in theory the zombies would pose a bigger risk to him than he would to them now that he's not practically invincible."
iZombie,3b47l5,crimsonfury73,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:01:45 2015 UTC,My feeling was that she didn't entirely disbelieve his argument that the city was going to disintegrate into a zombie outbreak if he was to vanish.  Curing him was the only option open to her short of eliminating him.
iZombie,3b47l5,Agent_Dale_Cooper,2,Fri Jun 26 03:59:24 2015 UTC,a) Blaine can't kill people and sell their brains -> zombie outbreak happens anyway.  b) Blaine can kill people and sell their brains -> Liv wasted cure for nothing.

iZombie,3b0i26,FluffyCookie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"That's because they're turning the series around. After the success of The Flash and iZombie, they used their season finale to ease the series into the lighter mood the other series have, which should make Arrow more enjoyable and feel closer to the comics."

iZombie,3b10qu,suss2it,13,Thu Jun 25 02:37:23 2015 UTC,"The first few episodes have the Blaine/zombie problem subplot on the backburner. You get a few scenes, but nothing much.   Later on they become a much bigger part of the story, as does Major (who, surprisingly enough, is one of the more dynamic characters this season; he gets this whole arc of his own which takes him away from being the boring Perfect Ex trope; also, he gets beaten to within an inch of his life a lot).  So........yeah. At the beginning of the season they establish the characters, and have very little progress with the serialised story arc, and just have a bunch of procedural's that don't really matter. Then they hit midseason, and the balance shifts, with the procedurals being more in the backgroudn (as they should be) with the main zombie arc being the focus in most of the episodes (to one extent or another)."
iZombie,3b10qu,JBB1986,10,Thu Jun 25 07:08:10 2015 UTC,"There's an overall plotline going on, but if the ""case of the week"" trope is not your thing, the show might not be for you. I think that will always be a thing with this show."

If the show was to have more episodes ordered in season 2, the space they take up would have to be taken from one of the midseason shows.

There is also Penny Dreadful which is on its second season, I think."

iZombie,3a8wfp,LootableCorpse,13,Thu Jun 18 12:20:47 2015 UTC,"It makes some sense. Giving iZombie too many episodes creates the chance of making it feel too much like just another cop procedural show, as the Zombie plot in the background gets stretched too thin.  This way, they can do the whole solving murder cases when they need to, but at least 50% of the show can be about the zombies and whats going on behind the scenes.  If they had to stretch their plot over a 22 episode season, we'd probably get closer to 10-15% of the zombies and whats going on behind the scenes. And then it'd just be Law and Order + zombies."
iZombie,3a8wfp,Zinyak,3,Thu Jun 18 12:33:14 2015 UTC,"Good. Too many shows nowadays feel so dragged out and unfocused with 24 episodes per season. The story could have been told better, in a shorter amount of time, with much less pointless filler that adds nothing to the story. I think season 2 of iZombie is going to blow the first one out of the water."

Side note badges are like $900 USD.   Thankfully E3 had a Rockband 4 demo outside of the convention center that anybody could play. That kept me entertained while I was waiting for my friend.  I turned around and I saw him on his phone and I waved at him. He put down his phone, I assumed he was finished with the call, and motioned for me to come over.   We talked about the show and I got this picture. He then asked me for directions. He was lost and was looking for the entrance to the convention center.

I think we do get a sense of who Liv is throughout the show, both through how she acts in the several scenes when she's not ""on brains"", but also how she reacts and deals with the changes in her internal monologues. She was obviously very distressed when she was on sociopath brains, because she's normally really empathetic and wants to care about people. Once her soldier brains started to wear off, she found herself suddenly unable to kill Blaine, even though she knew how horrible he is, etc."
iZombie,3a2ijt,awesomebob,7,Tue Jun 16 19:22:32 2015 UTC,"To add to this, the reason that one man wanted astronaut brains so badly is because he wanted to know what it was like to go into space.

Though a couple of the one-shot zombies (such as Sebastian, and Laurence Kaiser) have mentioned being affected by the brains they eat...........so, I don't know.

iZombie,3a2ijt,Jdodds1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:12:55 2015 UTC,"But aside from liv and Lowell we've only seen the other zombies for a scene at a time, they've also made references to visions and personality changes like asking lib ""where'd you go?"" Or requesting astronaut brains cause they're sick of the slums...."
iZombie,3a2ijt,ansibility,3,Fri Jun 19 03:25:08 2015 UTC,Maybe Liv is just naturally hardwired to have a bigger capacity for empathizing with her brain donors. Which is why she has stronger visions than other zombies. Perhaps she really is a psychic in her own special zombie way. Or maybe because it's just more convenient for the plot ;) And she did say (don't remember which episode) that it's probably because she's actively investigating cases which could be why she has more vivid memories of the deceased.
iZombie,3a2ijt,CaptainChewbacca,2,Wed Jun 17 02:23:56 2015 UTC,Liv may be experiencing more visions/personality shift because when she does investigations she is around more 'triggers' from the life of the person she ate.  Other zombies may not do that.

iZombie,3a2ijt,forgotacc,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:02:15 2015 UTC,"We did see quite a bit with Lowell, we see more with Liv compare to other zombies because they're not on screen as much as Liv was. I do think they should show more with Blaine considering he was on screen quite a bit, though.  With visions, it makes sense considering Liv tries to find things that triggers them. iirc, Lowell even mention this which is why he never knew the brains he was getting was in the form of murder. So, I can understand the lack of visions from other zombies if they're not out looking to attempt to trigger them like Liv does."

Seriously, dude has a major hero complex (argh; puns.......) and he was literally BEGGING for a reason to suffer through this. Help the others. Help the people got stuck in a life they didn't want, and make sure they come out the other side okay. He would have been COMPLETELY on board with that! But no.....jab him with the final dose of an experimental cure that not only, might be impossible to recreate, now that the ingredients have run out, but might actually KILL HIM. Silly Liv."

I'm maybe still a little upset on how she basically screwed over zombies everywhere, and maybe the entire human race by using that last (prototype) dose on Major.

In the third episode (The Exterminator), they explicitly show you what happens when zombies go without eating brains for a long period of time."

I'm guessing that once they are infected something attacks their brain cells, which can't reproduce themselves, so their body replaces those damaged cells with the eaten ones. Somehow, handwavy handwavy.  If I was going to go full scifi, I'd suggest Ravi should clone some ""blank"" brain cells and then they could sell those to the zombie-infected until he makes a cure.

iZombie,39lnnr,serralinda73,8,Fri Jun 12 17:30:10 2015 UTC,"Spoilers for Episode 10+ :  Major discovers that there's a certain amino acid that's only produced in the brain. He said its used for muscle growth and building, which is another way of saying it speeds up the bodies natural healing and fitness process.   Zombies are able to actually HEAL. This is a new trope. They aren't feral or decaying unless they haven't eaten any brains at all.   This amino acid is likely responsible for helping the zombies to heal back to full health. (A la Live getting hit in the head and having no scratches or scars, and the various bullet holes)   The other interesting thing is that this amino acid is also found in a plant found only in Africa. I don't know if this was clever foreshadowing for the cure or not, but it's a fun theory.  EDIT: This also explains the super strength and reflexes during full-on Zombie mode. The body is storing these amino acids and when zombies go feral, these amino acids are fully released allowing the super strength and speed to manifest in feral zombies."
iZombie,39lnnr,KanishkT123,3,Fri Jun 12 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"It doesn't explain visions and memories.  Zombies are alive, they have something like regular human regeneration by default.

They don't have running blood for one thing, and barely feel pain for another. Without running blood, its impossible for the body to heal itself, since it can't get any capillaries or other important cells to the affected areas. Biologically, zombies shouldn't heal.   In E3, Marcy's state of decay shows exactly how much zombies need brains to live and heal. I would postulate that zombies can only heal if they eat brains, and not otherwise. I guess I was wrong about the scars, but the healing makes sense considering all the zombies we see have essentially a steady supply of brains."

I think Peyton will show up to give blood; however, as time goes on, Liv starts to notice changes. Eventually Ravi and her discover Peyton has some sort of natural immunity thing going on. They isolate whatever it is and make some sort of zombie insulin type of thing and orchestrate some shit where he gets diagnosed diabetic. So long as he takes the shots or whatever he goes on living a normal life. Well, until he forgets to take them and rages out at the most inconvenient of times.

So he hasn't really lost much, when you think about it. The only problem's he'll have are zombifying some new minions (and I'm certain he'll find a workaround; maybe recruit from amongst his less affluent clients?) and convincing everyone that he still IS a zombie."

iZombie,39j0h9,JBB1986,3,Sat Jun 13 06:27:18 2015 UTC,"But that's my whole point: he HASN'T suffered considerable losses.   All he's lost is manpower, and convenience. He still has money, he still has brains for the foreseeable future; he just needs to replace his people, which he didn't really care about, and make sure noone finds out about him being cured. Stressful, but not necessarily difficult.  He hasn't been knocked off the top of the totem pole, he still has a monopoly on the brain trade, and he's still feared by one and all. He hasn't lost anything that he can't deal with fairly easily, and the only serious loss is his zombie-ism.   To summarise, he doesn't NEED to attempt to get back on top, because he still IS on top. The only reason he wouldn't be was if someone else had attacked him and taken over, not just launched a superficial attack on his business interests and then backed off."
iZombie,39j0h9,awesomebob,3,Sat Jun 13 07:40:10 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the things you're saying in this post simply aren't true: he doesn't still have brains for the foreseeable future, nor does he have a monopoly on the brain trade. I also think the loss of so many upper-level henchmen all at once is a bigger loss than you (or Blaine, in the finale) makes it out to be.  He probably still has the brains Liv returned to him, but that was just one round of deliveries. It isn't enough brains to feed the zombies of Seattle for more than maybe a week. Where's he going to get more brains? Who is going to help him? Any storage of potential brains/helpers at Meet-Cute got blown up, so where's he getting zombie blood or people to inflict with it? If they're new to Team Z, then Blaine's reputation probably doesn't precede him, so he can't just cow them with fear like he could his previous henchmen. He isn't feared ""by one and all"", he's feared by people already on Team Z.  As for a monopoly, any zombie can get brains pretty much whenever they want; they just need to crack someone's skull open. Blaine's business succeeded on convenience and reliability, but the moment that wavers, even if it's just temporary, things can go to shit very fast. If there's any delay in turnaround while Blaine recruits new people, finds new victims, etc, the other zombies aren't just going to sit patiently and wait for him.  Blaine went from having a secure base of operations with reliable and mostly-competent underling, reliably providing a valued service to a loyal customer base, and a pawn placed high in the local police's chain of command to divert suspicion from him, to having no base of operations, no underlings, a bunch of hungry zombies expecting brains that he's quickly going to run out of, a stab wound to the chest, and a vet operating on him. If that's not a fall from power, then I don't know what is."
iZombie,39j0h9,JBB1986,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:34:43 2015 UTC,"Fair points (and I completely forgot about Suzuki for a second; no idea HOW I did that, considering he's such a huge factor, but I did), but in regards to the zombie blood, I was operating under the assumption that he could coerce some of his less powerful/influential clients into donating.  I MAY have been a little melodramatic with the whole ""feared by one and all"" thing, but I was clearly referring to those individuals who Blaine already had under his thumb, and those really ARE the only one's that matter here. As long as THEY believe him to be as powerful as he's ever been, then he should make out alright, and get away with just about whatever he wants, as he's been doing.  ""The foreseeable future"" might have been a little inaccurate as well (I tend to exaggerate for effect; sorry about that), but still, we don't know how often he delivers, or how long those brains last once he delivers them (though logic says that since Liv can't possibly be snacking on the brains of every poor schmuck to come into the morgue, then there must be periods where she goes without brains, or at least makes said brains stretch for extended periods). He should be able to buy himself at least 2-3 weeks with what he has (doubtful he could get away with much more than that). Doesn't seem like much time, but if he can find somewhere else to base his operation out of (even temporarily) and find a way to procure himself some help (not even necessarily zombies; simply pay a few regular humans to nab vulnerable people off the street) then he could feasibly prepare and deliver the brains himself, until he can find a more permanent solution. There might be a small adjustment period, but if he scrambles, then he can swing it before the zombies start snapping and ripping into their neighbours. Probably  So........yeah, not as simple as I made it out to be (or as Blaine himself made it out to be; though, granted, he was expecting to have his zombie abilities to help him out, which would have made it possible for him to grab people himself, and FAR easier to recruit new talent) but certainly possible. Ok, I'll agree that he's lost a fair amount , and that he's very close to losing his grasp on...well, everything,  but the illusion of power is still intact, and he still has quite a bit in his corner. He still possesses all the pieces he needs to regain what was lost. He just needs to do it quickly. Riskier than he'd like, no doubt, but doable.  Hell, he might try and force Liv's hand for help; after all, surely she'd be happier taking more of a risk at work and getting her hands on the brains of the already dead, than allow Blaine to go out and murder innocent's to feed the zombie population. If he goes THAT route, then he'll buy himself even MORE time to pull it together. Which he obviously does, seeing as how the next season is supposed to pick up a few months on, and Blaine's still running his business.  WOW that was a lot.

How would he explain that he is cured to a client?  I bet we have a scene next season where he has to eat brains so as not to seem suspicious or perhaps he declines to and that arouses someone's suspicions.

She is mad at herself and holds a grudge against Major, since she used the cure on him. If only she had waited just a little longer, she could have saved her brother. But, they are thrown together again when all the Meat Cute customers start crawling out of the wood work, leaving a string of bodies in their wake. Clive and Liv do their usual thing, though Clive is becoming more aware of all the weird occurrences.   While Ravi and Liv struggle to replicate the cure, Major continues to put himself in danger, following Clive and Liv so he can take out the zombies.  Is Peyton coming back? I don't know. Does Liv's brother pull through? We'll see.  I do hope, however, that they do continue to balance the funniness of the show, with the drama, and the action. Hopefully next season, that will get stepped up a notch. I'm not sure if anyone else noticed, but in the finale, like...none of the guns had a recoil when shot. HA!"
iZombie,39j0h9,JBB1986,5,Fri Jun 12 05:33:17 2015 UTC,Clearly Major's so freakishly buff that he can casually hold a shotgun perfectly steady whilst blowing zombie brains all over a butcher's shop.

However, he isn't successful at producing more of it without more of the original drug, so I could see that he willingly makes a deal with them to make progress. This choice is probably ultimately a disaster for everyone. I'm assuming that to keep the plot going, there won't be any more viable cures around for a while.   Meanwhile, Clive tries desperately to link Major to the massacre at the Meat Cute without much support from anyone, probably mirroring Major's decent into madness in the process.

At this point he calls in the Army at the end of the second season and we have a full blown 28 days later comedy on our hands. This leads into an izombie movie if the show is canceled.  Evan survives but turns into a werewolf.  Peyton x Ravi.  We get a young zombie that's trying to survive the mean streets of Seattle.  Blaine fakes being a zombie brain dealer with Liv using his fake status as cover to protect her family.

In all seriousness, Major is one of my favorite characters on the show, but a well-written white dude isn't exactly groundbreaking, especially when the supposedly trope-breaking behaviors are traditionally masculine in nature. The real strengths of this show lie in Liv, Ravi, and Detective Babineaux.

Her mom seems to be a pretty successful Doctor maybe she just never had time to settle down but wanted kids and went to a sperm bank.  Liv's mothers name is Eva and her brothers name is Evan so I can see it being plausible as most son's aren't named after their mother.

(The Liv's dumb part was instead of taking few weeks/months of Major's bitching and moaning she wasted the last of the cure on him making sure that the tens/hundreds of zombies out there can go full apocalypse on the city. Every death in S2 will be on her.)  I love the show but I hate when characters are turned into tween idiots."

Major might have thought there was just this small group of zombies, and that the brain he found in Julian's car was his lunch.  Silly, I know, but when you look at all the info Major has access to, it makes just as much sense as the alternative, and this version of events doesn't make him have to come to terms with the fact that there might be countless other zombies roaming around out there."

iZombie,39c4r1,colorzofurmind,7,Wed Jun 10 21:56:38 2015 UTC,I haven't thought much about the connection between Blaine's zombie operation and Max Rager since they are treated separately in the show. But Blaine must be involved somehow.
iZombie,39c4r1,JBB1986,4,Wed Jun 10 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe......different last names, but that could be for any number of reasons. Hell, Blaine might be going under an alias.

iZombie,39c4r1,RAZRBCK08,3,Thu Jun 11 05:11:04 2015 UTC,Maybe Blaine got into the drug industry and daddy disowned him or he wants to make his own name for himself.  Just a couple potential reasons why having a billionaire dad might not deter someone from being a petty street dealer. I'm sure there are other more likely explanations but it's early for me. I don't necessarily agree the CEO is his dad though.

iZombie,39c4r1,EmperorJoker,3,Thu Jun 11 10:10:49 2015 UTC,So happy that iZombie has a Spike now!
iZombie,39c4r1,PraxisLD,3,Thu Jun 11 14:33:34 2015 UTC,"I was thinking this was a random and entirely unsubstantiated theory.  But then I remembered that the MR guy is Mr. Du Clark, a really weird name which looks like an English person at some point has tried to write down ""de Klerk"", an Afrikaans name. And Blaine is Mr. DeBeers, and ""de Beers"" is also an Afrikaans name. And that seems like kind of a coincidence!  You have to think, if you WERE the black sheep of a billionaire family with Afrikaans roots, you might want to change your name when becoming a drug dealer. And if you did change your name, you might stick with something with an Afrikaans sound, like your real name. And if you were looking for an Afrikaans name then, well, "" De Beers"", one of the largest and most famous companies in the world, would surely be something that came easily to mind!  Especially as the real name is 'de Beer', not 'de Beers'. The company wasn't founded by Mr de Beer, it was founded by Cecil Rhodes, who gave it that name because one of its diamond claims was under a farm owned by the de Beer brothers. So, while I can't promise that there aren't any genuine DeBeers-es out there, having that form of the name does rather suggest someone just nicked the name from the company, rather than it being inherited.  But of course it's probably just a coincidence."
iZombie,39dc6g,Viper_H,31,Thu Jun 11 00:23:02 2015 UTC,Writing wise I'd say Veronica Mars might even be stronger! But you'll have to adjust for pop culture and TV tropes that were popular ten years ago.
iZombie,39dc6g,SawRub,9,Thu Jun 11 01:15:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. Veronica Mars has the same sort of witty dialogue, reference bananza writing. It has a similar execution with Veronica doing the voice over. The tone is darker for sure, though it's less violent.  I did a comparison of season 1 of iZombie vs Veronica Mars. I'll link it in a second here it is.  TL:DR In many ways Veronica Mars is even better. Don't watch it if you don't like the idea of a low production value show. Watch it if you like the writing and humor of iZombie."
iZombie,39dc6g,LibertarianSocialism,12,Thu Jun 11 02:08:01 2015 UTC,I love that a show about a teenage private eye is darker than a zombie show.

iZombie,39dc6g,FivebyFive,9,Thu Jun 11 00:44:52 2015 UTC,Yes. Yes yes yes. Sassy petite blonde. Witty dialogue. Dark drama. Compelling season long mystery. It's basically the same but about class warfare and high school.
iZombie,39dc6g,groudhogday,9,Thu Jun 11 00:37:32 2015 UTC,If you take the zombies out of iZombie you would have Veronica Mars.  The plots and characters are very similar except they are high school students instead of cops / medical examiners.    Can't recommend VM highly enough.  Seasons 1 and 2 are two of the best seasons of television ever.
iZombie,39dc6g,fellatious_argument,3,Thu Jun 11 03:58:09 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I enjoy iZombie but VMars is leaps and bounds superior.

I actually watched the first episode accidentally (my dvr recorded funny) but have loved it's progression. It'll be really interesting to see what this strain on relationships does to Liv next season: -Losing Major/Ravi/Peyton's trust  -The strain not giving her blood will put on her family. Going to be super interesting! (I hope!)
iZombie,39bppd,colorzofurmind,5,Wed Jun 10 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"Your title makes it sound like you didn't enjoy the first episode much at all. I actually loved the first episode, and it was a great benchmark for the tone and development of this world we would become invested in. Granted, the procedural-cop portion has always been one of the weakest aspects - acting more as a base for the real plot to be built upon - but I'm more glad I decided to take a shot at this show in the first place."

iZombie,39bppd,forgotacc,3,Wed Jun 10 23:39:33 2015 UTC,"I find most shows that are comedy/drama usually have more ""silliness"" at the start of the season, and then usually tone it down closer to the finale to make more room for more drama. I don't think you'll have to worry about the lack of silliness for future seasons, though, they seem to balance it very well.  Anyways, I also got my SO into this show, he seemed against it at first until I made him watch an episode with me; seemed to fall in love with it quickly enough to binge the rest of the season with me."
iZombie,39bppd,mkfffe,2,Wed Jun 10 21:04:14 2015 UTC,"So, I almost didn't watch Episode 1 because the premise seemed too silly to me. I thought the first episode was one of the best openers to a series I've seen in awhile."

iZombie,39egco,Castriff,5,Thu Jun 11 04:45:47 2015 UTC,"Zombies will lose as soon as humans know about them. They are good fighters, but even regular policemen will be able to take them down. And it's too easy to find out whether a person is a zombie."
iZombie,39egco,Kinrany,2,Thu Jun 11 07:24:46 2015 UTC,"How? If they dye their hair, and put on a fake tan, how would you IMMEDIATELY tell whether or not someone was a zombie?  And seeing as how police officers are trained not to go for head shots, but rather aim for centre mass, then it's likely that any zombie could handle quite a few police officers. And besides, if it got to the point where humans knew about them, it wouldn't be hard for them to simply start infecting people deliberately.  Just stroll down a street, nicking people on the arm. Extract a portion of your blood, infect a local water supply. Have other zombies do it in other cities. REALLY not that hard. The only problem would be that that's sort of a catastrophic move. That would be far too many people to keep track of, and so they'd all turn fairly quickly (without regular brain deliveries) and would just start attacking and infecting people. But ""shrugs"" if your only option is let the situation spiral out of control, or sit down and wait for death, what would you do?  A couple dozen zombies? Sure, that'd be no problem for any PD. A couple hundred? A couple thousand? More? That's a problem. And it gets even worse when you consider the fact that there are going to be some zombies who don't reach the point of rabid insanity, and are still capable of rational thought, and making a coherent plan of attack. Which eliminates the single biggest advantage any law enforcement/military force would have in that kind of situation (zombies being dangerous, but dumb as shit and easily taken down with care).  Seriously, I don't get why people are so dismissive of the concept in television, particularly in a show like this, where the zombies are capable of formulating plans of their own, rather than just swarming mindlessly on whatever crosses their path."
iZombie,39egco,JBB1986,2,Fri Jun 12 12:27:16 2015 UTC,"It looks like your post is based on two assumptions:   Humans don't know anything but the fact that zombies exist. Zombies are Stupid Evil.   As soon as humans know about zombies, they'll get all the information. It takes one cooperative zombie to tell them everything, and even in the worst case they just have to catch one zombie.  Zombies don't suddenly become stupid, malevolent and self-destructive. Zombies do not want a zombie apocalypse, they want to be cured. If there's a war between zombies and humanity, zombies lose anyway, so their only options are hiding and cooperating.  Again, they can't hide in plain sight, like vampires, because they're fucked as soon as somebody asks to check their pulse."

It’s sort of a great existential question of, could you have a romantic partner with whom the sexual limits were very, very strict? How would that go?   Sounds very Pushing Daisies!"
iZombie,399hfm,chromaticburst,6,Wed Jun 10 06:54:03 2015 UTC,So the question is if they can get reinfected.  If they can get reinfected would Blaine reinfect himself from one of his Zombie clients?
iZombie,399hfm,ConcordApes,5,Wed Jun 10 16:51:27 2015 UTC,"I was reading one of those interview articles with Rob Thomas, and he says that there's nothing stopping Blaine from being re-infected. Being a human does have its perks though (Blaine can finally enjoy regular food again). The way they're going to play Blaine next season is sort of the opposite of season 1 (where he was a zombie pretending to be human). Now, in season 2, he's going to be a human pretending to be a zombie (you know, so meeting his clients, they don't want to crack open his skull and eat his brains)."

iZombie,3989xk,FiscalClifBar,30,Wed Jun 10 01:33:31 2015 UTC,"Glad they didn't let the AssHat case dominate the finale; while it did give us a sneak peek at the baddies for Season 2 (and that CEO will be one hell of a villain), it was easily the weakest portion of the episode. Major's arc came to a smashing conclusion: kickass fight scene with just the right amount of trepidation, Major FINALLY learning Liv's secret and reacting accordingly, and Major getting a taste of the zombie life.  He'll have an interesting road ahead, especially with Clive now hot on his trail. Liv's arc sort of got the shaft, but her scenes were still pretty good; McIver sold Liv's desperation for the cure, and her regret at lying to Major.  The good thing is that Liv will get a lot of focus with her turning down the blood transfusion. Blaine might be human (for now...) but he'll still be a force to be reckoned with.  I'm glad he didn't die, David Anders kills it every single time, and this is an interesting direction to take his character.  I would not be surprised to see him team up with Max Rager....   Overall, fantastic finale, super pumped for Season 2.  Great job iZombie!"
iZombie,3989xk,Future_Vantas,11,Wed Jun 10 01:08:09 2015 UTC,"I would not be surprised to see him team up with Max Rager....   Not really sure. A couple of things:   Max Rager seems to want to eliminate all zombies, and harness the zombie ""secret sauce"" for their energy drink. Blaine isn't on this radar since he is now ""cured."" but he is the connection between all of the zombies. He would be useful to Max Rager for tracking them all down. The existing zombies are probably worth more to Blaine ""alive"" (and continuing to pay for brains) than dead. Not sure how Blaine benefits from joining up with Max Rager. As a ""cured"" zombie, Blaine would be of particular interest to the Max Rager scientist. As someone that knows about zombies, Blaine is a loose end that Max Rager might want to tie up rather than keep around. Now that the astronaut brains are all gone, some of his clients won't be too happy with him. How many of them might actually turn on him (and try to take him out)?"

iZombie,3989xk,dmt2004,53,Wed Jun 10 04:21:11 2015 UTC,They keep shitloads of O negative on hand. O negative is the universal donor so it is used in almost all emergency surgeries. If the hospital had no O negative then anyone who came in with an emergency wound would probably die from blood loss.

iZombie,3989xk,platypus_bear,18,Wed Jun 10 05:26:23 2015 UTC,That's just it. Hospitals in real life use O negative for everything. It's overused. People who are type A have a A protein on the surface of their blood cells. They also have antibodies for type B blood. Or blood with the B protein at the surface of their red blood cells. Type B people have antibodies for the protein found in type A blood. Which is why when you give someone who is type A type B blood they will most likely die because their body attacks it.
iZombie,3989xk,TheOrigamiGamer16,22,Wed Jun 10 05:32:17 2015 UTC,O group doesn't have these proteins so they can donate to a wide variety of people. However they can only receive blood from an O group person. For example I can only receive O negative or O positive.
iZombie,3989xk,TheOrigamiGamer16,7,Wed Jun 10 06:36:38 2015 UTC,"Mentioned this scene to a relative who works in a hospital blood bank. They said it is possible for them to run out of a particular blood type even without a big incident taking place.  If they were close to running out, they would call up their local supplier and tell them to send more units STAT and the blood would be driven to the hospital immediately. Also if they had O-positive blood they could give that in a life-or-death situation.  They would never draw blood from a donor and transfuse it on the spot. It takes days to process blood and make sure it's safe, and a family member's donation isn't more safe than blood from an anonymous donor.  The mom says ""Liv's O-negative, remember? That time you sliced your head open on that nail, Evan was a match for you."" So apparently this has happened before, and presumably Liv wasn't close to death from a cut on the head.."

Although him lingering at the goddamn freezer window was just moronic, like really? How can he forget Blaine's existence that easily?  Also Liv was a pretty big idiot this episode. I know the brains give her some mannerisms, but did they also transfer the teenager's stupidity to her?  First the hooded hostage, and then she doesn't even have the decency to tell Major ""Hey Ravi is working on a cure, so we just need to be patient and wait and keep eating dead people brains for a little while and everything will be alright.""  Major is clearly a guy with a hero complex, he'd totally be cool with being a temporary zombie while Ravi figured shit out so that they could save everyone.  Instead, after one convo where he shits on Liv (rightfully so imo) she decides to use the LAST FUCKING DOSE OF CURE on him, dooming all other zombies unless I misunderstood Ravi, and possibly killing Major with very early prototype of the cure.  Fucking Liv, you are an idiot. That said, I feel really bad for her after that ending. Holy shit, suddenly everyone thinks only you can save your brother, yet only you know that you CANT. How is she going to explain that she can't give her blood? Fuck me, that's just awful. Either she turns her brother into a zombie, or loses him and her mother at the same time.  ALSO WHERE THE FUCK IS PEYTON. DID SHE LIKE, LEAVE THE COUNTRY?! I just can't believe she didn't even have a scene in this episode, not even one that showed where she ran off to after episode 12.  ... Inb4 Peyton shows up next season as a zombie because Sebastian turned her before Liv killed him. :x"
iZombie,3989xk,Zinyak,16,Wed Jun 10 01:14:59 2015 UTC,"The show's writers needed a way to write Peyton out of the show, but they needed to do it in a way so she could potentially come back. This is because Aly Michalka had left to do a pilot for another series, but, that show wasn’t picked up. The producer for the show hopes that she will return for season two. The way I believe they are explaining this is that Peyton ran off after seeing what Liv had become and she needed some time to deal with what she had seen."
iZombie,3989xk,TheOrigamiGamer16,7,Wed Jun 10 01:17:54 2015 UTC,"I wonder if stacking all these ""brain"" personalities is eroding Liv's own, so that even if she wasn't still under the influence of dumb teenager brain, the conflict of past brains has made her less able to make rational decisions.      Or, you know, she's making decisions about Major based on emotions. Possibly teenager-level emotions."

However, he might be embedded with zombie chunks. What excuse will Liv come up with in order to not give her brother blood? HIV?  I feel like he was sacrificed for Major's character, and I'd rather have had a cranky Major-zombie.   There were a lot of characters in play, so I feel like Peyton's return could have crowded the field. I do hope the actress hasn't split."

Even if he's not a zombie himself he can always get a blood sample from one of his clients, mix it into someone's food and then make them into a zombie, creating more clients for himself.  I mean the guy basically killed her ex-lover and her ex-ex lover in front of her and she thinks curing him of being a zombie is the proper revenge.

Blaine has turned numerous people across the city, and they have to work on curing them all and saving the world from a potential zombie apocalypse.  I feel like that would have made Major turn a complete 180,  he has a huge hero complex obviously, and I think he'd have been more than willing to try to help fix things.  Instead, Liv doesn't say a word about that, takes the time to try to get romantic with Major after JUST turning him into a zombie, and then when she gets rightfully shot down, she uses up the last of a prototype cure that might just rekill him, to make things right."
iZombie,3989xk,Zinyak,6,Wed Jun 10 01:40:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think there were some issues with how both characters acted there. Liv seemingly failed to mention some important stuff in order to justify Major's anger, when there really isn't much she could have done better. My comment from elsewhere:   I get why Major was pissed, but the fact that he seemed to completely blame Liv for everything was the part that made me think he was being unfair. Blaine turned Liv into a zombie, which she probably should have made clear, seeing as it was pertinent to the conversation they were having with Blaine in the room. It's not her fault she's this way, and she's pretty much being the most morally upstanding zombie physically possible. She also turned him into a zombie in order to preserve his life, knowing full well that it was possible to cure zombie-ism, something she also could have bothered to mention in the first place. Mostly I'm worried, from what Rob Thomas is saying already, that I'm really going to hate Major next season. He's already done some infuriating and stupid things throughout this season, to the point where he should have died on about five different occasions, so I can definitely see a really dickish side to his character coming out.

The same can't be said for the brain."
iZombie,39ajaa,grunscga,3,Thu Jun 11 03:34:25 2015 UTC,"Because in the Buffy universe vampires don't have souls, which basically means they have no conscience.  Even a good person instantly turns evil once they become a vampire as part of the condition.    A better analog would be if they turned into a full zombie due to lack of brains and killed someone though Liv pointed out that she's never eaten anyone she didn't want to."
iZombie,39ajaa,fellatious_argument,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:44:08 2015 UTC,"Right...forgot about the lack of a soul in Buffyverse vamps. I have to concede on that point.    I still don't think Blaine will ever get full redemption, though, for exactly the reasons you mentioned.  At best, I think he'll be an untrustworthy ally-of-convenience, and that's only if Liv is smart enough to arrange things so it's in his best interest to help her and not stab her in the back brain."
iZombie,39ajaa,grunscga,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:00:05 2015 UTC,"Well, Liv's a special case, and has no real call to go judging anyone else. I mean, the SECOND she worked out what she was, she immediately put in for a transfer to the morgue, where (mostly) guilt-free brains are in abundance. Not every zombie just HAPPENS to be a doctor who is far too over-qualified to be working in a morgue, and is thus certain to get the job.  ......kind of a bitchy thing to say to someone who just ate perhaps the only person who mattered to them, because of something YOU did. I mean, Sebastian deserved to die (he was a killer for hire, creepy beyond belief, and more than a little sadistic; terrible combo), but THAT? And to throw it back in his face? All class, Liv.

iZombie,399nyx,Zinyak,11,Wed Jun 10 06:49:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is completely mad/pissed off with Liv. It didn't seem like it when they were talking. He was disappointed but not mad. You have to account that A LOT of stuff just happened. Everyone's emotions are high, they are confused as to what just happened. Major was conscious for like what? 5 min? And her telling her about Ravi would add to the ""wait someone else was lying?!"" which will eventually happen but I doubt it will be in typical CW writing (""DON'T TALK TO ME IM HURT AND BETRAYED BUT I LOVE YOU BUT IDK"".)  They have done an AMAZING job in writing the romantic character in Major. He did have a story and his own journey (I'm looking at you Iris West.) He has always cared for Liv and have shown it in a mature not obnoxious way (IRIS.. .) Though he will be different. Like he just said, what was his way of redemption as a zombie? He might not need that one now but he did experience the craving and saw the sadistic/mob like organization behind it. Hell, he saw one of the kids without his brain. He will be as useful and skilled and determined as always but maybe just more distrustful of everyone, not just Liv."
iZombie,399nyx,elguitarro,3,Wed Jun 10 07:26:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your post. I still think Liv was an idiot for not telling him about Ravi and the cure, instead wasting literally the last tainted utopian they HAD.   It was honestly the worst choice Liv has made all season, even beating not shooting Blaine and getting her zombie lover killed because of it.  We've already found out through articles about season 2 that Ravi is basically going to be hunting for tainted utopian all season, which means that Liv basically sacrificed a very close chance to cure all zombies, just so she could immediately give a relatively untested cure to Major.  But hey, I guess we can chalk that up to the stupid teenager brains she was high on, if those were still in play. Then again, maybe it was her own stupidity and she has no excuse.  That said, Major is frankly my favorite character at this point, and Liv barely makes the top five, behind Blaine, Ravi, and Clive in that order.  Doesn't necessarily make iZombie a bad show, I have loved this season, but this is the first show I've loved, where I don't actually care for the main character."
iZombie,399nyx,elguitarro,3,Wed Jun 10 07:35:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with your post but remember that this decision actually goes with Liv's character. We are so used to this detective, think-on-her-feet Liv but forget that before being a Zombie she was a social awkward medstudent. She didn't go to parties, she was a straight-A bookworm-intelligent person or in medschool terms, she was a ""gunner"" student. She was never this ""life"" intelligent. That's why she didn't take the shot, that's why she didn't tell Major/looked for help.   She has been changing slowly, that's why she took today's shot at Blaine and not in the brain. She's different, a more savvy person however  Major is the only ""thing"" that is still holding her to that Liv. And that is the person she wants to become again. That's why she wants the cure, so she can return herself to that, she doesn't want change, she doesn't want to be this Liv. That's why she saved Major and tried to be her old self and didn't know what to say. He has changed now too.   That's what I actually like from both characters. They aren't being on our face of LIV DOESN'T WANT TO CHANGE BU BU BU but they show it with those little glimpses/dumb Liv moments to makes us remember ""ohh yeah.. she wasn't this badass person"" while Major has always been perfect, they explicitly mention it on the first episode/episodes .   Hopefully my point of view maybe gave you a ""uh.."" moment haha. I know that feeling of not caring for the main character ( cough Orange is the New Black cough. like really.. the main character could be gone and I would not care. Don't know why it's so popular. I keep arguing if it wasn't bc all EPs are at the same time it wouldn't have survived this long.)"

She also was a little bit agressive (we've seen her punching other asshats), and I don't think we've seen the same behavior in s13 .  It's just Liv being stupid/holding idiot ball again."

You're right, if Liv had just said ""Yeah, I turned you into a zombie against your will to save your life, but Ravi already has a cure and we just need to make more of it. Give us a couple months and we'll both be human,"" then that probably would have made him feel better about the whole situation. Instead, she sort of wasted the cure on Major. I'm sure he appreciates being human, but I think he would have preferred curing all zombies, especially since ridding the world of zombies has been his mission for a few episodes. Long term thinking. Better to tough it out as a zombie for a few months so everyone could be cured. I hope Ravi yells at Liv for her shortsightedness."

A series is only as good as its villains and iZombie has at least three great villains set up for next season.  First Blaine is not dead and he is going away.   David Anders nails the smug snake villain so well I just can't wait to see how he plays the ex-zombie role.  Vaughan plays the evil corporate overlord to a T.  But the character is perfectly positioned because while he is still completely evil he has a very good reason to prevent a widespread zombie outbreak.    Finally there is the rich guy who wanted the astronaut brains.  The best thing about that character is that Liv & co don't know he exists, and even if they find out won't realize he is evil.  He has near infinite resources to devote to finding a cure.  He also has both the resources and reason to want Blaine and Vaughan dead.  However he is decidedly not a nice guy.  He is a wild card that could be played either to make Liv's life miserable or to bail her out.  Whatever the plot demands.  Finally we have complications among the hero's team.  Major is angry with Liv.   Clive strongly suspects that Major is a killer.  What happens when Clive asks Liv for help solving the case of the serial killer who is going around shooting apparently unrelated people in the head with a shotgun, and the killer turns out to be Major cleaning up a zombie infestation?        Maximum compliments to the writers on this one.  They could take this show in so many different directions."

iZombie,38vlz6,pg2441,3,Sun Jun 7 06:49:25 2015 UTC,"Good question: I wonder if freezing brain specimens would work (and preserve whatever it is that Liv gets her visions and stuff from). I don't think Liv would have to worry about an ""expiry date"" though, since she seems immune to brain-induced ""food-poisoning"". We've already seen a couple episodes where she's had to eat brains that were rotten (I think one of them was that was the computer hacker, where the guy wasn't found for like a week after he died, so his corpse just laid there rotting away). Liv didn't seem particularly pleased with eating said rotten brains, but she didn't seem to suffer any ill effects aside from the usual ""visions"" and personality quirks."

Even if she kept a few favorite brains she would be using them during the days between episodes when she isn't solving murders.   The only way your suggestion would work is if she carried a utility belt of personality types for some skill she needs for all of 5 mins then has to re eat some murder brain leftovers. The show would instantly become a farce and be cancelled faster than Constantine."
iZombie,38sqbs,TooLazyForThisWorld,10,Sat Jun 6 14:18:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, I like this.   One problem I have with TV is that characters are always too damn stupid to see things as they clearly are, and too stupid to make logical or any other type of connection. Their stupidity is all plot-driven. We see smart characters make connections only when it drives the plot to make the character look smart (Sherlock, Psych, House).   Anyways, I'd love to see Major make that connection. I doubt it will happen. Clive is having open conversations about Liv's visions in the police station bullpen without ridicule. Selective stupidity is definitely a plot driven aspect of the show."
iZombie,38sqbs,peterkeats,3,Sat Jun 6 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"I know I really want Major to finally be portrayed as somebit smart and use his brains (before they're eaten lol). He's been shown to be pretty perfect in so many ways (ignoring his obsesions), and he was even smart enough to track down the candy man and Blaine, make the connections that Jerome wasn't killed by those two cult people even though everyone told him he was wrong. I really like Major's character (and i ship him and Liv really hard) so I'd really like the show to give him some bit of logical reasoning in the next season."

Iris and Felicity are (most of the time) extremely boring and useless. Major is a great character on his own and really adds something great to the overall cast of characters and the main storyline.  He's more than just a LI for the main protagonist. He has his own storyline that can co-exist besides Liv's storyline without being less interesting.

Teresa looked severely beat up; even if she fought back (very difficult since she was ambushed) someone who hunts zombies should have had no trouble putting her down in one shot.  My theory is that Max Ranger got to her... and their agent was the company's first intentional zombie soldier.  He (or she) was probably meant to kill Sebastian so he couldn't squeal, but once the company learned a group of kids saw Sebs in his full zombie glory, they put a hit on the kids as well."
iZombie,38qmya,Future_Vantas,2,Sat Jun 6 02:36:46 2015 UTC,"Ooh yea the Max rager angle probably makes more sense than mine. I really like the setup with Major discovering zombies on his own, maybe he'll be the one to initiate the hunters. Wouldn't be the first time two lovers ended up as leaders on opposite sides.

Hell, he might organize hunters as a way to protect Liv.  I have a feeling you'll get a ""called it"" moment soon enough.

Sebastian, so far as we know, has eaten only one and a bit brains in a little over two weeks, with a big fast in between (so far as we know).   Likewise, Blaine's clients. I know Lowell acted like he had brains morning noon and night... but did he? And how much? We're only aware of a few dozen teenagers going missing in total, in however many months this show has been running for, and Blaine surely has at least a dozen clients. Looking at the meals he's sent out, it looks like they're heavy on the dressing, very light on the actual brain matter. I suspect Blaine only gives his clients enough brain to keep them placated - that lets him serve more clients per murder, and also keeps his clients hungry (i.e. motivated). So apart from maybe Blaine, Liv may be much 'healthier', and hence stronger, than the other zombies.  Plus older. And that might go along with better-fed as well: older equals more brains eaten in total, and maybe that's what determines strength?  But actually, in the fight I'm not sure Liv needs to be stronger than Sebastian. Instead, she has the initiative. As a 'human', she gets Sebastian to the ground, and wallops him with a pan. Great! Then he recovers, gets her in the gut, and is about to stab her in the head - not so great. She turns her head away from him when he rages out [hang on, where did Blaine get that term? From MR executives?] so he doesn't know she's changed. Then she surprises him with her strength, and gets the initiative again. From there, it's more about doing the right things than being stronger.   So really, I'd put it down to a) luck, b) getting the jump on him twice, and c) managing to keep her head and fight effectively while in zombie mode, plus d) Sebastian isn't used to fighting zombies (why bother stabbing her in the gut? Doesn't do anything but lose him a knife...)."

iZombie,38f1f8,Kinrany,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"good point. I've no excuse for that... not after Liv expressly mentioned how a zombie mode zombie could crush skulls so easily. Either Liv is very strong, or Sebastian is very weak."
iZombie,38f1f8,VacuousWastrel,6,Wed Jun 3 21:41:50 2015 UTC,Sebastian is extremely weak. He has had at least two drops into starving insanity and we know from studying Marcy that the damage accumulated from starvation does not regenerate.

iZombie,38f1f8,Kinrany,2,Sat Jun 6 23:12:19 2015 UTC,"Some definate good points and I do like the point about how Liv has eaten more total brains (possibly more variety of brains as well, that could make interesting S2 and beyond plot points about zombies just killing loads of people to try and power up)  However I am not sure I agree about the well fed part. Liv seems to me as though she only eats enough brains to keep herself self aware and when she needs visions to have them. She never seems to gorge on brains (as seen with the Pizza they had the full pizza to eat but she only had two tiny off cuttings of brain to put on it and they were apparently enough to give her visions/make her a stoner even though Clive ate one). On the other hand when Sebastian killed his aunt he literally cracked her open and licked it clean. So while Liv may have full access to brains we don't know if she partakes.  Something that occurred to me while typing this however is that FOZM may be a diminishing effect. So upon first entering it you are super strong and can take on the world but after a couple of minutes you have diminished to just above a human and then just lower and lower."
iZombie,38f1f8,Izeinwinter,5,Wed Jun 3 22:21:22 2015 UTC,"She was keeping her intake down before the show started, but since she began using the visions as a tool, she has clearly been eating a heck of a lot more brains than just being hungry would dictate."

However as a plot device I don't really like it, unless we later found out that zombies were created a while ago in many cities in many countries then it would essentially introduce the problem that Liv would after killing Blaine be equal or greater strength to most other zombies (I know nothing has been said to say Blaine is first or anything but the fact he was dealing utopium at a max rager boat party makes it seem at least possible) and I would not like that as other zombies would show up and Liv could just instantly destroy them."

However if she did I would have expected scenes that are quite common in super hero movies where the protag underestimates their strength and breaks things but this is not really required.  Certainly is possible though that it is having no real effect."

iZombie,38f1f8,Jigsus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:33:59 2015 UTC,The Achilies brain is probably the best answer unless something better comes along.  However I suppose from a knowledge standpoint there has been next to no information given by the show as to how often or how much brains the average zombie needs to partake in to stay at full (or at least Liv) strength.  However from a quantity standpoint even if he ate Aunty dearest a day ago all Liv has (visibly) had is a couple of cheerleader smoothies and a shroom sized nibble of stoner dude. While Sebastian cleaned out his Aunts brain and licked the bowl clean.   Experience as an excuse I can kinda see though given that Liv seems to shy away from using her FOZM and every time she has entered it it has been accidental/a result of an attack it seems that she is not overly skilled in its use.
iZombie,38f1f8,Kinrany,2,Wed Jun 3 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest I hardly believe that being hungry makes zombies weaker. We know that Marsie was pretty strong.

iZombie,38f1f8,Kinrany,2,Wed Jun 3 20:13:22 2015 UTC,I guess we need to come up with an acceptable theory of how does the virus change the body first. It'll probably include simplified and unrealistic anatomy.
iZombie,38f1f8,GSLint,5,Wed Jun 3 21:01:18 2015 UTC,"Facts about zombies:   They can be killed with a headshot. They can survive bleeding and drowning. Either they don't feel pain or have a very high pain threshold.  They feel pain, including FOZM, but some of them can ignore it.  Sometimes zombies scream in pain, sometimes they ignore it completely. Their heartrate is very low. They need brains. Their brains are affected by their food. Certain parts of their brains stop working properly if they don't eat. Their bodies sort of decompose if they don't eat. Injuries leave scars, but heal. They can be knocked unconscious. They can enter FOZM, both voluntarily and involuntarily. They can exit FOZM voluntarily if they're distracted and/or not too hungry. They can survive dehydration in Romero mode. Liv can crush skulls in FOZM. Candyman can throw a human in FOZM. Licking zombie blood turns one into a zombie extremely fast.   Will add more over time."
iZombie,38f1f8,Kinrany,3,Wed Jun 3 21:05:43 2015 UTC,"They do seem to feel some pain. At least, they make unhappy sounds when painful things happen to them, and they can be sufficiently injured or stunned to be unable to fight back (eg when Julian got shot he fell to the floor for a few minutes; similarly, Sebastian got knocked out for what must have been a long long time by that car (even a shallow grave takes a long time to dig))."

iZombie,38f1f8,VacuousWastrel,2,Wed Jun 3 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"There could be a phantom pain effect for zombies especially new ones that are not used to being unable to feel pain. Almost like when someone loses a limb they can still feel it there its possible that despite losing the ability to feel pain the zombies think they should feel pain therefore have the appropriate reaction as before they were a zombie as that is all they know what to do in that situation.  Then after being a zombie for a while that reflex action to the pain stops as they realise they don't feel it. Think about it like if someone had a boiling hot rod and was about to burn you with it, then through slight of hand swapped it for a cold one when they touched it to your skin you would think there should be pain and give an appropriate response until your realised there was no pain."
iZombie,38f1f8,fellatious_argument,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"Crying out when they get hurt, that could just be some kind of instinctual reaction to getting damaged without them actually feeling physical pain. I know I've said ""ow"" before when I bump into something in a way that I expect will hurt even though it doesn't.

iZombie,38f1f8,Kinrany,2,Sun Jun 7 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"FOZM powers express during extreme emotional distress which suggests they are powered by the zombie's mind and scale with the strength of their will.  Liv pre zombification was basically an ubermench.  She was a brilliant, beautiful, doctor who did charity work.  All throughout the show she demonstrates her moral superiority.  During the scene with Sebastian she even chastises him for eating his aunt saying that she's never eaten anyone she didn't want to.  Look at Sebastian during this scene.  He emotionally is a wreck.  He killed his aunt who was likely the only person who was nice to him.  I think more than anything he came to Liv in search of answers about his condition.    Their fight is basically a clash of wills.  A clash between a bewildered neophyte and someone who is ready to defend her injured friend's life.     This is why Liv can always take on anyone 1v1.  She is the righteous hero and always has the strength of conviction on her side in any given situation.  I think next week she will be able to take out all the other zombies except for Blaine, who also posses a strong will.  He went from confused street rat to leader of a criminal syndicate.  I'm sure we get a monologue from him about how his service is a necessary evil and how zombies eating humans is no different than humans eating cattle."

iZombie,38f1f8,lovecats91,2,Wed Jun 3 22:11:10 2015 UTC,"While I wouldn't put it in terms of morality (though as it's a supernatural show, there may well be supernatural explanations like 'she has the strength of ten because her heart is pure', who knows? but we don't need to assume that yet...), but I think FA's willpower idea might have something to it.  Zombie mode seems to be like an adrenaline rush: in an adrenaline rush, the muscles are not actually stronger, but the will overpowers their normal 'safe settings'. Our bodies can do much more than we think: normally they have safety locks on them to keep them running at a level that can be maintained indefinitely, but when necessary they can briefly operate way above those levels. People can lift burning cars to save trapped children. Similarly in sports: training and will can force the body beyond its normal limits. That's why someone running a marathon can be seemingly on the verge of total collapse, barely able to run at all, and yet then be able to sprint as soon as they see the finish line - once the body knows that the end is in sight, it signs off on releasing extra reserves. Sometimes in extreme sports like marathon running or road cycling, you actually see the athletes collapse completely after the race and need an oxygen mask - they've gone way into debt in their effort, in a way most people, most of the time, simply cannot do.  So maybe FOZM is like a directable adrenaline rush, or instantly takes you to the level of self-destructive commitment that elite sportspeople can reach after years of training.  The body may not be any stronger, but the 'safety locks' can be bypassed.   That would make it more about the mind than about the body - and about willpower. Sebastian in this model would be like the talented tennis player who chokes in the fifth set, loses all concentration and feels exhausted, has to call for the physio for a dozen different complaints that all flare up at once... Liv is the seasoned pro completely in the zone. In sport, sometimes superior talent and physique can be crushed by superior willpower. [I remember watching Marat Safin, at that time one of the top two or three in the world, get thrashed by a tiny little belgian player barely in the top 100. Once Safin got irritated and distracted and angry with himself, he seemed to lose all his ability and the worse he got the worse he got...]  So maybe FOZM isn't an automatic power boost, but just gives you an ability that you have to then apply with your willpower. In which case, I can totally see someone in the position of Liv - fighting for her life and her friend's life, experienced, in righteous fury - overcoming someone in Seb's position - confused, inexperienced, overconfident, angry in an aimless way.  In fact, we don't need to bring FOZM into it, except to put them on the same level in the first place. Imagine two boxers of similar physical abilities. One goes into the fight with a mental state like Liv's. One goes into the fight crying and screaming and confused and distressed like Sebastian. In real life, we know which of those boxers is going to win that fight nine times out of ten..."

iZombie,38ax8j,JauntyLurker,32,Wed Jun 3 01:42:20 2015 UTC,I think Clive's reactions to Liv's different personalities is one of the running jokes in the show.
iZombie,38ax8j,imgurceo,42,Wed Jun 3 21:46:47 2015 UTC,"""This white psychic morgue girl is so fucking weird, but she does get results."""
iZombie,38ax8j,HouseOfBull3209,10,Thu Jun 4 01:44:12 2015 UTC,"Can't she explain her changing personality as part of the psychic thing? Brains are the only thing she has to hide, really. I remember one episode Clive asked her to try and get visions of a living person and Liv had to make up an excuse. Like, if she says she only gets visions of dead people what is Clive going to go, ""That's something a zombie would say!"" Clive doesn't know shit about ""psychics"" Liv can just bullshit him whenever she wants."

iZombie,38ax8j,X4NDR,57,Wed Jun 3 08:24:27 2015 UTC,"DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.  Peyton has been a character set piece for a while now: someone who rounds out the other characters' lives, someone defined enough to be believable, but with no development.  For her to be the second non-zombie person to learn Liv's secret, at this late in the season, is a bold gambit by the writers.  Here's hoping it is not rushed through because of the finale."
iZombie,38ax8j,Future_Vantas,27,Wed Jun 3 03:24:46 2015 UTC,"Do you think she put two and two together concerning Ravi already knowing Liv's a zombie? Liv said she worked at the morgue to get brains and Ravi's her boss. Then Peyton bailed on Ravi. Does she know her best friend/roomate and boyfriend both kept a huge secret? Or was she just running from Liv and forgot to contact Ravi?  Also, I'm a bit worried that Peyton will just leave a message saying she'll keep Liv's secret but won't have anything to do with Liv any more. Kind of like Tommy in Arrow. That would make me sad."
iZombie,38ax8j,iwishiwasamoose,11,Wed Jun 3 08:02:38 2015 UTC,"I definitely think she knows that Ravi knows. She said she'd been working at the morgue to get brains, no way Ravi doesn't know that brains have been missing for so long"

iZombie,38ax8j,X4NDR,15,Wed Jun 3 08:31:17 2015 UTC,I don't think Major will ever turn into a zombie. I feel like he is sort of the anchor. He represents what a normal reaction to finding out that zombies exist should be.
iZombie,38ax8j,imgurceo,5,Wed Jun 3 21:50:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm maybe. But we have had his reaction already, and now we are going to get Peytons reaction. so they may still change him as he could get replaced by Peyton. I guess Peyton was meant to be the normal person but that changed.. lol"

iZombie,38ax8j,MZago1,13,Wed Jun 3 13:23:06 2015 UTC,I thought she was super annoying as a stoner.  That's coming from someone that smoked a fat bowl before the episode.
iZombie,38ax8j,fellatious_argument,6,Wed Jun 3 05:00:11 2015 UTC,"That's the only thing I dislike about the show so far is that the brains she eats are always extreme stereotypes without much depth to them, making a lot of them incredibly annoying, hopefully in the next seasons they make the victims have a bit more depth and not seem like such caricatures."
iZombie,38ax8j,BritishMongrel,4,Thu Jun 4 00:18:51 2015 UTC,I think if the personalities are not extreme it would be hard to tell them from her own personality.  It is a bit ham fisted at times though.

iZombie,38ax8j,FireIsTheCleanser,30,Wed Jun 3 02:09:16 2015 UTC,The cheerleader body was gruesome.  The fight scene was intense.  When Liv said she was talking to a dead man I got chills.  The coup de grace skull stab through the hand was brutal too.

Edit: or maybe Steven ""The Websterino"" Weber is a zombie pushing obviously tained energy drink to create more zombies when taken with obviously tained utopian. Zombie hitman dished to the band about the plan and they tried to blackmail El Websterino Loco and he decided to take it out on them."

He is does massive, ongoing amounts of evil day in and day out, and letting him live would make the nominal heroes guilty of massive sins of omission and make very little logical sense.   It was bad enough that Liv failed to shoot him when she had him in her sights, but imagine that sort of situation repeating over and over again? Does this sound like a good story? No? That is because it is not.   It's tempting to keep him around, sure, but the end result of giving into that temptation is a situation like Sylar or Spike where he just hangs around for all eternity through the power of invincible plot armor.

Too much of a coincidence otherwise: - kids ""kill"" Sebastian and rob him (text message talks about getting 'his stuff') - kids now have a flash drive containing the smoking gun memo that implicates max rager in knowing they were selling something that turned people into uncontrollable psychopaths - either Sebastian goes to talk to MR (hey boss, you know that 'zombie' side effect we thought might happen? well about that...), or the kids (or Cameron, at least) find the memo and try to blackmail MR - MR don't like that. Kill one kid, kill or capture the second (cameron). Lure the third one to the hotel and at the very least beat her up. Note that the text message said to bring the dead guy's stuff - which kind of makes sense if you're trying to retrieve the flash drive but don't know where it is. Torture to find the location may also explain the violence of the attacks.  What i don't understand is why Drummergirl is alive and unmonitered to make the 911 call... you'd have thought MR would just kill her, whether or not she gave them the drive."

Not enough to make any direct move, but enough that he'd like to have some bargaining pieces around - and maybe a way to keep an eye on her, too.  We think of Blaine as a criminal mastermind, but let's not forget what he is: a low-life petty drug-dealer, who iirc had gotten himself in a pretty bad situation with more serious criminals, before he lucked out, became a zombie, and thought of an effective but very simple business plan. He's charismatic and quick-thinking, but I don't think he's really all that smart... and several times now he's been deceived pretty easily by people.   Poor guy doesn't really have what it takes to be a zombie crime lord, I don't think."
iZombie,38b752,VacuousWastrel,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:33:19 2015 UTC,I have to disagree with the latter part.  I do think Blaine is a criminal mastermind albeit an amateur one.  That moment before he eats those first gangsters and shows his true colors he is faced with an impossible dilemma and makes a split second decision to turn his shit around.  He goes from being cursed by being a zombie to being gifted with the ability to bend people to his will.  That's what makes him a great nemesis.  Liv and Blaine have both mastered their zombieism far beyond anyone else that is infected and both of them use it to opposite ends.  Liv is trying to find a cure while Blaine is running around infecting people.
iZombie,38b752,fellatious_argument,2,Wed Jun 3 22:19:17 2015 UTC,"Uh......I'm pretty sure that episode was meant to imply he was feeding Liv a line in BS, and that he'd already been running this turn/blackmail scheme for months.  Just clarifying. I'll agree with everything else."
iZombie,38b752,JBB1986,3,Fri Jun 5 10:44:55 2015 UTC,"Also highly probable, but he doesn't actually KNOW anything. He had some suspicions, but the Chief claimed that she bought the suicide story, which is why he paid her a visit himself, to see if she acted in a suspicious manner.  He would have killed her by now if he had anything more than a vague suspicion that she was in on the plan to kill him, and if he had so much as a vague suspicion he'd be having her watched 24/7.  As he is not.......I'd be more inclined to think that it's still just a ploy to try and maintain the facade that he's a good guy, and that if he's planning to use him as leverage, it's simply as a way to cover all his bases.

People on the discussion thread scoffed at it thinking it would be a high-school drama-esque show with zombies. Ha!
iZombie,37t97p,minterbartolo,11,Wed Jun 3 03:40:50 2015 UTC,"The drop may be because Flash season ended, having best rated CW show as a lead-in was certainly a boon. But the important viewing figure for the show's future is 18-49 rating, and that is currently 0.6, still above CW average. Most CW shows get 0.4 or 0.5 rating, and some get renewed even with lower numbers."

iZombie,37pvof,Kinrany,-3,Fri May 29 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"That's jackviolet's tumblr, not mine.  Here's the text for your convenience:    Way to take the really boring stupid way out. For a show that started off so strong, you are really letting me down here.  Both my cousin and my boyfriend have shouted “Omg, Liv is a horrible person!” when watching the last two episodes before this past Tuesday’s. For different reasons. So two very different people have two different reads on Liv’s character and they still came to the same dislike of the character. That isn’t good, show. You can afford to alienate ONE part of your audience by writing a character that rubs them the wrong way, but when you’re missing the mark on the same character on multiple fronts, that is really bad writing. I’m more balanced on Liv, but partly because I don’t take the writing out on her. I’m not shouting “Liv is horrible!,” but I do find myself mentally shouting “why the HELL would she do that in a rational world?!” a lot.  And the dream-sequence fakeout in this last ep? Ugh ugh and more ugh. That is SO CLICHE, show. And relies on all the wrong things for its supposed impact, which modern audiences have seen far too many times and are hella tired of. Everybody hates dream sequences for good reason. And yes, that was basically a dream sequence, show, don’t try to pretend the slight variance in execution made it anything different.  Also, you know what else is boring and tiresome? The whole “I will kill them ALL”/”Oh no now I can’t tell him I am one!” plodding plot “thickener.”  We just went through this on Agents of Shield. And as we saw there, and as such things work in general with reasonable people, “kill them all!” is always an emotional overstatement based on misunderstanding, and as soon as Character X learns that Character Y is “one of them” and that “they” aren’t all dangerous, they obviously back off that unilateral declaration.  Also, Liv, as my counselor kept telling me, “bad news is better delivered by the giver than learned by the receiver,” meaning that HAD YOU TOLD MAJOR earlier, you would have been able to prepare him to process the information better and he would have been far more accepting.  Instead now you’re not just a zombie, but untrustworthy, and if he finds out about you, he’ll have no idea what else you are or aren’t keeping from him and thus no reason to believe that you’re not part of the killer cabal.  Also, you kind of are, honestly. Blaine’s been murdering people by the dozens every week, and he’s been creating lots and lots of new zombies, and you don’t go to the authorities because you’re worried about your own self interest? Yeah, welcome to the cabal. You’re no longer any different from the Lieutenant, and unlike him, you’re not facing starvation and deteriorating into a mindless horror if you expose Blaine*. Every day you spend letting Blaine get away with it because you want to “take care of it yourself” at some uncertain point in the future, several people are getting murdered. EVERY DAY.  *Yes, exposing the zombie plague could be dangerous for Liv, but a) once again, if she’s the one who reveals the information, she can try and present it in the most moderate way including the “most Zombies are victims, not monsters!” caveat, b) she can hide out and have Ravi bring her brains until things settle down.  Siiiiiiiiigh. Please get yourself together and rally before the finale. I want you so much to be a show I’ll watch next season."
iZombie,37pvof,Bismaria,0,Fri May 29 13:45:35 2015 UTC,"Please, explain the downvotes."
iZombie,37pvof,Bismaria,3,Fri May 29 18:18:37 2015 UTC,"Probably because the person ranting is complaining about nonsense. It's not a dream sequence, it was a delusion created by the mental patient's brain she ate. It fits in with the entire theme of the episode.  Major's a complete nutcase at this point, and he's only degrading as episodes go by. Yeah, Liv probably should have told him what was going on instead of hiding it, but Major's proving himself to be incredibly unstable and I don't know if he'll be able to take the news well.  As for Blaine, she can't go to the authorities. Who is she gonna go to? For all we know Blaine's controlling the entire police force. Even if she did expose Blaine and he was taken in for questioning, by the time any authority could act, how much damage has been done by the hungry zombies Blaine isn't feeding any more? It's like other people on this sub have said, Blaine's put himself in a pretty secure position. Killing him or locking him up dooms the city and there's gonna be more casualties than just the homeless and the runaways. There's also the possibility of Blaine's group splitting up into several different brain delivery services, increasing the speed in which more of the city is zombified. And I can almost guarantee that none of them will be as smart as Blaine is about their conversions.   Overall, I'm sure a lot of people just disagree with the points they are trying to make. And they comes across as whiny, which doesn't help their case."
iZombie,37pvof,Bismaria,0,Fri May 29 20:05:38 2015 UTC,"Disagree -> downvote. Okay.   It's not a dream sequence, it was a delusion created by the mental patient's brain she ate.   From the plot viewpoint a delusion and a dream sequence are equivalent: both are All Just a Dream. I like the execution, though.   Major's a complete nutcase at this point, and he's only degrading as episodes go by. Yeah, Liv probably should have told him what was going on instead of hiding it, but Major's proving himself to be incredibly unstable and I don't know if he'll be able to take the news well.   Major is reckless and desperate, but perfectly sane and reasonable otherwise. He won't harm Liv, although he'll probably freak out.   As for Blaine, she can't go to the authorities. Who is she gonna go to? For all we know Blaine's controlling the entire police force.  Killing him or locking him up dooms the city and there's gonna be more casualties than just the homeless and the runaways.   Telling authorities is an obvious solution, and we haven't seen Liv thinking about it enough.   We only know about Blaine controlling Lieutenant, and that's only Homicide Department. She could tell CDC, for example.  She haven't thought about all the consequences of killing Blaine, and she was going to kill him.   Regarding a possible police operation, it's not too hard to track down most of his customers. There would be casualties, but it would save many lives in the long run."

I think these final two episodes will set us on a collision course between Major, Blaine, and Liv.  As for potentials characters to be turned into zombies for Liv to take under her wing:   Ravi: Wouldn't really be into this. One undead M.E. is enough. Clive: No. While I could see him being let in on the zombie secret one day, I'd rather see him remain human over the course of the series. Major: Conflicted. He's a good human, and the romantic tension between Liv and him exists because she doesn't want to infect him with her zombie-ism. However, Liv still loves him, and if he is turned (somehow), I think Liv would be interested in resuming their relationship. Peyton: Zombie lawyer? Sounds fun... but on the other hand, so far in the series, she's been mostly a background character. Would the show want to expand her role?"

Blaine needs to die. The cure needs to be found. Zombiism needs to be hushed up. Etc. Because Liv cares twice as much for him as she does for herself. They're siblings. She wouldn't rest til he was safe and human again.  Plus it'd be really cute to have her suddenly need to mother him in the ways of zombiism - prepare him for the brain visions, share her hot sauce, buy him hair dye, etc."

There's no bullshit contrived drama; the characters all have genuine and complex motivations, and it is the clash of those motivations which drive the conflict. The plot is riveting and surprising; I've been genuinely shocked by this show several times, which doesn't usually happen. The dialogue is quick and witty; fans of Veronica Mars will feel right at home here. Best of all, though, is that its procedural elements actually advance the season-long story arc without feeling awkwardly forced. I cannot recommend this show highly enough."
iZombie,37igef,F1uffyTurtle,1 point,Fri May 29 02:37:53 2015 UTC,The pilot got me hooked. The cast is just amazing and I think they have amazing chemistry together. Acting is also good. I rate it 5/5 and is a must watch.
iZombie,37igef,Diabeticnick,1 point,Thu May 28 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"This show is simply amazing to me. I watch a good amount of TV shows, usually serious dramas or science fiction, so it is great to have a show that is this lighthearted. The show has a funny little way with zombism without making it all about zombies, yet keeps you smiling and laughing. However it simply always leaves me wanting more at the end of the episode."
iZombie,37igef,pixierosesilver,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:35:13 2015 UTC,"Everyone is right, it is all about the characters. They feel like real people, they aren't perfect and they don't always act exactly as you'd expect. The only bummer is how short this season is."
iZombie,37ggck,Kinrany,13,Wed May 27 13:19:06 2015 UTC,Didn't Ravi say that only a some contaminated Utopium reacts with Max Rager? Also the rats prove that the Utopium to Max Rager ratio has to be pretty high. Since only one rat became a zombie but 2 rats were taking both MR and U just in different ratios.
iZombie,37ggck,buildzoid,4,Wed May 27 13:56:46 2015 UTC,"1/5 chance to become a zombie is still extremely high.  Ravi's thoughts are just speculations, but maybe we should really treat them as Word of God.  The exponential growth argument still stands though."
iZombie,37ggck,Talex666,7,Wed May 27 14:15:10 2015 UTC,"But it's not any Utopium that creates zombies in the right ratio, it's only that small selection of tainted batch. I'm pretty sure the stories of people going crazy on Max Rager are only exhibiting a few of the symptoms of zombieism. The tainted batch is the other half of the key, and it's in short supply now. That said, it is pretty unlikely that every zombie has been watching himself/herself until now (with the new psychotic zombie Liv created). Maybe most, if not all, of them were created by Blaine? He'd be keeping a track on them the entire time, and killing those who would ruin his plans by just infecting everyone."
iZombie,37ggck,Talex666,3,Wed May 27 14:53:35 2015 UTC,There's no way Blaine could keep track on random scratches. And a single wandering zombie is all what it takes to start a chain reaction.
iZombie,37ggck,Talex666,1 point,Wed May 27 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, although wouldn't their 'excessively trimmed nails' more or less keep that in check?"
iZombie,37ggck,Hulkkis,2,Fri May 29 11:03:33 2015 UTC,more or less   That's the problem. And we know that Blaine scratched Liv occasionally.
iZombie,37ggck,JBB1986,3,Fri May 29 13:36:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, when he was newly turned though. That said I guess it wouldn't matter how trimmed your nails are if you survive a zombie raging out and attacking you. In any case, it looks like the next episode will probably shed a bit more light on how well controlled the zombie population is."
iZombie,37ggck,gocgo,5,Sat May 30 14:29:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's gonna happen just yet. The show seems to concentrate more on Liv being a crime-fighting zombie. I think things will start to take off in the finale or in season 2, although it's not going to be a typical apocalypse (and if it is I'll be disappointed)"

There are no characters that appear in both, for example - the protagonist is a different zombie, with a different job and different friends. It's also supernatural instead of scientific - zombiism isn't a disease to be solved, the protagonist just is undead, she woke up in her grave that way. And she's friends with a ghost, and a were-terrier. She doesn't even have access to the police, she's a gravedigger who solves the crimes without official help.  As far as I know, the only similarity between the two is ""zombie sees brain-visions, solves murders"".  I've never read the comics, mind you, this is just what I know about them second hand. I could be off on one or two things."

iZombie,36mx23,Insanepaco247,14,Wed May 20 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, I can finally help with something!  Having read all four trades, let me just say first that the comics are massively different in every aspect, not just characters or tone.  The first couple trades are the closest you ever get to actual mysteries. A lot of references are made to how they solve crimes together and a few Scooby-Doo allusions pop up, but the focus of the comics is definitely the larger story, and the cases themselves are almost nonexistent.  The characters are much different. Instead of a cast of policemen and women and the victims of crimes, you get monster hunters, ghosts, were-people, vampires, mummies, and a couple other things I won't spoil. The characters have a lot of charm on their own though, so you won't be reading and thinking, ""I wish I could just watch more episodes of the show.""  The overall story is much, much different and way more comic-book-y. Again, won't spoil anything here, but it's a good story and worth reading for its own sake.  Basically, go in expecting more of a comic book than a police procedural and you'll probably enjoy it. The tone is similar to the show, or as close as it could get with all the other elements that appear. It's a short series, but has a great wrap-up and is really fun while it lasts. Give the first trade or first few issues a try and if you like it, keep reading."

It's one thing to steal a glass of water if you are dying of dehydration. It's another thing to steal part of a human being, even if you need it to survive. It's an issue of bodily integrity. People have a right to control what happens to their own body. If she had permission, I'd view her actions as ethical, but since she doesn't, I believe she is violating their bodily integrity and her actions are unethical, even if they are necessary for her own survival. Based on your comment, you might believe that any action which is necessary for survival is ethical, which is fine, it is a perfectly acceptable position. At the moment, I disagree."

iZombie,36jwlb,AraneusAdoro,1 point,Wed May 20 14:20:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah it seems I'm in the minority but that still doesn't make her actions ethical in my eyes. You're right, she should choose option #1. But to me option #1 is the lesser of two evils. That doesn't make it right. It's still wrong, it's still unethical, but it is the better option. Like being forced to choose between killing a healthy infant and killing a old man with very advanced cancer. If those were my only two options, I'd kill the old man. I would consider killing someone near death the lesser of the two evils. But murder is still an evil, it is still wrong. Same deal here. Stealing the brains of the dead is a better option than killing people for their brains or starting an outbreak, it is the ethically superior option, but theft, desecration of a dead body, denying someone's bodily integrity, and cannibalism are all still unethical to me. The fact that it's the lesser of two evils doesn't make it right to me. Like I told the other guy, it's fine if you disagree.   And actually, I don't see it as a huge difference. If she stops eating brains, Liv as a person dies. Her body just keeps going. Her consciousness is unrecoverable. Like Marcy. Unless you mean it is a huge difference in that keeping Liv fed is better for society, because a starving zombie is not terribly pleasant, to put it mildly. I agree, which is part of why I think stealing the brains is the lesser of the two evils."
iZombie,36jwlb,iwishiwasamoose,5,Thu May 21 02:03:24 2015 UTC,"See, we're coming at it from different angles. I say that that's the most ethical thing for her to do, you say that it's still unethical. Neither is wrong. Although, ""desecration of a dead body [and] denying someone's bodily integrity"" is still a part of her job as M.E., so the only real problem is cannibalism (which I don't think should be considered unethical per se), which still doesn't hurt anyone, including the loved ones. And lastly, I think that when something like that happens (zombies become a part of the society), ethics should be revised. You can't just apply the same ethical guidelines (except, maybe, for the basic ones) in a different universe.   Unless you mean it is a huge difference in that keeping Liv fed is better for society   This."

To me, this is like asking ""Wouldn't you be at least a little upset if you knew that your house (or your mom's house) was free for anyone to do anything with after you move?"" Why should I care? I've moved! So you can repaint in colors I hate, or screw in what used to be the nursery, or tear the whole thing to the ground for all I care.  What's the alternative? Stick the body in the ground until the worms and maggots devour it? Leave it on top of the ground for the vultures to eat, a so-called ""sky burial""? Or burn it to a crisp and then deal with the cremains? They aren't just ashes, there are bone fragments, and prior to burning any internal devices, such as pacemakers, have to be removed.  Nothing that happens to the body after death is pretty. Thankfully, we're no longer there to experience it. My body isn't who I am, it's just where I live."

Blaine and Liv will work together in the future {just a theory}. In the comics, there was another zombie dude and that's what happened.

In the comics a zombie is a person who lost their ""oversoul"". So they need to eat brains to get the ""oversoul"" from other people. The main character also isn't actually a full zombie because she didn't completely lose her Oversoul and therefore has some of her unique thoughts and personality traits and such but she still needs brains to keep herself from becoming a full zombie.

I think, in some ways, he can't stand living as a zombie anymore, now knowing that he had to eat people and that he did say that his trust fund is running out. When he decided to attack Blaine, he knew he was going to die and he didn't bother to think of a backup plan.  RIP Lowell. He was awesome while he lasted.

Yeah I know Liv is also a zombie, so maybe she doesn't see it that way, but Blaine is irrevocably a bad dude. He's murdered a huge unknown number of kids, and turned a huge unknown number of humans into zombies at this point.  Liv knows both of these things, and the whole episode has the ""One death to save many"" brain going through her. It was really dumb imo, to have her hesitate at the last moment.  I would have been sad that Blaine died, because I actually like his character, but it would have been interesting to watch the city kind of partially fall apart as all of his zombie clients were suddenly left without him.  Liv got what she deserved immediately afterwards. Really sucks that he died, but Liv should learn now that her inaction will continue to have consequences.

iZombie,365i9g,BellatorInMachina,6,Sat May 16 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"And I'm bored to death of shows being edgy by forcibly making their characters into killers.    Normally, I'd agree with you, but the show is about a zombie. Liv eats people. If anyone is capable of becoming a cold-blooded killer, I think someone whose blood has stopped flowing fits the bill. I'd be cool with her becoming a zombie who kills other zombies as a side job to her main job as a crime-fighting medical examiner. Blaine's the head of the current operation, his death will cause his minions to start new brain-providing businesses and his clients to either keep buying brains or start killing. I figure that's where the show is going eventually. Someone is going to have to put down Blaine and his crew. He is not going to jail. According to the show, starving zombies go crazy and try to kill everything, yes? And we just found with Marcy that feeding a starving zombie doesn't fix them. Being put in jail is equivalent to starving a zombie, killing their mind and personality, and reducing them to a killing machine that can't be rehabilitated. So jailing zombies will result in either keeping a warehouse of crazed killers for scientific experimentation (and search for a cure) or else simply killing them. The only way to keep a zombie sane is to feed it brains and there is no ethical way to do so. Even Liv feeding on morgue brains is clearly unethical. If you don't believe me, ask yourself how any of the dead people's families would react if they knew one of the MEs was eating part of their loved one. Unless the person willingly signed away their brain to be eaten, Liv doesn't have permission, so it is unethical. Where would a prison get the brains to feed their zombie inmates? It makes far more sense to kill the zombies right away than to deal with the ethical problems of feeding brains to inmates or starving inmates into deranged killers that are killed or subject to scientific experiments. Unless they find that calf brains really are a suitable alternative, in which case zombie prison is OK and Liv's diet becomes unnecessary and even more immoral.   And if we want to avoid boring cliches, let's face it, we already know what the next episode will be. Most likely, Lowell is dead. Liv goes to work, eats the brain of an alcoholic, and drinks away her problems. Ravi knows something is wrong, Liv denies and blames the alcoholic brain. Eventually, Ravi corners her and asks what's really going on. She breaks down crying and admits she tried to kill Blaine and chickened out, she couldn't do what needed to be done. Liv says Lowell tried to stab Blaine and Blaine shot him and it's all her fault. Ravi consoles her and tells her that her unwillingness to kill just proves she's still human (if they don't use the phrase ""still human"" in the episode, I will figuratively eat my hat), not a monster like Blaine. He then tells her Lowell's death is Blaine's fault, he's the one who pulled the trigger, not her. It'll be the ""Good Monster Character showing he/she is still human and not actually a monster like Bad Monster Character"" cliche from all supernatural works of fiction paired with a ""don't blame yourself, blame the killer, and try to forget that you could have easily prevented the problem"" cliche."

That she had the assassin brain and could resist undermines the consistency of the show in how she behaved when she had the artists brain.  I had the exact opposite idea of her. I do not respect her.

If anything she refused to let her emotional desire for Blaine's death get in the way of who she is.

First of all, she had male brains running through her at the time, so neither side in the gender wars has any points to make here.  Second, the fact that she chose not to commit first degree murder has less to do with her being a woman and more to do with her not being a sociopath. There is a big difference between self-defense (or the immediate defense of another) and cold-blooded murder.  There's a reason why very, very few people are actually cut out to be snipers. I'm not surprised that the person that wanted to be a doctor so she could help people can't watch a dude have a normal conversation with a ""friend""/client about musical tastes and concerts, and then calmly put a bullet in the guy's brain and end his existence.  Very few people actually could, regardless of the overall logic of the situation.  Personally, I think it's a statement on what ""brain food"" can and cannot make a zombie do.  Liv was hoping to let her inner sniper take over and do the deed, but it turns out she's just not that kind of person (most people aren't), and that overruled the sniper brains.  This sort of knowledge could be important to her well-being if she ever accidentally eats the brains of an actual psychopath.  > Why wouldn't she shoot him after he shoots her boyfriend?    I'm pretty sure she had already broken the rifle back down for transport, so she didn't actually have a ready weapon.  Blaine heard her scream and isn't an idiot, so he wouldn't have stuck around waiting for her to reassemble the rifle and take a shot.  Even if he's not expecting enemy snipers, the scream means there is at the very least a witness/probable 911 caller and so he needs to leave before the cops start showing up.    > The detective should also know.   I agree with this, but from Liv's point of view, you have to remember that she's literally a walking public health hazard.  She needs to very carefully consider who she brings in to her circle.  Tell the wrong person, and she ends up in an armored CDC transport van headed to an incinerator. I also seem to remember Clive saying something during the very first episode that implied his reaction would not be particularly positive if he found out her secret (although I can't remember exactly what he said).  I suspect that was something of a red herring statement, but Liv has no way of knowing that."

But she even suggested that her sniper solution could be the result of sniper brains. This wasn't Liv's solution. This was his. And despite understanding the benefits of taking the shot, having the muscle memory for taking the shot, she couldn't take the shot. It immediately became a trope when the man acted when she couldn't.   I'm not arguing that the writers are sexist. I'm saying that this was a sexist trope.   Also, gender isn't ignored. It's front in center in the story line. Every story. The male characters tend to be hyper sexualized. They tend to know how to fight. Women characters are mothers and therapists.   I'm not saying that it's sexism. She's eating the brains of people living in a society with strong gender roles. I would expect the brains to be reflective of this.    Second, the fact that she chose not to commit first degree murder has less to do with her being a woman and more to do with her not being a sociopath.    The brains made here acutely aware of the argument she was faced with: one is less than many. She had a strong moral argument for taking the shot. It wouldn't have made her a sociopath anymore than Lowell was for trying.    Personally, I think it's a statement on what ""brain food"" can and cannot make a zombie do.   I don't think so. She wanted to take the shot. She was disappointed in herself that she couldn't. She made a decision that she knew would put others in danger.    I'm pretty sure she had already broken the rifle back down for transport, so she didn't actually have a ready weapon.   Perhaps. I don't think it would have taken her long to reassemble. And he heard her scream and then scanned the buildings. He couldn't have known there was a sniper. If there was, why would Lowell make himself vulnerable by attacking? He could have waited. Blaine didn't bolt, either, as he's used to protecting the crime scene and assessing his exposure. That's why he has important people on his delivery route. He provides brains to a least a few cops.   I'm just not convinced...    She needs to very carefully consider who she brings in to her circle.     I totally agree, here. Her mom would be a terrible person to tell. As would brother. I don't even think she should tell her roommate.

It wouldn't have made her a sociopath anymore than Lowell was for trying.        I think you may be misunderstanding my argument.  I'm not saying that killing a human being makes a person into a sociopath.  I'm saying that a person with the ability to plan and undertake the murder of a non-life-threatening human is a sociopath. It's like the difference between first and second degree murder. In both cases, someone ends up dead, but one is treated much more harshly than the other because it is a planned, for-profit (for some definition of ""profit"") attack, while the other is a heat-of-the-moment rage killing.     In retrospect, had Lowell succeeded, it could be argued that it was a crime of passion, since he did it for ""love"". After all, he certainly didn't do any planning for his attack.     Perhaps. I don't think it would have taken her long to reassemble.     You might be surprised how hard it is to perform fine motor functions after an adrenaline dump.  It can be hard to get a new magazine into the gun, much less assemble it in the first place.  :)    I suppose, though, that her sniper brains would probably take care of that part, but that leaves us with the question of why would she take the shot the second time? It's not like she could protect anyone at that point, so we're back to the vigilante justice angle, which she had just decided not to act on.   Blaine didn't bolt, either, as he's used to protecting the crime scene and assessing his exposure.     In cases where he already controlled the scene and was prepared for the killing, yes.  In all of his prior killings, he either led the victims into a prepared ambush point, or waited and performed the killings in a way that ensured there were no (non-zombie) witnesses.  The closest he's come to killing in the open without a plan is when he killed the two guys in the car, but it was parked down a back alley and he specifically did it in a quiet way (no gunshots, anyway).     Maybe I'm reading too much into the post-shot acting, but Blaine looked a lot more worried and less in control than usual as he looked for the screamer. I guess we'll see whether or not he bolts/bolted this week."
iZombie,365i9g,yellowviper,1 point,Sat May 16 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for a really well reasoned response. This was a pleasure! :)    I think there are many people who would argue that ""vigilante murder"" is never the moral high ground.    And I think they have valid considerations. But I think that Liv wanted to take the shot because she placed value on it. I'm not endorsing either position. But, I think Liv was just unable to overcome her hesitations. Her reactions following this decision came across as disappointment in herself. Like failure.   She knew what her decision would mean: more people would die. She wanted to do something but she couldn't work past her issues.    I could argue that Blaine is equivalent to an HIV carrier that purposely infects other people.   Well said.    I think you may be misunderstanding my argument.    I believe so.    I'm saying that a person with the ability to plan and undertake the murder of a non-life-threatening human is a sociopath.   Which Liv wouldn't be because Blaine clearly poses a threat. So, I'm not sure why this was part of your argument. I don't think this was really a valid counterpoint in Liv's head.    I suppose, though, that her sniper brains would probably take care of that part,    That's what I was thinking.    why would she take the shot the second time?    Perhaps they needed to get to a plot point. If Lowell survives, we discover something new about zombies.    It's not like she could protect anyone at that point,    Except for all of the people that will fall victim to Blaine.    so we're back to the vigilante justice angle, which she had just decided not to act on.   But I don't agree that she decided not to act based on your vigilante argument. She knows that the justice system could offer little help. That someone would have to stop Blaine one way or another. She thought she could do it but froze because she doesn't see herself as a killer.   On a related note, would Blaine be killing if he had gotten a brain supply from the morgue? He tried negotiating with Liv initially."
iZombie,365i9g,iwishiwasamoose,1 point,Sat May 16 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for a really well reasoned response. This was a pleasure! :)      Thanks! I love a good debate, and nobody in real life seems willing to argue at length about the merits of zombie vigilantism.  :)     Her reactions following this decision came across as disappointment in herself.     Now I wish I hadn't deleted the episode off my DVR...to the best of my recollection, though, right up to the point where Lowell decided to take matters into his own hands, she seemed happy with the realization that she wasn't the kind of person that could drop the hammer on a non-threatening person. It wasn't until she was faced with the consequences of Lowell's impulsiveness that she felt regret at her choice.     Which Liv wouldn't be because Blaine clearly poses a threat.     I think this is where my argument was getting muddled.  Blaine doesn't actually pose a threat to Liv on the subconscious level, which is where kill-or-be-killed decisions happen for normal people.  Yes, Blaine is an existential threat to humanity at large, and if the powers-that-be ever learn about him, they will send an actual sociopath that works for them to take care of the problem (someone that is willing and able to kill random people when ordered to).  However, on a personal level, Blaine is no more threat to Liv than any other criminal, since she doesn't have to worry about zombification. I don't doubt that she would be able to kill him in self-defense if he attacked her (or at least try), but deciding to kill to protect yourself from an attacker while an attack is ongoing is a very different thing than deciding to kill on a logical basis because someone poses a threat to the world at large.    I think in the end, we're both actually arguing towards the same conclusion.  I think I may have misconstrued your initial comment as saying that this episode was bad writing and/or out-of-character, which I don't think it was.     If Lowell survives     As much as I think Lowell was a cool dude that didn't deserve what he got, I really hope he doesn't.  There was a failed pilot episode for some other show that leaked a while back that had zombies that were animated by some mystical force that made them completely invincible, even to headshots, and it was...quite dumb.     On a related note, would Blaine be killing if he had gotten a brain supply from the morgue? He tried negotiating with Liv initially.    Now that's an interesting question.  I think the answer is ""yes"".  At the very least, I don't see any reason why he wouldn't be turning people into zombies all over the city like he is now, and that by itself has led to several murders.    Would he still be killing homeless kids? Probably not as many, at least initially, but I think the demand he's intentionally creating would have eventually outstripped the supply from the morgue. His goal seems to be creating a (zombie) criminal empire, and that's going to end up needing a pretty massive supply of brains to keep running."
iZombie,364hog,SuperUrfling,4,Sat May 16 01:34:14 2015 UTC,lol Wish he had that much personality on the show! Guy's funny.
iZombie,35zr25,8u11etpr00f,16,Thu May 14 21:46:33 2015 UTC,I'm guessing she'll get more used to it and the personality changes will be less severe as she gets used to the changes.  The visions won't change but we'll see Liv as a much more consistent character instead of changing up week to week.
iZombie,35zr25,Mini-Marine,13,Thu May 14 23:43:44 2015 UTC,Maybe not. How long did Quantum Leap keep going? I think the new traits she picks up each week are one of the most endearing things about the show and I don't think the supply is as finite as OP worries.  I hope they keep this aspect front and center.
iZombie,35zr25,wiccabilly,6,Fri May 15 01:54:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, there is such a huge variety of personalities out there, some may seem similar to previous ones on the surface but can be vastly different in how they play out, but once they run out of the standard tropes and archetypes they'll just go deeper with it.  The mother brain for example: they had an expectant mother and so her maternal instincts went into overdrive, they could have a resentful mother who blames everything on her kids, they could have an overbearing control freak mother, a hippy mother, a overworked mother who had 8 kids, a typical jewish mother, a corporate boss bitch mother who has a househusband, a grandmother or great-grandmother and those are just some off the top of my head. Each of these brains could change how Liv acts toward her boss and friends in completely different ways for all the sweet and silly moments we're used to."

Like they've been doing the soldier, the mother, the drunk next episode, the gamer.  Eventually you begin to run out of stereotypes, and they need to be careful with that. Hopefully they move on from the whole brain personality thing though eventually.  I expect it to eventually take a backseat and just have them focus on the visions she's getting to solve the murders."

iZombie,35wm2j,ItSaidMakeAUsername,1 point,Thu May 14 06:14:45 2015 UTC,"That is true! But it also seems each show in the Arrowverse has their own unique tone. Arrow is a gritty, crime drama, Flash is the more cartoony, super-powered show, and Legends of Tomorrow is looking like some sort of time travel fantasy, so a supernatural cop show doesn't seem too far out of the pocket. Each show has their own feel, but they can still exist in the same universe and pop in to say hi from time to time.  I wouldn't want this to happen until at least Season 3 for iZombie though, let them continue building the show on their own merit. Then allow for a bit of fun and flexibility with the other DC players a little down the road."

iZombie,35wm2j,livmoore,3,Thu May 14 04:47:24 2015 UTC,"iZombie occupies an even weirder place within the Multiverse; it's almost entirely separate from the rest of the Vertigo universe and the Vertigo Universe was separate from the DC universe until Flashpoint.   DC and Vertigo are also pretty clear on their stance of who owns what; Vertigo titles and IPs are separate from DC ones, and that's why Sandman and Preacher news usually comes separate from DC movies and shows. iZombie just had the good fortune to be on the CW right after The Flash. So when Amell and Guggenheim started saying that all the DC shows should be able to crossover, DC and Warner Brothers wouldn't consider iZombie in that mix.  NOW, to stop being a party pooper, Star City in the comics was basically Seattle (so much so that in the Nu52, all Star City heroes just got moved to Seattle) so this would be incredibly easy to do. A Starling City villain starts dropping bodies in Seattle, Olly, Red Arrow Speedy, and Black Driver follow him there and run into Liv while investigating."
iZombie,35wm2j,conuly,1 point,Thu May 14 06:56:08 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I realize that's the case in the comics where iZombie doesn't interact with anyone else ever. But have you read those comics? They're TOTALLY different than the direction the show has been taken, it's a different character, she lives in a MUCH more supernatural world, and in the comics she lives in Eugene, Oregon not Seattle, Washington. So while the comics need to be put aside in a different universe, because there's a crazy amount of zombies/ghosts/werewolves etc. shit that would be no match for a superhero, but in this iZombie everything is more toned down and hidden from the public. The TV shows totally seem like they could exist together.  And yeah, when they first got bought out, nothing Vertigo was meant to cross over with DC. That also included Constantine and Swamp Thing but they both have met the Justice League on different occasions now because writers can change their minds.  And yeah, I realize Star City in the comics is usually Seattle, Arrow has also dropped a lot of hints like that. When you see phone numbers/ZIP codes in the show, they correspond to Seattle areas. But they could easily say Star City is just a twin city or suburb of Seattle, like Tacoma. I think Star City and Seattle being the same place, makes the crossover a LITTLE trickier from a writers standpoint, not ""incredibly easy"" but it could definitely work if that's what they wanted to do."

You see Liv, Lowell is dead because of you! Everyone Blaine kills from here on in is because of you! All you had to do was take the shot. Yes, you would have been a killer, so what? The prick has been systemically infecting wealthy people with zombie in order to sell them brains of children he's been abducting and murdering. Killing him won't make you like him.   Because seriously, what's the alternative? Having him arrested and tried for his crimes? Yeah, good luck with that. To do that would involve going public with the whole zombie thing, and I don't think the US government or the general public will care that you're 'one of the good ones'. You'll be rounded up, experimented on, and exterminated.   I really like this show, but holy crap do I really, REALLY hate it when they pull that nonsense. I'm not saying every protagonist has to be some ultra edgy anti-hero like the Punisher or Kenshiro that wantonly slaughters anyone they come across, but I can't stand heroes who treat their no-killing rule like righteous dogma.

iZombie,35rulh,AgnosticTemplar,20,Wed May 13 02:35:11 2015 UTC,I liked how Livs attempt to kill a person (zombie) is juxtaposed with Majors. Of course Major was doing it for self defense but when push comes to shove he pulls the trigger even though he feels sick for what he did.
iZombie,35rulh,groudhogday,25,Wed May 13 11:31:30 2015 UTC,And don't forget Liv has witnessed murder from the victim's eyes several times by this point. I think her inability to pull the trigger is completely within character.

If she had shot him, then all the zombies relying on his brain service would have had to fend for themselves. Some of them - particularly his muscle - would have tried to go into business for themselves. More zombies would have been created. More people would have been outright murdered. Sooner or later, there'd be a horde chomping its way down the streets of Seattle.  Blaine is evil, no doubt about it, but he represents order and stability for Team Z.

iZombie,35rulh,conuly,6,Wed May 13 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"Blaine is Chaotic Neutral. He needs to keep things in order. So he kills people most other people won't miss. Orphaned, homeless kids who just aren't involved with the big picture. Without Blaine, other zombies would be out killing, murdering for their brains. Not everyone can get a job where they can get brains. Cemetaries only have so many graves to rob assuming the body hasn't completely decomposed. Here we'd get a spike in murders as people get desperate. There'd be an outbreak, and all chaos would break loose, with both sides paying the price.  Blaine kills those that won't be missed. He keeps zombies fed and in control. Kill Blaine, someone else will try to do it, but they don't have the same charisma Blaine has to pull it off so well.  Granted Blaine is the one who made all the Zombies so...double-edged really."

There were definitely three bullet holes in the chest when Candyman went down the second time.    Major should have paid more attention to the youtube instructional video he was watching, which clearly specified that at least one follow-up shot should be to the head if your attacker is unaffected by the first shots.  It's usually done in case the attacker is wearing body armor, but it would do nicely for zombies as well.  Speaking of which, why didn't Clive consider the possibility that the intruder Major shot might have been wearing body armor?  It fits the symptoms perfectly: no blood, attacker was staggered by the shots but got up and escaped out a window."

The time to have those ideas is before you decide to kill someone, get a plan, set up a sniper rifle, etc.  If you think killing is ALWAYS wrong, then I really want to know... why?  What is the source for that rule?  If you believe ""Thou shalt not kill"" because it's in the Bible or something, that's fine, I have no problem with that.  But then you would never say ""I'm going to kill him"" and be there with a sniper rifle.  No, you pussed out, plain and simple.  THAT I cannot respect, and now Lowell is dead, not because you took a moral stance, but because you pussed out.  Blaine has to be stopped, and right away, because he's killing people.  You have a responsibility to do something.  Not necessarily kill him - again, if you have a moral code against killing, I am okay with that - but you have to do SOMETHING.  That can mean going public with Zombie-ism, kidnapping him instead, telling Major (since he's ALREADY involved) and getting his advice... there are other options.  But you choose one option, and don't follow through.  What the hell?  And your reason?  That killing to save future inevitable murder victims, is pretty much the same as murdering people for fun and profit?  That's BULLSHIT.  Makers of this show, why should I care about your show any more when you just made the main character so stupid that I no longer care whether she lives or dies?  Stop making the main characters act so stupidly I lose all respect for them."

When she got into the position it maybe wasn't as strong or her own character overcame it or something. That kind of thing was a big point of episode 3 when she eat the brains of a socio-path.

It is the police procedural that fills that gap left by Veronica Mars for the past decade. I kickstarted the VM movie and read the sequel book!

iZombie,35hsnz,faswich,2,Wed May 13 11:17:24 2015 UTC,"Zombies have always been the weird middle where they could bounce between fantasy, and science fiction, where to justify the science in the latter, they drop ""one big lie"", aka not ""hard science fiction"". Whether it is something that came from outer space, a man made virus, or in this case, a new street drug mixed with an energy drink. The show as it is, is certainly much closer to the science fiction, post apocalyptic zombie movies, then any stories that are more in line with fantasy. People just love debating just what is, and is not science fiction.   Intimately tied to the conception of the modern zombie is the ""zombie apocalypse""; the breakdown of society as a result of an initial zombie outbreak which spreads. This archetype has emerged as a prolific subgenre of apocalyptic fiction and has been portrayed in many zombie-related media after Night of the Living Dead.  Apocalyptic fiction is a subgenre of science fiction and horror fiction that is concerned with the end of human civilization. This apocalypse is typically portrayed as being due to a potentially existential catastrophe such as zombie apocalypse, nuclear warfare, pandemic, extraterrestrial attack, impact event, cybernetic revolt, technological singularity, dysgenics, supernatural phenomena, divine judgment, runaway climate change, resource depletion, ecological collapse, or some other general disasters.    Some quotes on ""zombie apocalypse"" and ""apocalyptic fiction"" taken from wikipedia. But considering wikipedia provides quotes on why alternate history is a subgenre of science fiction, something that is far from settled as a debate on the internet, take it as you will. If nothing else, we can probably agree that it is speculative fiction. Yeah, this show may scratch my ""zombie meta fiction"" itch."

iZombie,35axt1,toddwdraper,15,Fri May 8 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"Seems like it, as death vision is a universal zombie skill; both Blaine and Lowell noticed and asked Liv if she had a vision, hinting that they have had similar experiences.  The real question is if any of the other zombies care enough to be suitably horrified.  Brain hunger >> Morality"
iZombie,35axt1,Future_Vantas,10,Fri May 8 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"Not sure how they will approach it on the show, but it's possible that Liv just spends more time trying to tune in to the memories and feelings of the brains she eats when she works in the morgue, and as such has visions more easily?  I'm not positive but I don't think we've seen any other zombie have a vision yet.  Maybe they will address it by having her just be more sensitive to the memories of the dead than other zombies."
iZombie,35axt1,vivellimac,7,Fri May 8 16:44:29 2015 UTC,I would imagine they all see him killing their latest brain. Which would be interesting from a psychological standpoint.  Every time the meet him they get a reminder of the risks of disappointing him. That gives Blaine a powerful advantage.
iZombie,35axt1,haijak,4,Fri May 8 18:15:09 2015 UTC,I think the biggest thing eating a brain causes is a personality change to the traits and tendencies of the consumed brain.  It seems like the visions only occur through a trigger of something that the eaten brain had a memory of.  So if the zombie never sees anything that triggers a memory they might not even get a vision from that brain.
iZombie,35axt1,JHowrd13,3,Fri May 8 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"If you didn't notice, the last episode sort of addressed this question.  Lowell(and likely his other customers) hadn't been seeing the visions for a few reasons.  a.) He used a courier system so after he made the original contact, he did little face to face dealings with his clientele. (Visions seem to be brought on by seeing a familiar face or object)  b.) Rose's visions seem to be stronger and more frequent than other zombie's, since she is assisting police, helping solve the murders of almost every brain that she eats and decoding the meanings of their visions. She has used her ability enough to where she has more clarity in her visions than others.  c.) Some of them may have seen little flashes of visions or had hints, but chose to live in ignorance and not even go down that mental rabbit-trail of where the brain came from. They have one, so they're happy.  I was wondering this too while watching the latest episode, and it was answered about as soon as I could wonder. Hope that helps. :)"

iZombie,35axt1,FlameyFlame,0,Wed May 27 14:53:16 2015 UTC,Superman is the only Kryptonian on Earth. Rose is just a zombie.  There's no reason to think that using visions makes them stronger and more frequent. It's just a rationalization. The real reason is that the main hero has to be unique in one way or another.

It was originally created to do stories that could not meet the stringent guidelines of the Comics Code Authority and this allowed their comics to have more graphic content than their main imprint of titles. This also meant that their age-restricted titles were free to contain explicit contents of violence, substance abuse, sexuality, nudity, profanity, and other controversial subjects similar to that of an R-rated film. Although many of its releases are in the horror and fantasy genres, it also publishes works dealing with crime, social satire, speculative fiction, and biography. In early 2013, Karen Berger left her role as the executive editor of the imprint, having overseen it since its inception in 1993. She has been succeeded in that role by Shelly Bond.

I think we should be glad with that and not beg for 22 episodes just to get this wish realized to be later complaining that the show ended too soon or became crap or ran out of gas."

iZombie,357u1z,erenjaegerbomb93,1 point,Sun May 10 10:20:07 2015 UTC,I thought that show was canceled? I don't think CW would pick it up though. It's too old skewing for them. Its ratings were already awful for NBC and that network has bigger audience than CW. It also looks expensive to produce. It would get compared to Supernatural most of the time.
iZombie,3541ub,beamdriver,3,Wed May 6 22:45:23 2015 UTC,Victory! I can't wait to see what next season will have in store!

I watched like 10 minutes before I was like ""wait, I don't know half these people.""  And then when I reported it to Hulu - because I really wanted to watch them all in order - I got a dismissive reply the next morning that I was ""wrong"" and the right episode was online. So I'm glad someone else witnessed this and confirms I'm not crazy!"
iZombie,35554i,condoriano_ismyname,18,Thu May 7 04:41:47 2015 UTC,Another thing: Liv usually has her visions because she visits the locations where the people she has eaten lived and studies their cases. Other zombies don't do that so they probably experience fewer visions.
iZombie,35554i,lord_allonymous,10,Thu May 7 10:28:17 2015 UTC,"The question is would any of the other zombies really care? I mean for Liv she works in crime related deaths, and inherently she could feel some responsibility to care / solve the case. While the clients just pay up so they don't have to do the killing themselves, they also have no choice on who to eat so they wouldn't really know what other talents memories they could use.   A future arc may include some kind of serial killer who targets his victim specifically to absorb their skillset."
iZombie,35554i,pylamb,6,Thu May 7 08:50:41 2015 UTC,"I remember reading a theory from someone else that as the people getting their brains from Blaine don't necessarily limit themselves to one brain and eat just that one to get the visions the effect could be diluted.  Also if I was running the business Blaine is I would not give people full brains (we have seen that the butcher creates meals from them) and instead mix and match the brains in the meal so as to again dilute the effect of the visions, that way people don't get visions of Blaine murdering them (if it does work like that) every time he pops round to drop off a brain."
iZombie,35554i,Fiorbeth,2,Thu May 7 11:54:30 2015 UTC,"I got that too.   It seems its a mix of Liv both not only being in situations or environments that would trigger normal people's memories but she's getting the steroid option of brains whereas the rest are getting the Walmart protein powder version - she's eating the whole singular brain for the set amount of time it takes to solve her case, which means she's getting a stronger amount of memories, skills, personality, and memories of the victim."

iZombie,34zyco,conuly,3,Thu May 7 02:15:56 2015 UTC,"Section 1. History of article  Terrier:       Most terrier breeds were developed in Great Britain and Ireland. They were used to control rats, rabbits, and foxes both over and under the ground. Some larger terriers were also used to hunt badgers. In fact, the word terrier comes from the Middle French terre, derived from the Latin terra, meaning earth. Terrier is also the modern French for ""burrow"". The Kerry Blue Terrier and Airedale, however, are particularly noted for tackling river rats and otters in deep water. Not long ago many terriers were also herding dogs, such as Wheaten Terriers. Different localities raised terriers suited to their hunting or vermin control needs. Terriers were crossed with hunting dogs, fighting dogs, and other terriers. In the mid-19th century, with the advent of dog shows, various breeds were refined from the older purpose-bred dogs. All of today's terrier breeds are bred primarily as pets.

On that note, I'm happy to see Liv is finally getting some.  Other stuff- Not enough Clive this Ep but I liked him and Liv bantering about his love life. Major is becoming a major badass.

iZombie,34zyco,Adido_net,3,Wed May 6 03:16:57 2015 UTC,I have been wondering how zombie strength works. Do older zombies hold an advantage (true blood) or is it just multiply your normal strength x 10 or something or is it brain related?
iZombie,34zyco,GOA_AMD65,6,Wed May 6 18:18:58 2015 UTC,I think it's more akin to multiplying normal strength and then you gotta take into account that Blaine is a trickster so he'd probably try some dirty tricks if he and Liv go at it.
iZombie,34zyco,realgamer890,3,Wed May 6 02:14:47 2015 UTC,Or you could take into account that Liv probably weights 100 lbs at most and he seems like a pretty strong dude.  I see no way how or why Blaine couldn't completely destroy her unless she just hate a professional fighter brain...

iZombie,34zyco,realgamer890,27,Wed May 6 01:19:14 2015 UTC,"Nothing. Liv, under the influence of a brain, tried to psychoanalyze him and told him he was going after Peyton because he knew deep down that she wouldn't reciprocate his feelings and that he was doing that because one of his parents was distant/emotionally neglectful and he was trying to recreate that dynamic.

iZombie,350ome,DroidMasterX,2,Wed May 6 03:58:03 2015 UTC,"This is a CW show, so ""acceptance"" after the reveal of a secret is unlikely (see Arrow).  Major is the man though, so maybe he'll be cool."
iZombie,350ome,Oieoieoie,1 point,Wed May 6 16:41:52 2015 UTC,lol also see Supernatural for more examples of this.
iZombie,350ome,Chr1st01988,2,Sat May 9 17:37:22 2015 UTC,This will happen for sure. Major seemed to be very fixated and serious about finding out anything and everything about the brain eating Blaine/candyman.
iZombie,350ome,Oieoieoie,10,Thu May 7 03:17:07 2015 UTC,"I want to see Suzuki go to Liv for brains, spill the beans about what he's done for Blaine and what he knows about what Blaine's doing, and for them to them team up together against Blaine. They both have a reason to have a vendetta against him.   I'm trying to make this a 3, but it keeps auto-correcting to 2. Lowell gets visions from the brains he eats as well, doesn't he? He probably knows. Liv got a vision of Blaine from the piece of Jerome's brain she got at Lowell's place, and if Lowell has been eating Blaine-sourced brains for an extended period of time he probably has an inkling that something isn't quite right. What I want to know is whether Blaine has basically assigned him to get close to Liv in exchange for brains or if he just thinks there isn't a good option to get brains and thinks getting them from Blaine is the easiest thing to do in a situation where there aren't any good scenarios. But if the former option was the case, why wouldn't he ask Liv for brains from the morgue? And didn't Blaine say something to Suzuki about having some kind of plan for Liv? I'm fearing the worst for Lowell's intentions, but I hope the character sticks around in some capacity."
iZombie,350ome,Dizzard,3,Wed May 6 15:28:28 2015 UTC,"Yes! All of that yes. Yep, voicing my fears there very well. Though, I'm a little confused: Didn't Blaine deliver Jerome's brain to Jackie already, a few episodes back? When he said this brain will make you feel like a teenager, Jerome was right there. I'm still hoping that Lowell's reactions when he first saw her were genuine, but he could just be a really good actor. I also hope that if our doomy suspicions are correct, that maybe he's been developing true feelings for her."
iZombie,350ome,Dizzard,9,Wed May 6 15:44:13 2015 UTC,"It's possible that it was just another teenagers brain since that seems to be their main source. That what I would assume be the explanation. That or Blaine doesn't give everyone a full brain and he uses the one brain for multiple ""customers"""
iZombie,350ome,Dizzard,2,Wed May 6 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"Huh, that would be smart of him. Or he saves whole brains for his cash cow customers."
iZombie,350ome,DroidMasterX,4,Thu May 7 03:21:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe one of the brains belonged to Eddie, the kid Jerome and Major were looking for before Jerome was taken? I'm not sure. I might have to go back and rewatch."
iZombie,350ome,DroidMasterX,2,Wed May 6 15:53:20 2015 UTC,"That's probably the case. The way they set things up in that episode, it just made it look like he was delivering Jerome's brain. They seem to like fake-outs and false inconsistencies, don't they?"
iZombie,350ome,Malveux,5,Thu May 7 03:22:53 2015 UTC,"Well even if Ravi did become a zombie he'd still be ""sticking around"".   I don't think you have anything to worry about. The promo for next week has him saying it's been 12 hours since he was bitten and he looks fine aside from being shaken. Plus they're so doing a bait & switch with him staring at the brain in the promo. Oh yeah he's TOTALLY going to eat it. I'll believe that when I see it."
iZombie,350ome,madolpenguin,2,Wed May 6 14:03:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, that bit about sticking around was my way of saying I hope he doesn't get killed off without having to say it. Where is this magical promo? I haven't seen it posted yet."

iZombie,350ome,DroidMasterX,3,Wed May 6 15:15:27 2015 UTC,I really really really doubt they'd kill off a character like Ravi in that way. He's like the comic relief/lovable guy.  They'd only kill him if they wanted the tone of the show to become more depressing/low key.
iZombie,350ome,Hulkkis,2,Wed May 6 15:40:13 2015 UTC,"You can find the promo on youtube, that's where I found it. Type in something like ""iZombie 1x09 promo"". The episode is called Patriot Brains."

iZombie,34zlja,soren121,2,Tue May 5 21:55:10 2015 UTC,Ok thank you. I just thought because they sometimes add more episodes for the second season.
iZombie,34zlja,soren121,17,Tue May 5 21:57:52 2015 UTC,"iZombie was launched in the midseason, though, so it won't happen. Ordering a back-half only happens to fall shows. The good news is, its chances at renewal are golden. It's the 3rd highest-rated show on The CW."
iZombie,34zlja,Poroner,9,Tue May 5 22:22:56 2015 UTC,Are the other 2 the flash and arrow?
iZombie,34zlja,Gate4043,9,Tue May 5 22:24:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, actually. iZombie is battling Supernatural for 3rd place."
iZombie,34zlja,soren121,5,Tue May 5 22:41:31 2015 UTC,And they really really should surpass supernatural. It has gotten so bland and boring.
iZombie,34zlja,Gate4043,3,Wed May 6 13:23:05 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that the top 3 shows on the CW are from DC. Eventually they and DC will realise that ""Hey, wait a minute, these are doing incredibly well. Why don't we invest a ton of money into these shows and get a few good writers for female characters for the top two."" Flash is number one, right?"
iZombie,34zlja,listyraesder,3,Wed May 6 15:03:42 2015 UTC,Yup!   The Flash (18-49 demo avg: 1.44) Arrow (1.01) Supernatural (0.80) iZombie (0.71)
iZombie,34zlja,orramus,1 point,Wed May 6 15:06:39 2015 UTC,Thought so. It just wouldn't make sense if it weren't.
iZombie,34zlja,Zegir,2,Wed May 6 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"It actually works against them. One of the things about the CW being a 50/50 joint venture between Warner Bros. and CBS is that it is supposed to keep a 50/50 split between commissions bought from CBS Television Studios and Warner Bros. Television. Naturally, all DC shows are WBTV, and Beauty & the Beast is the only CW show outright owned by CBS, so there is pressure to find shows from outside the DC properties and to commission CBS shows over WBTV ones, with a new Star Trek series being one possibility."
iZombie,34zlja,listyraesder,1 point,Wed May 6 16:03:12 2015 UTC,"I would not complain about a new star-trek.   I feel modern TV is somewhat lacking a good sci-fi.  (If I have overlooked something please correct me, I am looking for good sci-fi!)  Extant had a decent opening few episodes, but around episode 5 I totally lost interest."
iZombie,34zlja,ajwhite98,5,Sun May 10 08:00:40 2015 UTC,"If they maintain the quality, I'd be happy with 13 episodes, so long as there are more seasons to come."
iZombie,34zlja,JupitersClock,5,Wed May 6 01:40:37 2015 UTC,"Even though there are folks on here saying that there isn't a chance that the CW will increase the number of episodes for iZombie I think there is a possibility. However, this is only based on the fact that The 100, also a CW show, premiered at 13 episodes during mid-season and then increased to 16 episodes for its second run."
iZombie,34zlja,AlexanderChimp,2,Wed May 6 03:53:55 2015 UTC,"Difference this time is that the CW has essentially run out of space, what with the Flash/Arrow spinoff, a few strong pilots, and 8 renewed series.   It only programs 10 hours per week, so it has room for one full season order and a midseason show. iZombie is vying for one of those slots along with the pilots, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if they split the slot and ordered 3 new series with 13 episodes each."
iZombie,34zlja,listyraesder,3,Wed May 6 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"Probably not.  The CW only has so many open slots.  They'll probably want to keep iZombie at midseason for convenience, which means about 13 episodes per season."
iZombie,34zj0f,Adido_net,16,Tue May 5 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it's simply a visual thing to set her apart and make her zombiesm obvious  Blaine had been a zombie for a while, but didn't do the tanning thing until he had been established as a zombie.  The fact that you see her buying bronzer in the first episode makes me think that her appearance is exaggerated for the sake of the audience, so while we see her as unnaturally pale, everyone else sees her as just a normal pasty white girl"
iZombie,34zj0f,Mini-Marine,2,Tue May 5 23:25:17 2015 UTC,interesting theory-- if that IS the case- who's POV are we meant to be seeing this through? Liv's? if so- is she extra pasty to herself?
iZombie,34zj0f,Mini-Marine,9,Tue May 5 23:42:18 2015 UTC,"Well, we do get her narration, so we're certainly seeing things from her POV, so her being so pale because she sees herself as very pale and standing out from the crowd does make sense.  I mean there's been numerous references to her being pale, but it hasn't been ""holy crap are you ok?"" but more like ""oh, you're really quite pale"""
iZombie,34zj0f,BooksAgain,3,Tue May 5 23:58:20 2015 UTC,"Even if she looks unnaturally pale, what are people going to think? That she's the most pale person they've ever seen, or that she's reanimated?  There's not really any risk. Being a zombie is really unbelievable. It's more believable to be psychic, weird and pale."
iZombie,34zj0f,BooksAgain,1 point,Wed May 6 23:40:17 2015 UTC,still though I was kinda curious why she would choose not to - although the whole depression angle seems to be most plausible.
iZombie,34zj0f,blockpro156,1 point,Wed May 6 23:45:04 2015 UTC,"I mean, why bother? At first it was depression, lack of interest in even trying, but now there isn't really a point.  Fitting in? Looking normal? She has more important things to worry about."
iZombie,34zj0f,Mik0ri,5,Thu May 7 00:38:11 2015 UTC,"Her family probably thinks that she dyes her hair, it makes sense  because after she became a zombie she was very depressed for a while. so Liv suddenly getting a kind of goth look while she's depressed shouldn't raise too many questions, and it also makes sense that she kept it because she looks hot!"
iZombie,34zj0f,Jalapeno_blood,2,Wed May 6 15:38:54 2015 UTC,"Out of universe - Because the audience needs the main zombie to look like a zombie. The show's gimmick must be maintained. Can you imagine the alternative?  ""So wait, that chick is the main character? I thought the MC was a zombie, isn't that the entire point? What kinda low budget crap is this? She's just a random girl who inexplicably eats brains!""  ""Noooo no no, I swear, she is a zombie, she just tans her skin, and dyes her hair, and...""  Etc.  In universe, my best attempt at rationalising her still not tanning, etc, is that she has now come terms with being a zombie, and everything that entails.  You need look no further than her narration - these days, she doesn't talk about being a zombie like a terrible curse. Just a shitty, different, but could-be-worse fact of her life.   She even jokes about it frequently - ""shish kebabs!"", "" it's a zombie thing "", "" if you heard the aimless shuffling of the undead, that's just me. "" etc.  So I honestly think at this point, she'd see tanning as a lie, a coverup of her true self. She  is a zombie, in it for the long haul, living the lifestyle, for better or for worse. (Not that she doesn't want a cure, but you understand.)"
iZombie,34zj0f,alphawimp731,1 point,Sat May 9 21:02:02 2015 UTC,love this theory. Going with it.
iZombie,34vdwg,50doctorwho,40,Mon May 4 21:44:38 2015 UTC,"Whats the tone     It's a bit like Veronica Mars, lite police procedural with a lovable female protagonist. lots of smart dialogue and black humor. The only supernatural element so far are zombies, who are as unlike the Walking Dead zombie variety as you can possibly get.   how simmilar is it to flarrow, is it a superhero style show?     Nope, it's its own thing. Wouldn't compare them at all."
iZombie,34vdwg,alexshatberg,-5,Mon May 4 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a bit like Veronica Mars, however, if you found Veronica's clever writing and strong character a strong draw you'll be disappointed with the protagonist Liv, who isn't very interesting at all.  The scenarios are interesting though and there is another character who is quite interesting."
iZombie,34vdwg,DevotedToNeurosis,5,Tue May 5 12:40:53 2015 UTC,What makes Liv so cool is she is a straight laced good girl who has to end the entire life she had planned out and become someone new.
iZombie,34vdwg,Jalapeno_blood,2,Wed May 6 03:27:02 2015 UTC,"I find she stands out as being the most boring amongst the rest of the cast. Everyone is more interesting than her. Of course, her zombie condition is interesting, but not her as a person."
iZombie,34vdwg,DevotedToNeurosis,23,Wed May 6 11:11:49 2015 UTC,Yes it is worth watching but it's more a blend of Buffy and Veronica Mars (with a pinch of Quantum Leap!) than a superhero show.
iZombie,34vdwg,wiccabilly,1 point,Mon May 4 22:20:36 2015 UTC,It's strange that I hated Buffy with a passion and didn't manage more than four episode of VM yet love this show. I think the quality is way above Buffy at least.
iZombie,34vdwg,Jalapeno_blood,2,Wed May 6 03:28:33 2015 UTC,I'd agree that production values are certainly much higher than early Buffy but I really loved Buffy and production value certainly increased once it became a hit.
iZombie,34vdwg,wiccabilly,4,Wed May 6 05:09:17 2015 UTC,"Buffy was nearly 20 years ago, at the time it would have been high production.  I'm an overly biased Joss Whedon fan though so take that with a pinch of salt."

iZombie,34vdwg,Jalapeno_blood,1 point,Fri May 15 17:35:33 2015 UTC,Wouldnt compare it to arrow AT ALL. It's much more similar to Castle than anything else that I've watched. Lots of humor and movie references. (Last episode had Game of Thrones and Fight Club jokes :P)
iZombie,34vdwg,BhiQ,15,Wed May 6 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"I think that it's worth watching, but it's not really a superhero show. Although it does have similar things, she has a secret identity and a few friends with certain specializations that help her solve crimes.    The tone is very different from Flash/Arrow, it's a lot less serious."
iZombie,34vdwg,blockpro156,2,Mon May 4 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"It's also a lot less cheesy than flash, although still a little cheesy."
iZombie,34vdwg,lord_allonymous,13,Tue May 5 13:34:41 2015 UTC,Its more in the vein of Veronica Mars/Buffy The Vampire Slayer than a superhero show ... and yes its pretty damn entertaining.

iZombie,34vdwg,JeamBim,4,Tue May 5 03:11:58 2015 UTC,"I think it is worth the watch. You will know within the first couple of episodes if it is something you want to invest your time in. Each episode has a crime that the main character tries to solve by eating the victim's brains which gives her insight in the their life. There are also longer arcs (are there other zombies? what turned her into a zombie exactly? etc). There are a lot of very funny moments, as well as touching moments. I find the show very fresh and fun, and it gets better as it goes on."
iZombie,34vdwg,Put-A-Bird-On-It,3,Tue May 5 01:22:38 2015 UTC,I never watched Veronica Mars and I watched iZombie and it was good.  A cheeky and a fun show that unwind you after the other shows on Tuesday!  It might not be for everybody so give the Pilot a try and see for yourself! : )
iZombie,34vdwg,PhoOhThree,3,Tue May 5 05:49:05 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to get heavy bryan fuller vibes from it, like Dead Like Me, the voice overs and the encroaching darkness."
iZombie,34vdwg,AmantisAsoko,3,Tue May 5 09:55:57 2015 UTC,It's way more than just a weekly procedural though. There is an entire over arcing story that plays a decent part of each episode.  As said it is nearly the exact same as Veronica Mars in terms of tone and those who haven't watched Veronica and enjoy this should definitely give it a go.
iZombie,34vdwg,Chr1st01988,3,Tue May 5 11:48:48 2015 UTC,"I really like the show.  It is worth noting, though, that it is nothing like the comic.  It pays homage to the comic, but is itself a completely separate story."
iZombie,34vdwg,trevmex,2,Tue May 5 14:26:54 2015 UTC,"It's light and more of a case procedural with elements of the supernatural. The casting is great, everyone is likeable."
iZombie,34vdwg,pylamb,2,Tue May 5 10:24:25 2015 UTC,"Abso-friggin'-lutely. It's a really interesting premise, the tone is more or less lighthearted despite its subject material, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's my fun show.

iZombie,34vdwg,WyrtWicce,1 point,Tue May 5 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"Veronica Mars. Weekly Procedural. Darker than The Flash, not as dark as Supernatural. It IS a super hero style show, but closer to a cop show.  But bottom line, it's worth it in my opinion."
iZombie,34vdwg,AlvisDBridges,1 point,Tue May 5 06:10:02 2015 UTC,"It's much closer to Flash than Arrow with its witty humor and pop culture references. Unlike Flarrow there's not much action nor much drama, and it's pretty much episodical - the larger story arc isn't very captivating and seems to move slowly.

iZombie,34qc21,AlvisDBridges,3,Sun May 3 20:31:21 2015 UTC,"A few days seems about right, but it's probably a gradual decline - Liv ate an extra bit of brain to ""top off"" the likelihood of her getting a vision. It also never seems to fade completely, so it's like the personality bits meld with her a bit and the skills lose potency but stay behind. Her voiceovers at the end have been about the lessons she learned from the brain-of-the-week, and I've taken that as her mental rationalizations for the changes the brains make to her thought patterns."

iZombie,34qc21,PantheraLupus,3,Wed May 6 04:27:48 2015 UTC,The personality and skills last until the brain is fully digested. The memories need to be triggered like visiting the dead person's house or meeting their families. Sometimes the memories are randomly triggered. Most of the zombies turned by Blaine uses tanning to hide their pale skin. They also dye their hair. Usually they're rich except for the two thugs that betrayed Blaine. Lowell also tans and dyes his hair making people assume that he works for Blaine. He is also rich since he's a singer. On the pilot episode Liv was buying what I think is a tanning lotion/make-up but she is never seen using it.
iZombie,34qc21,prettycureXD,2,Sun May 3 22:20:45 2015 UTC,1) How long does a meal fully digested? 4 hours?
iZombie,34qc21,maelstrom_xiii,3,Sun May 3 23:32:52 2015 UTC,It takes a while to fully digest something as a normal human being...a zombie with reduced organ function (speculating that her other organs are similarly less functional like her heart with it's very low heartbeat) might take a week or more. But that's just speculation. In some episodes when she's doing the voiceover at the end she talks about how the effects are wearing off.
iZombie,34qc21,ohnogodzilla,2,Mon May 4 01:28:49 2015 UTC,"I believe the answer to 1 is as long as the plot demands. The answer to 2 is spray tan, pretty sure."

On the number 2, we saw the Heroes bad guy and his older lady get spray-tan in a previous episode, has it ever been shown in-episode that Liv's new boyfriend spray tan as well?  on a related note, why do you think Liv doesn't spray-tan? is Liv that far ahead the depressed scale that she doesn't event bother getting a spray tan?  If Liv's new boyfriend spray-tanned, then so far Liz is the only zombie we've seen so far that doesn't spray tan then right?"

Clive announced that Eliza was the murderer, as she was the one who had purchased the GHB with the forged 'scrip pad. However, several things are pointing to a larger conspiracy surrounding Max Rager. When they went to Eliza's house to arrest her, it would appear that she had simply been tipped off and fled, but the shower curtain was pointedly missing, which would suggest that she was either kidnapped or killed while taking a shower (the tiles were still wet).   Carson had mentioned that the employees of Max Rager were all super serious about it, saying it was more of a lifestyle than a company. Plus that report that their product (energy drink or something?) causes 1 in 1000 people to become ""psychotic"" (or zombified).   But hey, since Clive had announced to the now-we-know-he's-a-zombie chief that Eliza was guilty, and presumably no one else, maybe the chief alerted Max Rager about her? The police attention and negative press associated with her actions would certainly put her on the black list within the company. Maybe Suzuki is involved in Max Rager?

As of the New52, Vertigo and DCU are one-in-the-same.  HOWEVER  The fact that they make it a point to flash the Vertigo logo at the end of each episode rather than the DC Comics one at the front tells me they want to promote the idea that these are separate."
iZombie,33udzz,samx3i,4,Sun Apr 26 01:45:04 2015 UTC,"you're not quite correct. Prior to New52, Vertigo published 2 types of comics: creator-owned and DC-owned. With the New52, Vertigo is strictly creator-owned, with the exception of Sandman: Overture.  The DC-owned comics (Swamp Thing, Hellblazer, Animal Man, etc.) have always been a part of the DCU. New52 didn't change that. All the New52 did was made it so that they weren't published through Vertigo anymore, and rebooted them as they did with the mainstream DC comics.  Creator-owned comics like iZombie have and always will be separated from the DC Universe. It's in whatever universe the creators want it to be, as is the case with other creator-owned Vertigo titles."

iZombie,33pbut,Frippety,8,Fri Apr 24 13:25:50 2015 UTC,"Spoilers episode 6  It may be because the other zombies being affected simply isn't relevant to the story. We only knew Lowell can be affected because it helped Liv (i.e. by getting her some pills to lessen the effect of agoraphobia) and was relevant to the episode (since Lowell and Liv had their date-of-sorts at Liv's place because of it).   Whether or not Blaine et al are affected by the brains isn't really relevant to Blaine's evil zombie chop shop and blackmailing ring he's got going.  Edit: Also, not all the zombies are getting their brains from people who have suffered a violent death. Lowell mentioned he gets his from the funeral home or something (please correct me if I'm wrong), so he may simply be eating people who've died peacefully in their sleep."

iZombie,33n4wl,TheMaltesePenguin,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:57:50 2015 UTC,"no it isn't. Vertigo publishes (or used to, prior to the New 52) 2 types of comics:  DC-owned property (Sandman, Hellblazer, Swamp Thing, Animal Man)  and creator-owned comics, which iZombie is an example of.  So, the creators own the comics not DC. However, DC introduced a recent thing in creator contracts, where they sign off adaptation rights or something like that. So it's fair to say, that while the iZombie comic isn't DC property, DC had full control of it as a show."
iZombie,33n4wl,cteavin,1 point,Fri May 1 17:46:50 2015 UTC,Isn't Constantine Vertigo? The tone is different but the themes match better. It'd be cool to see John make a guest appearance.
iZombie,33n4wl,ribblesquat,5,Thu Apr 23 23:39:37 2015 UTC,"John Constantine was a Vertigo property published in the title Hellblazer. Even then Hellblazer started as part of regular DC continuity.  JC was first introduced in Swamp Thing, who has interacted with Superman, Batman, et. al.  They phased out the DC continuity over time and Hellblazer was de facto separate from the DCU. The Hellblazer story came to an (ambiguous) end and John was subsequently reintroduced to mainstream DC continuity in the title Constantine as part of DC's ""New 52"" relaunch of their entire universe.  TL; DR: Sort of?"
iZombie,33n4wl,cteavin,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:47:10 2015 UTC,"I came into the universe with the start of the New 52, so that's interesting to me.   I read somewhere that Constantine is the only character in the D.C. Universe that has aged in real time with the series. Is that true?"
iZombie,33n4wl,ribblesquat,5,Fri Apr 24 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"More or less. It would feel like a cheat to claim Superman, Wonder Woman, Ra's al Ghul, or any other semi-immortal is aging in real time. John is in his mid-thirties at the start of Hellblazer and five years into the series there was a 40th birthday party issue. It's not like they showed a birthday party every year but by the end of the series editorial considered him to be in his 60s and John did remark on the extreme age gap when he started dating a girl in her mid-twenties. However, he was an extremely spry and vibrant 60. Comics being comics we can chalk that up to a blood transfusion from the demon Nergal early in the series or possibly due to his cancer riddled body being rebuilt from scratch by the First of the Fallen, aka Satan (but not Lucifer, he's a different character at DC.) Also, to correct myself from before there was roughly a year during which Vertigo JC and DCU JC simultaneously existed, appearing in Hellblazer and Justice League Dark respectively but they did wait until Hellblazer was cancelled to give DC JC his solo title.  While I can't think of anyone else at DC who ages as constantly as John Constantine, there was a remarkably similar progression over at Marvel. The Punisher's origins were explicitly tied to the Vietnam War so he was presumed to be aging in real time. As he got older he was spun off into Marvel's mature MAX line and separated from mainstream continuity. He died in his 60s, still kicking ass, and afterwards Frank Castle was reintroduced to mainstream Marvel continuity, this time as a veteran of an unnamed war to avoid giving themselves the same problem twice."
iZombie,33n4wl,obesemobile,3,Fri Apr 24 03:20:13 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, I was saying they should do a crossover in another comment. I think that could go well! Even if it wasn't a full on ""Meet up twice a season"" thing like Flash and Arrow it would be cool to have John investigate zombies spotted in Seattle, or another demon case but he runs into/gets help from Liv.   It would be cool to know that the zombie outbreak is tied into the Rising Darkness."
iZombie,33n4wl,cteavin,3,Fri Apr 24 00:20:10 2015 UTC,Here's to the CW purchasing the rights to Constantine because that tie in would make perfect sense. Plus it'd be cool to have Constantine cut off a head and bring it to Liv every year for help in a case.
iZombie,33n4wl,obesemobile,4,Fri Apr 24 02:29:52 2015 UTC,I would like someone to take care of Constantine and it would fit right in with DCTV (The CW). I can imagine John having Liv eat the brain of someone only for her to get possessed by a demon within it. Shenanigans ensue.

I also don't live in the United States, so things may work differently in different countries. Nonetheless, I'd like to share whatever little knowledge I have and hopefully answer your question.  In my country, autopsies are only done when there is an official police order (a.k.a instructed by the Law, so the family's permission is not required) or when the physician/doctor attending the patient (when he/she was alive) want to determine the cause of death (in which the family's permission IS required). I assume most of the bodies Liv and Ravi receive fall into the first category. In other words, the body (and everything on it) is evidence.  If this were real life, Liv and Ravi would always have a camera at hand to take photos of each bruise/cut/whatever that could be used as evidence in court. Even the clothes are carefully cut and photographed. At least one police officer (usually the only who signed/requested the autopsy) must be present at the time of the autopsy, as a witness. Also, in an ideal world, the autopsies would be done in a separate room as where the other bodies are stored. Nobody wants evidences or samples getting mixed up.  These kinds of autopsies require the coroner to be thorough, regardless of the mechanism of death. I mean, if the body had a stab wound on the chest, you cannot assume that's the cause of death. So aside from examining the thoracic cavity, he/she would also examine the abdominal cavity and the brain. Most major organs were removed, checked, weighed and recorded. This includes the lungs, the heart, the kidneys and yup, the brain. Sometimes other structures are checked too, like the stomach or the trachea, but I think that's per case to case basis. It is up to the coroner (or forensic specialist).  After all this, they put everything back in. They return everything to their original places as best as they can i.e they'd put the brain back into the skull, instead of tossing it into the abdomen. At this point, usually the police officer has already known about all the findings. He'd leave and wait for the official report from the coroner.  (No police officer stays for the clean-up). So, if you're Liv, this would be the perfect time to steal some brain.  You can't tell whether the brain is present or absent once the skull is closed. Nobody is going to open it up again to check.  The stitches used to close the scalp is done so that they are hidden under the deceased's hair, so most of the time it's not noticeable. The coroners take good care in not disfiguring the body, and making it presentable for the family members.  This is how it works in my country, and from what I've learned and observed. I hope this answered your question.  Edit: But if, for some reason, the body needs to be dug up and re-examined later, then yeah, Liv (and Ravi, since he's the boss) would probably be screwed."

iZombie,33khub,MikeyHatesLife,6,Thu Apr 23 13:52:48 2015 UTC,"I think that they addressed it in the first episode. Something to do with not only the fact that the brain is examined during the autopsy, but once everything is put back together, almost nobody will be going back for a second look once the body is interred. Basically, the odds of the cops exhuming a body when new evidence is found is actually quite low, and since Liv is solving the crime to 100%, nobody ever will dig it up later because the relatives will have the closure they need."

iZombie,33khub,penguinpaige,3,Wed Apr 29 16:56:53 2015 UTC,I saw an autopsy once for school. They slice the skin from ear to ear (moving the hair out of the way) then they pull the scalp to fold over the face. Then they use the bone saw to cut the top part of the skull off. Pop off the top and the brain is cut out. Put the skull back on and pull the scalp back over. I think a few stitches at the back of the head to keep it in place.

An alternative is placing the stitches at the back of the head so that they won't be visible when the body is lying supine.  From my knowledge, all autopsies require checking the brain, as I explained in my reply."
iZombie,33khub,Dinendir,0,Thu Apr 23 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"Assuming that a smarter person would extract the brains just before the body ships out, instead of removing it willy nilly and potentially tempering with evidence as has happened on the show, people would still notice the missing brain. First of all, most bodies in the US are embalmed before burial, an embalmer would surely notice the missing brain as the incomplete circulatory system actually makes the embalming process more difficult. Second, the missing weight in the head (1000-1400 grams for an adult brain) would definitely be noticed when the body is being prepped for display. Even after autopsy, it's usual for organs to be reinserted since that saves effort when it comes to disposal. Organs can be kept for further investigation but that would come with paper work and the missing organ would be kinda obvious. All in all, organs going missing doesn't seem like a very believable scenario. I think it'd be easier to get a job in a crematory and remove the organ before burning the body, though at that point it's been subjected to embalming fluids and/or decay."

Is it because she still likes him and doesn't want him to know she found someone else attractive or she's just not quite sure what she feels and wanted to change the subject

It doesn't have the greatest start as it comes off as juvenile and typical cw in the pilot but each episode it slowly sheds of the usual cwness into something amazing like a caterpillar  becoming into a butterfly almost haha. It is the darkest show on the cw if your into that and season 2 was freaking epic. It was the best season of television this year imo so far. If your going to give it a shot you have to at least watch 4 or 5 episodes, but I would highly recommend watching up to the finale because by that time you will be hooked."

iZombie,32y2xc,aidenalba,15,Fri Apr 17 17:46:00 2015 UTC,"i think it's unlikely that Lowell was turned by Blaine since Blaine is going after rich (older?) people. and even though Lowell is a musician i doubt he is making enough to pay 25K a month for brains.  also assuming Clive's boss is a zombie, he probably also wasn't turned by Blaine since i don't think a police chief/captain/whatever is making enough to pay Blaine."
iZombie,32y2xc,blackgarius,10,Fri Apr 17 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think everyone Blaine turns is rich. I think they have only showed the one person who is paying him. The others are his muscle and someone who owns a shop to use as a meeting place/brain distribution center. A high ranking police officer seems to be precisely the kind of person Blaine would target as he could prove very useful, like by shooing cops away from Blaine's activities at the skate park."
iZombie,32y2xc,obesemobile,3,Sat Apr 18 00:17:30 2015 UTC,i didn't think about that. but your probably right since homicide would be the best place to have a mole inside the police when your killing people for brains.
iZombie,32y2xc,blackgarius,8,Sat Apr 18 10:08:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't think Blaine turned Lowell either. I am partial to the Max Rager theory.  With regards to Clive's boss, I wouldn't dismiss that so soon. I think we can be pretty sure, at this point, that the boss is involved in covering up for Blaine. Is he Blaine's customer? It's still likely. A regular chief may not, but maybe he's a dirty cop and thus, makes extra cash on the side. Maybe Blaine is paying him a small amount (or bribing him with brains) to sweep those missing persons reports under the rug. As for who turned Clive's boss, there is still not enough clues to go on."
iZombie,32y2xc,blackgarius,2,Fri Apr 17 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"i also like the Max Rager theory kinda like the coca cola and cocaine story. And your right we don't know how he got turned, with all the zombies running around now there are plenty of other ways it might have happened."
iZombie,32y2xc,fellatious_argument,11,Sat Apr 18 10:16:56 2015 UTC,Isn't it funny how out in the open Liz is to anyone who knows about zombies?  Meanwhile there are undercover zombies amassing all around her that she is totally oblivious to.
iZombie,32y2xc,disneywizard,9,Fri Apr 17 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I think this can be explained. Liv said, back in episode 2, that she thought she was ""the only one"". So if she thought she was the only zombie around, her only concern was to hide her zombie-ness from humans, not from other zombies. She didn't think there were other zombies like her until she had that Blaine vision, and even then, she didn't think there'd be so many. Sure, she had met 3 zombies in the past 5 episodes, but it's hard to forget the loneliness she had felt in the past 6 months. This could explain her carelessness about her appearance, and why she'll continue to be surprised whenever a new zombie crosses her path."
iZombie,32y2xc,fellatious_argument,3,Fri Apr 17 23:16:09 2015 UTC,"I don' think so.  Remember, she's still getting slim pickings from brains and, if its related to a case, is stuck eating the same brain for a week at a time. All the other zombies we've seen have a variety of brains at their disposal so while Liv may be older, I don't think she could take any of them on yet.   Also: Blaine is kinda picky with his brains and has figured out, like a designer drug, how to get the most from brains."
iZombie,32y2xc,fellatious_argument,2,Sat Apr 18 02:38:10 2015 UTC,I read a theory that Lowell might have killed the girl at the end of the last episode out of revenge.  Did he also find out who poisoned the shot?
iZombie,32y2xc,MariaDwhatever,7,Wed Apr 22 19:35:59 2015 UTC,"Do you mean Holly or Eliza? May I know what kind of revenge? There was no Lowell x Eliza interaction in the entire episode, so if Lowell is involved in Eliza's death/abduction, it's simply bad writing. For this reason, and considering that all Eliza's stuff were taken, I think Eliza's death/abduction isn't a one-person job. A larger organisation, i.e. Max Rager, must be involved. I don't think Lowell has anything to do with it.  As for who poured the shot, I think the writers purposely made Lowell miss that detail so that we'll be unclear onto who is really guilty (I actually have another theory that Carson is actually lying and Eliza was just the scapegoat). Lowell didn't see who poured the shots because he was could feel himself changing and was pre-occupied with keeping himself calm/human."

iZombie,32t3z1,DakobaBlue,4,Thu Apr 16 22:01:41 2015 UTC,"My suspicion is that he's going to be a grey/anti-hero/bad boy sort of character, in the same vein as Spike from Buffy or Logan from Veronica Mars. I think he's keeping something from Liv and I think his association with Max Rager will cause some kind of problem (my prediction is that they supply him with brains), but I think he'll generally be portrayed in a way where the audience is meant to sympathize with him."

He was too guarded in that monitored interrogation room to tell the truth at the time, but his answer about the record label was too flippant and rehearsed, I think. And he and Liv just haven't spent enough time together for him to spill any more beans. Or maybe he won't, if he thinks her being privy to those details could bring her harm. Anyway, they'd better not turn him into a surprise bad guy, or I'll be annoyed."
iZombie,32t3z1,Rudy_was_offsides,3,Tue Apr 28 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"Yes and I learned this by mistake.

So that explains why he might be about to star in a new show, and he'll probably die by the end of the season.

I guess by experimenting with the traits she acquires from dead people allows her to reflect on herself in comparison, and develop that way. Never really thought about it like that. Kinda like how she was aware of her lack of emotion when she ate the hitman and never wanted to feel like that again. Basically taught her that emotion (even negative) is better than no emotion."
iZombie,32osc5,JMPitt,11,Wed Apr 15 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can't think of another that was able to exploit the kind of ""cookie-cutter"" predictable week-to-week story line in such a way to benefit the overall plot.  The closest I can think of is Fringe during/after season 3, but that was not as organic feeling as iZombie.    Also, the boyfriend story line is worth talking about.  Maybe it's just me, but during the first couple of episodes, I was repeatedly surprised that he wasn't a one-dimensional character.  It would be so easy for the show him only when it comes to Liv and their relationship, but they allow you to actually come to know him and like him.  He's not just eye candy (this show has lots of eye candy)."
iZombie,32osc5,prettycureXD,2,Wed Apr 15 23:24:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the boyfriend part. I know a lot of people from A.V. Club that dislike Major. Some even thinks he'll be the male version of Laurel from Arrow. Me personally, I find their chemistry lacking. Lowell is far more interesting atm."
iZombie,32osc5,JMPitt,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:49:59 2015 UTC,"Probably it can be better done (I'm not too up on arrow - maybe I should check it out).  I'm just satisfied with the different route they went with the character than expected.  I guess the way the writers have handled the friendship post-break up is very...ideal... in that they're actually friends.  That said, if you can accept this aspect of the plot, then he's an interesting character that you care about not only because he's a ""good guy"" but also since Liv cares about him.  Regardless, Lowell is a great addition.  They have a couple different routes where they can go.  Hopefully it keeps surprising."
iZombie,32osc5,hmpsnj,21,Thu Apr 16 13:44:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like that is the point. Since becoming a zombie she was severely withdrawn, wasn't interacting with family and friends, had basically ceased to be the person she was before. Her personality died, and each week she gains a little more of her humanity back through eating the brains of whoever."

And now that Bradley James is a part of this world, I love it even more. He and Rose already are showing some chemistry. And I love that Liv has someone else she can confide in."

iZombie,326soa,Canadian_in_Canada,5,Sun Apr 12 06:13:36 2015 UTC,Apparently he was named after one of the writer's high school crushes.
iZombie,326soa,Talex666,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:47:27 2015 UTC,That's a bit of a long stretch if we were expected to figure that out ourselves.

iZombie,326soa,Talex666,2,Mon Apr 13 17:03:26 2015 UTC,Just watched some youtube vids on some of the interviews. Seems that his name was a combination of people that each of the writers fancied. Major and Lilywhite.
iZombie,326soa,FluffyCookie,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"""Major Lilywhite"" according to IMDB. Well, it has ""white"" in it, so that could be a reference to Liv being white. Then if you were to go a bit too far on the interpretation, he was a major part of her life as her fiancé, but now he's just a ""Lil'"" part of her life. But that is probably a bit too far as I said."
iZombie,326soa,FluffyCookie,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:45:24 2015 UTC,So does he becomes lily-white?

iZombie,31x1e9,JustinC00,19,Wed Apr 8 20:43:47 2015 UTC,I have no idea what those numbers mean
iZombie,31x1e9,fourismith,25,Wed Apr 8 21:29:25 2015 UTC,"Flash is the most powerful lead-in the CW has, so most will credit some of its success to that. It's very good news when you maintain solid numbers on a week your lead-in plays a re-run. It's an indicator that the show is at least starting to have its own legs. Basically, the number is high enough that renewal is more likely. I don't know if I'd go so far to say imminent."
iZombie,31x1e9,wiccabilly,10,Wed Apr 8 22:42:26 2015 UTC,"I think that means: iZOMBIE projected an audience of approximately 700,000 viewers in the 18-49 demographic."
iZombie,31x1e9,Kuze421,13,Wed Apr 8 22:01:21 2015 UTC,That is actually not bad. Arrow has 0.82 and Jane the Virgin has 0.50. Even the Vampire Diaries has over the last 6 episodes averaging 0.75.  The only CW show that consistently cracks and surpasses the 1 million barrier in the 18-49 demo is The Flash. Compared to the other shows it is a Juggernaut. Truly impressive numbers. A fantastic lead-in.
iZombie,31x1e9,AfricazMost,5,Wed Apr 8 22:42:36 2015 UTC,Your absolutely right. Those numbers sound really good to everyone except Fox and NBC executives.
iZombie,31x1e9,Kuze421,6,Wed Apr 8 23:24:42 2015 UTC,"To be fair, CW shows generally have a lower budget than Fox and NBC shows, so they don't need as big an audience."
iZombie,31x1e9,Jangwin,6,Thu Apr 9 02:21:49 2015 UTC,"But while they don't have a higher budget, they still attract a HUGE fanbase that get upset when they cancel shows after one season.   I'm still upset over Firefly and I will never forgive them for it."

iZombie,31x1e9,JBB1986,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:13:47 2015 UTC,The Flash really deserves it. It's such a great show. Already surpassed Arrow in only one Season (which isn't even finished yet) IMO.
iZombie,31x1e9,Jeanpuetz,5,Fri Apr 10 13:40:26 2015 UTC,Incorrect.  0.7 means 0.7% in that age group watched the show. Which makes it more than 700k viewers. Probably 1m
iZombie,31x1e9,wiccabilly,9,Wed Apr 8 23:02:36 2015 UTC,It's also .2 more than the Flash re-run ahead of it which means some people who did not watch the Flash came back just for iZombie.
iZombie,31x1e9,joosh82,-1,Wed Apr 8 23:19:30 2015 UTC,I guess anything can be a demographic
iZombie,31x1e9,AmantisAsoko,5,Thu Apr 9 03:37:26 2015 UTC,*flips a table*  I love iZOMBIE but this (probably) gets a renewal so fast and Constantine is still in major jeopardy? Life isn't fair.
iZombie,31x1e9,lord_allonymous,8,Wed Apr 8 22:36:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, Constantine is not nearly as good as iZombie. I hope it gets renewed because I think it has promise, but the episodes I saw at least weren't that great."
iZombie,31x1e9,AmantisAsoko,2,Thu Apr 9 02:37:12 2015 UTC,"What are you looking for in the show?  I think some of the monster of the week episodes lacked in emotional range, but overall the writing was top quality for a TV show, and the effects are mindblowing. I'm a fan of the comics, and they let him smoke!  If the trash that is Gotham got renewed, Constantine should have gotten it immediately."
iZombie,31x1e9,Kuze421,2,Thu Apr 9 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Gotham is trash but of all the comic book/graphic novel shows, it is certainly the weakest in my opinion. The force fed writing, some of the kid bats/catwoman/ivy stuff is worthless drivel and some villains are laughable (penguin is a fan favorite and I hate him/his portrayal). I'm still watching in hopes that it improves, which it does incrementally."
iZombie,31x1e9,williamthebloody1880,3,Thu Apr 9 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"I gave up on Gotham because, I can't quite put my finger on what exactly, but there's something I don't particularly like about it.  It's not the lack of Batman, cos I understood that going in.  The scripts are fine, so's the acting.  There's just something missing"
iZombie,31x1e9,Kuze421,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:28:59 2015 UTC,Is it Lucious Fox? Just kidding...I certainly understand your trepidation about the show without knowing exactly what it is that irks you.

iZombie,31x1e9,Bonolio,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I liked all the elements if Gotham and still stopped watching."
iZombie,31x1e9,MikeyHatesLife,-1,Mon Apr 20 13:03:19 2015 UTC,"I can support Gotham more than I can support Arrow, which I see only as a tonal and stylistic ripoff of Nolan's Bat trilogy, designed for people who can't get enough of the Dark Knight. I am quite aware that the Arrow writers really admired the movies, and take inspiration from it, but just like 1990 Flash, they seem to have just poured a can of paint over the current Batman movie and called it new: red for Shipp Flash and green for Ollie, who, apart from his hair, is indistinguishable from Bruce.  Gotham sort of works when you keep thinking ""elseworlds, elseworlds, elseworlds"" &/or ""Multiversity!"". Gotham works best, oddly, when Bruce and his contemporaries aren't around. (And looking at the technology and the clothing styles, one could almost think it's the late 1990s: typewriters, hipsters in fedoras, etc. Which gives me some hope that it might still be connectable to Arrow/Flash/Titans/Supergirl,  because it's a flashback to modern events.)  As for iZombie, I'm very happy with it, however much Veronica Mars meets Buffy Summers it is. And there's no reason it couldn't be folded into the continuity of the other shows (along with Constantine, who has already snuck in DCU stalwarts like Dr. Fate, Psycho Pirate, Spectre, Faust, and others). At least it takes place in the Pacific Northwest, unlike Arrow, which showed Starling on the east coast when Felicity was tracking down a phone number or hacker."
iZombie,31x1e9,AfricazMost,10,Thu Apr 9 17:14:11 2015 UTC,One is on a small cable channel while the other is on a major network. There is a massive difference.
iZombie,31x1e9,ItSaidMakeAUsername,8,Wed Apr 8 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"Well, NBC shoved Constantine into a death slot right off the back. It was pulling decent Friday night numbers, but only adequate numbers generally.  Then they blamed ""well maybe there's too many comic book shows"".  God, NBC is run by morons."
iZombie,31x1e9,disneywizard,7,Thu Apr 9 04:02:01 2015 UTC,They also rejected the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt which killed it on Netflix and cancelled Go On when it was pulling amazing reviews and slithgtly above decent ratings.
iZombie,31x1e9,AmantisAsoko,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:56:41 2015 UTC,NBC is a small cable channel where you are?  Interesting.
iZombie,31x1e9,ShannonMS81,6,Wed Apr 8 23:12:01 2015 UTC,CW is the small network...
iZombie,31x1e9,AmantisAsoko,0,Thu Apr 9 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"CW is a merger between WB (you know, the Warner Brothers) and CBS. Neither of which were small networks by any stretch of the mind on their own. And to my knowledge, neither of which have ever been considered cable channels."
iZombie,31x1e9,naryn,8,Thu Apr 9 02:06:30 2015 UTC,"Small compared to nbc, if izombie was getting the same numbers on nbc it's future would be in trouble too"
iZombie,31x1e9,prettycureXD,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:27:43 2015 UTC,But NBC has larger audience and better affiliates so chances are it can get bigger audience than Constantine plus it has a procedural aspect like Grimm. Grimm had no comic following and was even mocked before it premiered yet was able to get more seasons ordered and better ratings. A series with an unlikeable lead is usually better suited for a cable network.
iZombie,31x1e9,ShannonMS81,5,Fri Apr 10 07:53:53 2015 UTC,"Listen I have no horse in this race but between the two networks the guy you replied to mentioned CW clearly has smaller performance numbers compared to what NBC would and it was the network he was calling ""small"".   The rather obvious point he was trying to make is that CW and NBC have different standards when it comes to viewership numbers. NBC expects much bigger numbers. That's all the guy was trying to say and I'm not sure why you couldn't understand what he meant as it was stated pretty plainly."
iZombie,31x1e9,Weklim,2,Thu Apr 9 02:40:33 2015 UTC,His main point remains but the CW is not a small cable network. It is a broadcast network. There is a massive difference.
iZombie,31x1e9,AmantisAsoko,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:36:01 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware CW was so much smaller than NBC.  All my life I've known CBS, NBC, and ABC as the ""big three"", and I figured the addition of The WB would at least put CBS at the level of NBC if not over it."
iZombie,31x1e9,ShannonMS81,3,Thu Apr 9 02:43:29 2015 UTC,The CW is owned by those two but it was created by merging two failing networks WB and UPN as such their metric for success is much lower than other stations.
iZombie,31x1e9,ChrisG592,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:10:18 2015 UTC,I didn't realize the WB was failing at the time. I libre UPN was having trouble though. They lost a lot of shows.
iZombie,31x1e9,MikeyHatesLife,2,Thu Apr 9 04:53:43 2015 UTC,"Correction: CW was a merger of UPN and WB programming, of which those were owned by CBS, Warners, and United-Paramount.  Just be happy we no longer have to hear ""You be UP'n!"""
iZombie,31x1e9,frostywit,-2,Thu Apr 9 17:18:59 2015 UTC,Plus they appeal to different demographics: people who like good television... and fans of Constantine.

iZombie,31y7bq,Forward_Delusions,3,Thu Apr 9 09:40:18 2015 UTC,Yeah the show seems pretty good at making big points obvious. The shoes for example are clearly going to play a part in the story and the way that every time Liv is shown eating brains they have a shot of her heaping on the hot sauce as well as the double jalepeno gag at the end makes me definitely think there's something to it.
iZombie,31y7bq,AMeowingCat,2,Fri Apr 10 14:16:47 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that too. It may be that while Liv has access to dead bodies, she only has access to a select few and, to do cases, she has to restrict herself to one brain until the case is solved.   But Blaine has an abundance of brains around him and the variety and consumption of them may allow him to retain even more human characteristics then Liv."
iZombie,31y7bq,disneywizard,5,Thu Apr 9 15:50:50 2015 UTC,Maybe the dishes are simply made with zombie taste buds in mind.

iZombie,31upgz,WarmakerT,2,Wed Apr 8 20:13:32 2015 UTC,Blaine will probably track him down since he saw the text message on Jerome's phone and replied to it. This is where I suspect Blaine's machinations will conflict with Liv as he's placing someone she cares about in danger.

iZombie,31te9n,TerrytheMerry,24,Wed Apr 8 03:38:14 2015 UTC,Blaine seemed aware of the visions liv was having when he was at the morgue when she had one in front of him.   It also seems like the visions need to be triggered by some sort of stimulus imagery from within the memory.  Lib gets them frequently because she is investigating the murders.  A client buying blaines brains may immediately get an initial vision and then nothing after that without any kind of imagery related to the victims life
iZombie,31te9n,NCFishGuy,12,Wed Apr 8 13:20:22 2015 UTC,I believe Blaine said something about having visions too in the second episode when Ravi was examining him.
iZombie,31te9n,TheAmazingSpiderLin,14,Wed Apr 8 05:35:30 2015 UTC,He seemed to immediately understand what happened when she had that flash of memory. And he didn't question her (at all) about what she meant when she said she ate a guy's brains and then saw him attacking said guy.

iZombie,31te9n,7th-New-Account,4,Wed Apr 8 06:19:39 2015 UTC,"the ""paranoia"" effects were kind of lame this go around. I can see how they'd run out original stuff eventually.   The whole thing with Major should be pretty much written out of the show IMO. maybe he pops in from time to time in conjunction with missing kids but the love angle is already old.   not to mention the whole Blaine industry thing.   it's a shame though because there's a lot of really witty writing scattered throughout."
iZombie,31te9n,SomeRandomJoe81,11,Thu Apr 9 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"This episode was good. The best parts of this episode were the character interactions. Liv and her brother, Major and Ravi, Blaine's muscle thugs were hilarious.   Liv's visions were obviously going to reveal Clive was working undercover, I don't get why she immediately concluded he was a dirty cop. So I'm going to guess that one of the personality traits she acquired was paranoia.  I can't figure out what Blaine is planning. To me it seems like he's using his pre-zombie drug dealing talents to create a monopoly on brains, and become massively wealthy. I think things will get out of hand, and more people will be turned into zombies, maybe a city wide outbreak."

iZombie,31te9n,JBB1986,2,Thu Apr 9 06:07:18 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this episode but I have some problems with it.  First of all, none of us bought that Clive could be a dirty cop, so that was bad plot and writing, but whatever, it didn't bother me that much in the end...  However, I cringed so hard when she got up after falling and said ""I know kung fu"". I get it that it's a Matrix reference and I love that, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't handled very well. Nobody would do that in the middle of the street and it gets even worse when she keeps showing off even after she gets up.  Also, in this occasion having the knowledge and the technique of kung fu, won't necessarily make you good at fighting. Muscles play a very big role in fighting. Not only would her muscles lack the ""muscle memory"" that is created with practising, her muscles would also be weak, making her knowledge and technique mostly useless. She would still be able to fight a lot better, but nowhere near what was shown in the fight scene. The only reason this works in The Matrix is that that world is virtual, not actual reality...  And that's not the only problem I have with that fight scene. It felt very fake and weak. Definetely did not buy that they were actually fighting.   With that out of the way, I really liked the screentime we got with Ravi. He's my favorite character so far and I love seeing his interactions with Liv and Liv's ex-fiance.  Also, compared to the brain Liv got last week, this was way better. It wasn't anything mind-blowing, but at least they didn't screw it up. I really disliked episode 3. Anyway, what other kinds of brains and personalities would you like to see Liv assume in the future?  I really like the sexual themes(?) in this show and how humorous they are. I really liked this weeks scene at the porn room, with the whorey memento line and Liv teasing Ravi about his ""privacy"" time. This is even better portrayed in the 2nd episode, where Liv gets that artist's brain and becomes a bit more erotic and aesthetic. Her checking out and flirting with that model (or whatever she was I can't remember, it was the woman that artist was banging) was hilarious.  I still haven't decided if I like the whole Blaine plot and his character. For some reason he feels very generic and unoriginal. I didn't get this feeling from this week's episode though, but from the previous ones. Maybe it won't turn out to be this way.

It made sense to me in the moment, but now I too am wondering how she came to that conclusion.  I mean, there are eating disorders that make you crave things that are not food.  Ooh! I know! The smell! Maybe her ability to smell brains is super-heightened! Like, she can smell your brains, through your skull, like a hundred yards away."
iZombie,31r7x7,FactorySquirrel,4,Wed Apr 8 00:02:01 2015 UTC,"I'd like to know as well. Do you just naturally gravitate towards brains once you turn? I feel like it would take you a while to figure out what's happening. Considering how awful Liv feels about Marcy, I don't think she would have killed anyone before this for their brains though. She would have been carrying a lit more guilt, no?"

iZombie,31r7x7,my-other-account-is,5,Wed Apr 8 07:01:14 2015 UTC,"yeah, it was heavily implied. However Blaine could have bitten/scratched her during sex. And also Liv doesn't know about that."

iZombie,31i9t0,prettycureXD,12,Sun Apr 5 09:43:53 2015 UTC,"The Flash has a preexisting fan base much larger than most because of it's popular comic history, plus it was a spin-off from an already popular show. That's not something that can be replicated just be changing the genre of iZombie.   Additionally, you can't just turn this into a superhero show without changing a lot about it, and not every show can be or should be a superhero show (I say this as a huge fan of superhero shows)"
iZombie,31i9t0,drock45,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:02:03 2015 UTC,I do like the show even its procedural aspect. I'm just bummed that it couldn't pull at least 1.0 in demo ratings. Did you know that The CW paid an ad for this show on The Walking Dead? And that viewers of that show mocked this show. Maybe if they went with a darker tone they could've pulled some viewers of that show.
iZombie,31i9t0,drock45,5,Sun Apr 5 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"Its a fun show, it doesn't need to be dark to be entertaining. Marketing just needs to let people know about it, and comparing it to the Walking Dead is just bad marketing"
iZombie,31i9t0,platypus_bear,0,Sun Apr 5 16:45:29 2015 UTC,I'm not comparing it to The Walking Dead. What I'm saying is that ad must have cost a lot since that show can pull 7.0 demo ratings. They wasted money with little return cause it was only able to get 0.8 ratings. That money could been used on the Flash or even Arrow.
iZombie,31i9t0,Myoptical,3,Sun Apr 5 16:53:01 2015 UTC,Arrow got 0.8 ratings the same week.  0.8 is actually pretty good for CW...
iZombie,31i9t0,alienhybrid,0,Tue Apr 7 06:15:40 2015 UTC,Arrow is on its 3rd season though and it premiered with 1.3 during season 1 plus it can plug its falling ratings with a Flash crossover. I just hope it can keep its rating till season finale. This week will be a test if it can stand on its own since it wont get Flash lead-in.
iZombie,31i9t0,naryn,1 point,Tue Apr 7 06:58:22 2015 UTC,"Its new, very new. Both the Arrow and the Flash have a large fan base. Far larger than the iZombie comic fanbase. It is effectively a new IP and they have to work hard to market it as not another generic zombie tv show #undeadveronicamars."

She definitely shouldn't have lost her freckles if she was just indoors a lot."
iZombie,31bcn5,WyrtWicce,-1,Tue Apr 28 21:48:50 2015 UTC,We're most likely just supposed to assume that's a symptom of her being dead. Maybe because she's not producing melanin anymore?
iZombie,31bcn5,kristina_the_gamer,18,Fri Apr 3 15:27:24 2015 UTC,well...yeah...but how does she explain it to everyone else?
iZombie,31bcn5,SomeRandomJoe81,11,Fri Apr 3 15:39:31 2015 UTC,They made a comment about her being pale and they seemed to write it off as staying inside all the time now while she didn't before.
iZombie,31bcn5,twistedfork,5,Fri Apr 3 15:46:20 2015 UTC,"Wait, is that even possible? Like if you just stay inside all the time, you get THAT abnormally pale?

iZombie,318ama,shootsome,10,Thu Apr 2 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"For sure! Well, I think Arrow has been lacking this season. But, The Flash is so phenomenal, it almost makes up for it."
iZombie,318ama,SgtFluffyButt,6,Thu Apr 2 23:56:09 2015 UTC,I saw a few people mention the flash. I looked up on imdb and the main character is in both the arrow and flash. Do you need to watch the arrow to know some bits about the flash?
iZombie,318ama,suss2it,9,Fri Apr 3 00:19:15 2015 UTC,"Nah, not really. Barry is introduced in season 2 of Arrow and is in around 3 episodes. However The Flash pilot covers who he is and establishes the world around him you really don't need to watch the Arrow episodes to understand it.  As for the crossover they had. It wasn't really like a part 1, then part 2 crossover, it was more like Arrow shows up in Flash's city for an episode and then Flash shows up in Arrow's city. Each episode had its own independent villain and plot line, so yeah you should be able to watch Flash and not Arrow and not get confused."
iZombie,318ama,Theniallmc,3,Fri Apr 3 00:48:40 2015 UTC,"Well, in the Flash there is a 2 part crossover with Arrow (one part on Flash, the second part on Arrow) so that could confuse you. Arrow is a good show too, but Flash is just.... Wow. Best thing ever"
iZombie,318ama,samsaBEAR,2,Fri Apr 3 00:42:51 2015 UTC,"I'd give Arrow a go anyway to be honest, while this season hasn't been as good, the first two were really solid. Like others have said, they crossover every now and then so I think you'd enjoy it way more if you know everyone that's involved. All that said, Flash is definitely good enough to stand alone!"
iZombie,318ama,PhoOhThree,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:18:40 2015 UTC,You will need to watch Arrow in the future for sure if you don't want to miss any details.  The shows are in the same universe so they will have crossovers regularly and also they are making a spinoff show from characters from both shows.  So watch both : )
iZombie,318ama,shootsome,2,Fri Apr 3 18:03:27 2015 UTC,Personally I think this is a solid point in the season. They could have done a few things better but it is still going strong.
iZombie,318ama,JBB1986,3,Fri Apr 3 01:17:51 2015 UTC,"I think the latest episode was pretty good. But mainly(to me, at least), this season has been about everyone yelling at/blaming Oliver, Felicity crying, and treating Roy like crap."
iZombie,318ama,naryn,2,Fri Apr 3 02:18:05 2015 UTC,"I....I actually kind of agree with that. In particular the blaming Oliver bit. Seriously, he's pretty much the only one with a brain 90% of the time (expect for Roy, surprisingly enough) and he just gets yelled at for no reason.  And Felicity.....dear god, woman, not everything is about your not-a-relationship-at-all with Oliver!"

iZombie,30zsnw,realgamer890,19,Wed Apr 1 01:52:10 2015 UTC,I agree with this theory. He definitely seems to be more focused on profits and whatever consequence is pointless to him.

iZombie,30zsnw,Canadian_in_Canada,3,Wed Apr 1 01:18:54 2015 UTC,Here are the questions:   Is there a critical point at which a zombie needs brains before their intellect is not longer recoverable?   Could Liv still reach that point of she doesn't feed regularly?   Could Marcy have been recoverable if she'd been feed regularly for a period of time?
iZombie,30zsnw,pimpwaldo,9,Wed Apr 1 19:11:17 2015 UTC,Liv said it herself if she doesn't eat brains her mind start to go in the first episode.
iZombie,30zsnw,Canadian_in_Canada,5,Wed Apr 1 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"Right, but the question is, is there a point of no return? Was Marcy recoverable, and would Live become unrecoverable without feeding. We know she'd decline without feeding, as she stated in the first episode, but we don't know how far she'd go, or whether or not she could come back once she feeds again."
iZombie,30zsnw,violue,4,Wed Apr 1 20:49:38 2015 UTC,"Some zombies turned feral immediately that night. She might have been one of them. If Marcy didn't turn immediate, her being trapped would explain her condition.   Liv was scratched and her change was less dramatic. Same with the woman who had sex with Blaine.   It would suggest the people who took the drug turned immediately. Contact with body fluids, bites, and scratches don't turn people as fast.   Wasn't Blaine the one who scratched Liv? He also turned immediately. He also took the drug."

Liv has been basically wasting her life the last 6 months, doing nothing, quitting her dream job, breaking up with her dream fiance etc   To Peyton the only thing that motivated Liv was proving Peyton wrong, and screwing her over in the process. Then when she confronts Liv she's nonchalant and doesn't even apologise for looking at confidential files. It's not really about right it wrong in her mind but the changes in Liv from what she knew, and the only thing that seems to have motivated her since the boat party was screwing her friend over"
iZombie,30zsnw,naryn,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:05:23 2015 UTC,"kinda, but from our perspective its pretty clear that her case is sloppy and circumstantial, and the suspect's guilt is not much of a concern to peyton.

The idea that liv isn't screwing over her friend but rather attempting to serve justice does't occur to peyton, nor does she seem to feel she has any duty to pursue the truth, her only reaction is to scold her friend for exposing how shoddy the search for a perpetrator was."
iZombie,30zsnw,Antivote,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think the case was that sloppy, the hobo was wearing his shoes and had his wallet. He confessed to robbing a dead body, but it's always better to confess to a minor crime if accused of a major one.  Serial killers are also probably quite good at hiding their tracks, note that they never found evidence barring the glock (that they'd have never found without Liv's visions). They were also probably under pressure to wrap the case up, as it was high profile."

Thats a pretty expensive piece of hardware for a homeless man, you can emulate the trick with a potatoe, but then you'd likely get unexplained potato bits.  point being there was plenty fishy about the case before liv stuck her nose in it, that her roomate hadn't dug deep enough to expose these flaws herself males her lazy, and a lazy prosecutor will ruin innocent lives."

Okay, they tossed whats-her-face brains and she was still shambling around next time they visited. But let's face it - a human non-zombie trapped in those conditions for months would be pretty incoherent as well. And how do they know that the cure wasn't simply ""more brains, and some mental stimulation""? They just gave up on her. Didn't even bring her more brains before offing her. Also, dude - don't crouch on the edge of a pit! FFS, lie down and lean just your arm over. You'll be more stable. (And she would have cooperated better if they'd tossed her a brain first.)

The importance of trivia to the plot is that it gave Liv and Clive the photographic evidence that he'd been at the bar that night.  It was Liv's personality that had her sharing the trivia, by the way. I'll wager he'd have thought these things, but not necessarily have spouted them as they crossed his mind. With her being new to this thought process, she's behaving differently than he would, similarly to the way she could recognise the difference when she knew she should be feeling sorry for the things she'd been saying to her roommate, or the way she should be responding to the video of Major, but couldn't."

Her zombiefication feels like a proxy of how my HFA works. How she thinks well-spoken and on point, but barely say five words. How she shut down when things get intense. The way she moves her body and tilt her head. The mani-period during her painting session.. Her ""hulking out"". Just a bunch of small things that makes me happy. Haven't really been relating this much to a character for some time.  And in this episode, the sociopath tendency really worked for me as well. I get like that from time to time when I get a lot much input. Completely numb.  And the factoids didn't bother me at all. I'm currently- uh. I just realized what you wrote and noticed that what I have been typing hasn't had anything really to do with what you ment.  But yeah, a lot of people seam to think people with autism don't feel at all or don't care. But that simply isn't true. I for example care a bit tooo much and feel tooo much.

iZombie,30jxve,rustedmachines,9,Sat Mar 28 04:11:41 2015 UTC,"The quantity of viewers is the useless value in ratings. What you need to look at is the 18-49 rating, which was 0.7 this week and 0.8 for the premiere, which is about expected for a second episode.  The CW's scripted average for 2015 has been 0.6 so anything from there up gives the show a chance at renewal. However most of the CW's schedule next season has already been spoken for with most shows returning. In addition WBTV is over-represented on the network so a couple of pilots from CBS Television Studios will likely take priority treatment when putting the 15-16 schedule together.   So realistically the show needs to build its audience pretty quickly."

I mean, turning a woman into a zombie that requires brains (not exactly a common commodity) to continue functioning as a semi-normal freak and then charging her exorbitant sums to keep her supplied? It takes drug dependence to a whole new level! Genius.....though, again, horrifying......  Brother knows how to capitalise on his zombie nature, which is something you don't generally see in these kinds of shows. Most of the time, they just struggle to live with whatever ""curse"" they've been unlucky enough to get landed with (like Liv) rather than finding the ways it can help better their own lives.

I don't have time for them all xD  When I heard about Arrow I hadn't much of expectation since it was a serie based on the comics and so as usual they probably would mess up everything, but then after the series started people talk about how great it was/is, however since it had already for a bunch of episodes I never jumped in the ""boat"", but it open the doors to the next DC TV series because I was like: ""I'm not gonna miss the boat again!""   iZombie is becoming more than your typical zombie show   yes, indeed. At this point I think every character has their own specific role and everyone could affect the course of the story. For e.g, I wasn't quiet enjoyed by the whole ex-fiancé thing, it seemed like the typical ""She's cute/sexy so she has to have a boyfriend or at least a ex-fiancé trying to revive their love, RIGHT?!"" but on other hand it's actually a good addition to the plot."

I know that they don't interact in the comics but they're not following the comics at 100% (for e.g. her name isn't Liv Moore in the comics)  For example Deadman could appear in a episode where there was a double homicide and he was one the victims and helps Liv to find out who was the killer.

If we're following the Veronica Mars parallels, he's a perfect clone of Duncan which means he gets shipped off as soon as he's no longer useful as a plot device and tool for Liv's character development.

Ghosts are thus bodiless oversouls; poltergeists, bodiless undersouls; vampires bodies without undersouls (thirsting for emotions); and zombies, bodies without oversouls. Revenants, like Gwen, are unique in that they possess both oversouls and undersouls. Souls can also ""infect"" the living, which accounts for the possessed and werewolves and the like.

iZombie,302ajm,autowikibot,3,Tue Mar 24 05:56:19 2015 UTC,"IZOMBIE:       iZOMBIE  is a comic book series created by writer Chris Roberson and Michael Allred, published by DC Comics's Vertigo imprint beginning in 2010. The series deals with Gwen Dylan (née Gwendolyn Price), a revenant gravedigger in Eugene, Oregon and her friends Ellie, a 1960s ghost, and Scott, a were-terrier. iZOMBIE was nominated for the 2011 Eisner Award for Best New Series.   Gwen can pass for a regular girl, but she needs to eat a brain once a month to keep from losing her memories and intelligence. As a gravedigger she has plenty of access to recently deceased people; when she consumes their brains she ""inherits"" part of the deceased's thoughts.  The ""monsters"" in iZOMBIE are explained via the concepts of over- and undersoul. The oversoul (as in Ralph Waldo Emerson's ""The Over-Soul"") is ""seated in the brain, contains the thoughts, memories, and personality"",  while the undersoul (as in Michael McClure's poem ""Dark Brown"") is ""seated in the heart, contains the appetites, emotions and fears"".  Ghosts are thus bodiless oversouls; poltergeists, bodiless undersouls; vampires bodies without undersouls (thirsting for emotions); and zombies, bodies without oversouls. Revenants, like Gwen, are unique in that they possess both oversouls and undersouls. Souls can also ""infect"" the living, which accounts for the possessed and werewolves and the like.  The characters of iZombie first appeared in a short story in the first House of Mystery Halloween Annual (2009). An iZOMBIE story was also included in the second House of Mystery Halloween Annual (2010).

I prefer no commercial breaks at all, but I'm poor so I usually have to hulu shows (although I did get the season pass on iTunes for this show).  Sometimes when I watch a show on Netflix and there is a weird transition where you know there was supposed to be a commercial, I kind of wish there was a commercial. But don't tell Netflix."

iZombie,2zznr4,Mini-Marine,3,Mon Mar 23 14:31:58 2015 UTC,The caption says it's from Dying Light. It doesn't have to be featured to be product placement. Just depends on the agreement. A lot of product placement is used as dressing in the bg. It's easier for art that way they don't have to greek out as many brands or use as much budget.
iZombie,2zznr4,radiantwhenlying,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:59:02 2015 UTC,"When I think product placement I think something more obvious, like if the only beer you see characters drinking Coors, or smoking Camels, or driving Fords.  If it only mentions what it is in the captions, that's something different, they needed a zombie game and instead of trying to create something just for that one scene, they just used something readily available."
iZombie,2zznr4,Mini-Marine,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:50:08 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of range of product placement, from in your face to very subtle. I work as an art director and have to do a lot of coordinating with product placement."

Now on probation for a felony, it seems that Angel will never pull herself out of the downward spiral her life has taken.  That is, until the day she wakes up in the ER after overdosing on painkillers. Angel remembers being in an horrible car crash, but she doesn't have a mark on her. To add to the weirdness, she receives an anonymous letter telling her there's a job waiting for her at the parish morgue--and that it's an offer she doesn't dare refuse.  Before she knows it she's dealing with a huge crush on a certain hunky deputy and a brand new addiction: an overpowering craving for brains. Plus, her morgue is filling up with the victims of a serial killer who decapitates his prey--just when she's hungriest!  Angel's going to have to grow up fast if she wants to keep this job and stay in one piece. Because if she doesn't, she's dead meat."

The main character has the ability to absorb memories through the brains she eats like in the comics but that pretty much the only thing the show and the comic have in common.  The show took the idea of working in a morgue and solving crimes from White Trash Zombie."

There's still no real origin story, and I liked that - it just allowed things to jump right into the story.  There's no coroner storyline whatsoever.  She has a group of friends that are all monster-based:  Ghost, Werewolf, Mummy, and there's a major subplot of vampires.  So, much more Buffy than the new iZombie TV show.  If you've seen the pilot of the show, you may not like the comic.  If you want a great and fun read, that comics are fantastic.  You just have to realize that they are vastly different in every way.  I look forward very much to reading the other 3 GNs."

So it didn't influence my like of the show.  Mostly during the show I was thinking to myself how similar this show is to Forever(supernatural guy is a medical examiner), but this show does the concept so much better. It just had the right balance of mystery story, background, humor, personal life drama, supernatural, etc etc to it. I hope they can keep up the balance of it all."

They both possess a type of ""fall from grace,"" causing them to descend into their respective societal positions. Though of course the mechanisms by which they enter them are notably different, their separation from the norm allows them to excel in their newfound roles (though we just met Liv, it's apparent that she possessed talents both due to her intelligence and zombie status)."

When I saw that iZombie was being brought to TV by Rob Thomas, it gave me so much hope, despite it being on CW. I have been burnt by so many others Thing-I-Love-to-TV adaptations.  The main similarity I see is the great awareness of tropes, especially detective, zombie, police procedural and romance tropes. Rob is very good at using and subverting tropes (like Joss Whedon, but less kill-y).   And the very very good dialogue."

The comparisons are there, but they're not enough to annoy me or to make it feel like the show is relying on the same bag of tricks.

It does remind me of Veronica Mars, especially during narration sequences, but it's different enough to be more than just a pale imitation. The fact the Liv takes on personality traits of the brains she eats allows the show to continually take the character down different paths (although I'm a bit unclear whether the skills, such as knowing a foreign language, disappear with the personality or whether she gets to keep them?). After three episodes I'm hooked."
