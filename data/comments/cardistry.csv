cardistry,3e66so,Gynwaith,2,Wed Jul 22 06:57:25 2015 UTC,I have block of the New Deck Order School of Cardistry deck. I can confirm that this deck sucks for fanning or even springs. I love this deck it's really great for one or two hand cuts but they are definitely not for any type of fans.  You will need fanning prrefer to get this deck to fan properly.
cardistry,3e66so,wizardelite,2,Wed Jul 22 09:49:38 2015 UTC,"I think the decks you're using are the problem. When I started, I used any pack of cards laying around. Having started in Egypt, Bikes and other mainstream cards weren't available at shops and we're only available by this guy on Facebook who sold them at 7 times their actual price. I started,like you, thinking I was never gonna do a thumb fan to save my life. Eventually, I got some bikes and just by watching the tutorials over and over I was able to do a semi decent thumb fan. Point is : Wait for the tally's then review your performance from there because while you're using non-bikes, you're at a disadvantage to almost all cardists."
cardistry,3e66so,AliBassiouni,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:52:23 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert on fanning, but in my 5 years of cardistry/magic, I can say that the quality of the playing cards you use will definitely affect your fans. Clumpy poop decks will give you a lot of difficulty in performing a thumb fan.  Pressure fans are the more viable option in this case, though it will still be easier to perform this with newer cards.   As for dribbling and riffling, I think you might find it helpful to bevel the edges of the deck as you're doing this (assuming you're not already doing this). What I mean by this is that the deck as viewed from the side facing the long edge resembles a parallelogram as opposed to a rectangle. What this  accomplishes is that each card in the deck will have a little of its underside exposed, allowing your thumb to contact each card from the bottom. The bevel is very slight, and should adhere to the contour of your thumb in biddle grip. But realize that this move, like fans, will become more challenging with a clumpier deck.  Good luck!"
cardistry,3e66so,Styruhfoam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:14:34 2015 UTC,"^  Also getting a bottle of fanning powder can only help. It is relatively cheap and one bottle will last you for years, I've had mine for 3 years and I think there's 60% of it left and I've powdered quite a many decks."
cardistry,3e4u1k,kaspyre,3,Tue Jul 21 23:34:33 2015 UTC,No it's fine.. that's the best way to start in my opinion.. with some practice you'll be able to do it elevated or not

cardistry,3e27k2,TheCasualCardist,2,Tue Jul 21 11:42:46 2015 UTC,Loved this! This is the first video where Hip Hop style music suits the style and flourish of the moves within the video.  Very Cool!
cardistry,3e12l3,Kyle_La,2,Tue Jul 21 03:29:53 2015 UTC,I liked this. All the moves look very smooth and clean but a lot of the action is out of the frame! Closeup's can be good at times but having the whole video framed like that makes it kind of irritating to watch. Next time try zooming out a little :) Nonetheless I enjoyed the video.

The people I described are not realistic with themselves and have an inflated ego and don't understand that being a beginner is not a mark of shame.  I know of a guy who was an absolute try-hard and he was garbage, now he's actually pretty good. Perhaps it's just a phase people go through, either way I want people to have autonomy and actually care about the hobby they have chosen and hold themselves to a standard of some kind."

It's one of those things where if you see something you don't like, move on. If people decide to simplify a flourish, then fuck, let them do it.  But honestly, this post made me cringe. Cardistry is an art form no doubt, but don't forget that at its core it's just people messing around with cards. There's no reason to be elitist about it."

I've also been getting annoyed with three packet cuts recently. I feel like they're all starting to look the same. But hey, you have to start somewhere. I'm not sure how much I agree on the last one. Someone somewhere said that ""I don't need to be a cook to tell you your food sucks"", which might as well apply here. On the other hand, input is more valuable from someone with experience.

cardistry,3e0voa,joetaylr,3,Tue Jul 21 09:20:17 2015 UTC,I dont see any problem with first point at all....no flourish is set in stone and it shouldn't be....ever!  and 4th point....We dont all have the same hands some stuff feels good in my hands and wont feel good in yours thats the way it is...deal with it.  I dont think you should be judging people you are in no position to do that ever. Just because you do cardistry longer or better doesnt give you right to judge it gives you right to advice them and point them in right direction.
cardistry,3e0voa,Sansoftime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:34 2015 UTC,"Not sure where I said a flourish is set in stone, I'm quite sure I said to gain an understanding of the move and what the creator had in mind before going on about your own variations.  Here's a very common example of the first point. Removing the Revolution cut from Squeeze. The beauty of Squeeze is that you have 2 layers of horizontally moving packets from when you make the square all the way to the end. when you remove the Rev it is now not as good as the original because the bottom layer doesn't move all the way to the end to give that satisfying closer.   So with this in mind if I were to create a squeeze variation, I would try to not take away from what makes the original good. One very good variation of squeeze would be squeeze a squaare by David Pedersen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en-GB&v=dOSNzcOLNuo&gl=SG  On the fourth point, while this is true, your hands and my hands are probably similar in the way they move so we can agree that some moves are for the human hand uncomfortable for you and me. I saw at one point someone saying V cuts was a comfy cardistry move, as much as I like V cuts which I do quite a lot. The strain involved is not something I would call comfortable."
cardistry,3e0voa,CardistryWolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:49 2015 UTC,"Ok good point but i think that removing some parts and adding your own is ok to a degree of course you dont want to ruin the move (for some reason people remove that one part from pandora all the time, the part where you slide one card of the tornado packet to flare it, sorry i cant explain it better).  V cuts are not comfy. id say that any move involving 3 or more packets in one hand is not comfy even some 2 packet cuts in one hand are not comfy for me like that one haneded move you need for nimbus(but i think i just need to practice that more) for example."
cardistry,3e0voa,InfectedReddit,3,Tue Jul 21 15:27:08 2015 UTC,"First of all. While I do see where you are coming from with number one, I think that anyone should be allowed to mold any move to fit them. I like what Andrei Jikh said in Genesis Vol. 1: ""There is no wrong way to do cardistry.""  Second, I agree with you on number 2, that drives me up a wall.   Third, just because someone has posted an original move doesn't mean its finished. Give the person some time and they could work it out.   Fourth, as a victim of creating contorting moves, I have to say, they might fit ones style. Different people create different things according to the way they handle cards.   Fifth, agree.   Finally, No. 6, Who are you to judge the amount of knowledge someone has about cardistry.   Overall this post really annoyed me, different people do it differently, and there is not a wrong way to do cardistry"

cardistry,3e0voa,Devin1026,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:24:34 2015 UTC,"First of all i would like to add to #3 about how i also notice in so many videos when people try so bad to get away with not giving credit when its due. It bothers me a lot and this is even something Chris hestnes mentioned in his whoshuffleslikethat article (8th paragraph). Like if you take a motion or closer from someone it wont kill you to type their name in the description. Another thing which is the only thing i disagree with is you talking about this try hard stuff as its a trait or characteristic of certain people, instead of a beginner phase, which it really is. ( Not saying thats exactly what you meant i have no idea whats in your heart that's just what i got from reading this) Now not ALL beginners go through this, for example in my first few months of cardistry i wouldn't blame tutorials for being too hard I would just come back to it later knowing it will be easier the next time i do. Im just saying everyone guilty of these things sooner or later will grow out of it. Overall I (And hopefully WE) appreciate you sharing your opinion, since it should always be okay for us to say what we need to when needed. (Btw, whats a community if we cant share whats on our mind?)."
cardistry,3dym9a,Gynwaith,3,Mon Jul 20 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"This cut builds into the Hot shot cut by Daryl Easton (or Martinez at one point). I would go with SoC's version of the two, which you already seem to prefer. But just to offer an alternative, here's my attempt at describing Daryl's original hot shot cut which moves the packets pretty much identically to the knuckle cut.  Drop the packet like a charlier, with your pinky and index finger straddling the bottom packet, bring your index finger to your thumb so that the index finger is touching the long edge of the deck closer to you while your middle finger is on the long edge away from you. Release the upper packet with your thumb and have your thumb duck under the packet gripped between the index finger and middle finger. You will then curl in your middle finger and extend your index finger in which will bring the packet over the thumb and perpendicular to the bottom packet, then grip the upper packet with your thumb and release your index finger so the upper packet is held between the thumb and index finger. Bring that packet to the bottom executing a scissor-like cut and use your index finger to pull out the hot shot card.   Of course, since it achieves the same result, you should do what is most comfortable to you. I just prefer Daryl's original hot shot cut since it doesn't require a readjustment of the fingers before you execute the cut after experimenting with other methods.  Source: Volume 8 of the Encyclopedia of Playing Card Sleights. Here's a video of him performing it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOzqzaS2HOA"
cardistry,3dym9a,TheCasualCardist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:44 2015 UTC,"It was the SoC one that I didn't like. Trying to cut it with your middle finger instead of your thumb is what I think is awkward for me. But if it builds into other things I might as well learn it. Can't hurt to know both ways. Any tips for trying to cut it with your middle finger like in the SoC video? When it try to do it it fans out the cards some instead of making a clean break. I can still finish it from there, but its much sloppier.  Edit: So I just found a third way on 52kards lol. It's similar to the SoC one but you can cut with your thumb instead and they show how to lead into the hot shot cut from there. So I think this is the one I'll use. Thanks for the advice! :)"
cardistry,3dym9a,TheCasualCardist,2,Mon Jul 20 17:15:43 2015 UTC,Cutting with your middle finger still involves releasing pressure on the bottom half with your thumb. Both are actually identical since they just use different ways to get to the same position. Also here is a follow up video with SoC for the hot shot cut which you missed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTgs9pxzEE   The SoC method allows for a bit more flair in doing the move and slightly less faffing about with the finger positions.
cardistry,3dym9a,AliBassiouni,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah after doing the 52kards way once or twice, I realized it was the same thing as the SoC way just turned differently. That realization made it wayyy easier to do it the SoC way."

On the other hand, it might make meeting popular cardists more difficult. At the moment, it's fairly easy for anyone to call up another cardist, regardless of whom, for a meet up. Most people don't but it's certainly possible. But with an influx of new people, the higher level cardists might become reticent towards that idea. I'm not saying that's what'll happen, but it's certainly possible. And yeah, there is a part of me that feels the hipster effect."

The color correction was really on point. Though the framerate seems a bit off for me, can't put my finger on exactly why. I do have a couple things to say. When editing to the music, you should be sure that the 'beat' you're cutting on is prominent enough. Otherwise it can be offsetting. I'd suggest that before placing any video in, you go through the audio and mark the places you think there should be a cut. If there are enough, there shouldn't be an issue with placing the audio. It's a bit of a shame that every shot was so close up, a bit of diversity is always refreshing (though I assume you didn't have a cameraman, which makes things a lot more difficult). The cardistry itself was great, a real pleasure to watch. I loved the timing on the one handed cuts was. Just really great all around."

I read down to where he was measuring, and that is not how you measure really thin objects. You cannot simply measure the thickness of one card, they'll be too similar; you have to clamp the calliper on the thickness of the whole deck, divide by 52, and there's your thickness per card.  It makes an honest difference."

This will make it much easier to learn flourishes in the future as most tutorials are taught that way.   Whichever hand you choose, it is gonna take you a while to just get comfortable holding a deck. I remember Poker sized cards used to feel huge in my hand. It all takes time."
cardistry,3djvbs,onimushalord89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, i have another general question maybe you can answer, I'm noticing when i do alot of cuts and general anything, but to keep this specific my Charliers cut, the cards dont stay in the tightest stack? Does that have more to do with the cards im using? Or do you think its a grip/technique problem?"
cardistry,3djvbs,onimushalord89,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:24:45 2015 UTC,"Packet control is another aspect that just takes time to learn. With a charlier cut, some people use a straddle grip to help keep the packets straight, but with practice, it can be done from mechanics grip. It's the worst answer to hear when you're starting out, but it just takes time."
cardistry,3djvbs,wizardelite,3,Fri Jul 17 11:29:49 2015 UTC,"Perfect Practice over and over again. In the beginning I thought I would never be able to do a simple scissors cut in my non dominate hand.  Felt so awkward and tight.   Now I can do it with my eyes close.  Just keep at it and don't give up. You'll get it eventually. Also note that not every single move needs to be mastered in both hands. Once I got the Charlier Cut, Scissors Cut, and the Revolution Cut down in both hands, I pretty much focus on my dominate hand.    I'll focus on learning future moves in both hands when the flourish dictates it. Like the L-Cut."

cardistry,3dgj9r,dukebubs,5,Thu Jul 16 02:26:45 2015 UTC,"Some custom decks do have different card stock and finishes and they vary between sources and decks. With that said, you won't be able to appreciate the differences unless you have a standard. Plus, as a novice, you will ruin those cards with practice faster than you can drop them.  If you're wanting to get into it, go to your local Wal-Mart or drug store and get some bicycle decks and see if you really enjoy it.  Buying custom decks to get into cardistry would just be a waste of your money."

cardistry,3dgj9r,wizardelite,3,Thu Jul 16 15:34:04 2015 UTC,"I'm coming up on two months into my Cardistry journey.  Anytime I start a new hobby I tend to go a little overboard in the beginning.  With that being said I went down that route and bought a ton of custom decks.  Which is fine because I do want to get into collecting.  However if I could take the last month and a half back, I would have stayed with just the basics.  Different stocks and finishes between decks plays a HUGE role in how well you practice. The Monarch deck by Theory 11 is a very slick deck. It takes some getting used to and now I'm faced with not only learning a variety of flourishes but I have to learn how to deal with packet control.  In the end I go back to the basic decks.  I really love the Bee's decks and if I would have just bought a block of those in the beginning I would be just fine versus buying all of the custom decks I have now.  Establish a foundation within your Cardistry practice.  Feel free to get a few custom decks once you are established and at least have the basics mastered."
cardistry,3dgj9r,iSachman,2,Thu Jul 16 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"Practice using the classic decks; Bikes, Bees, and Tally's, they are cheaper and you won't have to worry about wrecking these decks since you can always buy them  I find thicker cards like Tally Ho's helped me improve my speed and grip when using thinner cards, most cards are the same size so no need to worry about that!  The popular custom decks usually do have different finishes, textures and what not but I try to keep mine for when recording videos so they stay slick and last a long time. Occasionally I will pull one of them out just to enjoy how nice they feel , I highly recommend the virts deck, aladdins and monarchs ( I have yet to try out fontaines)...  TL:DR buy custom decks but use them on occasion, use regular decks for practice so that you can look awesome and appreciate the qualit of the cards when using the fancier decks"
cardistry,3dgj9r,zaindenno52,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:48:19 2015 UTC,"You're very lucky if you can always buy Tally's. Here in Toronto, as far as I know, it's very hard, or maybe not possible, to find them anywhere ;_;"
cardistry,3dgj9r,onimushalord89,2,Sat Jul 18 01:36:58 2015 UTC,"A lot of people on here recommend Bikes as they are a decent cheap deck and it doesn't matter if you destroy them. This makes sense if you don't want to spend a lot of money, but Cardistry is a very cheap hobby when you compare it to any other hobby. If you don't mind spending a little money, then get yourself some nice decks. You won't regret it. I would just suggest that you buy in bulk (3-6 decks) That way if you ruin a deck it doesn't matter because you have others.   I really dislike the feel and look of Bikes, so I use nothing but custom decks. It's nice to have different back designs to choose from to fit your mood, and they last longer and handle better than Bikes. Also the I'm in love with the thin borders on some of these new decks! I find I enjoy cardistry much more when I have a beautiful deck to look at and play with, and maybe you will too."
cardistry,3dgj9r,69ing,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:17:26 2015 UTC,"Bicycle dragons are my personal favorite custom deck. They feel nice, look cool, and are available at most big name stores.  Bees are also really good for practicing cuts as they tend to hold together really well (don't plan on fanning with them if they are more than a week old, though).  All decks will be able to perform relatively equally, but the difference in back designs can help spark inspiration and help with creativity.  P.S. If you wash your hands before you use your cards, they will last longer."

Otherwise I'd order online wherever you can find a deal. One brick is enough to last you as long as you'll need and will give you a fresh deck whenever you want. I'll assume that will cost $15-$20  Next obviously you wanna learn stuff. I didn't purchase tutorials for a while and the beginner list on this subreddit was enough to get me going. Along with free youtube tutorials and slowing down some performance videos it's reasonable your first 4 or 5 months would never need a dvd.  That being said if you'd like to buy a dvd I'll list some out that people have reccomended  Genesis - Andrei Jihk  The System - Dan and Dave  The Trilogy - Dan and Dave (This one is a bit out of your price range but some individual flourish downloads are on their website and you could always buy what you like)  I don't own any of these and I don't think it's necessary that you do either. Other people will probably recommend some other dvds as well and hopefully you figure it out.  Good Luck!

Once you get used to bikes and nail down some of the beginner flourshes both in the stickied post at on the front page of this subreddit and as listed in Billy's post grab some Tally Ho's they take a little getting used to but they feel really nice in the hands (about $3.25 a deck from a shop, I got mine at the waterloo shop but that's just cause I was in the neighbourhood and saw it)... other than that it's just practice your as off and have fun!!"

Well that is all good and well but it's more than just practice.  Practice in and of itself doesn't make perfect.  Perfect Practice makes perfect and that is something that isn't really clarified within the cardistry community.  Don't focus on just the quantity of your practice sessions. Focus on the quality of the quantity of your practice sessions."

It's sort of like the padiddle where you just gotta keep playing with it until you just get  Suggestion: just take a small packet inbetween your pinky and thumb and just focus on getting it to spin don;t worry about the rest of the move until you can get that down consistently

Going fast makes you look bored (which you might be) but, also makes certain moves look alike. Try doing it twice, at VERY different speeds. See how you like that.   Just like in speaking, vary your pace to maintain attention.  I like the longer bits of 'non card stuff' in the middle. Gives a nice pace."

Two small points of hopefully constructive criticism   The same camera angle did get boring about half way through, and not all flourishes looked the best from the side. You do your revolutions kinda strange, by putting your ring finger around the top packet not pushing it under and out. I used to do them like that, but it's very hard to make them look quick or smooth going around, I had to relearn going under. It's a very small difference but makes a surprising change on how the flourish looks. Try watch how dan and dave does theirs."

Also, certain flourishes need to be viewed from a particular angle for that visual flattery. No one likes to see L-Cuts from the front dead-on, you don't get to see the action. Maybe try to put more thought into which angles your flourishes look best from. Perhaps even consider moving your body a little so we get to see a little bit of the flourish from a good angle."

cardistry,3ciraw,Chrisfiftytwo,3,Wed Jul 8 07:23:08 2015 UTC,It has improved compared to day one but is still slow and can mostly do fairly large packets. Once I try to speed up too much or try cutting smaller packets it gets sloppy.  Very much a work in progress.

cardistry,3ciraw,stanearls,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:03:04 2015 UTC,How's the Squeeze coming for you? I'm having issues with the Revolution Cut at the end of the flourish.
cardistry,3ciraw,ribbers,2,Wed Jul 8 07:07:31 2015 UTC,Pretty good. I struggled with that. It helps me to do it at the exact time you pull out the packet with your thumb. The hand distance seems to help it.
cardistry,3ciraw,stanearls,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:12:02 2015 UTC,I just figured it out.  Your comments didn't click with me at first but then I finally got it.  My left thumb was always bent which made the scissors cut and the revolution cut a challenge.  Once I straightened my thumb out I got the hand distance that you suggested and I finally have the mechanics of the move down.  Now I just need to practice on making it smooth.  Thanks for the suggestions.
cardistry,3ciraw,ribbers,2,Thu Jul 9 07:57:19 2015 UTC,No worries man! Have fun practising it. It feels so good in the hands!

The part before you join the packet with the deck, when the packet is horizontal; try extending your thumb forward, moving the packet along with it.

I did try to delve into the world of two-handed cardistry' (namely 'Acrobatic' and 'Gravity' Stack') at the beginning of the year and noticed that doing a Scissor Cut with the left was 'colorful vocabulary' painful.  I thought I slept on it funny, but the pain didn't go away for a while.  Nope!  Osteoporosis.    I get a laugh every time I see an osteoporosis medication commercial on tv that feature people twice my age smiling, riding a canoe, making a birdhouse, and laughing with their spouse!  I can't wait to do these wonderful things!  Although I'm a bit miffed that I'm a long ways away from ordering off of the senior citizens menu at Denny's.  Not supposed to have osteoporosis at my age.  I believe my appointment for it is in a month or two with the VA, so the best I can do now is take over-the-counter calcium suppliments and card-on."

cardistry,3ch1cz,TNcardistry,2,Tue Jul 7 21:10:28 2015 UTC,"Although some of the moves were well done, others need more practice. I advice you to go back to the DVDs immediately and learn them correctly to avoid having to first ""un-learn"" them, before your mistakes really stick. For example: Pandora -> Crabshack -> Molecule 3 is not performed ""correctly"" and does not look as good as the original, and probably never will unless you learn the move correctly. IMO you can't really make variations on a move unless you really understand the foundation of your variation, if you get me?    That being said, I really enjoyed the vibe of the video, with the colours and music. I miss a credits section at the end tho, where you actually credit the creators of the moves that you did not make yourself.    I don't know if this is your first cardistry video or if you have done any before. If this is your first, it's really well done and I hope you will keep practicing.   Just make sure you learn the moves correctly. Not doing so is only cheating yourself, which in the end will not benefit you or anyone else.  Cheers, take care and practice well!"

Also, if the cut has a certain feel you want the name to capture, you can browse thesaurus.

cardistry,3c7ee8,patcharis,6,Sun Jul 5 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"I think there are several main draws to cardistry on instagram. One of the largest factors being that cardistry is ""curated"". On youtube, you'd have to be discovered and have people subscribe to you, or have to whore your videos out everywhere for people to watch you. However, on instagram, all you need is #cardistry and instantly you are able to have people watch your videos through the hashtag.  In addition, instagrams 15 second, no frills approach to videos has been able to cater to our generations short attention span as well as being a good starting platform for people with no video editing software.  Does instagram have to potential to replace youtube as a quality cardistry hosting service though? That remains to be seen."

It's just a question of how frequently people want to make videos for that purpose. Fortunately, having both Instagram and YouTube as options gives people that choice to be casual uploaders, serious video makers, or something in between."
cardistry,3c7ee8,Clashtopher,5,Mon Jul 6 15:27:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of an issue of efficiency. I could make a video showcasing 12 amazing ideas, but maybe my audience only immediately retains 3-4 of them. Upon rewatching the video later on they might find some more value, but it's very easy for quality material to be overlooked. That's why I tend to make short videos, usually in the 45 second range.   With Instagram however, you're given the opportunity to showcase ideas INDIVIDUALLY. They can be treated as their own entity and receive the attention they actually warrant.  Even better, Instagram has an air of informality to it. The pressure to release a groundbreaking video is effectively mitigated by the comfort of casually sharing.   I've also found that it's way more appealing to veteran flourishers. It becomes increasingly difficult to meet the rising standard the community sets for these individuals through a single, incredible YouTube video. Instead, through Instagram, they can reaffirm their status as giants in the community by only occasionally showcasing single high quality ideas. It serves as a reminder that they are still functioning at the same or higher level of creativity that you've come to expect. It's also a casual reminder that the rest of the world and all of your inspirations still CARE about card flourishing. It's a much easier way of continually reconnecting, thereby motivating, the community. It is more EFFICIENT."
cardistry,3c7ee8,Splitlimes,3,Sun Jul 5 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"I think you make a very good point, Instagram is a lot more convenient for most people and the videos can really focus on just a couple flourishes to really showcase them.  With that being said, I fear the day that the community switches entirely over to Instagram if/when that ever happens. I enjoy the 1-2 minute long high-quality videos that people put out on Youtube even if they only put out videos every few months.  For me, Instagram seems like a good way to share ideas and Youtube can still be used a source of entertainment with the longer videos with fancy editing and filming to really show off your skills.  So, while I can see why most people have been switching to Instagram, I really hope that Youtube can also have somewhat of a community uploading quality videos every now and then.  That's just my opinion, I know some people are kind of sick of the 'show off' videos, but to be honest, I would miss them if they went away."
cardistry,3c7ee8,Splitlimes,3,Mon Jul 6 12:59:40 2015 UTC,"I understand your point, but I don't think that the convenience of Instagram will eventually overshadow or mitigate the benefits of using YouTube. The reason for that being that they are two separate tools used for two separate kinds of video.  Instagram might appear to be the more prevalent option by virtue of the fact that everyone is posting there more frequently than they are on YouTube. But like I said, this is an effect of the convenience of the platform. I don't think it will ever completely erase the need for YouTube."
cardistry,3c7ee8,MarkooJ,2,Mon Jul 6 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"Thats basically it. I'm like, sure I could make another video, but god that takes like a solid 8 hours work, fuck it I'll do it next year.  Instagram wayyyy faster.  Also glad to see you made it to /r/cardistry :)"
cardistry,3c7ee8,Clashtopher,2,Mon Jul 6 14:28:42 2015 UTC,"Your yearly viral video is an awesome example actually, I should have mentioned it haha it's like YouTube is how cardists officially ""check in"" with the community and Instagram is how we fill the spaces in between those occssional check-ins.

cardistry,3c7ee8,MarkooJ,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:30:40 2015 UTC,"Another aspect is tutorials, I don't make many cause I'm a lazy ass, but instagram tutorials have the same appeal of speed, I hope we see more of them."
cardistry,3c7ee8,thatrugbylad,3,Mon Jul 6 22:06:41 2015 UTC,for me i think the best is combination like upload move on instagram often and then put everything in one video every few months or whatever.

cardistry,3bxwh0,Ekhart1965,5,Fri Jul 3 01:45:44 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much work you plan on putting in your videos. If you just want to have videos in which you perform Cardistry, then you're set. However, if you're looking to approach Ryuji's level for example, then you're certainly on the right track. Here are some tips that may or may not be obvious: * Know the moves you want to practice for the video, rather than doing things on the go. * When you go through your footage, name each file things like (spin doctor ++, flicker-, etc…). It sounds obvious but seriously a time saver. * Pick the song before making the video, so that when you shoot it you have an idea of what you plan on doing from an editing point of view. * Look into color correction and grading. It's not clear whether you've done it here, but regardless it's such an important tool. I would say that the most difficult part is to match the shots with different lighting conditions, so be wary of that. * If you edit to a beat, don't do it roughly by ear, rather look for the audio level (no idea where that may be on Sony Vegas). And choose your beat wisely, some aren't as obvious for the viewer and can be awkward to edit to. * Find were your shot stabilizer is on Sony Vegas (the Final Cut Pro equivalent is SmoothCam) to get rid of camera shaking. To anticipate using this sort of software, give yourself some space around the frame (i.e. shoot from further away). That's all I can think of off the top of my head.

cardistry,3btg0h,ehw_,3,Thu Jul 2 00:27:16 2015 UTC,"Nice work! I will say this: be careful as to which beat you edit to. This song has many different but recognizable beats. It's tempting to just make a cut where a beat happens, but if you condition the viewer to expect an edit on a certain type of beat, then it feels off when you decide to keep a shot for longer. It makes editing a lot trickier, but it's worth thinking about. It's a bit tricky to understand, here's an example. You condition an edit on the 'gunshot', which doesn't always deliver in that sequence. It's fine if the beat goes out and comes back, but in the middle of its sequence it's offsetting. Depending on your editor, there may be an audio bar that shows you the audio level. Base your edits on that rather than your ear. Here a couple of the edits weren't quite on point. Oh wait, this is a cardistry subforum. The cuts were great! Really nice flow. You can consider playing with cuts going fast and slow, rather than just slow. It's unfortunate that they weren't highlighted, but that's for a more serious video."

cardistry,3btmkt,willecho,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:24:32 2015 UTC,"This is a great opener, I like it. My thoughts: Slide the card in the back with you thumb not the packet and twirl the front card up your fingers (between index and middle finger) until it basically lines up with the pack. Be sure to still be holding the pack with your top hand (that will twirl) so you can do both actions at once. Do refrain from doing any additional cuts or flicker, keep it self contained."
cardistry,3bqihu,Alessiolo,6,Wed Jul 1 09:39:12 2015 UTC,"Wooo! That was fun, I can tell you poured a lot of work into this and I can really appreciate that. As usual I have a couple of notes but honestly this was great. A lot more production value than what you usually see. At first the intro's length bothered me, but I realize that the song limited you a bit. Electronic songs are usually annoying on that front. Depending on the song though, there may be nothing wrong with starting later in the intro, or right after the intro. I'm not sure if you did this actually, I don't really know the song. Some of the shots might have been too unstable for my taste. In particular, the shot at the beginning in the garage. I know it's really tough to do smoothly but there are some things you can do. You can anticipate using a stabilization software by shooting further away (leaving some space on the side of the frame). For that kind of shot, you can also get something like a skateboard to avoid walking. The first shot after the 'drop' was beautiful, props on that. The edit in which you move the camera forward and back with the spring (0:48) was amazing as well, spotless. A minor issue is that I noticed that some of your footage is a bit grainy. Obviously the lighting conditions weren't great (which can be solved with artificial lighting, but that's a major step up). There is some software out there that does a great job at removing the grain. Again, not a huge issue but worth looking into. In terms of color correction, you did a great job. It certainly didn't feel like you slapped the footage straight into the video. To really nitpick, I still have a couple of things to say. In some shots, I think you crunched the blacks a bit too hard (not my terminology), to the point where you loose visual information. I'm not talking about the parts where he is in front of the light (an artistic decision), but like the first shot after the song's drop (0:35). In my latest video, I got the darker feel by also pushing making the darks and mids bluer, and compensating with the miss/lights with red or yellow. It gives a stylized look without loosing you much visual information. Also some of the color correction between shots was a little off, but I would say that's the hardest part of the whole deal. As for the Cardistry itself, well it might have been a bit underwhelming for the quality of the video. I figured it's not you, but I thought I should mention it. It's good to have a list of the moves you'll do for a video beforehand; the filming becomes a lot smoother as a result. So yeah, I loved it. I want to see more from you!    Oh and I think the song was in another Cardistry video, anyone know which one I'm thinking of?"
cardistry,3bqihu,MattBeaudouin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:09:31 2015 UTC,"I actually cut 30 seconds of intro ahah. Thanks for the feedback! The grain vai a film grain added in post, guess it's my style, I used a steadycam but I'm not near good yet!"
cardistry,3bqihu,MattBeaudouin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:22:52 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it that makes sense, given the audio fade in. I never thought of intentionally adding grain in post. What about making it less subtle then? Steadycams are more to get rid of small movements (hand shaking), which are a lot worse than larger motions. I would still advocate to use a skateboard for walking shots."

I think that something like this is necessary in the cardistry community so I would say go for it."
cardistry,3boz88,ehw_,5,Tue Jun 30 23:43:06 2015 UTC,"There are currently more than 700 Pokémon, which I think outnumbers the number of flourishes in existence by quite a bit.  For each Pokémon, there are several defining features: its name, the moves it can do, its specialty and weaknesses, and of course, the way it looks. There's a shit-ton of these, and you'd have to be a total Pokémon nerd to remember all of them.  However, there's a much simpler classification system, and that's Pokémon types. Right now there's only 18 types, and these are a much quicker way to quickly give you an idea of what a Pokémon might be like.  So with that analogy in mind, I think that at its core, there are only so many types of moves:   Cuts Fans/spreads Displays Aerials Cascades Twirls Shuffles/weaves Isolations   And that things like whether a move is one- or two-handed, style, etc, is just a matter of tagging as opposed to categorization.   Like /u/AliBassiouni, there's no need to overcomplicate things. Keep it simple, yo."

cardistry,3boz88,AliBassiouni,4,Wed Jul 1 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"The question comes down to this: 'What is the point of categorizing Cardistry?' Firstly it's an investing exercise. Pragmatically, it's really about description. That is, you can tell your friends you saw Noel do this crazy isolation, and bam, they have an idea of what you're talking about. What I like about Cardistry is that you can really tell cardists apart from their style. I've been told that my inspiration from Ben and Ambrose can be pretty obvious, but I also keep my cuts very concise. So perhaps the categorization should also aim at defining someone's style, rather than the cuts. Just a couple of thoughts"

Then it got pushed back to the end of June.  Now June is over and we still have nothing.  This is getting to be more than frustrating.  It's been 3 months.
cardistry,3blvgc,DragonsBoat,2,Tue Jun 30 23:30:54 2015 UTC,"It's really not a big deal in my opinion, if you think about it were getting some pretty rad moves in the bundle and over the course of time the number of tutorials in the package has doubled (if I recall correctly from Huron's Email). Anytime during July is fine with me."
cardistry,3blvgc,mictubis,-1,Wed Jul 1 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"It is a big deal.  They are losing credibility, at least with me, with every day that passes.

cardistry,3blvgc,DragonsBoat,2,Wed Jul 1 00:29:12 2015 UTC,"/u/mctubis is right. We took a big credibility hit with all the delays from this launch, in terms of delivery, customer support, and Flicker Shot, and being good at cardistry or teaching is no excuse for that.  While we don't reasonably expect anyone who's lost faith in our company to return to after this, we've already been implementing measures to ensure that we're better equipped to handle this next time round.  I know it can seem that we're all just slacking around and ignoring you guys while Huron is busy getting pretty with the media and I'm just redditing all day. The truth, however, is that our jobs within the team are fairly compartmentalized. The footage for Flicker Shot was filmed by Jeremy and Huron over the course of May and early June, and within the past month Daren's been handling all the editing and refinement. On my end, I handle customer support, so when I take a break to attend to moderating duties on here, it's not like it's slowing down production on the tutorials.  Just wanted to give you guys a bit of insight into how operations work over here. We're still small and we're still learning, so hopefully once we've completed our commitments to Flicker Shot and sending out the back orders, we can get back on top of things in a way that satisfies both our supporters and ourselves, personally."
cardistry,3bmyjh,echo07,4,Tue Jun 30 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"The flourishes looked decent, but I hated the music. Not sure how drinking and fucking on the low have anything to do with cardistry. Also I was expecting a bit more from a properly edited video This just seemed like a few moves edited to bad rap music. Try and tell a story with your video. Make it have a beginning middle and end. Get a little creative with it and make your video have a purpose. Without a purpose it's just another cardistry video with rap thrown on top, and there's already a million of those videos out there."

Zach's music at least fits the vibe of the video, where this did not. The song was garbage (a feeling I have with most mainstream rap) and it detracted from the video(again my opinion, take it or leave it)"
cardistry,3bmyjh,onimushalord89,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"But this isn't zach's style, I would say far from it, and fair enough, I totally understand getting frustrated with that and I would agree that I hate watching videos that do not match the music, however -even though the song was garbage in your opinion- the moves and editing did match the tempo of the song, so that is where I disagree with how it doesn't match. It's a faster-ish paced song and the moves were faster paced so it wasn't like they were totally colliding: if you want to check yourself, tap your foot or hand or whatever to when the snare and the bass drum hits. You can actually see that the video angle cuts are on tempo"
cardistry,3bmyjh,ehw_,2,Tue Jun 30 20:24:29 2015 UTC,"You're right, the editing is on point with the tempo, but I found it difficult to concentrate on the video because the music was so distracting. Obviously I'm not the only one here who thinks that.  Music is a very important part of any cardistry video as it sets the tone and pace. Much like a soundtrack for a movie does. If the music choice sucks, then it will reflect poorly on the cardistry, as it has done here."

Did it really stand out to you that much? I mean we all have morales but like is that the point? Because it was an Instagram video I'm pretty sure it was most likely an after thought (thinking about the fact that it had explicit content or maybe even the music itself) but what about the moves? Sure you briefly mentioned his moves but like shouldn't the moves be your main focus on critiquing? This subreddit is for cardistry not music or video editing, granted, -yes-, you should critique those things but the music was like all you talked about  And should he really be concerned if he offends someone? Ian Mckellen once said (can't remember the exact wording) it doesn't matter what you do, you are bound to offend someone. So   However I did like the fact that you mentioned sort of a plot line, a story, that was good"
cardistry,3bmyjh,ehw_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:01:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, music matters and yes it stood out that much.  It's not about morals, it's about me showing someone's work to someone who hasn't seen cardistry before.  You think I'd do that with anything with explicit content?  Or something that's much easier for others to digest?"
cardistry,3bmyjh,Lousyspy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"Really? you would show things from an independent cardists to explain cardistry?? You wouldn't show, say, Tobias or Aviv or spencer or anything like that??  And are you sure the music was that distracting or was your phone or computer volume up to high?  And of corse its about morals and ethics. You don't want other people to be hearing explicit content or you don't want other to be hearing you listening to videos with explicit content (reflecting bad on you) or you don't want to listen to it your self, because explicit content is ""bad"". And that's a good thing, but there are plenty other videos you could choose from to show, if that was the problem.   And my point is why stop him to putting cardistry to music he likes? It's your opinion, and I know he asked for critique but for music?? I'm sorry that you hate the music so much"
cardistry,3bmyjh,ehw_,2,Tue Jun 30 22:40:04 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to point out that for Zach the rap makes more sense since his videos are more life style oriented than I guess you'd call artsy. If the video is just about moves, then rap it's more likely to cause a dissonance, though if it's just about hanging out it makes a whole lot more sense. To be thoroughly honest, I really disliked the song on a lyrical and musical level. But who am I to judge, I like some weird stuff, and this is a discussion for another subreddit. As for the video itself, I'm afraid to say I can't take it too seriously. Firstly, I see instagram as more of a platform for advertising and showing specific moves. When I think 'Cardistry video', I think YouTube of Vimeo. That's not too important, but still. From a visual point of view, I'd say that the moves themselves look fine, but some of the shots were out of focus (two card twirl), the light was excessive to the point of blowing out many shots. If it's intentional, then i'll just say it's very difficult to pull off tastefully. As usual, bringing color correction and grading into the mix really makes the difference in a video. Overall, it seemed to be just you showing off some moves. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but you might want to explore different directions a little deeper. Definitely keep at it, perhaps try something a tad more sophisticated next time."
cardistry,3bmyjh,MattBeaudouin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:32:05 2015 UTC,"Alright lads, I can see where you're coming from. The theme was to just have fun and show some skill. You can expect a more ""serious"" and ""grounded"" video from me soon!  As for music, I'm hoping to use this: https://pro.beatport.com/track/initiatio-original-mix/6588766 (couldn't find it anywhere else)  Also if anyone wants to collab, message me!!"
cardistry,3bmyjh,onimushalord89,3,Tue Jun 30 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"I actually like that song. As long as there aren't obscene lyrics in it, I think any song can work. I really like Zach Mueller's vids and he uses a lot of Rap/Hip-Hop. You just need to find something that compliment's your style and hasn't been overdone."
cardistry,3bmyjh,aaallaannn,4,Tue Jun 30 17:06:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no problem at all with your music choice. As long as the movement of the cards flows well with the music, I see no problem. I think everyone else's distaste of obscene lyrics is more of a personal preference, but if rap is your style, you do you man. Oh and those moves were pretty boss."
cardistry,3bmyjh,Lousyspy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:07:53 2015 UTC,"Initial thoughts about the song.  Hip Hop music--whether instrumental or not; has a tendency to sound loud.  Like it's trying to desperately get your attention.  In this case, it's trying to do that; get your attention.  My biggest worry is that what you selected is going to distract the audience from your focal point--your moves.  Try picking a song that is more...muted.  More quiet.  You don't have to pick something today.  Tomorrow.  Even this week.  Try looking up some royalty-free sites.  Some have a search engine that's based on MOOD.  It's an extremely helpful tool.  Take your time!  You have all the time in the world to make a great video."
cardistry,3bmyjh,ehw_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:48:14 2015 UTC,"Okay so I would like to respectfully disagree with some of the people here.  A while back I posted something about over used music and actually take back what I said about rap music, I don't think it is over used, I just think to many people with really novice moves use rap music and that's why everybody hates it. And when does music ever have to do with a card video? It's just music, calm down, as long as he isn't dropping f bombs ever single second and as long as it's not ""crave"" it's okay.  And plus it's your -first- video. Granted non lyrical music is usually better for something like this but like Jesus seriously calm down. Zach mueller uses music like this all the time with a lot more explicit content.  Second your move, I actually think they are pretty good. They seem pretty darn good comparatively with other material that comes out sometimes, so seriously forget all the other people that were saying stuff like that."
cardistry,3bmyjh,Lousyspy,0,Tue Jun 30 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"Ah, the doors have been opened for a discussion about music.  Here's my take.  Mr. Mueller isn't asking for help.  And I'm not exactly on board with the music he uses in a lot of his videos.  Some of the hip-hop music he has used worked well.  But I think a majority of them I don't exactly agree with--especially the ones with explicit content.  On that note, I think it's much much harder to construct a video with music that utilizes lyrics.  This is why I suggest going with instrumental; it cuts out another factor to worry about and I think that a song with lyrics must go with a 'theme'.  But I think that could turn into a whole 'nother discussion altogether.  Music can be a powerful tool and is a staple in virtually every cardistry video; it highlights ones moves or one can use it to apply their moves to.  In this specific case.  I do not think that the music choice here helped his video.  But careful music choice in future videos could very well help."
cardistry,3bmyjh,ehw_,0,Tue Jun 30 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"Your opinion is your opinion, and I can't change that, which is great! It's great to have an opinion that cannot be change (that is the beauty of opinions), but some people like that type of music. Noel and Zach and people like them have a very stylized sense and that is how they brand them self which is okay! So, yes do give your opinion, but please put a disclaimer beside it letting people know that it's biased.  I would agree, I am not a fan of language but when I watch a video, I am not making that my focus. I try to watch the flow.  I think it is best to tune out the bad words, just see how the beat fits with the music.  I would also heavily agree that instrumental music is great when it comes to editing cardistry into a video. However, some people make it work, and personally I feel like it worked, and I enjoyed the 15 seconds. I felt like moves were not completely but mainly polished and had sort of a late night back alley type of feel (which I think was what he was going for)"
cardistry,3bmyjh,Lousyspy,0,Tue Jun 30 20:12:20 2015 UTC,"When you make a cardistry video, everything becomes up for critique.  Not just the moves.  Echo07 asked for constructive criticism and didn't specifically ask for critique on only the moves.  I think if the music sounds like it's overshadows the moves in the video, it becomes the first thing I critique.  I would like to show more cardistry videos to others.  you have explicit content, I'm just not going to show off your work.  Sure, it's only one person.  But that's also one less person that could be showing off your video.  I'm not going to get into it about Zach and Noel.  Again, they are not asking for help for their videos."
cardistry,3bmyjh,ehw_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"That's great that you are showing videos to other people, really and truely that is awesome so cardistry can get more exposure, but why not show the videos that people have polished, and polished there work?  In my opinion, people should only be critiquing the music choice if it is an extreme situation- like using something that is way over used or just something that shows a totally opposite mood that they are trying to convey. Really and truly I find nothing wrong with his music (and that's my opinion) and he obviously likes the music or he wouldn't have put it to the video."
cardistry,3bmyjh,Lousyspy,0,Tue Jun 30 22:56:49 2015 UTC,"Onimishalord89 touched on a lot of the main points.  The music doesn't match with the cardistry.  And personally, I don't like cardistry videos with music with cursing.  I've heard enough of it in my life to last 3 lifetimes and it's like nails on a chalkboard to me.    Honestly, it should be longer.  Longer than Instagram.  Was this a test to poll to see if your editing work is good?  There isn't a theme to connect your cardistry and your song lyrics together.  You have to ask yourself this:  'what makes my work stand out from other cardistry videos?'  The flourishes looked good and the editing and lighting looked nice.  And I look forward to seeing your next video--provided your next video is a bit more...tasteful.  The biggest issue here is really the work that doesn't involve flourishes.  Try using instrumental music and maybe a location that would compliment the theme for your next work."

cardistry,3bl10h,onimushalord89,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:43:38 2015 UTC,Where else has he taught it? First time I saw it was in the Cardistry Con bundle. That flourish was the main reason I got the bundle. It's really unique. Haven't seen many flourishes like it.
cardistry,3bl10h,InfectedReddit,-1,Tue Jun 30 14:58:21 2015 UTC,"Well maybe not taught it, but that and windchill are what I see in most of his videos.  P.S And he sold it on the wire."
cardistry,3bl10h,InfectedReddit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:14:00 2015 UTC,It's his signature move. Of course it's in most of his videos. I expect to see it. Much like I expect to see Huron do Flicker in a Virts video.
cardistry,3bl10h,onimushalord89,0,Tue Jun 30 17:15:42 2015 UTC,Yes but flicker isn't all Huron does.

I just thought because he's quite skilful and seems to be creative, I'd like to see more of what he has than just the same moves. For example his sponsor video. I liked quite a few new flourishes in there and I'd like to see more."

cardistry,3birlp,MarkooJ,5,Mon Jun 29 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"Given the sheer colossal amount of cardistry that has blown up, you're absolutely right.   But here is where I think it works. Imagine all the videos you see on Youtube. Not just the great cardists like Tobias and Mueller. But the little guys trying new moves out.   Imagine being able to have a place to watch new demo reels of performances, a central hub to properly credit tutorials and moves, and even a portion dedicated to public mentoring (posting videos and having people critique). It would be a great place to cultivate growth and interest in this hobby that we all share.   The time required to put this together is only based on how fast it would take to get a public following. If we managed to get big names to bring people together, then there's potential for this to grow exponentially. But based on the response this ends up getting, I would love to try and design a website just like this to get it all started."
cardistry,3birlp,Clashtopher,3,Mon Jun 29 17:51:18 2015 UTC,There has been quite a bit of talk of creating a new central cardistry-based website on this subreddit lately. This 'Big List' could be a great addition when/if a website does launch.
cardistry,3birlp,SirWace,5,Mon Jun 29 19:20:58 2015 UTC,Super cool but this would need something like a website that all cardists recognise as the central hub for cardistry.
cardistry,3birlp,ishaanmohindra,5,Mon Jun 29 16:21:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, not many cardists venture onto reddit, so most won't see the list."
cardistry,3birlp,Powderfood_Phil,3,Mon Jun 29 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"Very true. There isn't a central place for cardists to go as of yet. And frankly, a forum isn't the best format to stream videos. So really, a website with a dedicated video player (or embedded youtube) with the ability to properly credit, source tutorials, and also give cardists a platform to really come together as a community.   Youtube is rather saturated, given what card magic has had to suffer with people spoiling tricks. Despite the availability of videos, it's still a hassle for newbies to try and wade through the confusion of the tricks and trying to learn them in a manner that would encourage long term enjoyment instead of frustration (which is often the case, just look at how simple some of the tricks look in comparison to the hours it may take to perfect even a Charlier)"
cardistry,3birlp,tobiaslvn,12,Mon Jun 29 17:39:08 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of tutorials that have been posted of people teaching moves that THEY DIDN'T EVEN CREATE.   It actually really bothers me that the cardistry community cares so much about this. Dancers also share new moves over the internet, and I've never heard about any dancer claiming that they own a move just because they came up with it. Imagine Michael Jackson's family going after dance-teacher who dares teach people the moon walk, or imagine Rodney Mullen going after skateboarders making videos explaining his moves - it's preposterous.   Cardistry is a skill, and of course it's common courtesy as well as common decency to give credit to people who inspire you, but still.  I've never seen, nor even heard of, a skill-based community that tries to enforce this kind of certified-and-monetized-tutorials-only spirit. It takes away so much from what cardistry could be."
cardistry,3birlp,tobiaslvn,14,Mon Jun 29 18:20:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can compare skateboarding and dancing moves with cardistry moves. It doesn't sound like you've spent months trying to create a new move. It's not that easy to come up with good practical cardistry. Since original ideas is really what makes a cardist stand out it's important to give proper credit. I think of it more like art, not identical to art - but pretty close. It matters who painted a particular painting. Who cares who came up with moving your arm in a new way."
cardistry,3birlp,Agenal,10,Mon Jun 29 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"No way, and I'm not just saying this because I make money off of instrutional videos. I've always felt like it's the authors right to choose whether or not a tutorial is put online. I think it's a mentality which will effectively kill off sharing your work - if people did tutorials on my flourishes, whithout my consent. I would never show anything to the public. I think the way it is now is great - everybody who has the ability to do tutorials, are so skilled that they know how hard it is and respects the artform so much that they won't do it. Everytime someone re-uploads a tutorial I've taken down or something similar it annoys me - I understand how the internet works. But if the author had absolutely no control over his work, other than to not share it, cardistry wouldn't flourish like it does now.  This whole argument reminds me of when we first started selling tutorials. Some, not the majority, but some people actually said that selling tutorials kills cardistry. And I do understand that people want free things. But if anyone is able to actually make money off of cardistry it enables them to make more, with higher production value - make events like cardistry con, custom decks, Tours etc. And remember this community is still very tiny, so it's not like you're buying something from a big corporation. You're actually giving the creator a couple of bucks to recieve something you might end up practicing for hours - AAaaand you help develop the cardistry community as a whole. I know you didn't say anything about making money teaching cardistry, but I thought it was appropriate to talk about in this context."
cardistry,3birlp,visualmadness,8,Mon Jun 29 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"It's very simple, really. Paying for instructional videos ensures that the creators of said tutorials are able to spend more of their time and effort on making quality tutorials. We are paying for the time and effort they spend creating and teaching material. I kind of don't get why this is such a big and silly debate in the cardistry community - and I don't get why people expect everything to be free.   Then again, I'm looking at it from a magic point of view, in which we are used to always paying for instructionals whether they be books, lectures, physical or downloadable videos. And yes, you might argue that part of what you're paying for is the secret and the production costs - but obviously you are first and foremost paying for the creator's time and effort spent creating, testing and refining the material so he can teach it to you.   In the magic scene it's generally frowned upon to teach material you didn't come up with - unless it's a commonly known sleight or very commonly known trick. There's many reasons - but first and foremost respect for the creator and his/her material. Secondly - you could argue that the only person qualified to properly teach it is the creator - because this person will likely understand the material in a way no one else does, and can offer better instructions than anyone else.  I think this will be a debate for years to come, sadly. I really appreciate that you're chiming in with your thoughts and experience here, Tobias. I hope more people will see things this way."
cardistry,3birlp,windomiles,12,Mon Jun 29 21:51:30 2015 UTC,"In addition to what Tobias and Allan have said, my biggest personal problem with people teaching moves they didn't create is that there's a high chance of them teaching the method incorrectly, which can be very dangerous in proliferation.   DannyTwist's Cardistry Academy immediately comes to mind: I feel sorry for anyone who started out with his tutorials now having to un-learn the incorrect techniques that they've picked up from this guy who can't even perform what he claims to be 'teaching'."
cardistry,3birlp,Clashtopher,3,Mon Jun 29 22:03:50 2015 UTC,"That is what happened to me, and I think it is why I am progressing so slowly in cardistry."
cardistry,3birlp,tobiaslvn,3,Mon Jun 29 23:05:41 2015 UTC,"When I wrote that I actually didn't consider tutorials that people release for sale for some reason (I was a little tired and distracted at the time)  I did not mean that it is okay to make free tutorials for flourishes that the creator sells and I completely agree with what you've said above.   The way the it is now is perfectly fine, I was thinking strictly about tutorials that were released for free and completely take back what I had said because it definitely doesn't apply to paid tutorials.  I am sorry for my misunderstanding and will delete my comment as I, myself, do not agree with what I had said now that you've pointed this out."
cardistry,3birlp,SirWace,3,Tue Jun 30 14:51:42 2015 UTC,"Hey no worries buddy, it's rare to be in a situation where I can express this kind of stuff without seeming out of context. So I'm glad you brought up the argument whether you believe in it or not."
cardistry,3birlp,Powderfood_Phil,2,Mon Jun 29 23:12:16 2015 UTC,"I think that selling moves is right but it should be avoided. Let me explain,  everyone wants this beautiful art to grow, right? That means we want more people to start learning cardistry, but how can a begginer learn if there are'n t any good free tutorial? I mean, there are good free tutorial like the dynamite series, school of cardistry and others but i think that the main problem is that begginers want to learn what they see their favourite cardist doing but they don't want it so much that they feel comfortable spending money on it. I think that many begginers arrive to a point when they aren't still able to create their own moves but they are able to learn some of the more advanced stuff, at that point they are stuggling and looking desperatly for free tutorials of their favourite moves, many of which doesn't even have a tutorial at all (ex:mockingbird). It's at that point that they end up looking some shitty tutorials made by unqualified people.   At the same time I think that it's right to sell your own moves, if we want this art to grow we also need people to be able live out of cardistry so they can keep creating and make this a plausible  ""job"". Considering that there aren't things such as cardistry show for now there aren't really other way to make money out of an art.  P.S. Sorry if I wrote something wrong I am not a native english speaker."
cardistry,3birlp,tobiaslvn,-1,Mon Jun 29 23:17:52 2015 UTC,"Several things to say to that:   It matters who painted a particular painting.   Only because a painting is not just an accumulation of skill and creativity, but also a thing you can buy and possess. Sometimes carbon-dating a painting is the only possibility to distinguish it from a forgery.   By definition there can be only one person who possesses any given original painting, while only skill limits the number of people who can perform any given cardistry move. There is definitely an undeniably important difference there.  Music would be a much better comparison. Millions of people can play ""Wonderwall"", but of course only one band wrote the song. Does being able to play the song mean I should try to pass it off as my own creation? Definitely that would be a dick move. Does it mean that Oasis-members are the only ones that should be allowed to print and distribute guitar-tabs for that song? This is what seems strange to me, and it also seems to be an idea that is unique to cardistry.  I think that's a bit schizophrenic: It's wanting a move to be ""out there"", but at the same time wanting to keep it for yourself. It's also a strong hope to make a living out of your hobby, a desire to earn money by publishing paid tutorials. I get that desire, I really do. But I also think it's destructive, and I wonder why it's so unique to cardistry."
cardistry,3birlp,visualmadness,6,Tue Jun 30 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"Do you really think that enabling anyone to do cardistry full time - will be destructive, in any way? There is a desire to earn money, but only because it enables me to do cardistry. It is not the intention of doing cardistry to earn money. Thinking that is really ignorant. Get ANY other job and make more per hour. Do you think someone would spend years practicing cardistry, to earn money? It's the other way around, I want to earn money so that I can do cardistry. To think it's wrong to want to do what you love, if any money is involved. That is really what is destructive and demotivating.  I create I new video that I have been working on for months, with all these moves which I've been creating over the years. And it's like each one of these moves have a story to them. I've had them in my mind for months or even years trying to figure out how to close that one, or how to improve the opener for that one. Taking bits and pieces from other ideas I've had from years ago. Figuring out the perfect flow. There is a lot more to it than just ""woops I just happened create 'Pandora'"". All my passion is poured into these creations and I've been working on them for so long and then when I finally release them in a video, MisMag822 releases a shitty tutorial on how to do Flip Phone incorrectly. Could you wait a second, until I'm ready to teach you what I've been working on? Or do you prefer shitty incorrect explanations shot in someones bathroom? That is what is destructive. Money is what enables us to do what we want, in the best way possible. We are not millionaries.  It is this way, because it's a great community - we're all friends and respect each others work. So don't say ""you're taking away from what cardistry could be."" This community is great and I love it the way it is now - and it's always been this way for a reason."
cardistry,3birlp,Powderfood_Phil,5,Tue Jun 30 06:53:28 2015 UTC,"Something else to consider is 'dibs'. If you invented something, it's only right that you should be the first to publish the work on it. Of course, there's lots of people who have no intention of making tutorials for their moves as it is, but for those that do, having others do it first can be a real buzzkill. But that's more of a matter of courtesy than anything else."
cardistry,3birlp,Agenal,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:44:27 2015 UTC,"for those that do, having others do it first can be a real buzzkill   That is a good point, and one which I hadn't thought of. Sure, others rushing to produce a tutorial on a new move and scooping the creator is really, really shitty.  But back to the thing that bothers me: What's your take on old moves being exclusively taught on DVDs or paid-to-watch videos? For example one of the first moves I tried to learn and couldn't figure out on my own then was the carnahan fan. I searched long and far for a tutorial, and the internet basically told me to buy the DVD. I finally found a tutorial by TheRussianGenius, and the comments express a lot of unhappiness at its existence. What's your take on that?"
cardistry,3birlp,visualmadness,4,Tue Jun 30 07:26:10 2015 UTC,"What's your take on old moves being exclusively taught on DVDs or paid-to-watch videos?   Again I'm relating this to the magic scene as in my previous comment - but I really don't see what the issue is with this. The Bucks came up with the Carnahan Fan and published it in their Sleightly Magical notes and later on The Trilogy and probably as a downloadable video on their website. That move is MORE than accessible. Think about it this way - if it was only published in an out-of-print set of notes, then I'd understand that there was a bit of frustration from people wanting to learn it - but as accessible as that move is, I really do not see the issue.   The creators are more qualified to teach it than anyone else -  because they've spent the months, maybe years developing it and refining it, and then figuring out how to teach it to you. They will have tips and subtleties on it that other people have missed - but in the end, it's their move and it's just a really uncool thing to teach it if it doesn't belong to you or you don't have the creators' permission.   I just looked it up, and it's $3.95. Not even $4. That's a cup of coffee at Starbucks. Surely you would buy someone a cup of coffee for them to teach you a move and teach you all of the little details and pointers and tips that aid you in learning the move, right? You'd buy them the cup of coffee to thank them for their work. So that they can keep coming up with, and teaching you more great things.   Again, in the magic scene, if you want to learn something, you're gonna have to track down and buy whatever book it's published in. It doesn't matter if it's an old or a new trick. If I want to learn one of Vernon's pieces from the 70s (if he was generous enough to publish it - it's his material after all) - I'm just going to have to track down which book he put it in, buy the book (if I can get it, a lot of them are out of print) and learn it from there.  I'd want to learn it from whoever came up with it, because I'd sure like to hear what that person has to say about it.   Expecting these things, which take a lot of time, effort, passion and dedication to come up with, to be free - borderlines on being entitled and ungrateful, in my opinion. We should be thankful that these people are generous enough to share their hard work and creations with us in the first place - ultimately it's their choice. The least we can do is buy them a cup of coffee for the effort."

cardistry,3birlp,McRabbit,3,Tue Jun 30 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"I searched long and far for a tutorial, and the internet basically told me to buy the DVD.   This is a small aside, but there's also the Sleightly Magical lectures notes where it was first published, even before The Trilogy. Though I understand that most people prefer to learn from videos over the written word, especially when they're starting out.   What's your take on old moves being exclusively taught on DVDs or paid-to-watch videos?   As far as exclusivity goes, I think the reason it used to happen is twofold:  For one, cardistry used to be considered a subset of magic culture, and thus it was treated the same way: you had to pay to gain the insight of how to do the material in Showoff, just like how you would pay to learn the stuff in those Ammar tapes.  Secondly, we didn't use to have smartphones, affordable editing software, or YouTube back in the day. Producing a tutorial video used to cost a lot of money, and without guaranteed return on your investment, it wasn't even worth making. That's not even taking into account the fact that flourishing wasn't even a 1000th as popular back then as what it was now.  So, the precedence was set in the early 2000s (and even earlier if you consider things like the McBride tapes) where all the resources teaching what we now consider 'old/classic' moves were paid ones. But what about now?  Frankly, I think the way to go about it these days this is pretty straightforward. To make it simple to understand, I've created a flowchart for people who want to make tutorials for old/classic moves:  http://imgur.com/jxruYpM"
cardistry,3birlp,tobiaslvn,-2,Tue Jun 30 17:53:18 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to nitpick here. Tobias I've watched your tutorials and thoroughly enjoyed them. However, while teaching Phaced you didn't credit who came up with the Skater cut nor the scissor cut, both of which are used in the flourish. To me, cardistry is an art, just like dancing and skateboarding. You wrote, ""Who cares who invented moving your arm in a new way"" ...but what about if one would say the same thing about cardistry and say ""who cares who invented moving cards in a new way""?  In my opinion, the cardistry community's growth is dependant on the accesibility of tutorials. Yes, it is important to give credit where it's due. But these half-assed accessible tutorials made by teenagers in their bedrooms give possibilities to other cardists to create variations based on moves created by big names in the game such as yourself. Accessibility invites innovation. If we let the world of cardistry become a welcoming sharing community instead of an exclusive name-dropping club, we will definitely see a substantial amount of progress in the artform.   Again, I'm not attacking you personally, I love your work and all that you have done for the community. I just wanted to contrast my opinion since I feel like we have opposing views."
cardistry,3birlp,NicolasMolines,6,Tue Jun 30 17:36:04 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YvPnQFHIK4  I literally say 'Skater Cut' and I remember re-shooting this tutorial a bunch of times because I went too deep into the credit of the skater cut and we thought, we'll just put it in the description. Which it is, it's in the description. And I don't verbally walk through that part.  Half assed tutorials are fine, just teach your own material. That's really what's happening - create your own, help the community grow."

cardistry,3birlp,ehw_,2,Mon Jun 29 17:35:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, actually I think we should post a new like post on the idea of categories.   Here is my train of thought: so for persuasive speech the is ethos logos and pathos (all Greek words, all representing different types of speech) I think we should do the same for cardistry. I know we have like one handed cuts and two handed cuts (those are technically ""categories"") but like what's a two handed cut category for something like vine or snow globe where you have like 2-3 packets and one card is revolving around the packets, verses something like squeeze, we need to create categories, I'll create another post about this...  Second off, We would need to have rules for this spreadsheet because the fact that some people delete their Tutorials cough patrick varnavas cough benji taylor cough   Rule number one would have to be if it is deleted with out being submitted (we found it and put It on our list) it should be taken off the list in respect to the owner and no further links from youku or any other place should be posted   Rule number two, if they submit it to be put on the spreadsheet, they cannot take it down unless there are extenuating circumstances that provide a good reason to take it down  This spreadsheet will contain flourishes from DVDs for documentation purposes only and will have links to websites where you can purchase them.  After some of the new websites are up that are hopefully being design by David  Perdersen, I would love for this to be some how incorporated   If anyone has any suggestions at all please let me know how to improve this idea, I am currently in the work of editing, taking away copyrighted material or private material and adding material to the spread sheet and if anyone can help out with editing this material and filling it out please let me know(Unfortunately I am not up to date with most of the flourishes from the wire or from the cardistry news app so help with that would also be greatly appreciated),  here is the link:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zJ4A3wMnOd6yy06ZNW8VWPvVi5IvRleQNGiIhQk78rQ/edit#gid=0"

cardistry,3bjyv2,windomiles,4,Mon Jun 29 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"You know what, that was actually very interesting. Not as much because of the finished product, but because of the potential. I would suggest you try to recreate this video in the future, perhaps with keeping some of these tips in mind: * You should work a little on your moves. But you know that, so I'll leave it at that. * In terms of shooting, the location was very nice. It fit the song well, perhaps not your clothes that much.  * A bit too many shots are too far away to see what you're doing. You should have more standard shots throughout so the viewer's eye doesn't bounce around too much. * I can tell there are a lot of issue in post production. Most obviously, the size is wrong. I'm making the wild guess that you are using Final Cut Pro. If that's the case, be sure to drag your footage in the timeline in such a way that you get a box saying something like ""Do you want to match your sequence settings to your footage?"", which you do. Otherwise, look at the format of your footage and fiddle with the settings to get it right. * More post prod: Use a stabilization software on your footage. Otherwise, it's really distracting to see shaking. In FCP, it's called SmoothCam, I'm pretty sure other software have something similar. Keep in mind that these software work by zooming in the video to compensate movement, so anticipate by taking larger shots to stay in frame. * This is a bit more intense, but seriously look into color correction and grading. It a makes the difference between a video with cardistry and a cardistry video. It's tricky business, but trust me it's worth it.      That's all I have off the top of my head. I really like the direction you're taking, keep at it!"
cardistry,3bjyv2,MattBeaudouin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips matt. I will keep this in mind when i film my next video. Youtube fixed the size of the video. In terms of editing, I used a really crappy version of imovie that came with an old macbook, do you know of any free editing softwares that are better? As i was filming, my sister pointed out that my outfit didn't match the video, but it was to late to go back to the house and change.  Thaks for the advice, I will not forget it."
cardistry,3bjyv2,Lousyspy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:25:03 2015 UTC,"It's neat.  The music matches with the serene surroundings.  Tip of the hat, especially for your first video.  I did notice that you were a bit too far away in a lot of your beginning shots, I'm glad that you had a lot of closer up shots, but being too far away a lot had me worried.    Your clothes.  To match the song and surroundings, this is going to sound funny; pants.  And maybe a logo-less shirt.  Also, your deck-back design washed out against your shirt.  Im not sure what to recommend for attire though.  I wasn't sure what the theme of your video was, and going into theoretics won't do a lot of help as there's a lot of ways this could go.  You're working with a great location, unfortunately, it's a little bit tough to work with without a theme, I think.  All in all, great first video.  Similar to what Mr. Beaudouin said, it's really interesting and I completely agree that you should re approach it in the future.  Polish up the moves, work a bit in the editing, and do something with the clothes and you're good to go.  It's really just little stuff.  Great video"

I have one major goal for July.  I just bought a budget video camera. The focus for the month of July is to make the most out of the video camera to enhance my practice sessions. I'm going to record as much as possible my progress in Cardistry and post those videos up to my YouTube channel for a visual record of my progress.  Not only will this help me go to the next level in my Cardistry game but I hope it will help me get comfortable being in front of the camera and back into video editing. Start small with simple videos and gradually progress over time. Vision is that the viewer will get to see my progress within my Cardistry practice as well as my video editing skills. Plus I've always wanted to do something with my YouTube channel but never had a topic I could connect with. I do now.

cardistry,3bdst4,Lousyspy,7,Sun Jun 28 07:14:09 2015 UTC,"The truth is to get card twirls smooth takes AGES. Think 12 months not 3. But your flickr is actually looking not bad really.  Thing is, what makes it look not smooth are the transitions points. The card quickly snaps from one spot to another, pausing on these transition points. In the perfect card twirl, the transition points and the movement between them would have the same speed. It not really about speeding up the transitions, but actually slowing down the in-between spots?   To do it smoothly you want the card to be almost lagging behind your fingers, you start on the next movement exactly as the next one is ending, it almost feels like the card is constantly playing catchup. You have to feel the weight of the card.  What you want is for your fingers to roll smoothly around each other. Imagine a gambler rubbing chips together, smooth movements with constant, light pressure. It looks like you're holding a little too tightly, by loosening up it lets the card move slower as it transitions between the positions.   A good way to understand what I mean by feeling the weight of the card is trying with a larger card / heavier object. If you try it with a jumbo card you'll notice how the card lagging behind your fingers. I've got a 30cm steel ruler here, if I do the returning action of flicker with it the natural inertia of the object makes the transitions so slow and smooth. The inbetween points are just so slow.  The thing is, its easy with a steel ruler, but its hard with a card because its so much lighter. It has next to no weight, your movements have to be so delicate. The weight of a ruler dampens out all the little transition movements you put in, so it appears so smooth, but the light card has seemingly no dampening.   So because the card is so much lighter, your movements have to be so much lighter. Hold the card as little as possible, next to not dropping it, it will help you feel the weight better.  But ultimately, card twirls are the kind of thing cardists spend YEARS working on. They can just never get good enough to be done. Its deceptive how easy they are to pick up but hard to polish. The good news however is that a solid card twirl is one of the most versatile, useful moves a cardist can have in their aresenal, they are totally worth the patience.   Just keep at it yo."
cardistry,3bdst4,Splitlimes,0,Sun Jun 28 08:07:15 2015 UTC,Thank you for taking the time to write that!  I can actually rest easier and not be as hard on myself.  Especially knowing now that it takes much much longer to get a clean Flicker down.    Thank you again!  I will continue to keep working at it.
cardistry,3bdst4,ffchn,2,Sun Jun 28 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"To do a nice flicker try to get your arm,wrist and fingers very loose and use everything like an whip. Don't worry too much and try to extend your fingers as much as you could, you're doing the basic mechanics right, but not unleashing it's flow and doing it smooth, you're keeping the twirl in one place and making it look kinda rough. Not sure if you know what I mean, but watch this and see if it helps.  I'm not a pro but the thing is to keep it light and smooth, rolling your fingers and using arm-wrist movement lightly with the hand. Do it very slow and light, don't worry about speed, if you get it right you'll be doing it faster unconsciously. I hope it helps!"
cardistry,3bdst4,ehw_,2,Sun Jun 28 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"Okay, so Eliot had most of it covered already, he did an awesome in depth analysis of the move but I had like one thing to add.  So my best analogy of the move flicker is like mayonnaise or glue; a little goes a long way. One flicker can last sooo long if done right, and it is all done with extension. Every single part of flicker can be extended or elongated.   I have done a lot of work and research on this move myself after watching Huron do such an awesome job on the move. What I have learned is its not just the fingers or the hand, it is the whole wrist, maybe even the whole arm sometime.  If you watch the flicker tips, which I'm guessing you have, I love the way Huron says make a box, an invisible box in the air that frames all of your moves and make sure you fill up that box. So many times have I seen flicker done repeatedly in like this little 6x6 inch space. No. Don't do that. (I believe Im paraphrasing what Huron said at one of the lectures at cardistry con) It should be done twisting the whole wrist, fulfilling the most potential the move has, using the fullest motion you can with out going over board. And it doesn't  have to be fast, there are so many people who do flicker slowly and it is so beautiful.  A couple more things. So you know how like if magicians are trying to fake like throwing a coin in the other hand? Well before they actually fake it they are going to do the actual action of throwing the coin in the other hand so they can notice what is natural about throwing the coin in the other hand. So if you were to apply this thinking to flicker, what I do is I remove the card and just practice sort of whipping my hand, in the way I would want flicker to look. Maybe even like looking at how some people like wave flags around or cloth, something that looks like flicker that is natural and put that into how you preform flicker.  So I guess my tips summed up are use the full movement/potential of the move, make it natural, and keep it loose. I'm pretty sure other people mentioned it already but if it's not feeling loose then I'm guessing it's probably not gonna look good. Take drummers for example, the secret for some of the fastest drummers in the world is being loose. And your hand isn't the only thing that has to be loose, it should be your arm/bicep, and especially your shoulder. Since the shoulder is what connects everything to the hand it needs to be one of the most relaxed things. Sometimes it's good to just shake everything and get everything loose, even in the back as well.  So sorry if this was too long (and I apologize if you have already gotten some of this advice before, I didn't totally remember Elliot's whole post), and I know Eliot answer pretty much everything but I just wanted to add my two sense!  -Edit- Yeah I'm sorry this is a bit of a repeat, I didn't read the second post down"

More of an inspiration month for me.  I've been in sort of a cardistry slump in recent months. Sometimes I would even go days at a time without picking up a deck. But I've been slowly regaining my interest in the art form, especially in the past month. I can attribute most of this to other cardists that I have been meeting up with as well, like Benji who flew in from the UK.   Looking forward to July, though. I plan on mostly practicing some unoriginal material to maybe spark a little creativity, then going back to creating some of my own stuff. Best of luck to all of you and your own endeavors."

Finally figured out how to do the Faro Shuffle thanks to The Virts.  Figured out how the Thumb Propulsion works.  Still need to work on the grip and consistency but once I get into the grove it's soooo much fun flicking the cards.  Made some progress with my Spring.  Still need to work on control but I'm much farther than I was with my spring than I was at the start of the month.  My biggest challenge of the month has been working on my flow and smoothness of moves.  Currently working on three 2 hand cuts, one of them being the Sybil.  I have down the mechanics of the moves but I'm still having issues with establishing a sense of flow and smoothness with each cut."

For a fun video (thank you for saying that it's a video made for fun), it's an impressive display.  Little bit of cleaning up in some of the moves, but I've seen a few of your videos, I don't think that's going to be all that tough for you.  Only things I can add is this.  From the beginning of the video, I was expecting a bit more text displays or animations.  Maybe more of the lyrics or just...more. I'd say that if you know how to do it, go for it and have fun with it.  Only other thing is the music.  I felt it was distracting attention away from your focal point.  That being your moves.    You have the moves.  Don't let the music take the focus away from your moves.  Have it highlight them instead."

Sadly, I have found that Indiegogo doesnt have the same reach and exposure that Kickstarter has. The people who buy the most decks during crowd-funding periods are collectors and most collectors tend to avoid Indiegogo like the plague.   Also, I feel like too many people set their funding goals at the projection of ""every deck sold"". This tends to make the funding goal pretty high and honestly unrealistic on a platform like Indiegogo. I set my campaign goal at my break-even point.  This is not to say that he has no chance of getting fully funded. Toomas is a talented guy with a great design sense and I really hope he gets this deck funded."

As far as doing this with a regular deck, I think it would be really difficult since you have to have more friction between each card than you do between the deck and your finger. I have to treat it like the knuckle spin in terms of the condition of the cards. Who knows though, maybe with more practice I can upgrade to a regular deck :D"

cardistry,3b5q7o,Lousyspy,2,Fri Jun 26 13:59:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty much it's just practice, practice, practice.  At first when I usually start a move I try to just get it down barebones, finger positioning and the general (usually rigid, awkward and slow) movement of the packets. I find usually the rigid movement is because it's a new move and you arent used to moving your fingers that way, overtime you get used to the move and it sort of just naturally becomes more fluid because you're more comfortable and relaxed holding the cards that way.  Like for example Trist by Birger, the move is super knacky and really awkward when you start, you're fingers are all tense and the packets don't move smoothly, but as you practice you get more comfortable and the packets move a lot smoother until it's as close to the way he does it has possible."
