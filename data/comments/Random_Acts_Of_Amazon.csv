Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,3e3l6y,doublestop23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:01 2015 UTC,Bighorn sheep are born around the end of May thru the beginning of June. Using this information you can age a sheep to within a few weeks. When a sheep is born most of its energy goes into body growth for the upcoming winter. At 6 months old a young sheep has almost no horns. Once a ram comes out of its first winter the ram’s horn starts to grow as the weather warms in the spring and the feed gets better. At 1 year old the ram is starting to grow some horns. A ram’s first summer means a lot of growth for his horns.

Go to game store ask for 30 card learner decks (they are free) learn with a friend who knows how to play and is friendly/good at explaining things   Option 2: Get any version of the duals of the planewalker game on steam/ipad/android   As far as what cards are legal in tournaments there are lots of formats. the tldr for each one is bellow:   standard: newest stuff, rotates every october (soon to rotate more often), new cards are added every few months.  modern: cards form ~10 years or so, barring a special banned list. Doesn't change too often, but it gets expensive ot play and cards spike a lot as people do well. Legacy: pretty much everything aside from a small banned list and the ""power nine"". Very expensive, very complicated, very fun for experienced players. Vintage: pretty much everything. Stupid expensive. Seems fun, but not played often IRL due to card prices.  ""Limited"" where you buy packs an dmake decks (via Draft or Sealed) for just that tournament."

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,3e2iwi,Shercock_Holmes,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:46 2015 UTC,The problem with -doodles is that a mutt is unreliable in terms of coat type and temperment.

No dog is truly 100% hypoallergenic for everyone and you need to find the one that works for you.   The papillon is a great breed. They're very, very smart and frequently participate in dog sports. They have lots of energy and drive. A big dog in a tiny body. Their hair is longer and sheds minimally. It is possible that you would be able to coexist with one."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,3e2iwi,budgiebum,2,Tue Jul 21 14:27:07 2015 UTC,"papillon   That's another one I was considering. I think volunteering to foster dogs would be a great idea, thanks!"
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,3e2iwi,Shercock_Holmes,2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"I have a dog that is likely a papillon mix and she's a doll. She can run with the big dogs and plays hard but is small enough to take basically anywhere in a carrier.   Men always say they want a big, tough dog but mine is more attached to the little papillon mix than the larger dogs. He spoils her like crazy."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,3e2iwi,budgiebum,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:33 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the episode of american dad where the father falls in love with this tiny purse dog and coddles it the whole episode. I keep telling him he'd love a small dog. He's such a tool sometimes.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,3e2iwi,Shercock_Holmes,2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"If he is worried about the dog being prissy, there are plenty of working and sporting dog breeds under 35lbs. However, all of those will take more exercise and training to be happy than a toy breed.   West Highland Terriers, Basenjis, Welsh Terriers, Bull Terriers, Schnauzers, Italian Greyhounds, Poodles (in a puppy cut not a foo-foo Continental)."
