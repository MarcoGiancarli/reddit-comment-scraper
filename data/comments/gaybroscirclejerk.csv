It is an exclusive club of guys that like to stroke each other's cocks.  Kind of like Gaybros, we do GBCJ meet ups sometime to jerk in person but most of the time we just do it virtually through digital connections.  We are kind of an exclusive club of Fortune 500 company employees.  Mostly middle- to upper-management.  We have a sort of Board or Council membership where we donate our monthly dues to different investments - charities, startups, struggling local gay businesses.  Two years ago we invested, smartly I might add, in a chain of gay-owned Gold's Gyms.  Well worth our time and investment.  We are currently waiting on our investment to pay off with Facebook's investment in Oculus Rift.  Currently, I'm campaigning for investing this year's purse to low-rise apartment complexes for wayward youths that are within 25 miles of major college campuses across the country.  Perks would include weekend fast track classes and online training similar to khan academy where we teach homosexual kids how to be more masc - gym training, 24 hour marathons of RuPaul's Drag Race, Lumberjack training, Crew, Rugby, Classic (closeted) Homoerotic Literature, etc.    So, we're basically a consortium of gaybros that like to masturbate.

I think for a very brief time it was also just known as kaposi's sarcoma because that was one of the major, uh, symptoms...  It's what those awful horrific lesions were/are.  I wasn't old enough at the time so I don't know if that was before or after the GRID name.  You have to understand that because the condition was so new and that there was very little organization about what it was or how to treat it by doctors and health officials that all across the US names were being adopted as people were being diagnosed.  Not sure if that makes sense.  It was an awful time.  So, I wasn't sure if you were being serious about asking your question (especially since I think you would have seen it by now around here) but that's my serious, although I'm bad gay so not very thorough, answer.  Also, it's really not ""GRIDS"", it was just kind of adopted around here as ""GRIDS"" or The Grids"", etc.  It was just called GRID.  I think standing for, and this will tell you a lot about how it was looked upon then, ""Gay Related Immune Deficiency"".  Yeah, Gay was actually in the disease name.
