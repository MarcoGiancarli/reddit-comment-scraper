aoe2,3e2k70,LaurenTimmerman,2,Tue Jul 21 23:36:25 2015 UTC,"To answer PS: no, and thank goodness for it. That would make for a very boring game.  First question: there are a lot of things that could conceivably be done with towers. Most players skip over them after Feudal because upgrading and building them beyond that is too little bang for the buck."
aoe2,3e2k70,Sup6969,0,Wed Jul 22 04:04:54 2015 UTC,"It doesn't exist. It's impossible.   The closest to that would be a bunch of FU turkish BBT (regular bombard cannons can't kill them), teutonic castles (same) or shitloads of korean keeps (they have the range to counter cannons but lack the punch) backed up with a few bombard cannons/SO to kill rams. But trebuchets are the great annihilator of defenses. You could always bring your bombard cannons/SO out to kill them but then they would be vulnerable.   Defenses in AoE are not meant to stop your enemy. They are meant to prevent raiding and slow his advance long enough for you to react to his agression with your army.   If you want indestructible defenses, go play stronghold ;)"
aoe2,3e1pr7,digitalixus,2,Tue Jul 21 07:39:05 2015 UTC,"It's better than you might think. Here's 50 unupgraded skirms vs. a castle with obsidian arrows.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30dZ7m2F-_8  Normally they do 1 damage, but with obsidian arrows they do 4 damage, which is a 300% damage increase.  Archers can hit buildings easier. While melee units must surround the building, which can take time, and only get a certain amount of units attack it, any units within range can take out a building. You can fit 20 knights attacking a building (which will be a while before they all get around), or get 80 Archers to attack a building at once. 50 skirms each doing 4 damage a piece take out the castle fairly quickly.  Not a replacement for melee units, but they do make a significant change in their ability to take down buildings."

aoe2,3e1pr7,norther_,2,Tue Jul 21 11:54:32 2015 UTC,No one is saying archers are ideal for taking out buildings. It just makes them more versatile.
aoe2,3e1pr7,PeterPorky,0,Tue Jul 21 17:43:43 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. Letting them purposely fire at buildings instead of doing something else like pushing, raid or just about anything else. This is almost equalient to have them idle, which isn't a good thing. Aoc is all about efficiency. I get that in late game, you may not have 100% army control or whatever, so ofc they are gonna stand idle, perhaps firing at buildings, and these archers, doing it somewhat better. In the end it may total out to a difference of a few houses, some forgotten stable or whatever. That's why I say it's not practical. To me this is like you'd give scorps some additional building attack bonus, it's just futile and well, pretty dumb. It's too little to make a difference. As I said, the only time these bonuses comes in handy is if you are trying to breach into a walled player. Be a house a palisade, it will then be quite useful, as you will get in x % faster."
aoe2,3e1pr7,norther_,3,Tue Jul 21 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"This is almost equalient to have them idle   No, it's equivalent to have them slowly take down a building.   As I said, the only time these bonuses comes in handy is if you are trying to breach into a walled player. Be a house a palisade, it will then be quite useful, as you will get in x % faster.   They can take down other buildings fairly efficiently. Castles are fairly stronk, and 50 skirmishers take them down in a minute. These are units with two ranged attack. Get something like fully upgraded Arabalests and they can take down a castle in like 30 seconds. That's incredibly more efficient than before. They can be used to kill buildings at a distance while pushing forward.  It's not ideal, no one is arguing that it's a replacement for Eagle warriors or siege, but it's not useless."

You never do continuosly do arb with maya and I'm pretty sure enemy would just stand there watching u attack the castle etc. You'd lose the entire army before even getting the castle to half HP. Having this as a bonus is like the celtic sheep bonus, it's not useless, but it will never affect the outcome of the game. But I mean, if you wanna go use your army as siege, be my guest."

If you have massed archers, which is the dominant strategy for Mayans, I'd say it's quite worth it. A few rams + archer support (to take out any infantry attacking the ram, and to attack the building when other units are out of range) could be a pretty solid combination.   Context. Nobody would let u attack castle like that etc.   Yeah, and nobody would let a ram get to a castle either.   Probably, but on the other hand, in an actual game would lose none, because some semi intelligent player would use rams or trebs and defend it with the arbs rather.   That's fallacious thinking. You're assuming the tech is bad because nobody will buy it and it will go unused, not because the tech is inherently bad. I could make this argument for literally any other tech. Yes, obviously a tech that isn't bought won't be used, and obviously someone without the archer bonus against buildings won't use their archers against buildings."
aoe2,3e0aid,LadiesAndMentlegen,7,Mon Jul 20 23:38:05 2015 UTC,I think fire before poison. I want units that go down in a smoking mess after a siege onager shot with chemistry strikes.
aoe2,3e0aid,BoomierBoom,3,Tue Jul 21 00:10:08 2015 UTC,"Basically this. You can tell if a unit has fire applied to it via GFX, too  You'd need the same for poison."
aoe2,3e0aid,FreakishHero,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:30 2015 UTC,You should try out Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader. Those games had incredibly graphic fire based attacks.
aoe2,3e0aid,ethanGeltan,4,Tue Jul 21 03:42:28 2015 UTC,"I hate game mechanics like poisons/DoTs because they are almost always gimmicks. Very few games do them in a way that it adds to the gameplay. The only games they really work is in DotA like games where you only control one dude.  In AoE2, at best DoTs would add nothing to the gameplay and simply overcomplicate; similar gameplay can be introduced can be achieved with current methods or else more units would have to be added to make DoTs useful. At worst turn the game into a micro shitfest, which really sucks because AoE2 requires alot of movement screen to screen managing your eco and fighting on different fronts.  To make DoTs be useful, there would have to be a complete overhaul of the game. Common units would have to have increased Armor and Pierce Armor so that DoTs can break through them (and regular attacks would be weaker against higher armor). The game may have to introduce Nukes if regular attacks aren't as strong as DoTs; AoE2 has only 2 Nukish units (besides anti-Building units), Heavy Scorps and Onagers. Health regen might have to be a new thing and/or Monks would have to be heavily retooled.  Speed debuffs are a different issue and I think they'd be less stupid than a poison mechanic but in any case, you will be sitting there clicking your ass off trying to spread the debuffs as quickly as possible to different units."
aoe2,3e0aid,TheBattler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:19:58 2015 UTC,That's a good point and something I hadn't considered before. I actually completely agree with you as far as it turning the game into a convoluted mess. I still think a speed debuff might work however balance-wise. What do you think of the other features being added to the game like building strength being affected by terrain?
aoe2,3e0aid,damjpog,2,Tue Jul 21 07:41:24 2015 UTC,I actually think thats a feature in African Kingdoms!
aoe2,3e0aid,damjpog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:36:34 2015 UTC,"Well, Berserks and monks have the reverse feature, should be no problem. However if it's a tech for all archers units it sounds stupidly op to me. Maybe if it doesnt depend on how many arrows a unit get hit by it can be balanced. Or if it's only for a UU that does less damage."
aoe2,3e0aid,CanadianGGG,0,Tue Jul 21 06:01:29 2015 UTC,"OP? Perhaps, though maybe it could be reduced to 2 damage over a 3-4 second timeframe. Well, the point is that they would be poisoned arrows/bolts, not poisoned javelins or handcannons as I don't think those were ever used in battle - so it would just affect mainline archer units and mounted archer units. Obviously it wouldn't damage siege or buildings either, just units of flesh and blood. Additionally it wouldn't be a tech open to units with easily abusable units like longbowman or mangudai for whom poison didn't play too big of a role in their military anyway. Probably mayans wouldn't get it either purely for balance reasons similar to britons lacking thumbring, though it would be a great addition to civs like the inca or japanese who are underused anyways. Age of mythology had this exact same mechanic in it and it is by no means overpowered."
aoe2,3e0aid,mullikine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:00:14 2015 UTC,I never played AoM enough to judge it's OPness. But I just feel that it would be such a huge difference in an archer battle in late castle/imp when there are less micro. Also knigts would suffer pretty bad vs this. Fire one volley then on to the next one while the first one dies seconds later. But who knows.
aoe2,3e0aid,digitalixus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:39:50 2015 UTC,I think a better Idea would be to add traps that could be DoT.  I could throw down a line of pitch like in stronghold and would deter people from attacking through it.  Maybe they'd have to make it where fire would spread to trees and you could open up a BF map even if you dont have SO.
aoe2,3e0aid,thedboy,3,Tue Jul 21 20:22:46 2015 UTC,"These are the kind of updates they should be adding to HD.  Fire/poison/bleeding attrition damage is a perfect candidate for a new feature to AOE2. The reason is these additions add depth to the game without affecting the learning curve of new players.  Take a lesson from AOE3: AOE3 simplified the game which was a mistake. They took out forests and made pocket/flank not matter (because of small map sizes). They removed the usefulness of walls and towers and the strategic advantage that comes with elevation. These were perfect features, like your proposed one, perfectly suited to AOE. The fact Warcraft 3 has all of these is testament to that. Unfortunately, the AOE3 developers replaced good, intuitive features with crazy features that you have to learn before feeling prepared to play, which is offputting for new players.  Now I myself am very excited about all the new units and civilizations coming to AOHD but I'm going to be the devil's advocate for a moment to make this point. Adding new civs is making it a little bit more difficult for new players to learn the game. Not a big deal really.  But a better update would be fire/poison damage. We need more features that add depth to the game without affecting at all the difficulty of playing the game for the first time.  The original AOE developers had something called finesse when they came up with design of this game; Extreme delicacy and subtlety in the highly sensitive act of adding new features.  Oh yeah, a Tech Tree button on the front screen would be nice too!"
aoe2,3e0aid,kona_boy,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:19:12 2015 UTC,"AoE3 was more casual, that much is certain, but another thing you have to give them credit for is that they made each civilization feel unique and distinct. The Dutch for example, had an entirely different (and historically justified) economy from the Japanese, but with these complicated differences came the impression of cultural depth. That extra depth does make things more difficult for new players to fully familiarize with, but for seasoned veterans it provides endless entertainment to learn even the slightest intricacies of each civilization and their effect on the metagame. Perhaps you are right and we should prioritize the experiences of a new player, or perhaps we ought to cater to professional players who maintain this game's longevity and relevance, but I think we can all agree that this game has always been something that has evolved with us, and being a part of that evolution is something that should unite new and old players alike both for new exciting gameplay and for sticking to the same successful formula that has contributed to its freakishly long lifespan. This game could definitely consider an idea like I proposed, but I would never compromise the older community for a newer, less dedicated one. The devs of this game need to concede (as I'm sure they already have) that this game isn't going to be pulling in masses of new players, but still updating with small new game mechanics and civilizations could keep the game fresh for those of us intermediary players who tire easily of mayan vs mayan wars on Arabia, but don't necessarily want to give up so fast on the RTS that has such a special place in our old nostalgic hearts."
aoe2,3e0aid,orangebomber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:29:02 2015 UTC,"Besides the gameplay changes of AoE3, which most have come to terms as casual-fying the series and a general regression compared to the 1st/2nd games, I think the huge imbalance and over-complexity of civilizations/units was the next most off-putting thing about the game.  I mean think of it, they tried to make the Russians the equivalent of AoE2 Goths but turned everything up to 11 (no pun intended) - the Russian units are like dirt cheap but super weak (vs Goth's discounted infantry, but they still are quite powerful). The French and some other civs had cavalry with ""toggle"" trample damage which was totally ridiculous (no toggle = attack single unit, toggle on = splash damage but unit HP drains itself in addition to receiving attack damage) And the weird ""attack penalty"" thing that completely threw everything off (some units had 0.5X attack against villagers, 0.7X vs siege or something, totally wtf).  Oh, and everything about AoE3 just screamed ""No rush!"". Like the forced minimum distance limit of your TC/fort from an enemy TC/fort, and the attack penalty on villagers, and minutemen you could spawn from your TC. There was simply little to no strategy in that game since every game was basically ""boom to Industrial Age and stomp on the enemy with your superman units"".  TL;DR: AoE3 is a total cringeparty as the developers tried to marry the history/strategy aspects of AoE2 with the popularity/RPG aspects of more mainstream games like WoW and Starcraft, resulting in a crapfest that got disowned by seasoned players and abandoned by casuals in just a few years (which is totally the opposite of AoE2's longivity - that game came out much earlier and has survived much longer)."

Main strenghts are:   Civ bonus, 33% increased trade gold. Basically makes them must pick in any teamgame that goes towards late imperial. Standard pick on closed maps, situational pick on open map like arabia, since they are awkward as flank Strong castle age UU, great for raiding They have fully upgraded paladins Full access to all blacksmith upgrades, so strong thrash army   Main weakness:   Don't have xbow upgrade, so going for early archers raids, prevent you getting xbow afterwards No eco bonus, besides less time spend building.   Military strategy:   On closed maps where you can fast castle, castle drop offensive/defensive and make conquistadors to raid. Also possible as pocket in teamgames As flank on open maps awkward, but you have to make archers like any other flank, but you want to make sure you get some fights to make sure you and the enemy don't have too much left when you hit castle. After that often knights In Imperial strong paladin civ.   Monks are mainly used as defensive option when enemy has easily converted units.

aoe2,3dxga8,S1Fly,2,Mon Jul 20 09:57:19 2015 UTC,you never ever go arch as spanish. You either drush wall to conq/kts or go full sc and stone wall to conq/kts
aoe2,3dxga8,norther_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"You can go archers, scout rush, or drush -> fc depending on how open your map is. Drush/scout rush -> full walling to reach castle age has it weaknesses on more open maps and is too vulnerable to mass archers from your opponent.  But indeed your focus with spanish is mainly on how get fairly fast to castle age safely. For that reason you often mix in more skirmishers than usual since archers don't scale into castle age."
aoe2,3dxga8,S1Fly,0,Mon Jul 20 12:06:44 2015 UTC,"No, you never go archers, ever. 99% of maps are wallable enough for it to be worth to wall and conqs/kts. Your way better of making full trash, even though that's usually suicide whenever pocket comes with kts. But the thing about having many skirms whenever u get castle is that they become, as regular spanish archer, useless as enemy pocket now will have kts. Xbow+kts beat the living shit out of kts+skirms.   What happens if the enemy flank isn't a complete fuckwad and is actually playing it smart by not attacking your army, instead gb, getting to castle, getting xbow bodkin? If you'd see the enemy is spanish and for whatever reason creates archers, you let him mass them up, and if he masses skirms, it's gonna be just as bad.   Risks of going drush FC no matter what civ is if a) you have a hole and get rekt b) flank goes straight to your pocket and he isn't walled or you don't inform him of that.

aoe2,3dxga8,VacuousWaffle,3,Mon Jul 20 17:08:52 2015 UTC,"The civ. When to pick them? What maps? With what other civs? Who counter them (Thinking Brits)? General civ things?   They're my go-to on Black Forest. If you know a game is going o be a prolonged stalemate, they're incredible in protracted games because of their fast-firing bombard towers and ability to convert siege. In addition to BF they can do well on highland, rivers, and yucatan if you're going heavy into the monk build. If you're going heavy into the Paladin build, they're versatile pretty much everywhere. In addition, The Spanish navy is one of the best in the game and it's cannon galleon, which fires 15% faster than others (and is affected by ballistics), is almost like a unique unit in itself. The only thing it's lacking in a navy is a specific bonus. Considering that their trade is also 33% more valuable than others, and trading ships generate gold slightly more quickly than trade carts, they're an ideal civ for water maps.  Civs that can counter them:  Keep in mind before reading the following, you'll have a fair chance against most of these. The Spanish are one of the most versatile civs out there. They have crack cavalry to counter infantry and archers. They have exceptional gunpowder to counter infantry. They have great monks (or the best monks in game, if you're playing Forgotten) to counter the bulkier sheer-force units like paladins, teutonic knights, and elephants. Their building bonus makes for a great bombard tower push or castle drop, and their trading bonus allows them to produce the normally-expensive knights, hand cannons, and monks throughout the whole game. Their navy is one of the best in the game and the Spanish cannon galleon is like a unique unit in itself.  Teutons (resistant to conversion, teutonic knights take down paladins, and their castles are within range of bombard cannons' range), Persians in HD (gunpowder units don't do well against really good paladins or elephants), Mayans/Aztecs (infantry aren't worth converting, and Eagle warriors are resistant to conversion and gunpowder), Turks (all of their gunpowder outranges your gunpowder, if they get camels supporting their gunpowder units there's not much you can do; converting bombard cannons and Jannissaries isn't significant), Japanese (Samurai aren't worth converting, but beat your conquistadors, they have the best halberdiers in the game, which will counter your paladins, they have a top-notch archery line which will counter your gunpowder units. Quick-packing trebuchets can counter your bombard cannons and towers. If they go for a mixed army, it's a pretty easy win for them. If they go all into archers, or all into infantry, you will be able to mop them up, though), Huns (their massed cavalry archers will tear apart your monks and your gunpowder units. Only hope against them is massed Paladins). Mongols (cavalry archers with a bonus against your bombard cannons. Like the Huns can easily take care of your monks without dealing with skirms or spears due to their speed. Their fast onagers can take out all of your monks in a single blow if thy are allowed to get in range). Italians (anti-cavalry, gunpowder-resistant archers and they get a specifically anti-gunpowder unit, the only one in the game, and can give it to all of their allies. There's not much you can do against them).  They're good against:  Slavs (their unique unit is slower than other cavalry, and easily converted, putting a big hit on their economy when they're going just for raw power), Koreans (for similar reasons), Franks (one trick pony of OP knights, where you have the perfect counter for), Celts (converting their siege will destroy their infantry-heavy civilization), Vikings (because infantry heavy and won't be able to reach your monks; tough hey can be a force to be reckoned with early on in water games), Indians (can't stand up to gunpowder; expensive camels are easily converted), Saracens (for similar reasons), Persians in Forgotten (slow elephants as their power play are easily converted as long as your monks outnumber their elephants and you can micro well; elephants that would trample over you in HD will now quickly be converted by Inquisition), Byzantines (cataphract heavy army will be countered by your crack cavalry, ranged gunpowder units, and monks; you'll unlikely have a lot of infantry in your army, so their bonus is worthless.), Chinese (archers can easily be killed by Paladins, or outranged by gunpowder units. Their scorpions can be killed by your bombards, or converted [one converted scorpion can take out a handful if they get a shot off]), Goths (infantry heavy so weak to gunpowder, weak defense will allow your bombards to destroy their base easily; their defensive bonus against range is negated by the fact that they're infantry; don't bother going for knights at all against Goths, just go into handcannons, skirms, and bombard cannons),  In addition to Japanese, it can go either way with Britons, the Magyars due to their counters to your monks and gunpowder units. It'll depend on which builds you go for and which micros to do. You can slowly inch towards Britons with bombard towers and you can beat Magyars with sheer power.   Military strategy. I'm thinking monks, but then they are slow and weak, so archers and Calvary take them out easily. So knights, monks, skirms, and pikes with some onager and or scorpions? Rush? Turtle? Late game hit?   They're great for rushing. You can easily scout rush or knight rush because their upgrades don't cost gold, and they have both bloodlines and husbandry. With the gold you would've spent on upgrades, you can get +4 more knights to raid. They're able to knight rush earlier than most (if not all) other civs.  If you want to turtle up behind bombard towers supported with monks and bombard cannons, their 15% faster gunpowder firing is phenominal for turtling. Don't bother making more than one castle if you're turtling, 5 bombard towers are far more worth the stone.  If you're in a bottleneck, they aren't taken out easily. Monks have a range of 12, they are elite longbows in their range. If you mass up 20 monks and can micro well (easier if game speed is on normal), 20 knights on the other team quickly become yours. Don't bother converting archers, but converting onagers can be disastrous for the other team. Since onagers are often accompanied by a mass of units + other onagers, can either take out several onagers with one conversion or take out a mass of units with their converted onagers.  They're best in bottlenecks, or behind walls/castles/bombard towers where they can't be reached. If they're next to a castle, you can quickly garrison them if others get to close. If you put them behind skirms or hand cannons, they can greatly increase the value of those units by healing them while they're behind attacked.  I've only really found them effective with the new Forgotten tech Inquisition, otherwise they can take a while to convert. If there's a teammate with Teutons on the other team, they're not worth very much. Don't go for scorpions or onagers, go for bombard cannons. Your bombard cannons fire faster than all other civs' bombard cannons. Support monks with paladins and skirms and you'll be in a pretty good position.   Economy. I need to focus on gold obviously, so my techs should be limited? As with the military questions, I want to avoid seige weapons and prefer no knights (But they can be a need be) as I should spend gold on monks??? What should my strat be for economy?   You should have some knights in there in most cases. You have some of the strongest knights in the game, and their upgrades cost no gold. In terms of economy, the 33% trade bonus is ridiculous in a late team game AND IT AFFECTS YOUR ENTIRE TEAM. Focus on trade carts early on and it quickly pays off. Having a mass of monks on your side greatly increases the lifespan of your units."
aoe2,3dxga8,PeterPorky,2,Mon Jul 20 14:50:20 2015 UTC,"i disagree that eagles are resistant to gunpowder. they do better than, eg, champions, but they still die really quickly and would be a bad choice to make against gunpowder. also slavs, koreans, saracens and celts with their siege onager + halb (or mameluke/war wagon) combination kills basically any army spanish can make, aside from bombard cannons. but since korean siege onagers have almost the same range as your bombard cannons, and celt siege onagers have a +40% hp bonus, they can still do okay.  also as for rushing, they are not great in the feudal age because they can't tech into archers, they don't get the crossbow upgrade. if they get a castle up early, conquistadors are completely overpowered in castle age. they also make knights that are as good as basically anyone else's.  also, monks are only useful in late imperial age to convert expensive siege. perhaps you have the best micro in all of aoc, and can actually use monks to defend vs massed camels, paladins or cataphracts, but otherwise it just isn't viable. particularly if you don't manage to pull it off and you just lose all your monks, that's a massive gold cost. also you can't say indians don't stand up to gunpowder when they get the best ranged hand cannons in the game, they get bombard cannons, and their camels have bonus armour. i can't see what part of their army composition wouldn't stand up to gunpowder"
aoe2,3dxga8,sweetjones1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:16 2015 UTC,"i disagree that eagles are resistant to gunpowder.   They're not as good as scouts, but they do okay. Granted skirms are probably the better option. 4+4 defense is good against an attack bonus of +11. They get an attack bonus against hand cannoneers. They definitely aren't the best units, but they're worth their resources when it comes to countering hand cannons. Hand cannons might be able to get one or two shots in, doing 40 damage (if they're lucky and their shots hit both times). Once Eagles get they're, they'll either 3-hit them with 100 health, or 2 hit them with 60 health. You'll lose more Eagles than hand cannons but it's 70 resources vs. 95.   but since korean siege onagers have almost the same range as your bombard cannons, and celt siege onagers have a +40% hp bonus, they can still do okay.   Monks can convert onagers equally regardless of their HP. It's much more beneficial to counter siege with monks.   also slavs, koreans, saracens and celts with their siege onager + halb (or mameluke/war wagon) combination kills basically any army spanish can make   Monks can convert their siege before they get in range.   also as for rushing, they are not great in the feudal age because they can't tech into archers, they don't get the crossbow upgrade. if they get a castle up early, conquistadors are completely overpowered in castle age. they also make knights that are as good as basically anyone else's.   Agreed.   also, monks are only useful in late imperial age to convert expensive siege.   Converting siege in Castle age helps a lot. When it comes to countering an archer rush, whether or not investing 135 gold into a mangonel is successful can make or break a game.   perhaps you have the best micro in all of aoc, and can actually use monks to defend vs massed camels, paladins or cataphracts,   If they're in a bottleneck, or behind a wall/army/castle/bombard tower, you don't need godlike micro, it's not that difficult. You need a mass vs. another mass with monks in support. If the units are distracted with the mass, monks can easily get conversions.   also you can't say indians don't stand up to gunpowder when they get the best ranged hand cannons in the game   Their camels can't stand up to gunpowder. They are weak against ranged units. I agree that Spanish and Indians are good matches for each other. Camels counter paladins, paladins counter Indian-gunpowder, elephant archers counter spanish-gunpowder, monks counter elephant archers."

aoe2,3dxga8,the_io,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:11 2015 UTC,"On water maps: their cannon galleons are stupidly powerful, but expensive as always. They are viable for naval combat (unlike other civs) because of the Ballistics tech applying to them also. If you can make it to post-imp and get some cannon galleons there's not much the other civs can do.  The Conquistador is arguably the strongest Castle Age unit in the game- use them ASAP. If you are intent on attacking as soon as you age up, train some knights while you are gathering stone/building a castle. Luckily your blacksmith upgrades don't cost gold so you can spend the gold you save there on more gold-heavy units like knights and conqs.  Spanish monks get all the techs I think, but they don't have any intrinsic bonuses. It's always nice to have monks for healing and converting expensive enemy units but there are other civs with better monks.  Edit: Oops, forgot the Forgotten. Spanish have a unique tech to convert faster, so uh, yeah, there's that."

I'm pretty sure the new AI doesn't get resource bonuses so I am lost.   The AI has a near perfect build order. It's villagers are always working, and always on the resources they need to be on to reach the goal, be it attacking or advancing. It actually isn't perfectly efficient either, not doing any micro on early game food like taking from only 1 sheep at a time or microing boar and deer closer to gather points. I reckon it does a standard expert build but with 3 or so extra vills in dark and the same in feudal to have comfort and flexibility in the next age. It is entirely possible to advance faster than hardest AI with good micro and villager distribution (the AI basically never advances on less than 24 vills, you can work it to advance on about 21 with knife-edge villager distribution and efficiency). Are you getting housed ever also? Time spent housed is growing time wasted.   2) Why does my ally always lose their fight in a 2v2? It's not a case of the enemy grouping up on them, I even have to go out of my way sometimes to kill some of the attacking units (not many). But they always lose a bunch of buildings and seem to be completely overwhelmed. Is your ally AI worse by default? Reversing the races on the same map did not help.   When I'm winning, my ally seems to do better too. I'm guessing they react somehow less aggressively if you (their ally) are under attack, and if they let the opponent get the first attack, they fall behind. Being the first to do damage is a huge deal in these fights because reactive play isn't something the AI is very good at. It's eco shuts down and from there the enemy has an advantage. If you manage to attack first, the enemy's ally probably won't attack your guy as fast.   3) I've seen people set waypoints for units. I hold down shift and click a bunch of spots and flags appear, but they don't follow them. No idea why it's not working.   Release shift and right click   4) For some reason, clicking on buildings doesn't work sometimes. Sometimes I have to click twice. Again, no idea why. It's not a problem with the mouse as you can see the button be pressed in the game.   HD is poorly set by default, the game actions sync to active frames which can lag a little versus registering clicks. You can increase this control value with a console command, not sure what it is.   EDIT 5): And why is it that whenever I see someone vs the new AI on youtube, they DON'T have hoards of units outside their base? I watch them casually build a single castle after booming without a single military unit, and then a few light cavalry appear, and die to the castle. I have to fight off at least a dozen units before building my castle. The AI in the videos are usually on hard, yet they seem so easy.   The casters are faster than the AI and get to execute their strategy much sooner, before the AI is prepared. Pay attention to the game clock, a fast castle is 14min or less clicking up, and a castle drop should have the stone ready as soon as you hit castle. Do this and you'll pretty much get the castle done by the time the AI's crummy feudal attack is priming."
aoe2,3ds7nv,BoomierBoom,3,Sun Jul 19 03:39:54 2015 UTC,"they are just very efficient in resource gathering. but that is not to say that they are perfect, ive had 2 hour black forest games where an AI has only gathered 30 stone (and likely spammed the ai teams chat)  edit: for point 3, end the shift right clicks with a nomal right click then the unit will start moving on its way"
aoe2,3ds7nv,needude72,0,Sun Jul 19 01:08:26 2015 UTC,So you're saying they have a base resource gather rate increase? If I am constantly making villagers and always have them active then they should not be more efficient with resources than me.
aoe2,3ds7nv,needude72,2,Sun Jul 19 01:37:02 2015 UTC,"it's not an increase its just that they play very efficiently, minimal villager downtime and building up a massive economy compared to what a casual player is used to  i've played the game in a few month long patches at a time for many years but have only just got into the habbit of focusing on what resources i've got coming in rather than what i currectly have. most unit and upgrade costs become insignificant when you start building up an economy like an AI (having 40-50 more villagers than you think you could survive on)"
aoe2,3ds7nv,Promiskuitiv,4,Sun Jul 19 01:46:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, the AI villagers gather at the same speed as yours, it just doesn't leave them idle. What it does badly though is that it retasks its gatherers too often, so they walk too much.  So a good human player will gather more resources with the same amount of civilian units than an AI does."
aoe2,3ds7nv,LadiesAndMentlegen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:37:04 2015 UTC,Yes I even abuse the pause mechanic to keep my villager production constantly going and no idle villagers. It's not that.
aoe2,3ds7nv,needude72,3,Sun Jul 19 15:45:19 2015 UTC,"Mostly what bugs me is the inhuman amount of micro they seem to have. If they mass up monks it almost gg because they can convert all of your units at the same time, instantly, dodge all of your mangonel or bombard cannon shots, and continuously move multiple individual units like crossbowmen away from pursuing knights. It's really ridiculous and not at all representative of human fallibility. If there was one thing I wish they could somehow nerf, it would be their micro skills."

aoe2,3ds7nv,Amoress,2,Sun Jul 19 15:46:50 2015 UTC,"1) I wrote a sentence about that in my first post and yes, it doesn't cheat.  2) I've heard this a few times, it's either that the human booms while his ally tries to defend from soldiers of both enemy AIs or that it lost 1v1 against the enemy AI. The latter should in theory happen to 50% overall while the former can push the percentage of games in which the allied AI loses over those 50%. The ally AI isn't different from the enemy AIs. Maybe the enemy AI also got some tributes by its allies.  3) Was already answered.  4) Not sure about that one.  5) Maybe they didn't play against the new AI (""Computer"") but the old ""Conquerors AI"" or a different AI instead - or played on a lower difficulty level -> the AI only plays without handicaps on the ""hardest"" difficulty (and will never cheat by default on any difficulty level ever).  I hope that helps clearing some things up!"
aoe2,3ds7nv,needude72,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:41:48 2015 UTC,"What difficulty are you playing on? I play on Hard and win regularly.  EDIT: May I suggest watching this video? It really helped me get better at the game.  1) The AI's Town Center is always active (generally speaking...). They are making villagers. They are slaughtering sheep underneath their town center to minimize villager travel distance. They are never housed (which greatly slows you down). They hunt boar which gives them fast food. They train a lot of villagers (~28 dark age, ~34 castle age) which helps them age up quickly. They also tend to FC (Fast Castle) or flush (Feudal Rush) which is why they're keeping up with you in ages.  The AI is instantaneous. It moves each unit individually and can continuously create units. It doesn't have idle villagers. It doesn't make mistakes (strategically, tactically with their villagers they are a mess). They micro effectively. That's why they keep spamming units; their economy is good enough and perfect enough to continuously produce units and they continuously produce them.  The key to beating the AI is to deny them resources and not let them get strong enough to overwhelm you, because they will just pummel you with numbers, with each unit microing decently. It's enough to overwhelm you.  The key is to strike them early. Get to the Castle Age as fast as possible (~17 minutes if you're really fast) and get some Knights or stuff to hit their wood and gold. If you're too slow they'll make Spearman and upgrade them to Pikes to shut that down. Hit them early enough and you can take them out of the game while your economy booms.  2) This is because you're making mistakes. In a 2v2 your AI teammate will do as well as you. You must pressure the enemy economy to keep them occupied on defending and not on offense. The AIs are all equal. Your allies will generally outperform your opponents if you pressure them off their resources. Your allies will generally get crushed if their enemies are allowed to build unharassed.  Those are my thoughts. Let me know what you think.  I tend to get to Feudal at ~11:00 to 13:00, and Castle by 17:00 to 19:00. The AI is about the same or a little slower. I hit Imperial at around 35:00 to 45:00, the AI is usually 40:00 or never, depends on how the game is going."
aoe2,3ds7nv,geckogod5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"I wish your advice would help but I have already been doing all of that. I abuse the pause mechanism to make sure my TC and villagers are never idle. I get boars and butcher everything under the TC. I've tried the castle knights rush but they already heave pikemen and skirmishers. I would not be asking for help if it was that easy. Really the only thing I can think of doing next is recording the next game and looking at what's wrong.  As for the ally AI, I should not have to harass the enemy so my ally has a chance at winning. They lose to one enemy attacking them so the other enemy is not involved. Switching the races in case it's a race vs map difference doesn't matter either."
aoe2,3ds7nv,sweetjones1,2,Sun Jul 19 15:43:17 2015 UTC,"Well if you're doing all that and the AI is still outpacing you then you're making mistakes and need to practice. And when they build the pikes to counter your Knights, build crossbows to kill them. Keep the fight on their end and dont neglect your eco and you'll keep them stuck in the castle. Hit their wood to stop them from spamming trash. Hit their gold to stop them from building other units.  Also I highly doubt your ally ai is always losing. But if they are... Send units to help them out."
aoe2,3ds7nv,Clemensor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:51:55 2015 UTC,"just to add a little about the ai partner problems that may explain things, the AI tend to prioritise their attacks on either a nearby civ or the civ with the highest score (8  player free for alls with AI players quickly become 5-6 on one). so if they are aiming for the ally it may be because they simply outscore the human player"

aoe2,3duyi8,RED_Sky95,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:19:39 2015 UTC,"i think its a a strong late game civ, if the UU is fast and they get bbt. maybe give them bloodlines so they have FU paladin.    +40% speed in imp for fire ships is just to much. (or as they are just aviable in castle only +20? that would be the max imo.) the military building -25% wood probably makes their drush good, so they can survive with the bonus sheep in a drush+fc pretty well. how are their monks for arena?   after all, i think it would be okay, but kinda useless castle tech if it isnt a sea map (But same goes for huns)."
aoe2,3duyi8,RED_Sky95,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:51:36 2015 UTC,So i am going to give them blodliness and nerf the speed.

aoe2,3duyi8,RED_Sky95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"Start with tree times more sheeps near town Militar buildings cost 25% less wood.   First bonus means you don't need farms until late feudal or even castle, so you save a lot of wood and you'll be gathering food much more quickly. Second bonus saves you even more wood, and is basically Viking's very strong dock discount bonus, except on land.  Combining those 2, they have a ridiculous early game which lets them do drush+fast castle, scouts, or archers very well. I don't see how they can be beatable."
aoe2,3duyi8,TheBattler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:10:57 2015 UTC,"Let me explain the great shield swordsman so anyone has no doubts. This has a pretty good amount of life (60 and 9 with elite)and speed for an infantary ( a little more than an pikeman) It has really good piercing armor, but not much normal armor which would make it completely destroyed by cabalary if they didnt had an small bonus gainst cabalary ( 10 and 15 in elite, its close to that) still using them against cabalary can hold them but never really defeat. Its greatest advantage is the incredible bonus against siege and archer, that combined with the pierce armor speed turn into a cheap( not because of the price that i am going to increase but because iyt just costs wood and food) late game counter against combinations of archers and siege. Of course if the enemy is masssing this too there is no way to really break their formation. Until you buy the shield in hands upgrade! That will allow them to crush this lines as they are massed. Cabalary can kill them but champions will exterminate them in seconds. The idea is to make people use more champions. Also elephants kick their ass so combinin them with halbadiers is a good idea. Also i nerfes the speed of the fire ship to only 30%. And the extra sheep bonus is just about double not triple. What is your opinion about the uu and the chnges?"

aoe2,3dlnzq,Kazirl,3,Mon Jul 20 13:06:24 2015 UTC,I recomend a archer rush. hits at 12-14 min and no inexperienced player can deal with it.

aoe2,3dlnzq,Kazirl,3,Fri Jul 17 09:08:23 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there is videos out there if you want a visiual. anyways.  fairly standard 17 villiger feudal. 6 sheep-> 4 wood-> boar-> 3 berries/dear->  boar-> 2 gold. Your TC will be idle a short while.  While going up put most of the food vills onto wood. When you have built a barrack and got a 250-300 wood in the bank switch your economy around to be 6 on wood, 3-5 on food, 2 forward builders and rest on gold.  Build 2 forward archery ranges, make 4~ archers and then go ham while growing your army nonstop. Remember to build houses, it's so easy to forget. If your opponent is defending with archers/skirmishers send 2 vills from gold to food and mix in skirmishers.  Keep making vills and send them to gold untill you got 9 miners so you can kep making nonstop archers, then more to wood/food/stone.  Your goal is to push your opponent of resources. Keep an eye for defensive towers going up and stay away from the TC range.  And as always you'll have to practice the buildorder a couple of times before you get it down. For civs I recommend Brittons(Better archers, faster production) or Huns(Great to start with since you dont have to worry about houses)"

aoe2,3dlnzq,jayknow05,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:55:55 2015 UTC,"BTW as for macro games. Easy wallable maps like Black Forest. Fast castle, ~28 pop, max 20 min even for beginners, before 17 idealy. And get 2 new Town centers. aim for 100-120 vills when your maxed out.   Side note: You'll need 18 on farms to sustain 3 TC. so delay the third a bit."
aoe2,3dlnzq,Kazirl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:41:24 2015 UTC,"I think trying to juggle military and getting a decent castle age time is too difficult for a beginner. It also makes for a two stage attack since your Feudal army can't finish the job.  With everybody being beginners, it shouldn't be too too difficult to fend off an archer/scout rush with trash."
aoe2,3dlnzq,Axa2000,2,Fri Jul 17 14:18:08 2015 UTC,"Ye, I agree that a new player should plan to make it as easy on the micro as possible.   That said it's not good to start with builds that will get stuck on 20 vills if you cant end it. A way to slowly working towards eventualy get up to castle age is needed, hence why I still take some food in my archer rush.  Ofc ignore this if you are trying to min/max an all in win/bust strategy."
aoe2,3dlnzq,Shogun5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:34:40 2015 UTC,"It might be better go up at 24 pop and send ~5 archers to harass the wood-line, put them on defensive and then concentrate on economy. Knights should hit at ~22 minutes to follow."
aoe2,3dlnzq,ProfessionalWingman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:39:50 2015 UTC,That is probably a better strategy if you play against better players who can defend the rush.  But against those who don't know how to react you want to hit them fast.
aoe2,3dlnzq,0x726b00,4,Fri Jul 17 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"Fast feudal age (11minutes), build 2 archer ranges (13minutes), pump archers (14minutes) and find enemy gold and hog it, then find villages to kill, age up to castle and finish them off if they don't quit and decide hide in the tc, game is finished under 20 minutes.  if your opponents aren't that good, then you could extend those times by a few minutes, but basically the above time is factoring the relatively fast castle, which would basically waste this strat as the goal with archer rush is to block gold, kill vills and have you advance with castle age and steam roll if needed.  going fast castle (15minutes) and knight rush (17minutes) is also my next suggestion, if you find yourself too slow or the opponent is ahead, you can simply change strategy without any concern.  my final one is if you have a cavalry civ, then scout rush is just as good, you can get there faster too and harras in a different way, similar to archer rush, but you're just looking for taking the clear lead to finish off in castle."

aoe2,3dlnzq,yaak_yaak,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:10 2015 UTC,Some of the strategys posted here only apply to Arabia and other open land maps So if different maps are played these will not work for you.
aoe2,3dlnzq,vernocchi,3,Fri Jul 17 12:53:08 2015 UTC,"Cheesiest would be probably the Tower Rush (similar to Protoss) but it's pretty counterable if you see it coming and leaves your ECO in a very bad position afterwards. It's incredibly annoying to deal with though.   If you really wanna go for cheese the Persian Dush is also an option. It involves destroying your town center and building it again right next to your opponent's Town Center.   The de-facto main build/strategy for AoE 2 is the Drush, which involves rushing with 3/5 militia + scout in the Dark Age.   Go YouTube all these words I gave you! :D"
aoe2,3dlnzq,yaak_yaak,6,Fri Jul 17 07:41:14 2015 UTC,I may be mistaken here but isn't it the persian douche? I've seen you refer to it as the dush twice and now I'm confused.

aoe2,3dlnzq,CommanderDerpington,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:18:31 2015 UTC,"OP is looking for cheese and he comes from SC2. He'll be fine. Trush is relatively easy to execute, as well as the DUSH. The Drush is probably the hardest one to pull out perfectly."
aoe2,3dlnzq,xThomas,2,Fri Jul 17 08:20:38 2015 UTC,"Some valid points you are raising here, I suppose it comes down to how much experience OP already has and how proficient his expected opposition will be.   OP, These rushes vernocchi has recommended are high risk/high reward situations and should be carefully considered before committing, and I do not recommend trying to drush this early in your career. But vernocchi is correct. You will most likely dumpster these kids with even a sloppy trush, as it is a very difficult strategy to fend off. However you should keep in mind it does take a little skill and hurts your economy if it fails.  Trush video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hvsIGlruhtY  Sorry for mobile link and the fact the the video isn't super tutorialy as much as a demonstration. Trushing is just something people are expected to know how to do automatically somehow so there aren't a lot of trush tutorials to chose from. Although this guy is 2k plus so he knows what he's doing."
aoe2,3dlnzq,a_moose_called_jim,4,Fri Jul 17 08:41:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. Let me add in any case that the AoE2 compo will not be my main focus/forte of the LAN, but ranking in the top 3-5 for this compo would boost my end result and probably translate into a better prize in the final ranking.  Because of this, I have absolutely not problem doing all-in strategies. If I lose against an opponent that knows how to stop these kinds of rushes, I'll have absolutely no regrets."
aoe2,3dlnzq,DulcetFox,5,Fri Jul 17 08:58:27 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, trush. Make sure your first tower can't be seen by your oponent, add military when you can and keep vill production up."

aoe2,3dlnzq,molsz28,2,Fri Jul 17 09:43:58 2015 UTC,"Trush build depends on the civ, but a general one would be like 6sheep, 7-9 wood, 10-20 food click fuedal. On the way up to fuedal transfer 3-4 on stone, keep 6 vills on food, send 4-5 vills toward your oponent and the rest can stick on wood since you need to build a few buildings and farms in the fuedal age.   Most of the time if you do this vs computer they just won't defend against it and you'll get an easy win. Hopefully it is the same vs newer players."
aoe2,3dlnzq,RobotKitten,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:58:25 2015 UTC,The eco is incredibly different between SC2 and AOE2. AOE2 is a much harder game macro wise.
aoe2,3dlnzq,CommanderDerpington,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:11:29 2015 UTC,"Drush wall + fc Huns is your best bet. This is a bit advanced on the micro side, but basically you do  28 villagers in dark age while attacking early with militia and the scout at the same time, before 8 minutes. You build some palisade walls.. Make sure you plan your walls to use buildings as part of walls. You can easily practice a dozen games in a day if you have Internet. Fc (fast castle) is necessary when dealing with players who just won't give up, so there's that whole not lasting 2 hours thing for you.  If you need an alternate easier less intense strategy for feudal wars, build like 20 archers in feudal, advance to castle at 18-22 minutes and upgrade to crossbows.   Finally there's laming, laming is hardest t pull off and not recommended. People hate laming and sometimes ban it, which is basically: wall enemy resources, kill enemy deer, steal boar, kill enemy villagers while they are hunting boar, kill sheep, steal sheep, build a town center next to theirs and shoot at it.."
aoe2,3dlnzq,HugoChavezRamboIII,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:47:13 2015 UTC,"a lot of the strats mentioned (fc knight rush, archer rush, scout rush, tower rush) are definitely valid but these are legit strats that certainly don't qualify as ""cheese"" and can be difficult to execute well for a totally inexperienced player.  a true ""cheese"" option would be all-in militia rush in dark age with a few forward vils to wall opponents resources (gold, stone, wood).  you can even wall him into his base if you feel like it.  this strat will allow you to devote minimal attention to eco, not worry about age advancement times, put constant pressure on the enemy, and allow you to focus basically all your time on micro ur militia.  against an inexperienced player with slow feudal times and poor walling skills, this will totally demoralize him and could lead to sub 20 min gg.  off the top of my head basic build is:  6 vils on sheep 4 on wood 1 to get boar 4 to berries 1 for other boar then send vils to berries / boar / sheep until you build your barracks (should build around 6:30 or when you get 175 wood -- dont build farms until building the barracks) then send 2 vils to take gold and start pumping militia.  once you get 3 militia, send them forward with 1/2 vils.  use the vils to palisade wall enemy resources (gold and stone piles, also mills and lumber camps) and use the milita to annoy the enemy vils.  dont fight when outnumbered and save ur militia until you get a good mass, then you can be more aggressive w them.  im assuming sinc e you play sc2 that you have decent enought micro to manage this  the rest of the vils should go to farms (put on straggler tress around your tc until you get enough wood to build a farm) with some on wood (think you need like 1 vil per 2/3 farms in dark age).  then you can either keep making farms, stockpile food to go to feudal and upgrade to men at arms, or you can add a few more vils to wood and add another barracks.  will need 2 vils on gold for each barracks for constant production (cant remember exactly how many farms but would guess maybe 6/7 would do it)  would probably use huns for thsi strat as not having to build houses is one less thing to worry about. could also use celts as theri militia move faster (other civs' infantry bonuses dont kick in til feudal iirc) and they cut wood faster"
aoe2,3dlnzq,RajaRajaC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"It's really important that you know what type of map you will be playing on. If you are playing on water maps or arena then literally none of these strategies will work. You'll also want to find out which civs you are playing with. If you play a meso civ like Mayans or Aztecs then you won't get any knights. If you can choose civs then you will probably want to choose Huns.  On an open land map I strongly recommend against doing a drush. Sometimes you can destroy noobs who don't research loom with a drush, but the drush is not about killing your opponent but rather about slowing them down so they can't attack you during the feudal age quickly enough to stop you from getting a fast castle. The drush is microintensive though, and against newbs you would probably be safe simply doing a fast castle without a drush and spamming knights. If they are truly newbs and you follow a build order then you should have knights in their base while they are still in feudal and without any real army."
aoe2,3dlnzq,Fall_Star,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:11:42 2015 UTC,"I've played AoE II for over a decade, and the cheesiest of them all is the Teuton tower rush (trush).  Teuton towers hold more villagers  and have murder holes (enemy villagers can't easily kill them just by running up to them).  Even if you know the teuton trush is coming, it's difficult to stop on any open map.  All you have to do is hit Feudal before your enemy.  The runner up is the Persian TC drop.  Before your enemy goes Feudal, you delete your TC, take all of your villagers except a few lumberjacks, and build a new TC right by theirs.  Remember to wall in your villagers as they are building)."

aoe2,3djb4p,needude72,3,Fri Jul 17 10:17:58 2015 UTC,"I think there were 3 intended scenarios:  1) You attack and kill Bleda while he is fighting the boar  2) Bleda kills the boar, then his archers come to finish you off while you get reinforcements of your own  3) You run away, triggering a conflict  4) Someone mentioned the other day that there is a bug and you can make it out without killing him, and you can actually convert him since Bleda is not a hero (does not regen HP). The game won't let you win until he's dead though.  I always figured the best thing to do is kill him while he attacks the boar, because then you don't have to deal with Bleda + all of his soldiers all at once."

Aside from some hilarious dialogue and spontaneous resolution you get a few extra villagers because they still spawn when you cross the western river.    Bleda wastes our time, let us follow Attila!

From a top-down perspective, fleshing out all the majour world-wide occurrences would be a great addition, and then after that maybe focusing on regional squabbles and battles.  Viking raids across Europe were a huge shake up for a while and I'd be thrilled to play these, from a historically accurate perspective.  Normandy, anyone?  Colonization of the UK - I think only the Welsh were able to hold back a pocket from them.  More of the Middle Eastern events would be grand. Asian events (Japan, Korea, Indians).

Yes, that would be awesome. Would be even better if you can play both perspectives, for narrative purposes. Though it's probably not possible. If I'm not mistaking there are some interesting player-made campaigns where you play one-side one scenario and the otherside the other scenario (because the historical win falls with the other team); added bonus is that you might see the event from multiple perspectives (instead of identifying with that one side you've played from start to finish).  I'd also really love campaigns or at least some scenarios within a campaign where fighting isn't the idea. There was this scenario in a player made campaign about the... first (or second) crusade where you started out as 1 monk, that had to convert villagers (what would instantly convert back), so you can raise money for your cause. I really loved that one.  I'm hoping that with this new expansion there will also be a campaign/scenario (like those Battles of the Conquerors) that focuses on the Indian Ocean trade, with trade being the thing of focus.  Internal events would also be a great addition! All these things can change the whole way of looking at those campaigns/scenarios."

I actually love AoE3 too despite the hate it gets, its a more casual game, sure, but its fun in its own respect. Having said that though, I don't really think these bonuses would work in a game like AoE2. The hungarians are already largely covered by the magyars and the austrians by the teutons/goths. Also those units were used more in the AoE3 timeframe and don't make much sense here.  One thing I do really agree with however is I think it would be neat if each civilization had unique buildings. The game could always do more to differentiate the civs and make them feel truly distinct. In fact, I would say that the reason this game has so many civilizations is in part because none of them really play too substantially different from one another. I think the best idea in here is the blockhouse thing, which would totally make an awesome unique building for the slavs. In fact, I've made a huge list of unique buildings I thought would be cool to have in game:  Italians - Genoese Towers - Expensive towers with a huge bonus against ships and with a large LoS/range, but very low base damage  Byzantines - Caltrop Field - A building that you can walk over like a farm, except enemy cavalry slowly takes damage over time while on it. Costs gold and loses health in direct proportion to the damage it inflicts  Japanese - Shrine - Building that heals only very close units slowly  Turks - Port - Large dock that builds ships more quickly and returns food in addition to the normal gold from trade cogs.  Vikings - Longhouse - Supports large population more cost-effectively than a house and can garrison units inside for a low- ranged throwing axe attack which ignore pierce armor obviously. Very good against rams and trash rushes.  Persians - Caravanserai - Building capable of garrisoning persian trade carts for a ranged attack. Trade line is very hard to raid.  Inca - Road - A small stone cost for a building that you can walk over (like a farm) and have military units move more quickly upon to stream line military movement and reinforcements.  Hey if you translate this too, tell me what you think!"

aoe2,3dkp5t,MaxRavenclaw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:28:52 2015 UTC,You ruined my civ ;_;....just joking But seriously i know i kind of get inspired in the exlusive units and blockhouses but i want to know your opinion about the tech an bonuses. For exmple the hungarian castle makes buildings much tankier against siege..but not against units such as champion petard and militia drivates ( teutonic knight to). The point is making games more interesting obligating players to get back to the infantary and militia types of units ( that also makes easier to my civ to kill them muhahahah). I want to know what do you think about this idea and the fact that amazibg austrio hungarian empire would be an DEFENSIVE AND NOT AGRESSIVE CIV( just byz and teutons are). .Now about your ideas: the inca road is great but it would make the teutons the best civ in the game if acompnied by incas ( imagine an teonic knight at the speed of a normal infantary?). The italian is also preety cool ( i always liked to resist to a mass viking navy like that). The byzantine is also great but i am to lazy to repair them all the time :P. The japanese shrine looks kind of uselles sunce we have monks ( my opinion bro) and it is lso slow (it coyld be viable if it was able to be built at feudal age). The longhouse looksblike an teutonic castle that brings pop. I actually liked them and the fact ut ignorates pierce armoe but for me is imcomplete you know :/ The turk port would be essential in water maps with little wood and food but it kinda of desrespects the vikings :/ Persians: finally i can protect my precious money cars:D

aoe2,3dh7eu,sweetjones1,2,Fri Jul 17 09:30:46 2015 UTC,"Persians are definitely stronger earlier in the game   Fully upgraded massed elephants are pretty unstoppable. They're strongest in late game. They need to be outnumbered by spears 7 to one (and be attacked on their own, otherwise the trample damage from other elephants kills any incoming spears almost instantly), or need to be converted by monks. I've played hundreds of games with Persians and 95% of the time no one thinks to use monks. The 5% of the time they do, they get two or three elephants (most I've seen is 10) before they get trampled over. The only thing that can stand a chance against them are massed marmelukes/scorpions in a bottleneck, or Forgotten Spanish monks. If the elephants can reach them, they're mince meat. 20 base attack, +4 from blacksmith, and +6 from their trample damage (and even more damage if attacking adjacent units).  For comparison, a fully upgraded mameluke has 14 attack + a 12 attack bonus to elephants."

aoe2,3dh7eu,sweetjones1,2,Fri Jul 17 12:48:54 2015 UTC,"Gunpowder isn't good against Persians. Persians are literally the only civ without 2-handed swordsman, they won't go for an infantry build. Elephants are faster than hand cannons and are tanky enough to get to them, because they have 600 health and 3 pierce armor. Elite Jannisaries have 40 HP, they are two hit by a single elephant, and if there are more than one elephants attacking in an army, they're one hit because of trample damage. Unless Jannies can get in 32 hits on an elephant before elephants get in 2, they are beaten. In terms of gold cost, you get 10 jannies for every 7 elephants, and by Imperial the Persians 20% all-resource bonus makes food incredibly easy to come by, and they mine gold faster than the Turks, who have the 15% gold bonus as their only eco bonus.  Persians obliterate jannies on paper and I've seen them torn apart in games dozens of times. They don't stack up unless in an extreme bottleneck. And if they are in an extreme bottleneck, then they can send in paladins second only to Frankish Paladins (which get a +2 bonus against jannies because of their team bonus) to get there quickly, or use their onagers that come with siege engineers. Without a bottleneck, there's nothing Turks can do to stop them. Their monks aren't spectacular, their unique unit is squishy, and they lack the only counter unit to cavalry, literally the only civ without a pikeman."

aoe2,3dh7eu,sweetjones1,2,Fri Jul 17 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"Turk immediately makes hand cannon from 4-5 ranges, bombard cannons from 2 workshops. How many elephants can the persian get out at this time and with what upgrades?    Depends on how you're splitting. They train faster than bombard cannons and are cheaper. Even if outnumbered by something like 5 to one with hand cannons, elephants can clear them out. You can easily produce 1 elephant as quickly as 5 hand cannons. If they aren't, training knights in 4-5 stables will give them the 2nd best knights in the game, and the best knights at taking out hand cannoneers because of their attack bonus towards archers. Bombard cannons and hand cannons aren't counters for elephants unless in an extreme bottleneck and far, far outnumbering the opposition.  You can train elephants in castle at the same speed as you can train jannies in castle for Turks. By time you get to imperial you'll have a bunch of elephants waiting while hand cannons haven't even been trained. And hand cannons are essentially skirmishers against slightly-slower knights when you do the math. They've got 35 health and no defense, with 17 attack vs. 600 health and 3 pierce-armor and 20 attack (unupgraded elite elephant vs. unupgraded hand cannon). They simply aren't good units for dealing with elephants if the elephants can get to them. If the elephant takes out two hand cannons before they die, they are worth the gold cost, though they'll likely take out dozens. Elephants with their speed upgrades are faster than hand cannons, you can't micro away from them. When elephants have their 3+4 defense, hand cannoneers do 10 damage to them. You need 60 hand canonneers firing simultaneously to kill one elephant. If you have a group of elephants doing trample damage, you need one elephant to one-hit kill one hand cannoneer if they are standing adjacent to each other. They're obliterated in every possible way. A unit slower than the other unit, with 50% of the attack of the other unit, with 5% the HP, without a bonus against the other unit will not beat it unless incredibly massed. Math just doesn't stack up. I've trampled over Turks dozens of times. The one time where it was a war of attrition-stalemate loss was in a black forest bottleneck where I was outnumbered 5-to-one with fully upgraded jannisarries vs. fully upgraded elephants. If I had just invested in bombard cannons, I would've won, because nothing can pressure elephants besides massed heavily upgraded monks in a bottleneck."
aoe2,3dh7eu,PeterPorky,6,Fri Jul 17 18:15:43 2015 UTC,"None, really, because there are also water maps. Even your example presupposes that it's a land map and also that the Turks don't have trade, because Turks with gold can handle Persian cavalry as well as anyone (who's not the Saracens) using janisarries and camels. And on a water map you can fight Persians with Turks easy. But say for example in the late game with trade you're Vikings vs Teutons. On land, you haven't got a chance. Your cavalry is horrible, your melee troops are worthless against Teutonic Knight armor, and your ranged troops can't cope with Teutonic Siege. But put it on a water map, and suddenly you're way stronger than they are. And that's entirely discounting the early game, where things tend to be a bit more balanced."
aoe2,3dh7eu,fearsomeduckins,3,Thu Jul 16 06:53:16 2015 UTC,"Vikings are favoured vs Teutons on open landmaps like arabia.

There are very few instances in the game where you've got no chance at all (assuming equal skill), but post-Imp Vikings vs Teutons (or Koreans, or Mongols, etc) with a good economy on both sides and no lack of gold is about as heavily stacked against you as you can get.

The best counter to elephants is what? - Monks. So that means then enemy will make some monks to convert your elephants if u are persia. So what a persian player has to do is pretty much to make some monks in advance in order to ""reconvert"" the lost elephants and then not losing the push (which BF is all about etc).

aoe2,3ded8q,kw1k2345,5,Thu Jul 16 09:18:32 2015 UTC,"I know opinions vary on the Byzantines as a civ, but I love them for closed maps. They have strong defensive bonuses out of the gate and can counter-tech to pretty much anything the enemy uses. Cheaper pikes/skirmishers are a huge benefit for late-game scenarios and for making super efficient combined arms pushes (which Turks don't do very well). Their guns are, of course, technically inferior because they doesn't have a bonus, but they're still excellent.  Note that the Byzantines tend to really shine in a corner/pocket position where they aren't under direct pressure for a while. Their strength is in their ability to pivot, but it takes time and serious booming to get all tech'd up. Having them in the rear means they can play super reactively to whatever is happening at the front lines (instead of being under pressure to tech against an immediate threat), which lets their efficiency skyrocket.  On the flipside, their best ""rush"" is probably a fast-imperial. :P"
aoe2,3ded8q,BallistaMan30,5,Wed Jul 15 18:36:53 2015 UTC,"""They can counter anything"" is often said, but note that countering means being on the defensive. In AoE, you usually want to be on the offensive, rather than on the defensive.   Sure, the civ can counter well, but that means you will never be the aggressor, you will never exert pressure on your opponent, and you will not dictate the pace of the game. These are serious problems.  By the way, note that ""cheap trash"" is pretty much useless on a map like BF where you are never resource-constrained to begin with: it being closed means your farms will be fine all game, you have loads of wood available, and in the late game, your trade should sustain mass production of gold units."
aoe2,3ded8q,johnloeber,2,Wed Jul 15 23:12:42 2015 UTC,Byzantine's lack of siege engineers or siege onagers makes them pretty weak on the offensive. If I ever get randomed into Byzantines in BF I just help my team hold ground by spamming bombard towers and halbs.

Regardless, the up time for the goth player will have been massively delayed, and briton will get through eventually. Some BF maps are very open, to the point where it isnt worth it to wall in the beginning. That favors briton. If there is a very long and thin way  between the players, it's difficult for the briton to get fwd wall, and then it's in favor of the goth as he can just triple or quad wall.

You always want to trick your opponent into building units that are weak to your closing unit (longbowmen)  My best piece of advice is don't open with the unit you want to close with, you never want to build one unit for the entire game or else your enemy will just build hard counters for the entire game.  Step 1) build a few knights  Step 2) make sure enemy sees knights so he builds pikes to counter  Step 3) Poke at their eco/stall with your knight army to buy you some time and encourage pike production  step 4) Mass longbowmen to shit all over their now worthless pike army   You get where I'm going with this?

Not nearly as effective as either civ, obviously, but I don't see how you can get bored with them.  My issue with the Saracens is that their complete lack of any meaningful economic bonus means their start is... atrocious. But I wouldn't call them boring."

Keep practicing them to get them solid, this works fine vs AI. Allows you to play and restart whenever you want.  If you go for a flush build which is 2 archery ranges with constant archer production and a blacksmith for fletching. You can simply add 1-2 more villager to gold besides the 7 for army production, and rest of villagers to wood and make farms whenever you have 60w left. This way you will collect 800f and 200g above your expenses for army and you can click to castle age. It is quite easy, and it is the main reason why going archers is nice in feudal age, allows for easy eco balance."

Turtling isn't really favoured in aoe because defending always requires at least some villager idle time, which is bad for your economy. The enemy doesnt even need to kill villagers to do significant economical damage if you're just waiting for him to come.  Teutons, then. Their towers garisson twice as much so you can keep more villagers safe from harm with a single tower (building more than one tower in your own base is uncommon because you only start with 200 stone, and in the castle age all your stone should be used on catles). Their eco bonus is solid enough for any situation.   Finally, their castles are very well suited for point defence; not only do they have more range when the teuton UT is researched, but the ability to create teutonic knights is pretty much 'ram-insurance': If an enemy has an army and some rams standing in front of your castle, and he's moving in the rams create some TKs, your opponent will have to respond by either:   moving his army underneath the castle to try and kill the TKs. This is only cost-effective for him if he's using archery range units, who die extremely quickly under arrow fire, such as from a castle.  Do nothing or try to pull back his rams. You get his rams  (or some of them) killed for free because TKs pack a really big melee punch.   Most importantly for a turtling civ of course: the teutons have a really good lategame. Paladins, siege onagers, hand cannoneers, and a situational but powerful UU."

I assumed what OP meant was a strategy where you don't make much army but rather defences to overcome the opponent's army. If you do that on an open map, which can be walled but it is prohibitively expensive to do so (lots of wood/stone spent, loads of time wasted on villagers building walls), the enemy doesnt even need to attack and harass your eco to gain an advantage on you. (on a side note: there is always a hole)  Anyway, to answer your question, if your eco is attacked but you have a watch tower nearby, you can put the villagers inside but if the enemy army just waits around the corner or keeps coming back there, your villagers are sitting ducks."

It blows my mind, though, that the team only recently started seriously looking into this. It's too bad the performance wasn't the top priority from the start. From what I've seen, the lag has become far and away the most salient aspect of AOE2HD's reputation.  Could you explain why we only see this problem on HD edition?"
aoe2,3d23sg,CysionBE,15,Sun Jul 12 23:19:58 2015 UTC,"It's been on the plate for a long time, that's why a lot of patches came with small performance updates. Many of which did not affect all players or even worked against some players. However, these small changes added up over time, notably patch 3.9 included some huge perf boost seen by everyone. Right off the bat, which is a year ago by now (I cannot speak for anything that happened at the release of HD, we -Forgotten Empires- only joined later), we talked about performance and how to solve it. However, this was always considered a way too big task, almost having to rewrite the whole engine in certain aspects. Now, with 4.0, a lot of the engine had to be rewritten, mainly the UI rendering, for the new mod manager, the unified lobby and some more things. This new UI rendering unearthed a lot of problems which were hard to pin down before. So now we could see the exact problems and we revisited the separation of the graphics rendering again. At this point, it actually seemed like a feasible task and thus an engineer committed to solve the problem once and for all.   As for why it's only seen in the HD edition: I don't know, I'm not a programmer :P  However, HD did some graphical updates (like the smooth FOW, AA shadows, 3D water, 32 bit SLPs) and my guess is that they put a strain on the old engine."

It's generally accepted within the programming industry that the notion you can just identify a deep-rooted problem and solve it by rewriting everything in one go just doesn't work; it is much better to continually iterate, make small improvements that address both superficial and underlying architectural issues, until you reach the point that solving the initial problem becomes far easier and manageable.

We're talking about a software platform that was developed in the late 90's -- of course it's going to need large-scale changes to run effectively on modern hardware.  While I'm sure most of the engine's existing logic works well, I would imagine that performance-wise, it doesn't make the best use of modern resources (does the engine make effective use of concurrency, for example?). Does it use antiquated graphics libraries? I wish these under-the-hood changes were the primary focus earlier."

aoe2,3d23sg,norther_,3,Sun Jul 12 23:58:35 2015 UTC,"Depends in what way you want it to ""compete""? If we're talking performance, then the upcoming patch will be the one to judge it by. For me personally on the beta builds, it's running more responsive and smooth than UP, especially on super busy maps (crowded Black Forest for example). However, I cannot judge this for other computers, which will be the big test."
aoe2,3d23sg,CysionBE,2,Mon Jul 13 06:24:22 2015 UTC,"I ment being an equally good platform in terms of performance, indeed. Even if HD would somehow get better than voobly, I don't think there would be much of improvement to the HD side of competetive play.   Also, what does ""big computers"" mean? I have a quad core i7 with gefore gt840 and this game is choppy and laggs in single player. One could think that a game like age of empires (hd or not) would suit with some very mediocre computer."

aoe2,3d0w0e,ProfessionalWingman,3,Sun Jul 12 16:17:20 2015 UTC,"The great battle of Bouvines, fought on 27 July 1214 on the road between Tournai and Lille, brought to conclusion a multitude of conflicts that had been raging in Western Europe for a long time. Emperor Otto IV of the Holy Roman Empire had been deposed by the Pope, and Otto hoped that, by beating the principal protector of the Papacy, Philippe Augustus of France, he would be able to enjoy superiority over his opponents at home. He attracted a great many allies, principally the Ferrand, count of Flanders, and King John of England.  Flanders had been claimed by France for over a century, and had joined the alliance to throw off the shackles of French rule once and for all. Situated on the border of the Holy Roman Empire and France, its position had always been hazy; but as the Emperors were generally weaker and had less autonomy over their vassals, the Flemish believed joining the Empire would be to their advantage.  King John, on the other hand, was fighting to regain all the lands lost to France in the previous decade - all part of the inheritance of his father, Henry II, who had owned Aquitaine, Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Poitou and Picardy. John himself would command the war effort from Aquitaine and Brittany, distracting part of Philippe's forces; but he sent a detachment under William Longsword, Count of Salisbury, to help Otto IV on the northern front.  While the French were crossing the bridge of Bouvines, heading west, they received news that the Emperor's forces were marching towards them at great speed. The Burgundian troops of Duke Eudes quickly left Philippe's army to fight a rear guard action against the imperials. They were successful, and bought enough time for the French army to turn around and array itself in neat formation on the heights east of Bouvines. The forces of the Emperor were in less good order, as they had been marching at full speed for half the day, and their infantry in particular had fallen behind.  The Flemish were positioned on the left flank of the imperial army; German (and Dutch) troops made up the centre, while English and German troops were on the right flank. Fighting commenced first on the right flank, with Flemish and Burgundian troops charging each other; the fight soon spread to the entire front line, with the French cavalry proving particularly effective in thick and tight formations, which smashed through the less densely packed imperial formations.  The centre of the German line proved strongest by far, strengthened by battle-hardened Brabançons and Flemish forces, who could keep the French knights at a distance with their polearms. Nevertheless, the French smashed through the imperial right, and outflanked the centre. Otto IV was nearly captured before his Saxon forces grouped tightly around him and escorted him to safety, abandoning the field. Seeing the Emperor leave was a shock to the rest of the army, and their forces collapsed under the French assault. Only the Brabançons held their nerve, forming a powerful schiltron which beat off multiple French attacks. Eventually, however, they too were overcome and scattered.  From the Chronicle of the Anonymous of Bethune: ""What more can I tell you? The Emperor's men and those of Count Ferrand were completely defeated. Count Ferrand himself was taken, as I told you, with many great men from his land. From amongst the King of England's people William Longsword, Count of Salisbury, brother of the King of England, was taken.  It was a marvel that the number of barons, bachelors, sergeants taken was so great. They were pursued over two miles of land. The emperor took flight towards Valenciennes, and spent the night at the Abbey of Saint-Sage, and the others ran away to various places as best as thoroughly vanquished people could."""

aoe2,3d10t7,needude72,5,Sun Jul 12 17:00:52 2015 UTC,"Best known scenario that was broken is the 2nd scenario in Barbarossa campaign on Age of Kings. If you kill all the units of one of your allies, you win the scenario at 6:40 when your ally is supposed to send you resources to win the game.  Another one is in Genghis khan 1, you can set your one of the 2 tribes that are at war with each other to neutral and kill all their units, before receiving and instantly completing the task with the other tribe.  You can do most scenarios in a shorter way than the intended route. In the end you'll just have to unlock the Victory Condition trigger and reach the conditions in it to win the scenario."
aoe2,3d10t7,S1Fly,3,Sun Jul 12 18:15:23 2015 UTC,"i'll just explain the Dos Pilas exploit here:  the game is programmed to send an attack to your temporary base a few minutes after you hit the castle age and you are supposed to make a choice between surrendering the city or betraying your allies. before advancing in age you can build 2 extra towers by the western gate (making 4 in total) and getting 5 achers in each.  when you advance you have enough time to build a university, and get bodkin arrows, crossbowman, balistics, guard tower and murder holes before the attack hits. when the attack hits the game sets them as allies so they can get through your gate (you can lock it to stop this and set them back to enemy). if you kill the attacking army instead of picking a side all the AI players simply freeze, allowing you to roll a few rams towards one of the two wonders to win"

Bleda, whether accidentally by the devs or on purpose, is not a hero unit. This means he doesn't regenerate, and he can be converted. To get him converted you will need to run from the hun camp at the start of the mission to the stable in the west. THere you get villagers to build a TC with. Bleda will then attack but with some major walling you might be able to keep him out until you reach the castle age. Bleda creates no units so you only need to get rid of his tarkans and then leave him alive. If bleda cant reach atilla he'll randomly start scouting the map; He is allied with everyone however so he doesnt die. Once you convert him, you need to personally send him to his death for the scenario to proceed."

aoe2,3d1bbx,HasteMaNeMark,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:29:47 2015 UTC,"Generally micro is more important in the early game and it shifts to macro as the game progresses. Apm as in speed? Sure, in most rts  games speed is huge factor. The same is true for aoc, although probably not to the extent as it is the case in scbw/sc2. My tip for you: in my opinion aoc is a lot deeper than sc2. Many things need to be learnt and considered when choosing a strategy etc and especially on low level, a better strategy and solid build up will always win vs the player microing the shit out of 2 units while having an imbalanced economy (unlike on expert level where players are a lot closer economy wise etc). So don't try to approach the game thinking you need to be the fastest to win and spam clicks etc. Just focus on getting the basics straight and play clean and according to your map, then speed will come by itself."

aoe2,3d1bbx,geckogod5,2,Sun Jul 12 21:03:19 2015 UTC,"It is quite common for a game to be a constant skirmish between players and go back and forth. That's why players tend to build 120+ villagers and have comparatively small armies that they constantly reinforce. That's also why killing the enemy's economy is so crucial and can often decide a game. That being said, I don't know how your specific situation looked like, but you usually also want a few units that can destroy buildings. E.g.  there's no point in attacking a castle with your 10 knights - just add 2 rams."

You have 4 resources you have to balance and try to get the right amount for your strategy.  It is much more macro based, since you need to care about those things before you can think about micro.

EDIT: The mod also has a historically correct campaign, displaying the Battle of Bouvines, start of the Hundred Years War, and more fucking important events I can't remember EDIT 2: Oh right, it displays; the battle of Bouvines, the Barons’ War, the conquest of West Friesland, the battle of Kortrijk, the start of the Hundred Years War, the Chioggia War, the siege of Maastricht, the battle of Vitkov Hill and the siege of Neuss  EDIT 3: The mod makes another .exe so you can still play vanilla. The mod is not available on HD because of the civilization limit on HD, if the devs make something about that I don't know why this mod wouldn't be ported to HD. (I don't know if this is true, but I heard it like this)  I also recommend anyone who downloads the mod to play throught the campaign with Custom Campaigns button first because it introduces the new changes, and the scenarios are just straight masterpieces. Especially the battle of Vitkov Hill  TL;DR: Get Userpatch, get Age of Chivalry: Hegemony and enjoy the game."

aoe2,3cvcl2,CheesewithWhine,7,Sat Jul 11 02:10:41 2015 UTC,"Don't see why the Turks need Pikemen. Their late game is very strong, if you have gold, which is intentional and in my opinion interesting design. Heavy Camels kill most cavalry just fine, and they have plenty of options against War Elephants. It also does not solve the problem that the Turks are just weak on open maps."
aoe2,3cvcl2,thedboy,3,Sat Jul 11 08:36:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. Turks would be close to unstoppable if they could also spam decent trash units backed up by guns and camels.
aoe2,3cvcl2,Bunnyhat,7,Sat Jul 11 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"Spanish- +50 gold to start? The Spanish early game isn't good, they pretty much either have to boom or scout rush. This gives them an extra option of a Drush to harass with. Makes historical sense given their time in South America. Perhaps a bit OP though since they do have a really nice Castle Age with Knights and Conquistadors."
aoe2,3cvcl2,Severa_AoE,2,Sat Jul 11 06:43:34 2015 UTC,I suggest +20 gold. This enables the spanish to execute a strong 4 militia drush rather than the 5 that the aztecs get. The spanish castle age is simply too strong to give them a 5 militia drush.
aoe2,3cvcl2,geckogod5,2,Sat Jul 11 07:04:01 2015 UTC,I don't think there is really anything wrong with the spanish. They're already a pretty well rounded civ and I could think of plenty other civs that could use an early game boost more than the spanish.
aoe2,3cvcl2,LadiesAndMentlegen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:14:05 2015 UTC,"They're very bad on open maps in 1v1 since they lack crossbowmen, which dominate castle age warfare. Otherwise pretty well-rounded."

aoe2,3cvcl2,thedboy,5,Sat Jul 11 08:24:04 2015 UTC,"Franks- I feel like the franks already have an amazing castle age rush, I think it would be better however if they still didn't get bloodlines, but instead their bonus was tweaked to 25% instead of 20%. This would give their knight line a slightly greater edge, plus the numbers just look prettier: 125 hp knights, 150 hp cavaliers, 200 hp paladins. Otherwise I feel like the cavalry armor upgrades are unnecessary insofar that they only further solidify their role as a one trick pony. I think they're a decently viable civ after the forgotten empire changes.  Byzantines - ehh, I feel like having a significant reduction on two age advancements is just a better version of the italians 10% off each age. They probably could use it more anyways. I don't play as the byzantines alot, nor do I know what is or isn't OP for them, but maybe reducing the cost of some of their imperial age techs slightly might help things, I only know they're quite expensive.  Inca - I think couriers should affect ALL units and be made a more expensive tech to counterbalance that. This would forseeably give their economy a necessary imperial age boost in addition to faster military units. Plus it kinda makes sense. This is a tech justified by their expansive road system, which was used by military personnel and civilians alike. As for their eagles, I would make them at least a solid 20% cheaper, if not slightly more. Eagles are the core of a meso civ and just having them be slightly faster and cheaper seems fair next to the mayan and aztec +40 hp or +4 atk. Lastly, they lack a real power unit, and the kamayuk is no power unit, however, I saw an idea in a thread earlier for kamayuks to do splash damage in one square behind the one they're attacking and that seemed like a reasonable enough buff. They are a unit that works wonders when properly organized, and I think that splash damage could further stress the importance of their careful use. If all of these were implemented I think they would at least be on par with other meso civs, maybe even slightly OP.  Indians - The indians could be made far more viable just by removing the building bonus against camels alone, giving them far more raiding power during the castle age. Also, I would give the elephant archer either the ability to fire multiple arrows or more range (He's standing on top of a goddamn elephant)  Italians - I would give them the siege engineers tech, I would give them -15% on each age instead of -10%, and I would increase the gunpowder resistance of condottieri  Teutons - I'd make the teutonic knight slightly faster, but only for the imperial upgrade, which is already quite expensive. The reason being because during the imperial age, hand cannoneers, arbalests, heavy cavalry archers, really anything with range becomes an absurd menace to what is a cool, but useless unit because of its speed.  That's all I can really think of for underused civs. I wish I could give the Slavs something too, but only because their civ bonuses seem so boring and uninspired. If you can't tell, I really love the Forgotten civs, but I wish some of them weren't so disappointingly low tier.  Edit: forgot about my teuts"

Turks with gold are stronger than almost all other civs (only a few civs with a ton of time to upgrade can really match them).   Turks are on a timer most other civs aren't, just a feature of that civ. No standard maps force you to fight trash wars - you always get an opportunity to win while you have gold. As Spanish, Byzantines or Magyars, you want to drain your opponent of gold and make the game draw out, so you can win with your superior trash. They work the opposite."

But as an imperial age unit they just don't work well without Bracer.  Saracens even get a bonus towards them (more damage versus buildings), but the Saracens already have so many other things to use. It's nice to have the option though, I guess.  In Forgotten, Japanese have the distinction of being the only civ to get fully upgraded Cavalry Archers without having any kind of bonus towards them.   Turks' are best though in post-imp (even better than Hun Cavalry Archers probably, due to +20 HP and Ring Archer Armor). Still, they're just not very good units and only see use if you have the very top tier and need them for something specific.

I'd actually like to see ethnic units in the game. I.e. Knights for the Japanese look like Mounted Samurai, villagers have different skin colors based on civilization. They don't have to function differently but it would be a HUGE improvement to an HD version of a game. Something I'm surprised they didn't do.  The most important thing to do is to make sure each unit is uniquely identifiable. One of the problems I had with graphical unit updates (jorgito's I think) is that I had trouble identifying one unit from another, and that is a big no-no. So I should be able to tell the difference between an asian knight and an asian light cavalry and asian cavalier."

aoe2,3ct3hx,orthodox_caveman,2,Sat Jul 11 01:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem would be coming up with a unit design so that they are all easily recognizable, with just minor differences to make them culture-specific. And then each one of those would need all its own move/attack/death animations and stuff. Just thinking about it gives me a headache.  Aztecs didn't even use swords as far as I know, they used macanas (weapon of Jaguar warrior) which are just like a club studded with obsidian, or obsidian spears/knives I guess too. You can't really make a long weapon made of a single piece of glass or stone because it will just shatter. So it wouldn't make sense for them to have a unit called a longswordsman or 2H sword...  It always kind of bothered me too but I think it's just one of those things we have to concede, for simplicity's sake. Otherwise you would have to rename the whole structure to something generic like Level 1 or Level 2 Infantry instead of Militia, Man-At-Arms, etc. But who wants to do that?

aoe2,3ct3hx,MakeLoveNotWarPls,2,Tue Jul 14 12:57:58 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, obsidian was the preferred cutting material. Obsidian is a trade-off, it's crazy sharp (it is used in surgery today because it is sharper and cuts better than steel) and easy to craft, but it fractures easily. I've read that after a few hits the blades might just break, but even when they break they are still sharp, just smaller. Aztecs and their neighbors didn't use hard armor very much, so obsidian was perfect for slicing through light armor, but you would have a hard time with a solid metal breastplate like the Spanish might have worn (arms still vulnerable though).   I was reading about Incas and it said that they did make swords from copper but spears were still the preferred weapon. When they were fighting the Spanish they started using swords more since that's what the Spanish were doing."

If new models have to be created it becomes incredibly difficult to keep in the art-style of the game. Some people have already been complaining that the elephant archer looks too detailed and smooth compared to the war elephant for example.   Another problem is that units with new models will become more difficult to recognize.

aoe2,3ct3hx,makerofshoes,21,Fri Jul 10 17:04:44 2015 UTC,"I always thought a skirmisher cavalry unit would be cool.   But why? Cavalry already counter archers, you might say.  I'll tell you why, you patronizing bastard. Because range is a huge deal in this game. Not only can pathing be messy, especially in tight locations, but melee units have a serious limitation when crowding around units. Also, it would allow them to attack over obstacles like walls and stuff.  Why would you use them?  Skirmishers move slow and cavalry archers are fast. Mangudai are arguably (or maybe not so arguably) the strongest unit in the game, and all they need to do is shoot and run. Cav skirmishers would be a nightmare for a Mongol player to deal with, or anyone else who relies on cav archers (Huns, Spanish), the same way that Huskarls are a nightmare for civs like the Britons. Massed Cav archers don't have a solid counter besides ""Don't let your enemy get to that point.""  The camel is sort of like a mounted pikeman, so there is some precedent. To make them fair/balanced, I think give them 3 base range and no minimum range, and pretty close to whatever damage a skirmisher does, and similar bonuses. Also give them a little bit of melee armor since they're on a freakin' horse. Available to build in Castle Age from the archery range, you can adjust the cost and training speed to whatever it needs to be. It will have a gold cost like camels.  WTF? There's nothing like that historically  STFU. There are literally millions (give or take) of books written about exactly what I just described. Notably in North Africa and Spain where light cavalry dominated for centuries (Berbers). The Spanish successfully used units called Jinetes (just means horseman in Spanish) armed with javelin, sword, and shield in response to the Moorish light cavalry. Maybe they could have a small bonus vs cavalry too, as a nod to that part of history.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinete  Who gets them?  Give them to civs with traditions of light cavalry like Spain, Portugal, Berbers, Saracens, Turks, and Magyars. Don't give them to the Mongols. They don't fucking need it, they have Mangudai, dumbass. There are some other civs that might get them for balancing reasons or fun, like Japanese, Persians and Indians. And while we're at it, why not Byzantines, too? They get everything anyways."

On top of that if you fully upgrade your skirms in imp theyre as good as FU castle age crossbows, so even against non-archers they can do some damage. Pikemen on the other hand are not good enough to handle mass paladins for example; and against anything non-cavalry they suck balls"
aoe2,3ct3hx,nightbringer57,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:47:46 2015 UTC,"Well.. They still attack 50% slower, with a minimum range. And most archer units dont fare well against upgraded units of the following age, especially with armor.   Even if the difference isn't that big, skirms still only do 1 or 2 damage against imp units  where arbs deal 3 to 5.  Skirmsishers typically do the least damage of the game, even against archers, their little attack bonus doesn't even make for the slower attack speed. They only deal more damage than regular archers against other skirmishers and elephant archers.   Still skirms don't need an imperial upgrade.

aoe2,3ct3hx,makerofshoes,10,Fri Jul 10 19:26:41 2015 UTC,"If siege towers were introduced, they could take a similar job as the Ram does now, and Rams could become a trash unit (make them ungarrisonable, just there to soak up fire and knock down walls/buildings). Rams are super easy to build compared to onagers/scorpions/siege towers so it makes sense they would not cost gold (often they just had armor made of toughened animal hides).   Of course that will never happen though with the game the way it is and the role of the Ram solidified in everyone's minds. It's possible a siege tower would be introduced but there's not really a role for it right now.  If introduced, Siege Towers could be tougher than rams, have a strong siege melee attack, be garrisonable to a higher degree than rams (more units inside), and like how one user mentioned the other day, be able to ungarrison up to 2 spaces away rather than just 1 (or 1 space away instead of 0, depending on how you count. basically able to unload troops behind a wall)."

A fast horseman, however, can raid, run away, regen, and raid again.  Maybe a regenerating, heavily armored cavalry unit. He'd have high armor and pierce armor, so he'd take very little damage from most units and regen away, but he'd also have low HP such that Halbs and Camels with their big attack bonuses could cut through the armor and kill him.  An Infantry unit with some sort of anti-Siege shield. He'd run around and tank Onager and Heavy Scorpion shots but have lowish HP and be vulnerable to Archers.  A foot Archer that ignores armor and pierce armor. He'd have very low attack but do more damage to Paladins than Arbalests, and he'd be pretty good vs buildings due to ignoring their armor.

Those are really fun if you can't find a ranked game because it allows you to play with players who are lower and higher ranked than you and no one loses or gains elo. I find myself playing them when the HD lobbies are particularly empty.
aoe2,3cpimn,MrKleekus,-2,Fri Jul 10 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most of the decent HD players have actually found their way to voobly ever since patch 4.0 was released. I'd advice you do the same. That said, what I remember from HD is that it get's exponentially harder to find games the further away from ~1600 you are. So my initial thought is that you're just in some bad luck atm. Lots of people tend to be straight up nazis with elo requirements, so I guess what you can do is to host your own game."

Some people like AoE2 because they like playing a castle building simulator. If you tell them to play it like a clicky multiplayer RTS, it turns into a different game that is actively less fun than playing a castle building simulator. So don't bother.  If she manages to crank out large armies eventually, consider high pop games on defensive maps like Michi/Oasis/Black Forest. Just boom to five hundred pop and relax. When she finally has all her paladins in a row, rush out the gate and smack the AIs around.  If she never gets to that stage, consider buying her Stronghold 3 for Christmas ;)"

aoe2,3clb8r,fritosdoritos,10,Wed Jul 8 23:47:57 2015 UTC,"This is the post mortem article for the original AoE (it applies to AoE2), by Matt Pritchard. I'm quoting the important part:   All of the 2D sprites in AoE began life as 3D models. Age of Empires contains 20MB of in-game sprite graphics. Even though all of the displays are 2D, we decided early on that all of the graphics in the game would be taken from 3D models. We used 3D Studio and 3D Studio MAX for art production.  Because 3D rendering is so time-consuming, each artist was issued two machines each, both usually 200MHz Pentium Pros with 128MB of RAM, which at the time was better equipment than the programmers were using. The objects in the game were created as 3D models that had anywhere from a couple thousand to 100,000 polygons. The models were then textured, animated, and rendered out to a .FLC (Autodesk Animator) file with a fixed 256-color palette.   I also recommend reading the AoE2 post mortem, also by Pritchard.  EDIT: Just for interest sake, there is this loooong thread where Matt (ES_MattP, the one with the Neo avatar) answer lost of questions and gives insights on how AoE2 was developed and how was it working at Ensemble Studios. Some of the images seem to be lost (fuck you image shack), but it is worth reading if you have time."

aoe2,3cjwv2,norther_,7,Wed Jul 8 14:15:57 2015 UTC,"I find it odd that he doesn't take a look at more expert games and consider that in all hun wars, it's is done around min 14-16. I've always heard that around pop 30 it's gonna be worth it, later if you are heavy on gold and wood, but sooner if you are heavy on farms.   I also see that he gave this video like 99% about economy, when both of the upgrades offers defensive and offensive purposes. Having villagers walk 10% faster means you can garrision them much sooner to TC, meaning you can save more villagers from an incomming raid. The offensive pretty minor, but is that you get to a place quicker, comes in handy if you have forwarded, but again, it's pretty minor.   Assuming he used the right formula for this, I didn't expect it to be that big difference.   I am again pretty sceptical about his conclusion, mostly as it neglects 10 years of aoc META, but also because I feel some parts has been left out."
aoe2,3cjwv2,S1Fly,2,Wed Jul 8 14:22:33 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really neglect AoC meta. You get wheelbarrow early in open maps, because 10% move rate makes a huge difference   It makes the villager go from 0.8 MR to 0.88 MR.   With an archer being 0.96 MR, archers can only shoot half as often as without Wheelbarrow. (not taking into account possible better dodging)  For militia/m@a with 0.9 MR, they will barely catch up.  The meta is that without wheelbarrow you most likely lose some villagers.  Besides that wheelbarrow will be more efficient when placement of resource drop off point is less optimal. In those huns war you have to seed a lot of farms, and often place them around the 2nd row around the TC, in which that additional carry potential and movement rate make more of a difference, aswell at lumbercamp when you cut past the first rows of wood.  I quickly watched this video, but as far as I can tell his calculations are correct. Nice video with interesting thought food. Just keep in mind that in actual game you want it slightly faster, since your villagers move around more."

aoe2,3cjwv2,Clemensor,5,Wed Jul 8 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"my response from the yt side:  Another thing about wheelbarrow is, that it increases the villager walking speed by 10%.so every new added villager after adding wheelbarrow, will automatically go faster to work. Additionally they can get faster away when getting harrassed. 10% can make the difference between life and death :P. Take into account that for meso civs (azt and maya in the conqueros) the boost is lesser than for other civs, because of their farming bonus and especially the carrying bonus from he aztecs, u might want to look into that.

aoe2,3cjwv2,caepe,5,Wed Jul 8 18:56:49 2015 UTC,"I like the effort and thought he puts into this but obviously such things are very hard to quantify with ""simple"" math. There are a lot more things that 10% vil walking speed does than collecting ressources, so it really is hard to value the tech objectively. It varies from game to game as well, so maybe he shouldn't have ripped that guy so hard who said he goes by feeling. There are obviously good benchmarks where you should consider getting the tech, that good players with loads of experience came up with, but I don't think you'll ever be able to say with 100% certainty ""at this point you get the tech""."

He does a simple math aproach towards eco view only, as it is so much harder to quantify it's usefulness, since when you will be attacked and need the speed boost is quite random.

Things were going pretty well, but then I had to go afk for a moment (I have kids) so I queue a bunch of unit production and step away.   I'm gone for a few minutes and come back and miraculously my base has not only survived, but thrived since no one attacked me and now I had a giant pile of resources and a bunch of units created, ready to go. So I start making a bunch more units and upgrades, and start mobilizing, knocking down my enemy's walls and stuff. A few minutes later I notice my ally is shooting onagers at my massed hand cannons and infantry, apparently because he was mad I was gone before or something. I checked the chat log and he never messaged me or anything. So I take down his  onagers with my own and keep playing.   We eventually win the game but it wasn't easy. I have to think that it would have been a lot easier if my ally hadn't been a dick and started a civil war. I ended up getting MVP.

(This is from both sides, and with other allies, it's not just against me)  If you play, you need to understand, playing with unknowns people may not be able to get armies as fast as you might expect, calling everyone noob because they don't have what you expect by the time you want doesn't mean you need to yell at everyone.  You need to work with your team.  (Make knights and send here, then yelling at them when they are not there in 2-3 minutes doesn't really work).  Games with him always seem to end with him quitting after his 'plan' doesn't go as expected, or 2 people start attacking him.  (doesn't look at the other side of the map where the team is destroying them)  Fortunately people like that are rare.  The other is people who try an early rush and when it fails they quit.  The one I can think of here is STORM_Capjaw.  He plays Black Forest, which should be a long game, and of the about 10 games I've played with the guy before finally refusing to play anymore, he ALWAYS monk rushes (usually fails, and then quits right away, without saying/donating anything).  It doesn't matter which side I'm on, this ruins the game.  Doing an all in strategy in a team game is just a waste of everyones time, either you win the game quick, your team wasted their time, or you fail and quit, leaving your team to die anyways...  At least stick it out, or say what you're doing, be a team player.  Like /u/sweetjones1 I've had several who say something then go off and do some bizarre cut or some other failing strat, basically free boom for 40 minutes, while the allies hold things off, then go do something stupid and kill themselves.  This makes me mad, because of their poor communication/teamwork.  If they did something intelligent, we'd have won, but instead they go off doing their own thing trying to win alone.  Teamworks is very important in a team game.  I'd much rather have all noob players on my team that at least try to work as a team, even if it means we loose.  The guys who just wall off their base or whatever, and kinda fun, if it was actually a serious game, it doesn't even matter, so I just laugh and try to help (although few appreciate/understand my suggestions, so it's kinda a loss cause, probably just not sure what to explain to people of that level...  I usually try with explaining that you need to wall chokepoints or wall to protect your economy, explain where I would wall, and that walling off allies is not usually needed, etc.  I guess I'm doing it wrong)"

It is better to spend those 225+ resources on a faster castle age time and boom from there.  The discussion for BF is whether it is worth to go for a dock from 3 or 4 shorefish. Since you obviously delay your castle time, but early food gathering can improve your imperial time if enough shorefish is available and you can actually gather with 2-3 ships. Not sure about the answer anymore, but I think it was still tricky to do with 3 shorefish.   You can still try to gather shorefish with a villager if you have to mill a deer patch/bush closeby."

aoe2,3chcm9,kresos,2,Tue Jul 7 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"No. It's not worth it. There is however an exception, as always, and that's for arena.  It's only worth idleing TC if you know when you force drop food from sheep, you'll get enough for a vill. Basically max ~two seconds if you will. Getting loom early may even be worth it in TG as flank, atleast when you're about to get second boar. If you are up aginst someone you know is laming quite a lot, or just about about any random, it's probably worth doing loom before taking second boar. If you are unlucky, he might run in to you as you take boar to TC and he can block vill and then gg vill. It's a good precaution, and you don't lose out too much on it, especially in lower rated games."
aoe2,3chcm9,norther_,2,Tue Jul 7 22:54:04 2015 UTC,With HD quality lag loom is often advisable.
aoe2,3chcm9,VacuousWaffle,5,Wed Jul 8 05:29:53 2015 UTC,"Never for arena, unless you don't know how to take boars properly"
aoe2,3chcm9,norther_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:21:12 2015 UTC,"Im not sure. If it was at creation of villager  #8-#12, I wouldn't loom unless I was going to be consistently idling my tc at each point. Your net loss of resources over first 20 mins of the game is high if you loom then as opposed to idling  for 10 (ingame) seconds.  After that, you're gonna be looming anyway  at end of dark age(unless BF or arena, maybe islands) so Its not too big a deal and would agree with you for that."
aoe2,3chcm9,argus_panoptes_qn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:18:00 2015 UTC,"15 sec idle time means 15 sec later to feudal, which is crucial for no econimical gain compared to an opponent. The investment of loom also means you don't have to bother about harrassement from enemy scout (do I need to say in dark age), which actually can do serious damage do villagers without loom."
aoe2,3chcm9,norther_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:38:02 2015 UTC,"15 seconds is important-ish, yeah but its not normally at deciding point because you are in fuedal at 10:20 instead of 10:05 (22 pop), you can still get a spear out before he has a second scout and if u had loomed earlier youd have about 60-100 of total resources less at that point.   but im starting to see that because youre 15 seconds behind, he will be a villager ahead for 15/25 of the time after that point. so eventually he is collecting more than you.   So I guess it is a trade off between having a sacrifice of 15 seconds and slowly losing resources after 10:05 relative to your opponent. or being about 60-100 resources behind your opponent at minute 10:05 but in fuedal at the same time. Genuinely do not know which I would prefer"
aoe2,3chcm9,argus_panoptes_qn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:58:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah and what do you do if enemy fwds? 15 sec is a really big deal, you'll be behind in military and with scouts thats' a big deal. For islands maps, that can result in gg water straight away... Put in a perspective of being 2/5ths a villager ahead for what, 4 ingame min? It's like a net eco win at the cost of a much later up time + the fact that you are easily harrassed by enemy scout. I've seen viper do loom by pop 7 when he couldn't find sheep even"
aoe2,3chcm9,norther_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:36:10 2015 UTC,"Im gonna add a side point: Im not sure of your situation but I am assuming that you're talking about early on and u have found sheep slightly late.   A solution: Put 7/8 vils on sheep until you're at the point of food collecting you would have been when you normally have 6 vils on sheep straight away. Once there, move them onto wood. your mill will be slightly late up but thats less important than keeping your tc working."

Don't quote me on this one, but I can't find anything on Barbarossa attacking Poland. The whole mission is propably a reference to WW2 as the opening cinematic says barbarossa invades poland because there was not enough room for the booming German population (Lebensraum). Also, the failed invasion of Russia in WW2 was codenamed 'operation Barbarossa', so thats propably what they're playing at. Henry the Lion never openly betrayed Barbarossa. The only thing I can find on the matter is that Henry once refused to aid Barbarossa in the invasion of Lombardy (Milan). Barbarossa got so mad at this he stripped Henry of his title as duke, after which henry was exiled. Needless to say, Barbarossa did not succeed in conquering Milan, unlike in the campaign. Barbarossa's son tried to get his father's body to Jerusalem but the siege failed and Barbarossa's remains were buried in Tyre instead.   So yeah the only mission that is even remotely right is the 5th mission where barbarossa loses most of his army trying to get to the Holy Land."

It might work but have never ever seen it tried so I don't know..................  Vs someone who doesn't fast imp, that's a terrible idea. Much better to do standard FI then, and mind you that italians have got a pretty neat one with the cost reduction of gunpowder. bbc takes out xbows and mangonels pretty easily whilst massed HC takes out knights. Be aware that the opponent will probably be 3/4 TC and if he knows you are FI, he could just go quad/triple kts and then there is not much you can do to stop it   EDIT: Never really play forgotten, but doesn't italians get some kind of reduction for age advancement?"

There were canoes too which were useful for scouting and fishing or cannon fodder (none of the native units counted towards your pop cap). You could also have proxy wars and just make your Indian allies fight your enemy's Indian allies, Imperialism at its best.  That way you could just make a nod to all these smaller nations without having to add a whole new civ (like the Apache or Swiss).

Nerfing their anti-cavalry bonus sounds like blasphemy to me though, everyone knows that if a unit is holding a spear in a game then it kills horses (/s). Maybe instead of nerfing them, make them cost more and train slow so they are hard to mass?

Research chemistry immediately upon hitting imperial age, then start making hand cannoneers and bombard cannons once you're done. The Italians save 7 food and 7 gold on each hand cannoneer, and 34 gold and 34 wood on each bombard cannon. So the difference is mostly made up once you've made your first batch of hand cannoneers and bombard cannons. They're about as good as the Byzantines probably."
aoe2,3cb3qf,norther_,2,Tue Jul 7 14:09:36 2015 UTC,"Normally with byz you wanna do another type of FI, especially on arena. You basically do stable blacksmith, and then make a few monks and scouts. Try gather as many relics as you can. If you let enemy get all 5 relics, he get's a huge advantage. You don't have to commit to much to it, but just you getting 1 or two relics will be good enough. If you have the ability to get the rest of them, go for it. You can still achieve a FI to around 24-25min, and then with better eco and hopefully 2+ relics. Whilst two relics certainly won't impact your eco a massive amount, it will also mean that enemy won't get all of them. Make uni and workshop as you up.   in imp I'd much rather go with monks and do +3range, and theocracy, which makes microing a lot easier. Add in bbc hc eventually.. Another thing can be to create market blacksmith in feudal would you have relics really close and not feel to commit much at all. You can then sell 200 stone which gives you a boost.   Would you wanna do a straight up FI with bbc and hc anyways, I'd do 29+2+3 (uni and workshop takes long time to build iirc). So basically two vills less than a turk FI, and you want one less on gold and one less on food (can do 28+2+3 if you use market to sell stone)."
aoe2,3cb3qf,sweetjones1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"Imo, fast imp on arena is only viable for non turk civs as a follow up to a castle drop or monk rush, if you wait to do chemistry it is too late and the other person figures out what you're doing (they should when your score is still so low after 20 min) they will be able to make enough knights to beat your gunpowder combo."
aoe2,3cb3qf,leroddotfaise,2,Mon Jul 6 22:11:57 2015 UTC,What do you do in the castle age as Spain or India? Lacking xbows/knights throws a kink in most of the less civ specific plans
aoe2,3cb3qf,S1Fly,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:06:37 2015 UTC,"You obviously go knights as pocket with spain, and xbow as flank with indian.  These civs are awkward in the different position, just like aztecs are awkward in pocket position.   As spain flank, if your map is really easy to wall, drush - wall - fc, otherwise just go archers and try to find some fights with enemy so when you hit castle age your are not left with a lot of archers.  Indians, never played FE civs, but I assume you can go some camels to counter opponent pocket knights, or if you are close to flank, you can go feudal aggression into xbow and flank fc -> knights."

Just be sure victory is set to conquest if you don't want to lose via relics or wonders. Unless you get incredibly unlucky in a small TG and the relics all end up out of your control then it's not something you should be losing to anyway. As for wonder victories, just plough through forest with onagers (assuming BF)"
aoe2,3c8hjk,Axa2000,8,Mon Jul 6 02:13:15 2015 UTC,"Yes and No.  Yes, because if you failed to at least take 1 relic near you, that's completely your own fault, if you fail to notice it was enabled for relic or wonder victory then again your own failure, if you hover over it it explains, but obviously ""standard victory"" isn't quite as clear as it could be for the newbies..  No, because I feel the timer should be extended.. It feels some-what too soon and cutting short the game.  Lower ranked games make people tend to just sit around setting up their eco to have large scale armies wasted every few minutes, when someone snaps up a wonder the entire game is pretty much pointless when it's say with easily defended positions."

It's just the nature of the internet where you're anonymous and you can say whatever you want without any repercussion. It kind of sucks in certain instances where you can't control this, like smurfing. I have never seen a good solution to stopping smurfing in any competitive game, and any solutions that people have come up with only serve to make the game worse for the people who don't do stuff like smurf.  I hate to tell you this after how much effort and emotion you put in this post but I don't think you're going to change anything, and I don't think anybody else is. You just sort of have to go along with it. I have learned to take 0 things personally on the internet. The people who have nothing constructive to say about the game are always going to be like that, just leave them alone. Don't waste your time, effort, and emotions."

I play a lot of Dota and trust me, the community there makes this one look like fluffy bunnies from a Disney movie.  I do agree the multiplayer is absolutely intimidating and I'm still not very inclined to pour time into it, but that's just the nature of this game. The game itself is already hard and the small player base means skill level is going to have a large difference."
aoe2,3c5q5u,LevynX,2,Sun Jul 5 03:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, DotA is very tough from what I've heard, partly because the game has been so popular for so long and the player base is very competitive and very experienced. Games where you are forced to team up with random people you don't know for a daily game breeds the attitude of losses and mistakes being unforgivable."

I barely ever see any real trashtalking, to teammates or to opponents, and hey, those voobly jerks don't play on HD so you're not going to see any of their rants in your games.  The only real 'bm-ing' I see is the occasional laming (starting scout harassing, walling resources) but is that really worth biting your nails off for? It's part of the game, after all.  On the other hand, I'm an 1860 elo player, so the smurfing problem may be larger than I can notice. After all, most games on HD are in 1500-1700 range."

aoe2,3c5q5u,Severa_AoE,3,Sun Jul 5 12:35:50 2015 UTC,"Often the more involved you get into a gaming community the more you realise and encounter the drama that goes along with it, it sucks but it's the nature of the internet unfortunately.  Like you I haven't been in the AoC Community for very long at all and only over the last week or so have I properly learned about the dispute between Zero and Voobly and I was surprised at how serious it was. I do not think though that both sides airing their grievances publicly is helping anyone at all. All it is doing is getting people involved that really shouldn't be, allowing people to pick sides and dividing people. Zero and Voobly should attempt to sort their differences privately so that the community can just carry on without people getting involved and move on.  As for multiplayer, coming into an online community as a noob is always difficult because there will always be elitists and people with a sense of entitlement because they've been around for longer or whatever. In my opinion one of the big issues with multiplayer is that you start with 1600 ELO which if it wasn't the default starting ELO would suggest you are somewhat skilled. This basically means that anyone from 1550-1650 could be either a good player but unlucky with results or a bad player but lucky with results so I can understand why people would get frustrated. Best thing to do is just ignore it, it might make you feel down a bit for a bit but just take a break and come back. I've only played a handful of online games so far but my good experiences have outweighed the bad.  Hopefully the drama will die down and everyone can just carry on enjoying the game because that's why we're all here isn't it?"

aoe2,3c5q5u,CaptainFalconA1,3,Sun Jul 5 15:09:30 2015 UTC,"Hey Fresh Princess,  I appreciate your contributions to /r/aoe2. You always seem positive.   I am actually surprised that you feel the community treats noobs appallingly. I am always willing to help noobs, and what I've seen on /r/aoe2 is the same. There is tremendous help available here, yt, aoczone etc. Aside from a few comments from people like /u/bannedfrom4chan(?), I don't see any noob bashing.  People may bash noobs in Steam, but one thing I see is noobs not understanding the rating system, e.g., trying to join a 1700+ game. That is annoying. You need to pick the appropriate difficulty, and when more advanced games kick you out, don't rejoin. I played LN with a guy on my team who didn't know what LN was. Another time, the LN player went to the spot he could see on the map, which isn't where he should have put his tc.  Regarding the drama, I'd prefer if it wasn't there either. Zak's videos brought me back to the game, but since then I've leaned to the side of the people that kept aoe2 alive for 7 years without MS."
aoe2,3c5q5u,ZaltorTheMerciless,2,Sun Jul 5 10:12:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Zaltor... I know there are a lot of people out there who are willing to help, just like you, but I still see plenty of comments here and elsewhere that are like that. Even in my own experience, when I was a total noob, I've had tons of people completely rip me to shreds over every tiny mistake. I know I'm a little bit over-emotional [see: this post], but like, when you're a new player, it's so discouraging..."
aoe2,3c5q5u,CrashWho,2,Sun Jul 5 15:04:38 2015 UTC,"There was a lot more than Voobly...  GameRanger, GameSpy, and several Chinese or other local variants.  In addition to all these...  All the mod communities aok heaven, userpatch, etc.  Forgotten Empires supported the game as well, both before HD with their mods, documentation on further mods, and a lot after.  I don't think MS would have done any more than releasing HD and left it be.  So supporting the MS Game today, DOES support those who have helped support the game in microsoft's absence."

aoe2,3c5q5u,norther_,3,Sun Jul 5 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, the HD bugs are actually quite game breaking for anyone who played the game before HD. I love that the HD developers are working on the game, but they could do far better quality control.  The reality is, I've seen this in other competitive communities too. The people who keep it alive simultaneously rip apart the community.  And you have the problem too that different people want different things. It seems the pros are fairly content to play the game as is, with an extremely consistent meta that doesn't change too much. I mean, I watch zeroempires, and he can call their strats probably 80% of the time right from the beginning, if not more often than that. On the other hand, a lot of people that are newer or more casual want to see the Forgotten, want to see new additions, etc. So I think that is what is probably splitting the community the most. That and the Voobly vs Zero Empires stuff, because there's your two probably biggest communities being divided.  I agree with you, but I think that some of what is causing this isn't something that the community will ever be able to reconcile on.  Edit: About HD, I'm not talking just multiplayer, which you could use Voobly for. I'm talking the game itself, such as it not clicking when it should click. And as your thread calls for peace, I must remind everyone that HD did present us with the glorious moonwalking bug, which I wouldn't trade for anything."

They can work all they like to fix the problems, but let's not forget that that's exactly what they've been doing for the last two years. 3.9 was decent, but still not close to being a good product. You could play with US people if you were EU, but it seemed more likely that massive lag could appear. It's not in the end about being competetive, it's about accepting the product. You see lot's of newbies complaining about lag and consider HD to be broken and I am sure most of them doesn't even know there is a competetive scene for AoE."

My mates PC is even better, but whilst his internet is I dunno, 25/10? He is in UK, yet we can occasionally experience lag that is for like a second. Pretty ridicolous.

It's not something you'd experience in server-based games, but in peer-to-peer games it's more likely to be seen. But yes, the netcode needs some serious work. It's designed and optimized for 56.6kbps, so higher capacity network won't help thaaat much, just as long as the ping is low it will be fine. I've noticed the ping very often will jump in the lobbies, even with people I have around 10-20 ping to, it can jump up to several hundred for a short moment."

But have huge problems with several players who are very near me (few hundred miles) I actually think the bigger problem is the increased computer requirements, and those that try to run it on older machines/laptops.  Then there's some odd issues with very high end machines.  I have an okay graphics card etc, for about 5 years ago, and all runs great.  Hopefully there are future improvements that work with this.  The expansion I'm sure brought a lot more funding to the game that was most likely already at/over budget (with the first release + expansion), and if they really work on it through the end of the year, that gives quite a bit of time to make improvements.  So I'm hopeful some of these issues will be resolved.  4.0+ is BAD, but we don't know the circumstances that pushed the release or why.  I think you're misunderstanding hope/support as acceptance.  There are some good changes in 4.0, I don't think anyone can disagree (mod manager is AMAZING, and the future of automatically getting mods for a lobby, would make for some really cool mods) but performance took a huge hit.  I hold, they made a huge mistake releasing 4.0.  I 100% support continued development on HD, and focus on the positive, not the negative in my effort to keep this development going."
aoe2,3c5q5u,CrashWho,3,Sun Jul 5 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"Mod manager is a good idea indeed. But think that 90% of the mods that was created won't get updated. On my desktop from 2007, the performance is the same so I really don't think so. It's not about being negative for improvments of the game. It's about being sick of them releasing broken patches. Not a single main patch has been released without it having to be fixed months later. It feels as if we, the customers, are beta testers of the patch."
aoe2,3c5q5u,CrashWho,0,Sun Jul 5 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"All I know is the performance on my system is pretty good, and I can play with someone on the other side of the world without lag issues.  I play on both gameranger (which is supposed to have less lag than voobly) and Steam.  I do not play Voobly anymore (I am just a casual player) and unless there's one of these laggy players in the game, the response time is very similar between the two clients from what I can tell...    Now pathfinding glitches, missing commands, etc are still an issue, but I'm just talking lag...  Either way, with possibly another 6 months of development budget, I have hope that some issues can be resolved, and I have fun playing as it is now, so I'm all good either way.  To the mods getting updated, yeah.  They are obviously trying, but they've turned so many people off from the game, which I think they (devs) are oblivious to.  They need to do some additional work with the mod manager, as it's still a mess, but it's a good start, and has potential, given time, and the community updating the mods, I think it will be good.   Not a single main patch has been released without it having to be fixed months later. It feels as if we, the customers, are beta testers of the patch.   There were a few, I think one of the early 3.x patches didn't need an immediate hotfix, and 3.9, other than that... yeah.

Yeah, it's manageable, but if you ever, ever even want to micro, just a tiny bit, you'll never be able to very well. And this game is how many years old?

He basically did only one strat; he tried to find the opponent asap, then steal one boar, drush, fc and spam 1tc ca. This was something new at the time. Later on many said that he did in fact not cheat, but that he just knew the map structure better than others. Also  You can read about it here and here (if you speak German). The original threads were on AocGroup I think, so they aren't there any longer.     Same goes for Igloo vs Ertug. This was back in IGZ when cheating protection was not as good as it is now. Ertug basically kept smurfing Igloo with his cheat. He even played with a proxy for quite some time when they IP banned him. He made several smurfs, most notably [FF]ccc.     Bolt taking money was even before that. They wanted to organise a Land Nomad tourney and many people chipped in for the prize pool. Bolt was choosen as trustee and then ran with the money."

aoe2,3c2u4u,LadiesAndMentlegen,4,Sat Jul 4 06:37:23 2015 UTC,"Zhuge Nus were much weaker because pulling a drawstring with significant poundage fast enough for semi-auto fire is just not feasible (both Chinese and European crossbows needed a crank to pull the string back), so the bows were made pretty small.  Zhuge Nus were popularly used in defensive positions, since gravity can help increase their force, or to fight off semi-nomadic dudes who didn't wear much armor or both. Zhuge Nu arrows were also tipped in poison to help improve their killing ability. The Chinese used regular crossbows and Zhuge Nus in entirely different formations.  The first arrow does the normal damage (8+4+2 from Rocketry), and then every arrow after that does 3 damage (which, vs everything except for Monks, means 1 damage) and each arrow after has a...50% chance of hitting? I think? Vs a Paladin, for example, Chu Ko Nus can usually do about 9 damage, which is way more than an Arbalest that does 3."
aoe2,3c2u4u,TheBattler,2,Sat Jul 4 07:29:43 2015 UTC,"The problem with Chu Ko Nu is they're really inaccurate. Elite Chu Ko Nu fire an extra two shots, but as they're so inaccurate it's not likely to hit. You can counter that with masses of Chu Ko Nu, but why not just spend it on massed Scorpions?   On the other hand, their consequent shots (after the first one) do melee damage, so with larger targets that have better pierce armour and traditionally better against archers, they'll crush them.  I play with my brother a lot (he plays Saracens) and Chu Ko Nu wreck Mamelukes every day."
aoe2,3c2u4u,Zywakem,2,Sat Jul 4 12:11:03 2015 UTC,"That's not really a problem. Chu Ko Nu do alot of base damage and their first shot will hit just about as often as any Archer, and way harder. You can usually count on 1 or 2 shots hitting, which is ALOT of extra damage output considering most Archers have low attack. So Chu Ko Nu are at least as effective as other Archers even without factoring in the extra arrows.  You can use Scorps but I don't think Chinese Scorps are super great. Lacking Siege Engineer is a big problem, and it means even Mangonels eat them alive. The Mangonel line has an attack bonus vs Scorps, so Chu Ko Nu survive one Onager shot (not Siege Onager of course) while Scorpions don't. Chu Ko Nu also handle cavalry way better than Scorps do.  On the other hand, Scorps come from Siege Workshops and if I had the choice I'd use Bombard Towers if the game gets to that point instead of building Castles to mass CKNs."
aoe2,3c2u4u,TheBattler,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:44:30 2015 UTC,The thing about Elite Chu Ko Nu is those extra 2 shots make it a longer time till you get back to the first one. So the rate of fire is less than archers.
aoe2,3c2u4u,Zywakem,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:06:54 2015 UTC,"Arbalests fire roughly twice as fast as CKNs, while CKNs do roughly twice the damage against low pierce armor targets (like Champs) and thrice the damage vs high pierce armor targets (like Paladins) so it works out."
aoe2,3c2u4u,TheBattler,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"Is that with every shot they make, assuming all 3/5 hit the target?"
aoe2,3c2u4u,Zywakem,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:06:53 2015 UTC,"Their first arrow does as much damage as the stats say. Non elites fire 2 extra arrows doing 3 damage each. Elite chu ko nu have 4 extra arrows. Even if they fight vs huskarls whith lots of pierce armor each arrow does at least 1 damage.  The arrows have a hidden melee value of 0, which makes them effective vs rams. That is because rams have -3 melee armor. (ZeroEmpires made a video about it but this sums it up pretty well.)"

aoe2,3by9s8,soulday,8,Fri Jul 3 03:46:55 2015 UTC,"The Inca really aren't much of anything. The buffed skirm and slinger are useful archer bonuses, but on the other hand, the slinger is really quite similar to a hand cannoneer, and the Inca don't get thumb ring. In my book, that's not really sufficient for being an archer civ.  Them being called an infantry civ probably comes out of having a full infantry line and the Kamayuk, but then again, they don't have any useful infantry bonuses.   I think the Inca suffer from the same problem as all the other FE civs: the developers did not want to create OP civs that would ruin the balance of the game (note that three of the most popular and strongest civs -- Huns, Aztecs, and Mayans -- were all introduced with the Conquerors expansion back in the day). So they stuck on the conservative side, and possibly with the exception of the Magyars, made weak-ish civs.  Thus, I think the Inca could be an infantry civ, if they got appropriate buffs that actually made their infantry useful -- but I think the developers were afraid of doing this because it's easy to overshoot the power balance and go from ""good"" to ""OP""."
aoe2,3by9s8,johnloeber,4,Fri Jul 3 04:12:17 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, the Incas are mean't to field Kamayuks/Helbs + Eagles + Slingers + Skirms. They are extremely micromanagement heavy.  They need a few more buffs such as -  Eagle Warriors are 10% cheaper  Lose Fast Fire or Heavy Demo (whichever they have) / Get Thumb Ring  Andean Slings - Cost 300/300 - + Skirms and Slings train 25% faster (addition to original).  Couriers - Cost 400/400 - + Spears and Eagles train 25% faster (addition to original)."
aoe2,3by9s8,devang_nivatkar,3,Fri Jul 3 04:29:51 2015 UTC,"I think its because they don't let non-byzantine civs have the defensive descriptor, which probably fits the Incans and Teutons better than the infantry descriptor.  Like other new world civs, they are probably at their strongest in the early imperial. And even though the Incans have a good start with free llama and double houses, they will probably end up turtling, at least moreso than the other new worlders.   For what its worth, the Incans have a full barracks while the Aztecs and Mayans don't. And their villager armor bonus does encourage infantry use. Maybe this is the reasoning."
aoe2,3by9s8,leroddotfaise,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:11:50 2015 UTC,"They have full infantry line, makes them pretty much an infantry civ, with defensive civ not possible as description.  Not playing FE, but from the bonus description, delayed drush into m@a and towers seems to be their best option, getting defensive upgrade and forcing vill wars.  Which honestly is quite crappy/unreliable as your best option."

aoe2,3by9s8,alexLAD,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"That ""good start"" is as good as the Hun housing bonus during Dark and Feudal. In fact, it's actually BETTER because the Huns start with 100 less Wood, and the llama can be used as a second scout, which is actually very crazy. The Incas are without a doubt early game aggressors.  They only turtle like every other civ turtles, which is when you're walling up for a Fast Castle."
aoe2,3by9s8,TheBattler,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:35:37 2015 UTC,"I played a couple of games online and from what I could tell going infantry is a big mistake, even eagles. Save your gold to archers and slingers, the only infantry units worth using is halbs and some kamayuk. The eagles should get some +1 pierce armor, they die to fast for raiders."
aoe2,3by9s8,TheBattler,3,Fri Jul 3 19:41:36 2015 UTC,"Don't take the civ descriptors to heart. Half of them are not very accurate.  Celts are an Infantry civ, they should be a Siege civ or at least Siege and Infantry. Teutons are an Infantry civ but they have an Infantry UU. Chinese are an Archer civ with no Archer bonus. Saracens are a ""Camel civ"" that doesn't even use the regular Camel line, it just so happens their Mamelukes are OP and are supposedly Camels (and even then, they have additional weakness to Skirms so are they cavalry archers?). Huns are a ""Cavalry civ,"" but they should without a doubt be a Cavalry Archer civ like the Mongols. Speaking of the Mongols, they have a similar problem to the Saracens, they don't really use their regular Cavalry Archer line (in spite of having a bonus) they just have an uber buff Cavalry Archer UU and their Siege and Hussars are just as memorable.  Anyway, I could go on and on but actually, the only civ in the game to get fully upgraded Champs, Eagles, Halbs, AND an Infantry UU to me deserves to be called an Infantry civ.   the archer units are overall more useful in most games than the infantry ones   Uhhhh, then like every civ in the game should be an Archer civ because, as the great Eminem would say, NOBODY LISTEN TO INFANTRO.   (celts get 15% passively ¬¬)   Celts also miss Squires to balance out the 15%, and Celts don't get Eagles, Kamayuks, and Slingers. Inca Eagles are as fast as Mangudai, way faster than Woads."
aoe2,3by9s8,nightbringer57,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"Overall I think the inca would make a good civ for 1v1 arabia or shit. Especially the armor (and a bit the attack) upgrades for vills, the starting lama + 10 pop houses, cheaper stone buildings, all those are pretty decent bonuses as a defensive or forwarding civ. Being able to upgrade the vills in feudal or even castle is more useful than it may look. Their army comp is rather good against most army comp, the issue being that they are really vulnerable to siege.   The kamayuk is a much better unit than it gets credit for. A decent number of them can mow down any melee army except teutonic knights. The thing is you have to support them with eagles or siege and it is really micro intensive. Or you can go for an archers mix (all 3 range units), but then again you need some anti siege support."

aoe2,3by9s8,nightbringer57,0,Sat Jul 4 13:29:47 2015 UTC,"I think yes, a little bit. The problem is that at least three of them (incas, indians and italians) depend on castles a lot. And when you depend on castles, your unit has to be very, very strong to make up for that. Like plumes or mangudai."

Voobly has good anti cheat protection, so that is no problem, but all the other problems you have with players still exist. These rely on the players not on the client you use.

Obvious counter to scouts, but you can stil use them offensively. Say you up on 21 pop on hun wars, instead of 22. You then make a spear and send it to enemy stable, he then can't attack your scouts without spears of his own, I'm then putting pressure on him.   Towers can be used to take out enemy woodlines or gold, and can also be used to protect your gold or even wood. Both defensive and offensive purpose."
aoe2,3bt2pf,LaurenTimmerman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:49:36 2015 UTC,"It's actually vice versa, yes; ranged army is better for attacking and melee army better for defending, generally speaking. Scouts in the feudal age and knights in the catle age are the exception rather than the rule. If you're attacking (unless in imp) you want to get as many villager kills as possible, and ranged units are much more effective at this than melee units. Knights are an exception because they have huge attack and can chase villagers down to get more kills.   So when defending, you want it the other way around; to lose the least amount of villagers. An early castle can surely help with that, but the heavy investment of resources might be counter-productive in the end, unless your opponent is stupid enough to walk his army underneath it. I'd suggest only building a castle in defense early on if you have a really good unique unit (spanish, mayans, turks, mongols, koreans, teutons, magyars, slavs) so the castle serves a second purpose.   I digress. For the army composition, fritosdoritos has the right idea. Mangonels are definetly a defensive unit to add and work even better if you already have a castle, to limit the maneuverability of your opponent's army even further."

I certainly don't keep track (it's pretty rare) but I don't feel it happens more on HD than with AoC, although it's possible.  I don't know if UP fixed this, I don't see anything in the list of fixes, but it might have been helped with UP...  See this post referring to this issue which was in 2011 (well before HD came out)  http://aoczone.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=49164&p=80635  ""Well mostly its the players mistake, they click any other resource apart from hunting then the vils task becomes not to be a hunter, then it it attacked by boar and it's a hunter again, then it needs ur micro, sometimes it won't even move with micro though and the only way to save it is to click garrison hotkey and click on tc.

If it's twice as common I might not really notice a difference, as I almost never lose a vil to this, but it's certainly not '20 times in a row' at least not for me.

I always garrison (Both HD and Gameranger) if my vil fights the boar, and as far as I know, it's never turned back on the boar a second time.

aoe2,3br1sq,RagingBull123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:01:44 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately this happens to everyone, and to the best of my knowledge is not unique to HD or any specific patch.  It doesn't look like you clicked on any resource while you selected the vills.  And I think everyone saying that it's due to over-clicking is mistaken. It doesn't look like there is any significant lag for that to even be a factor. If you ever watch a pro game by theviper you will see he clicks on the same things over and over.  You have to understand that your villagers are really stupid.  The villager is trying to find the shortest distance to travel toward the TC, and this is also where you are putting down those new houses.  So the villager sets a pathway back toward the TC, but then finds that its being blocked by new construction, and instead of finding a new path it just defaults into attacking the boar.  I'd be willing to bet that the villager would have made it back fine if you hadn't put those houses there.  Sometimes it's not even due to construction, but just other obstacles that are making it confusing for the villager to find it's way back - like other units working or fighting.  The villager wants to follow your orders to go back toward the tc, but it's path gets blocked so it decides it might as well fight for it's life.  When this happens I try to click on a spot closer to the villager but in the right direction, and then click again near the tc once the villager is closer and has an unobstructed path back.  I find that I lose villagers must less often than in the past."

She's quite insightful without sounding too much like a snooker commentator.  She's nowhere near as productive as Memb, Katsuni, ZeroEmpires or several others though."
aoe2,3bonb1,sweetjones1,3,Wed Jul 1 12:48:41 2015 UTC,she has by far the most productive fan base though  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06VyRUu7Yjs

aoe2,3bonb1,norther_,4,Wed Jul 1 15:39:13 2015 UTC,"Altough he has been very controverisal, Zeroempires is probably the most proffesional commentator there is for aoc. But really comes down to personal preference, if you like some bits of saltyness, and also quite a bit of insightful commentaires, check out rgeadn. Memb and Katsuni ofc if you want a laugh. Really are lots of options, check out voobly's youtube page and you'll find all the recent tournament games casted."
aoe2,3bonb1,TheBoomer,2,Tue Jun 30 22:23:24 2015 UTC,"out of curiosity, how has zeroempires been controversial?  EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes. jeez"
aoe2,3bonb1,ZaltorTheMerciless,3,Wed Jul 1 05:55:35 2015 UTC,"What norther said, and after HD came out he tried to get Voobly banned by Microsoft. Dick move"
aoe2,3bonb1,mozinator,9,Wed Jul 1 09:46:35 2015 UTC,This is just a baseless accusation. Got any proof ?
aoe2,3bonb1,HasteMaNeMark,2,Mon Jul 6 14:22:46 2015 UTC,Really? I didn't know that. Can you elaborate a little?
aoe2,3bonb1,ZaltorTheMerciless,3,Wed Jul 1 09:55:57 2015 UTC,"I have no first hand knowledge, but I've heard the accusation multiple times and never heard Zero deny it.  It was after what norther said, after the business regarding streams, after he got pissed, after he got banned and started trolling over at aoczone. There was a bit of a divide between the community at aoczone/voobly (who had kept the game alive since 2006), and the HD group (either newcomers to aoc or nostalgia types like me). HD was released in 2013.  Zak's followers are (from what I can tell) mostly HD players, whereas I think most of the longtime players sided with Voobly. It was an attempt to retaliate against Voobly for banning him.  It is really kind of silly. It boils down to ego and money. The guys at Voobly had worked for years without much (if any reward). Zak comes along, is a pretty popular caster, wants the games to be casted on his channel (i.e., he gets subscriber and donation money, attention, exposure). The sponsor of the tournament, who is the sponsor of the top 2 teams in the world, says no, we want to keep the games casted on Voobly's channel. That is perfectly reasonable to me.  Why should Zak get that if the people that run Voobly, that organize tourneys, that provide tech support etc don't get anything? Everything I have seen from Taff and the gang is them doing things for the good of the community, to put on a good show etc. What I have seen from Zak is insistence on getting paid, constant trolling (2 years later even) of aoczone and Voobly guys.  Zak wanted money, and he had the biggest following, so he said fuck you. I will divide the community so I get paid.  You can look back on this sub if you want. There are a fair amount of pages on the subject."
aoe2,3bonb1,thedboy,2,Wed Jul 1 11:02:41 2015 UTC,"Everything I have seen from Taff and the gang is them doing things for the good of the community, to put on a good show etc.   Sadly, you can occasionally find Genette engaging in flamewars and trolling, which is sad as he's an official Voobly representative."
aoe2,3bonb1,ZaltorTheMerciless,-1,Wed Jul 1 12:44:32 2015 UTC,"True, Gennette sometimes loses his cool. Most these interactions of his on reddit seemed to be because he (and others from Voobly) were getting shadowbanned. He thought it was the mods of /r/aoe2, I think it ended up being because people from aoczone would come over due to the hubbub."
aoe2,3bonb1,thedboy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:38:22 2015 UTC,"I think it was for breaking self-promotion rules - namely, mostly only posting links to one website and not participating much in other meaningful ways on Reddit, which the Reddit admins are not very fond of."
aoe2,3bonb1,GenetteAoC,5,Wed Jul 1 13:45:43 2015 UTC,"Excuse me, but where does it state that I'm an ""official Voobly representative""? I help with streaming and tournaments as a hobby. The day people will have to bite their tongues when some individuals are acting false and spread misinformation is the day this community will go belly up. I've been vocal about the disastrous HD release and I find it outrageous that ZeroEmpires tries to make a living off other people's work without crediting them - like it or not, but I stand by it."
aoe2,3bonb1,thedboy,2,Wed Jul 1 13:22:12 2015 UTC,"If the difference is lost on me, perhaps I'm not the only one.  I don't disagree that the HD release has been marred by bugs it should not have been, or that ZeroEmpires got greedy. Just because one side of the equation acted poorly doesn't mean both have to. But if I can confuse you with Voobly, so can others - and the flaming and trolling does reflect poorly on Voobly IMO, which I'm sure is in nobody's interest."
aoe2,3bonb1,norther_,2,Wed Jul 1 13:31:59 2015 UTC,"I think it started for tyrant war 2, the sponsor of the tournament only accepted it to be one singe channel streaming and that'd always be vooblyofficial. This in hope for aoc to get bigger. Altough he had his points, zeroempires pretty much demanded to be able to stream the games on his own channel, which quite obvioulsy made lots of people mad. Then got banned for aoczone for several reason, and then creating smurfs on the same website only to glorify himself and in some regards talk bad about the counterpart. Unfortuantly this debate got bigger than what it all should've been, and it resulted in communities splitting further. Zak to the new HD people whilst voobly kept their old followers. Bit funny when you think of it. Lots of people still dislike him and can't get over things that has happened. Thankfully feels as if the both parts has come to a better understanding of eachother.   It was a while ago that happened and this is obviously not the full story. Quite a while ago now, and I think it's the best to just forget about it, nothing to win on by starting to dig it all up, again"
aoe2,3bonb1,pewrAOE,5,Wed Jul 1 06:14:43 2015 UTC,"I prefer BBQTurkman aswell. What i like about is that he shows the game in a way that keeps him entertained as well. He skips through most of the dark age, where nothing interesting happens anyway and also skips through periods of booming etc.  This is the complete opposite of ZeroEmpires, which always runs through the recorded game at the standard speed and spends 15 minutes talking about himself at the beginning of every game, often while eating at the same time. Then complains that the games have too little action.  Big respects to Memb and Katsuni for spending alot of time casting games without trying to make any money, but i'm having trouble understanding their english ;<"
aoe2,3bonb1,Urcomp,3,Wed Jul 1 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"BBQturk is my favorite. The rest are good as well, but he just has a good mix of entertaining video picks and insight about them all delivered in a super Australian way."
aoe2,3bonb1,ZaltorTheMerciless,3,Thu Jul 2 14:26:24 2015 UTC,"The Memb and Katsuni combo without a doubt. They are always entertaining and informative. What puts them above the rest imo is the humor and chemistry they have. Most of their stuff together is on VooblyOfficial's YouTube and Twitch channels. Memb also does solo commentary - his yt and Twitch channel   IMO just watch the VooblyOfficial channel on Twitch and YouTube. They have the best players in the world, and put out a ton of content. There's nothing more informative than watching the top pros. They also get the best access to the top level games, usually live/spec delay, whereas Zero's versions of those games are not done live."
aoe2,3bonb1,willworkforicecream,2,Wed Jul 1 09:40:33 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you can't beat Katsuni, Memb, and Taff if he pops in."

aoe2,3bonb1,justpicksomethin,6,Wed Jul 1 04:17:57 2015 UTC,"I think Taff and Genette are the best. Insightful, a lot of game knowledge, and not cheesy like Katsuni. Next I would pick Membrillo. He casts with Katsuni a lot though, so it's tough to find one's just by him."
aoe2,3bonb1,justpicksomethin,2,Tue Jun 30 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"Brilliant! Thanks, have you got any specific links? Best ofs?"
aoe2,3bonb1,ZaltorTheMerciless,4,Tue Jun 30 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"http://www.twitch.tv/vooblyofficial/profile/past_broadcasts  TONS of content there. Genette is co-casting with Katsuni and another person who I don't know in the ""8th wonder vs. Vinchester"" match near the top. Genette is the composed one....shouldn't take long to figure out. Katsuni just acts like like a 15 year old even though he's in his 40's. Taff appears every now and again, but that's definitely the best channel out there for AOE videos."
aoe2,3bonb1,HappyF,5,Tue Jun 30 22:29:13 2015 UTC,"It's not hard to find games with just Memb, try his youtube and twitch channels. Most of the games on there are him solo. His games on VooblyOfficial are usually with Katsuni or someone else.   Though I don't share your assessment of Katsuni as cheesy"
aoe2,3bonb1,justpicksomethin,3,Wed Jul 1 09:44:57 2015 UTC,Yeah he calls katsuni cheesy before he calls memb cheesy? lol

aoe2,3bol1w,pixlepize,8,Tue Jun 30 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try something different and just make up a bunch of potential stuff for the civs already confirmed, based on what we already know about them historically:  Berbers: Cavalry and naval civilization   Camel upgrades free or camels cost less Husbandry free Ships move 10% faster Trade ships gather +50% gold Docks cost -50% Cavalry attack 20% faster   Mali: I'm guessing an archer civ   Buildings repair for free (adobe houses and forts were easy to repair) Skirmishers attack 25% faster (adept at javelin usage) Gold lasts 30% longer (renowned for having vast stores of gold) Trade carts have +5/5 armor (known for extensive and well protected trade) Skirmishers have no minimum range   Portuguese: If confirmed, probably a naval and gunpowder civilization   Gunpowder units move 15% faster (known for swift conquests) Ships and hussars have +6 LoS (historically talented explorers) Galley line upgraded for free   Idk that's all I can think of"
aoe2,3bol1w,LadiesAndMentlegen,3,Wed Jul 1 03:00:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for your predictions.  Berbers seem REALLY OP from your predictions. 10% faster fireships will wreck; galleons will out-micro other ships. Trade ships are already faster than trade carts. Cavalry attacking 20% faster would make 14+4 AP into 22 AP; essentially Garland Wars but for cavalry.   Buildings repair for free (adobe houses and forts were easy to repair)   Indestructable castles??
aoe2,3bol1w,PeterPorky,2,Wed Jul 1 09:55:01 2015 UTC,"Haha these are in no way predictions, and they're certainly not a super logical assessment balance-wise. I'm just throwin' out some potential ideas for bonuses that don't really exist yet. The percentages and numbers are merely variables."
aoe2,3bol1w,LadiesAndMentlegen,2,Wed Jul 1 16:28:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting variables in themselves. I like the concept but theyd need to be balanced well.  I'm hoping for a civ that can produce villagers slightly faster, or make petard OP to the point where they are actually used."
aoe2,3bol1w,PeterPorky,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:38:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with the portuguese. Another unique naval unit would be nice, that should go with some kind of portuguese ship. Also, as you mentioned a trade cart bonus for Mali, the portuguese could have a trade cog bonus, (they started the maritime trade with India). Or you could mix those ideas and have a unique trade cog, the Carrack (Nao), better but more expensive, or maybe not as a unique unit but as an upgrade of the trade cog (it's a shame you can't upgrade trade cogs or fishing ships, in the original AoE you could).  I've heard another civ could be Abyssinia (Ethiopia), an unique unit of warriors using this weapon would be good: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotel That would mean bonus against cavalry and armored units (""could be used to hook and rip the warrior off the horse"", ""can be effectively used to reach around an opponent's shield"") but weak defense (hard to block with that, and they rarely used armor)."

This would mainly affect the UU creation speed. But only the civ would have the UU so there would be no comparison point...

There is virtually no competitive scene for Forgotten Empires for anybody to test if a civ is strong or not.

aoe2,3bol1w,LadiesAndMentlegen,2,Wed Jul 1 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"Great.  tl;dr: Inca Housing bonus is the same as the Hun Housing bonus except better in Dark Age and worse after early Castle. Incas are probably the second best Dark Age civ, and easily last to early Imperial where they are a B+ and good enough to beat the majority of the civs in the game, but they manage to beat the shit out of the A+ early Imp civs with Slingers  Let me first explain the Housing bonus and how it's actually exactly the same as the Hun bonus (widely considered the best eco bonus in the game) in the Dark and Feudal Age, and only starts to falter in the Castle Age.   Dark Age: You need 25 pop. Hun bonus gives you full pop cap, but it doesn't matter if you're only building 21 Villagers. Huns start with -100 Wood. Inca builds 2 Houses, spends 50 Wood. Incas net 150 Wood headstart over the Huns. Inca villager seconds spent on Houses is less than Hun Villager seconds chopping the 100 less wood. That means Inca bonus is actually BETTER in the Dark Age. Feudal Age: 45 pop necessary. 28 Villagers is standard right now, plus some room for military (not as necessary with Fast Castle). Inca only build 2 more Houses, 100 W spent total, which is now equal to Huns drawback. However, Incas can wall up with Houses, which is also standard, a big edge over Huns. Castle Age: Hun bonus starts to beat Inca, but not as crazily. You need 120 pop for first Castle boom. 15 from your 3 TCs, so 105 pop. All civs need 525 Wood for that; Incas only need 275 Wood. 250 Wood to spend on TCs is huge, that's 125 extra Wood for your first 2 TCs plus 15% discount on Stone. Then again, the huge Hun advantage is their Cavalry Archers so I'm not going to pretend Incas are equal to Huns here.   Now that's settled, let me explain the other bonuses: the Inca can use the free Llama as an EXTRA SCOUT in the Dark Age which means that they find all their resources faster than everybody else, and they get an extra 70~ food when they eat the Llama, which makes their Drush faster than anybody else, maybe not quite Aztec fast but they are faster than the other best Drusher, the Huns. This is a big deal.  Feudal Age, researching Scale Mail Armor means enemy Archer harassment is much, much less. Not a big deal but Inca don't need to stay in Feudal Age long because of Drush -> FC is standard, and any less Villagers killed in Feudal is good help. Incas also have the safest Trush, though that's not a big deal.  Inca are weak in Castle Age but so are the Aztecs and Mayans and they are the top Arabia civs, even in The Forgotten, so this is not exactly a game breaker.  They are not as good as the Aztecs and Mayans in early Imperial, but regular Eagles are still very strong vs the other 21 civs in the game, and the Inca get Slingers; Slingers actually counter Rams pretty safely, AND they counter Eagles. This means the Inca actually beat the fuck out of the Aztecs and Mayans, the best early Imp civs, and when other civs try to use Arbalests and Rams, they get whipped by the cheaper Slinger + Eagle combo.  Incas are not so good in the later stages of the Imperial Age, just like the Aztecs, but they have a stronger version of Halbs + Onagers using Kamayuks + Onagers that can work for a time."
aoe2,3bol1w,norther_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"Camels having a weakness to towers/TCs shouldn't even be in the game anyways. Also, you might be surprised how handy cheaper units can be. Eagle warriors cost as much gold as plumed archers (50g) and if they had a cost reduction bonus as powerful as the mayan archer one, they would cost just 14f and 35g in the imperial age. With 500g invested in eagle warriors, this would amount in 14 EEW vs 10 normally. Otherwise another alternative is to give their eagles more armor since the Inca were one of the only meso empires known for metalworking."
aoe2,3bol1w,nightbringer57,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:13:43 2015 UTC,"Cheaper eagles being cheaper can be quite a difference I think. With maya or aztec you'll find that your gold quickly drains into the eagles fund. As you mass from 6ish barracks'  your gold will get drained fast, obviously. For BF maps they are still quite possibly the worst civ in the game, but for 1v1 and Ara tg thry will be massively improved. 25% cheaper in castle age, 30% cheaper in imp does sound neat. Still need something to make it a good civ, really does lack a power combo in imp.   I think free fletching or bodkin is overpowered and free cav armor as well. Imagine how strong drush fc would be. Normally the problem when you reach castle by min 17 is that you cant make second wood upgrade, xbow and bodkin without delaying TC quite a bit. Also getting it instantly is very strong. If this civ gets any eco bonuses, you could face fully upgraded xbow by 16.30, so I guess give them a weak eco to compensate . Intresting and worth discussing about I think"
aoe2,3bol1w,thedboy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:54:24 2015 UTC,"Simply a tech that would give the camels a  good-ish Camel Armor value would be quite good imo. You give them like +5 or +6 camel armor. Cuts off most of the bonus from towers, fireship, gallleys and TCs. But castles would still hurt quite a bit and would be way less brutal. And pikes would still hurt a lot.   The indians should have gotten this instead of shag- shgat- shatan-... oh fuck that..."

aoe2,3bowf8,norther_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yea, the whole cost more than a champ for +10hp and -5 attack is kinda bad. They should just make em like 60f10g or like 45f45w"
aoe2,3bowf8,norther_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:22:12 2015 UTC,"I just think the purpose of them is stupid. They are said to be good against infantry, but realistically they will just die. If you patrol in, they will stagger of course, which is fine, but once you lose formation, which does happen, they don't stand a chance vs pretty much any other infantry unit.  It's a concept that doesn't work foor aoc. They are just a different version of the halberdier. More base attack and more HP, ranged (always first strike vs melee), but loses out on attack bonus vs cavalry. I'd still go halbs vs cavalry civs most likely.   I'd like to see a spear unit that actually does well in infantry combat. Unfortunatly, kamayuks aren't."
aoe2,3bowf8,Jonne,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:32:09 2015 UTC,"Has anyone experimented with patrolling and stand ground? They should stay in formation, but i don't know if they'll actually attack."
aoe2,3bowf8,norther_,2,Wed Jul 1 05:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yes I have. They do actually work fine and do take out most infantry. But as I said, it's easy that they lose formation, and when that happens, you're in for some trouble. I'd suggest giving them like+2 base attack. Current state they deal 8 damage to champions in post imp, really too little."
aoe2,3bowf8,makerofshoes,3,Wed Jul 1 06:01:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe, instead of buffing them or changing their cost, they should just make it so they attack ALL units their spear touches. As in, if one stabs, say, an arb, and there's another arb right behind it, both take damage, maybe full amount, maybe less. Sorta like a more linear logistica/trample damage. In fact, make it their imp UT, and make kams, slingers and eagles move 10% faster a civ attribute."

aoe2,3bowf8,damjpog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"Not at all. This would just be an addition, and adding an attribute can only ever make a unit more diverse in its uses. Plus, in any big battle, esp. post imp slug matches where there's 100s of units in the field, there will always be units milling around, looking for someone to kill, trying to pathfind through the mass of bodies in their way. Put these guys into the fray and you can deal with both the active units and the units that are behind them trying to find a way into the battle."

aoe2,3boplu,norther_,5,Tue Jun 30 22:27:42 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, you may want to use Defensive Stance in some situations, which prevents them from chasing things too far."

aoe2,3boplu,Axa2000,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:32:35 2015 UTC,in defensive they should only chase as far as their line of sight (with the centre point being the spot they were standing)  then return there once the enemies are gone
aoe2,3boplu,needude72,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:56:48 2015 UTC,"If your units are standing still they probably shouldn't be in range of enemies.  This opens you up to mangronel fire, easy scouting, and pulling problems.  Defensive stance units will attack all units within a certain range of the point they were told to stand at, which fixes following units into castles or town centers, but still leaves you open to be abused by people forcing your units to walk back and forth.  If the AI is only commanding a single unit they are trying to scout you."
aoe2,3boplu,gdubrocks,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:51:11 2015 UTC,"What everyone else is saying- Defensive Stance. Units are created with Aggressive Stance selected by default, which means they will chase units forever or until they die. In Defensive, they will chase them up to a certain point, then return to their post if the unit goes out of range.   Stand Ground stance is better for archers, it means they will not break formation but they will shoot at anything that gets in their range. If you put melee units on Stand Ground, they will just stand in place while getting shot by arrows without trying to fight back, so usually you want to have melee units on Aggressive or Defensive.  All the buttons for stances and formations are in the lower-left corner of the screen, they are fun to play around with. If you can't see them when you have a group of units selected then you can enable them in the options menu."
aoe2,3boplu,makerofshoes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:36:54 2015 UTC,"They sound as if they are set to 'Aggressive'.  Simply set them to 'Defensive' if you want them to chase a short distance, but return after a while. Set them to 'Stand Ground' if you want them to not even move, nor react to archer fire. Ranged units will still attack while set to 'Stand Ground' though."

aoe2,3bnihw,ProfessionalWingman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:15:43 2015 UTC,"The basic idea is this: You select a bunch of conditions and a bunch of effects. If you then play your scenario, the effects of that trigger will happen when all the conditions are met. For example: Condition0: Select Object (choose an object here) Condition1: Timer (choose a time) Effect0: Display Instruction (type in your text)    So for example with this trigger, you could have your hero say ""I'm yours to command"" once you click him, but only if more than a minute of gametime has passed. On the right, you can select a trigger to be looped (it can trigger again and again) or you can disable it - you can then enable it later with another trigger! For example, you might only want your hero to say his thing once another goal is accomplished, but then it should work every minute or so.    Most conditions and effects are somewhat straightforward and can be figured out with trial and error, but do ask if you have any specific questions. Also, here is a huge list of faq!"

What are some good tips for making maps? Does anyone have any cool ideas? We tend to just make games for us against the bots but I'm wondering if there's scenarios that I could try instead.  I try to balance mine like most normal games. Everyone starts with a source of food, 2 near by boars, gold, stone, wood, sheep, etc. Then as you go out from the base, more boars, larger gold/stone, etc.  I try to throw in some fun stuff, for a team game once I set up a trade route river we could use along the back of the map for trade cogs. Gave it a bit of lore (cities in ancient times tended to spring up around rivers). I like to hide small easter eggs with a relic. A washed up boat, a forgotten temple etc.  I've been trying to get an AI team on the map that isn't an actual contender. No TC or villagers, mainly just walls and towers that attack -all- players.

Just make all the units/buildings you want neutral-controlled player 1 for example, and also give player 1 his usual stuff for playing (a human player is going to play player 1). Now here's the hard part: you need to make a trigger with no condition and one effect for every single unit or building you want to become neutral controlled. Then select change ownership for each effect. I think you can work it out from there: after a unit is changed ownership by a trigger, it does not revert colour when a player comes close."

aoe2,3bilfw,thedboy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:39:17 2015 UTC,"In arena you have a stone wall surrounding your base. Monks have a huge range and can thus convert behind that wall. Since you're almost always fast castling in arena, the battles will often be between relatively small armies, since you can often not afford much more. Monks are far more effective when the armies are reasonably small.  Monks + Mangonels is also really difficult to counter, and basically only dies to Light Cavalry, Eagle Warriors, Castles and some unique units."

aoe2,3bilfw,sweetjones1,3,Tue Jun 30 00:27:31 2015 UTC,"Build a siege workshop, often a monastery too, wall back and keep booming. If the castle denies the only gold you need to go out and tc one of your secondary golds (hopefully not near the castle) immediately, before he can get army to deny it.  Ideally you have built your buildings (market, smith, houses) towards the front of your base to partially wall already, so you can fill in the gaps really quickly.  You may also need to build knights/skirms in defense depending on civ, for example mangonels and monks will rarely cut it vs jans or conqs.  You can deny a castle going up with a tower, and if you think you are likely to get castle dropped make some scouts on the way to castle age, even if you dont get dropped you can still use them to zecure relics and delay a monk/siege push.  The key is to spend less on defense than he does on attack. If you can survive and boom to imp you should be in a commanding position"

aoe2,3bgkxe,NocteTaurus,2,Mon Jun 29 01:14:17 2015 UTC,The game tends to crash when you play with multiple AI and higher than 200 pop settings.  In case you were playing with these settings and not just 1v1 it is probably it.
aoe2,3bgkxe,S1Fly,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:54:09 2015 UTC,This has been a common issue since the game has launched. Patches haven't been able to entirely fix it. The match making system is pretty broken but there's not much you can do when dealing with a 16 year old game... even if it has been remade.   If you're referring to a different problem then I'm not sure what to tell you. Maybe someone else will have an answer.
aoe2,3bgkxe,goodyman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:46:27 2015 UTC,2 things helped me. Dialing back my overclock a bit and moving the game off my SSD. Now it only messes up when someone goes out of sync.
aoe2,3be2eg,Sensationalist420,2,Sun Jun 28 10:07:05 2015 UTC,"When i try queue up commands with my scout they will only do the first command even if the little flags come up.   You right click once after putting flags and they will follow that route. You probably click more than once and overwrite it with a new movement command.   also if i try have 5 villagers selected and shift build 5 farms they will all work on 1 farm and then 4 will idle while 1 farms and the other 4 will stay just as foundations.   Villagers will automatically build anything in their LOS, you probably made the farms too far away."
aoe2,3be2eg,S1Fly,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:10:41 2015 UTC,Are you sure this is the issue.  I would of thought that it follows the same pattern as buildings. As in select 5 vills and queue building 5 houses. All the vills will build together.
aoe2,3be2eg,ChamakhsBarber,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:21:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah they will, but they will move to the next one after the first one is finished.  But if you want to make multiple farms, just make a mill and spam farms around it and tasks the villager to make the mill. They'll spread quite evenly over the surrounding farms when the mill is finished"
aoe2,3be2eg,S1Fly,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:24:39 2015 UTC,"When I do mass farms, I select the whole group of villagers first, then use the hot keys for build and farm (AA I think), and place the farms one at a time, control clicking one villager in the selection bar at the bottom in between each farm, so that way the deselected villager becomes the only one assigned to that farm when the remaining villagers get assigned to the next farm. Eventually only one villager is left to make the last farm. Not sure if it's the fastest way but I've gotten pretty fast at doing it."
aoe2,3be2eg,noossab,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"for the vils its a line of sight issue, as s1fly points out.   my advice:  Play as koreans and you'll have less of these problems (+3 LOS on vilagers). (kappa)"

He could have literally never played aoe online before, or he could be someone from voobly/gameranger who already has a good understanding of game mechanics and strategies. Starting it at 1600 is no fun for either; the new player will just get destroyed and quit, and the voobly/gameranger guy will grow tired of easy victory after easy victory."
aoe2,3bbzru,LaurenTimmerman,2,Sat Jun 27 21:29:37 2015 UTC,thats a very good idea! Also games played should definitely be shown somewhere you can see it in game
aoe2,3bbzru,0x726b00,2,Sat Jun 27 22:21:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah Elo rating starting at one fixed value like both Voobly and HD do it is bullshit. You could give new players provisional ratings calculated by the performance rating formula for the first few games, which makes the ratings changes very quickly (some chess servers do this).

aoe2,3bbzru,gdubrocks,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:37:59 2015 UTC,High experience would put you at the top 2k steam players.  Heck having an elo of 1601 makes you in the top 20k.  Everyone should start at 1400.

aoe2,3bbzru,LaurenTimmerman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"You greatly underestimate how bad players are at 1400 elo, and overestimate how good players are at 1800. There's no fun for a player who has had good experience in playing online to win game after game after game without even trying. It's fun the first 5 times maybe but after that it's just another wasted 30 mins of your life every time.   I think you misread my earlier post, it said that only if you suggested to the game that you have high experience in this game in multiplayer (say you have played on voobly or gameranger and are an above-average player there) should you be starting at 1800 rating. If you have no experience, to the 1400 you go and if you know a little about the metagame and kinda understand what youre doing then 1600 is a good place to start. It's not fair to assume that all 1800 players are pro players simply because they're in the top 2000 players in the world, because aoe2 doesnt nearly have the community size of other online games."
aoe2,3bbzru,gdubrocks,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:42:28 2015 UTC,"and an 1800 rating is equivalent to the top 2k players in the game.  You are telling me that if I sign on to AoE for the first time and click advanced that I will get matched up with the top 2k players? That's an awful idea.  1,600 is also an awful place to start. Top 40k? No thanks.  If you have high experience in the game you should be able to easily win and climb.  I don't know if you play league or not, but what you are suggesting is that players can get placed straight into platinum tier just by saying that they are good."
aoe2,3bbzru,LaurenTimmerman,0,Wed Jul 1 23:57:28 2015 UTC,"You obviously didnt even read my previous comment so I'll be sure to use less words this time.  League of Legends big community -> top 2K players are all pro. Aoe2 small community -> top 2K player not so much, just very good players.  If you think that starting everyone at 1400 will fix aoe2's problems for new players you clearly don't understand how elo works. In the short term, maybe a couple new players will be matched along their level of skill but in the long term 1400 will become the new 1600 if you see what I mean. All the smurfs and players from voobly will start at 1400 too, after all.   The system I proposed allows players who don't intend to play competitively to start at 1400 and have their fun, and people who are starting out competitively can start at 1600 and people who are already really good players can start at 1800.  I don't know if you know what voobly is, but there are many snobs out there who would laugh at me even for saying that an 1800 player on HD is a very good player."
aoe2,3bbzru,gdubrocks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:47:10 2015 UTC,"http://www.lolsummoners.com/stats  Platinum has 8% of the total ranked players in league. Diamond has 2%.  AoE has 450,000 ranked players * .08% = platinum is at 36,000 players..... which proves my point. Infact I said that 1800 was like platinum when in reality it is much closer to diamond ONE which is two divisions higher than platinum, and the top 1%.  Yeah masters players are going to look down at the diamond players and think they are unskilled, but you cannot reasonably call a 1800 HD player unskilled because they are in the top 1% of all HD players. Are there better players? Of course, but that doesn't make them unskilled, they are far, far better than average.  You clearly don't understand how ELO works since every single game that uses it starts their players at a low point instead of a high point. If you place a new player too high they are going to lose a bunch of games in a row and have a horrible entry experience. If you place a good player too low it's not a big deal since they will quickly climb out.  Right now the problem is new players get placed in a location that has players that are guaranteed to stomp them. They have to lose a lot of games to find other new players.  TL;DR:   Platinum ~ 1601 (8% of 450,000 = 36,000)  Diamond ~ 1700 (2% of 450,000 = 9,000)  A player in the top 1% is not bad no matter what any snob says."
aoe2,3bbzru,LaurenTimmerman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"I never called 1800 players unskilled myself, in fact, I am 'only' an 1860 player on HD.  What I was getting at with the whole rating argument is that '1600' as a starting point is arbitrary. They could've gone with 500, 1000, 2000... all values associated with elo are constructed. As such, starting at 1400 won't change anything. You say a good player can quickly climb out of low elo, but apparently that is not the case as even 'good' players who give new players a 'horrible entry experience' apparently stay around 1600, winning about as much as they lose. How will this be different in the long rung if the starting elo is suddenly changed to 1400?   ELO needs to come from somewhere. For every 1800 player there are three 1500 players, each having 'given up' 100 elo indirectly to the 1800. Lowering the start to 1400 will therefore plunge the people already at 1400 to even lower depths to get the 'good' new players out of their starting point. They don't just alleviate themselves to 1600 instantly by showing someone their skill... hey does that sound familiar? Yeah, that sounds like the system I proposed!   You've seen from your own data that over half the players in aoe2 have never even played online or have only played a couple games then quit forever, locking them between 1500 and 1600. So, most people who play online often enough, let's estimate that number at about 60K (and thats propably still overoptimistic). Now you should get completely different numbers for 'platinum' and 'diamond'"

aoe2,3bbzru,rarely-sarcastic,3,Sat Jun 27 19:55:42 2015 UTC,Same here. I played a few games and definitely improved but I just kept on getting rushed and completely destroyed. The one time I came close to winning was when the map was small and I got a lot of protection from my teammate and got a little breathing room to actually get a decent army but that got crushed super quick. The few people who played with me seemed to really like noobs playing against them because they kept on inviting me when I would just come to watch matches.
aoe2,3bbzru,Koivin,5,Sun Jun 28 03:39:47 2015 UTC,"For me, as a noob, I personally just want to play some games against others. No crazy weird rushes, über micro or tight build orders. I am not a pro gamer nor do I am to be. Just playing casual games versus other newcomers seems to be impossible with all these crazy competitive players. It's demotivating for me to keep playing."

I pretty much only play with my real life buddy and we want much the same. A good fun game without either team whitewashing. I honestly hate crushing people or getting crushed. There's no fun in either.
aoe2,3bbzru,FrshPrncessOfBelarus,7,Wed Jul 1 01:37:06 2015 UTC,"Better community culture regarding new players   In my honest opinion, I think this is the most important thing. People are just so mean ;-;"

Incentives and Disincentives. Modern law and economics is based squarely on this fundamental concept.   All the devs have to do is create a simple system to disincentize smurfing, as I suggested elsewhere in this thread."
aoe2,3bbzru,DulcetFox,2,Sat Jun 27 23:06:06 2015 UTC,I've never had issues with smurfing. But I have been turned off from people generally being rude. The problem with multiplayer is that ~20% of the community sucks at interpersonal interaction.
aoe2,3bbzru,geckogod5,2,Sun Jun 28 02:36:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of the rudeness stems from the irritation caused by unbalanced games in team play. Better players get mad at teammates for not knowing basic concepts.  Right now, people between 1550 and 1650 could actually be 1300 level players or 1700 level players. There's no way to know how many games they've played so it is difficult to make fair games in that rating range. Unfortunately, this is also the most populous rating range. The community has frequently requested that players' total games and win percentage be listed next to their names in the game lobby. This would enable players to create better balanced teams.  We can't change human reactions to irritation, but we can remove sources of that irritation."

I've seen lots of people drop games because they are tired of teammates yelling at them constantly, and I swear a good portion of the time they aren't even giving good advice. Balancing the teams will help, but as long as you have a losing team you are always going to have people being dicks to their own teammates and blaming them for their team losing. Now that isn't the majority of people, but the majority of people don't even chat much, so this minority really stands out."

aoe2,3bbzru,gdubrocks,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:10:22 2015 UTC,Honestly it doesn't unless you set a 35+ minute treaty length.  My 10 feudal scouts or 10 castle age knights are going to be just as strong against a player with no army.  You might as well just start the game in imperial age it would have the same effect.
aoe2,3bbzru,kona_boy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"Yes it does. It's a noob game, with a treaty timer. Anyone not noob enough usually QQs at this and leaves.   It has, in my experience using in every game for the last few weeks, negated quite a lot of the griefers/smurfs/hard rushes from good players. Before the setting existed, I'd simply have to put ""no rush"" in the title which led to one of two things; a dick head smurf deliberately crushing us or some idiot who either doesn't care or was too stupid to read the title and you end up with someone raging because it was supposedly a no rush noob game.   Instead of sweaty palms from trying to build right + deal with some ass hole smurf harassing me while I try and have a fun game I can freely get my wall up and focus on not getting my ass handed to me.   Judging by your suggestion though it's pretty clear you a) aren't a noob player b) shouldn't be playing 3v3 bf noob games with treaty timers."

aoe2,3bbzru,thedboy,-2,Sat Jun 27 22:32:23 2015 UTC,"Solution: Automated smurf banning  EDIT#2: Smurfing is here defined as smurfing+noob bashing. Smurfs that don't noob bash would not be reported, because no one would be pissed enough to report them.  1. Smurf reporting function   Located on the main menu. No one-click reporting. Users must write down the name before quitting the game and then type it in on the main menu.  One-click in-game reporting is more likely to be abused by poor losers.   2. Automatic banning   X-number of reports causes an automatic ban on the account This number should be high, approximately 20-30, to minimize wrongful banning. Each user can only report the same person once.  Bans would be temporary, but the report threshold for getting banned each subsequent time would decrease and the ban duration would increase.    3. Ban shared accounts   A ban on one account bans all connected accounts Forces the smurf to buy another copy of the game if they want to smurf again.   4. Voobly rating conversion   New players have the option to enter their Voobly rating in order to get an appropriate HD starting rating to avoid getting reported for smurfing. Non-voobly veterans can opt to choose ""Experienced Player"" and start at 1700 to avoid getting reported.   Edit #1 What do you guys disagree with about this?"
aoe2,3bbzru,geckogod5,5,Sat Jun 27 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"Automatic banning is a terrible idea, even with the restrictions you propose. Any kind of dispute between players is likely to result in wrongfully reporting the other player, not just for smurfing. Also smurfing is impossible to prove. Banning a player from using their game that they bought when they were not hacking or breaking any rules regardless of whether that player was smurfing or not is against common sense and is wrong in so many ways. Also, the reporting function would be abused to hell. Even if it could be shown someone was smurfing for absolute certain (which is impossible), banning is too strong of a punishment.  Here's an example of a situation gone wrong: 1 hour into a game, a CBA host boots one of the players on the other team.  The booted player starts lagging the game for justice sake.  Everybody reports the lagging player for smurfing.  Another example: A 2000 ELO player might let their noob friend use their account, or vice-versa. Noob joins noob game and gets reported. Account gets banned.  Another example: Voobly player gets reported.  OK so that's my argument against a permanent ban system. Here's one against a player-player ban system.  It's easier to get into a game with HD at the moment compared with voobly or even GR. No ratings for CBA, no banning. It's so painless and easy. It's one of the best things about HD and should not be sabotaged. At the moment, hosts already have the power to kick another player and players have the power to rejoin a room so there is also a good balance of power already. If someone feels so strongly to keep rejoining a room after getting kicked, they can and the host is forced to reevaluate if that person should be kicked every time. If someone has a bad internet connection, the fact they desync is deterrent enough for them to stop joining games until they sort their connection out.  Case study: The reason facebook is so successful compared to other social networks is because it is constantly bringing down barriers to antisocial behaviour i.e. actively promoting your profile. Voobly is really hard to get into as a noob because of your rating. Once you get blocked on gameranger from one player you are blocked for life. Closed communities are not as fun. Adding a banning system, skill rating system, behaviour/smurf rating system is antisocial and doing more harm than good in a game that is desperate for new players."
aoe2,3bbzru,geckogod5,0,Sun Jun 28 09:45:30 2015 UTC,"I am suggesting temporary bans.  The problem in the community is not that it is ""starving for new players"". The original post on this thread pointed out that aoe2 has tons of new players, but that they are not sticking around due to the unpleasant multiplayer environment.  A 2000 account lending his account to a noob friend wouldn't get reported for joining noob lobbies. Noob lobbies kick 2000 players before the game starts... And a noob lending his 1600 account go a 2000 player who then stomps noobs is exactly what we want to be reported.  Your Facebook analogy is weird...Facebook thrives by lowering barriers to antisocial behavior?? Facebook lets you hide people from your timeline whose posts annoy you and lets you permanently block people you don't like.  Regardless, you're ignoring the problem that this thread is about: the inhospitable environment for noobs on aoe2, that is due in part to being crushed by noob bashing smurfs without ever having a chance to learn and have fun!"
aoe2,3bbzru,norther_,2,Sun Jun 28 13:36:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, auto banning is a bad idea, due to people being able to abuse it's function. A player could report another player, purely because of the fact that they were beaten, or some other personal reason that isn't against the ToS. The fact that the ban is temporary doesn't change anything; the person will still get banned wrongfully and will still get punished for no good reason. It gives power to those that don't deserve it, and there are MANY that don't.  However, the permabanning of smurfs and their alts is a nice idea. Games need to take smurfs more seriously - they ruin the game for others and exploit the system, almost like glitching."

aoe2,3bbzru,norther_,0,Sat Jun 27 22:31:36 2015 UTC,Good point. Added point #4 to address this.
aoe2,3bbzru,geckogod5,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:36:45 2015 UTC,That is a pretty good solution!  There should be some period of time before you get banned where you can appeal however else some group could gang up on a player (however mean that sounds). Still sounds like a good idea and saves mods (still needed) time.   I think VAC works like that on family share accounts so banning like that occurs and should be easy to set up with steam
aoe2,3bbzru,norther_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:32:01 2015 UTC,You simply set the threshold of ban reports at an appropriate level. I'm guessing 20-30 would be pretty solid.
aoe2,3bbzru,geckogod5,-1,Sat Jun 27 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"Smurf=equal noob bashing and I disagree 100% with that. Smurfing means nothing else than you play under different alias. My dad and brothers play this game aswell, do you think we should have to buy two extra copies of the game. I doubt the voobly thing will work practically. I'd much more rather see something that laurentimmeramn said. You can enter the level of experience you have.  I'd like to see some kind of report system, but mostly towards desyncers. I do however tjink this will be abused, what if you get banned when you have done nothing wrong? Good luck getting that account back. Also I'm sure 99% of all voobly players are aware that HD rate is about +400 from voobly."
