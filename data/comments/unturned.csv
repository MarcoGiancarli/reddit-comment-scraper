Improvements:   Improved inventory to show clothing icons and quality.   Improved storage to drop items when destroyed.   Improved camera tool to work while in vehicles.   Improved helmets/vests to be scrappable/repairable with metal.  Tweaks:   Tweaked camera tool to be useable on server when admin.   Tweaked clothing quality to not go down in easy mode.  Fixes:   Fixed vehicle bumper collision issue.   Fixed singleplayer to not start listen server.   Fixed interacting in camera tool.  Note: This should fix the crash when loading Linux singleplayer on 64-bit machines.

unturned,3dwi2p,compugasm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:36:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The intention of having the items wipe, is to prevent people from looting. A lot of people want to make ""raid proof"" structures. I believe this should not be possible, because there are players who wall off entire islands, and block access to towers. So we need to destroy those structures. By making the stored items wipe, it's pointless to waste your time destroying the safes, therefore somewhat accomplishing the ""raid proof"" request, without making things indestructible."
unturned,3dvzot,volk96,4,Mon Jul 20 00:09:59 2015 UTC,Impossible because #1 you can break every structure built by players #2 you can build bridges to everywhere and #3 you need something that blocks players from coming in which would also disallow yourself to enter
unturned,3dvzot,TehNumberOne,2,Mon Jul 20 00:20:15 2015 UTC,"But, then the map becomes cluttered with 'stuff' long gone players created. You can't just leave their things unbreakable because some people block tower entrances and wall off whole islands, leaving you no way to access these places.  If the solution is to wipe the server periodically, then it's pointless to build bases because your base and gear will be wiped anyways. Similarly, if your stuff can be destroyed, it's pointless to build base. I see both sides of this coin, but ultimately it's pointless to build bases on public servers.  The best option is storage lockers. If that's destroyed, anything inside is destroyed along with it. Since it can't be looted, they're probably going to be left alone. But still, do your best to hide these, so nobody is tempted to destroy it because it's in their way."

Now there is servers out there who actually have admins, that play fair, try different servers. Because the majority of people tend to go back to the same server after been a victim of admin abuse and complain about the admin abuse and that just leads to a scenario where you get banned 95 % of the time."
unturned,3dkmp5,MissJuliaKelly,2,Fri Jul 17 01:18:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with the server admin abuse problem (and don't get why this is being downvoted so much).  admins shouldn't be able to change the game state through OOC influence, such as by spawning items or teleporting characters. IMO they're only there to enforce issues bothering the entire server, such as language."
unturned,3dkmp5,RA2lover,3,Fri Jul 17 10:46:49 2015 UTC,I agree that there are many servers where admins abuse their powers. There are also a large amount of players that claim admin abuse anytime they're killed by the admin. I feel that some people are quick to assume that anyone that kills them is either abusing or hacking.

Still, I appreciate you looking through it - I tried to make it as concise as possible so you wouldn't get bored but also added mine and the community's critique where it was needed."
unturned,3dfqa0,PuffTheMagicDragn,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"Meh, I know I missed the deadline, but here is my contribution:  Triangles - I would like the ability to build walls at 45 degree angles. Triangle floor pieces would make that happen, and allow me to build a manor that is befitting a player of my caliber. You see, my bedroom must have a particular ocean view. A diagonal distance is longer than the walls we build now. But I think it's tedious to build a 10ft wall or a 12ft wall. So just keep one wall segment and it will just fill in the extra horizontal space automatically.  Traps/doors - I'd like to see things that are activated by trip wires. We have metal grates. Combine that with metal spikes, and a trip wire, now you've got a door that springs open/closed with deadly force. Or, possibly a mechanism for a ""secret"" door. It looks like a normal wall, but jumping up to activate the trip wire would slide/swing the wall open to reveal the treasure room.   Elevator - There is a garage door which slides upwards. Could we attach a floor to it and slide the whole floor up? Even if it's just one level, it would make a nice vehicle elevator. Or, how about a 2x2 floor that rotates, so it's easier to turn your vehicle around while it's in the garage.  Ramps - I haven't looked at how ramps work in 3.0, but I would like ramps that don't have wood beams jutting out from them like 2.0. I must be able to smoothly transition my vehicle from ground to ramp. I must jump my vehicle like Evel Knievel.  Landscape - Could we dig holes or tunnels? The other day I was on Smilyland and while driving off-road, I fell right into a deep pit that was covered over with camouflage. What I was looking to do, was a good way to hide a base from enemies. Building bases underground would make that easier. It would work similar to the pirate cave. You just hollow out a space and then build a structure inside the cavern. Digging gives you no experience points.  I look forward to seeing how this game develops over the coming years. The way I see it, you could have ""War Thunder"" play out with the large maps and military vehicles for the PvP crowd. Or, ""Farming Simulator"" play out in the rural areas because there are farms, silos, hay bails, for the PvE crowd. Both seem possible given enough development time. Good luck with that."
unturned,3dfqa0,N4tri,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions, some of them are very good indeed.
