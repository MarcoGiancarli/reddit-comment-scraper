angelsbaseball,3dtcns,stuckinthepow,3,Sun Jul 19 06:55:11 2015 UTC,Reagins was basically there to be a place holder for the demands of Scioscia and Moreno so I can't say I'm too confident about the next hire if Dipoto's hires leave.
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,Kelmon,2,Sun Jul 19 07:18:29 2015 UTC,"Could be Blacky, which on one hand I love because Buddy is close to the organization, a phenomenal talent utilizer, and has a wonderful baseball acumen. On the other hand, he's too close to Scioscia and basically becomes his FO strongman."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,shiftyeyedgoat,2,Mon Jul 20 05:14:20 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard from the baseball insiders like the Olneys and Rosenthals, Bud Black prefers to be in the dugout and he's probably going to find a manager position sometime in the future.   Dipoto wasn't perfect, but he left the organization in better shape than when he started in 2011. My hope is the assistant GM Matt Klentak stays and becomes GM. He was director of baseball operations with the Orioles for 3 years before Dipoto hired him. He has the front office experience, but he's also has the eye for advanced metrics that, I think, are an absolute must for player evaluations."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,wonderbread403,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:23:32 2015 UTC,Well that placeholder had more success that Jerry ever had as a GM.
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,Titan67,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:22:54 2015 UTC,I don't understand why the majority of Halo's fans consistently credit Dipoto. Anyone care to explain?
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,Edhop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:23:42 2015 UTC,"It puzzles me too, like everyone here loves to shit on Reagins but he did oversee 3 AL West division championship seasons, and before that he over saw player development. Development of players such as Aybar and Kendrick. His scouting regime found Trout. He drafted Richards. But one bad trade that the owner forced him to do and he is crucified while good ole Jerry gets a pass for those moves."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,Titan67,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:58:12 2015 UTC,"You do know that Reagins fired Eddie Bane, the director of scouting from 2004-2010 that drafted Weaver, Adenhart, Trumbo, Trout, Skaggs, and Richards, right?"
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,wonderbread403,0,Mon Jul 20 19:10:40 2015 UTC,"Whoever Mike Trout wants. On a serious note I'm not ready to give Jerry all of the credit for the teams success, without Mike Trout and Pujols we aren't having 50 win upvote parties. Calhoun was drafted before Dipoto was GM. I'm not trying to say Jerry sucks but thinking he is the SOLE reason for the success right now is misguided in my opinion."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,Titan67,4,Sun Jul 19 08:48:04 2015 UTC,"He is the reason our pitching has been great this year, and the pitching depth we now have will allow us to make a big deadline acquisition, something we haven't had much of in recent history."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,breakfast_cats,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:52 2015 UTC,"No, our pitching is great this year because our pitchers are doing great, Heaney is great because our coaching staff coached him up on his delivery. A GM has no effect on on-field performance. Garret Richards was an Angel before Jerry was. Jerry didn't make Richards who he is today, Garret did."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,Titan67,4,Mon Jul 20 09:13:27 2015 UTC,So you're giving Dipoto no credit for acquiring Santiago and Heaney? Then who cares at all about the GM? Clearly their job doesn't matter.
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,dukiehazzard,4,Mon Jul 20 13:13:42 2015 UTC,Not to mention how he completely rebuilt the bullpen in the middle of last year. Signing Smith and trading for and extending Street were fantastic Dipoto moves. I guess some people don't remember how bad our pitching was just 2 years ago.
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,breakfast_cats,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:51 2015 UTC,"One reason our pitching sucked 2 years ago was Joe fucking Blanton, someone that Jerry signed. Dipoto did an awesome job with the bullpen but not every Jerry move was fantastic, we could really use that Grischuk kid he traded to St. Louis right now. I also haven't heard a word about that Cuban kid they dropped a lot of $$ for."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,Titan67,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:42 2015 UTC,"I never said every move was great. I agree about Grichuk definitely. And obviously Blanton was terrible, but at the time of the signing, it wasn't a bad idea. Arte had just given Hamilton all the money in the world, and Jerry had to create a rotation with almost no money to work with. Blanton was a decent back of the rotation innings eater type his entire career, nobody could have predicted he would be anywhere near as bad as he was."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,breakfast_cats,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"Jerry signed Blanton because Arte made him sign Hamilton and he had no money left over for pitching, which is what he wanted to spend on in the first place."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,cshenton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"That's not my point. It's not like Santiago and Heaney are pitching well because Jerry told them to do it. Mike Scioscia and the coaching staff probably had more to do the with success of those guys than Jerry. Jerry did a great job of getting the guys, he deserves credit for that, but the players he got aren't good JUST because Jerry Dipoto got them they're good because they put the work in themselves."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,Titan67,3,Mon Jul 20 17:10:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think you realize just how insane it was that we got not one but TWO great young lefty starters for one Mark Fucking Trumbo. That may have been one of the best trades this team has made in the last 10 years. Add that to the Kendrick for Heaney trade and the rebuilt bullpen and pitching depth, Jerry did a lot more to help this team than you're giving credit for. Sure he's not the reason the players are good. They are good because they are good players. And if it wasn't for Jerry we wouldn't have them on our team."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,breakfast_cats,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"If all those moves Jerry made didn't pan out this sub would be calling for Scioscia's head. But since they did pan out Jerry gets the credit. He deserves credit for getting the guys, as I said above, but they still needed to be coached. Here is an article that explains how Heaney was coached up on his delivery by Mike Butcher Jerry did a good job in getting him, but the coaching staff deserves more credit in this sub for the teams success than its getting."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,Titan67,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything here except-   If all those moves Jerry made didn't pan out this sub would be calling for Scioscia's head.   I'm pretty sure we'd all be calling for Dipoto's head if all his moves backfired. Only the idiots would be blaming Sosh for it.  Also, I agree that the coaching staff should get more credit, I never said anything to the contrary. But this thread is about our opinion of Dipoto, and IMO he is a big reason for why our pitching situation is very good right now."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,breakfast_cats,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"Jerry did a great job of getting the guys, I'm just of the the opinion that it necessarly isn't a death sentence for the team if the next GM isn't a carbon copy of him. OP of this thread mentioned how he couldn't IMAGINE how bad it was during Reagins tenure, well I was there, I was watching the team, it wasn't a nightmare that people here seem to believe."
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,Titan67,2,Tue Jul 21 02:30:40 2015 UTC,But without Pujols (or Hamilton) he would have had a lot more resources. We don't know who would be on the team or how they would be doing without Pujols.
angelsbaseball,3dtcns,dukiehazzard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:01:03 2015 UTC,Well that winter the Angels needed a 1B and a big bat to replace Vlad. We all saw how Prince was in Detroit. I loved Trumbo but now it's obvious that we made the right move in trading him.

But I've seen a lot of Angels fans with an irrational hate of the Dodgers as well. It's both sides. Dodgers hate the LA part of the Angels name for sure, but I would say they don't hate Angels fans. I went to a game at Dodgers Stadium last year with a Dodgers friend and there were tons of Angels fan there that were like me. They came with Dodgers friends and all in all, everybody was friendly because there's a lot of connections across the Orange Curtain."
angelsbaseball,3dnr13,wonderbread403,-3,Fri Jul 17 20:00:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm a lifelong Angels fan and I hate the Dodgers. I just don't go around yelling/commenting ""HURRR DURRRR FUCKING THE DODGERS WE HAVE MIKE TROUT!!"" I find it best to just calmly say, yeah I hate/don't like the Dodgers because I have been an Angel fan for life. For the most part, they're reasonable and MIGHT not stab you.   Edit: Hate might be a strong word, but I think of it in a more competitive connotation than dislike. If that makes sense."

Dodger fans see us as a threat because we are just as good, my Dad liked both teams growing up but when Angels became a lot better his friends told him he had to pick a side, so he went with the Angels. Living in Los Angeles I get a lot of hate for being an Angels fan, but if we were shit Dodger fans wouldn't pay any attention to us."

angelsbaseball,3dnr13,muzakx,2,Sat Jul 18 04:41:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't understand why fans would have a rivalry-like hate for a team that's in a different league. Sure, they're near each other geographically, but there's no baseball relevance to that. The only time it really makes sense for the fan of an AL team to genuinely hate an NL team is if they were to face off against each other in the World Series. And that's never happened between the Angels and Dodgers, sooooo..."

Jokes aside, its a local rivalry and LA folks are pretty intense about their baseball. They hate us because all Angel fans remember a World Series title and they haven't had one in over a quarter century. Dodger fans can boast about the name or what not and all we have to do is calmly point to our 2002 banner while their most recent banner has a whole lot more dust on it.  In the end, I don't hate the Dodgers, I actually like many of their players and Kershaw is probably my favorite non-Angel. I work at a sports bar and its their fans that drive me bananas. Thats my only problem with them."

angelsbaseball,3dca2e,lethalred,7,Wed Jul 15 04:26:56 2015 UTC,Mike Trout making my b-day even better!
angelsbaseball,3deyww,wonderbread403,9,Wed Jul 15 19:16:59 2015 UTC,"What about CJ Wilson for Andre Ethier? Their contracts are fairly similar, and they each would fill the other teams's needs."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,Weaver4prez,5,Wed Jul 15 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"Before the season, I suggested a trade for Ethier. My Dodger friends said the brittleness of Crawford and Puig makes Ethier a highly valued bench player for them."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,ZombieLabrador,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:52:20 2015 UTC,That sounds like a very good trade for both clubs.  As a dodger fan I'd love to see our fo make this kind of move.
angelsbaseball,3deyww,Redpubes,5,Thu Jul 16 04:55:18 2015 UTC,"Ethier is a super consistent .285 hitter, a decent defender, and we can fill in that pitching spot with Heaney and Skaggs in the future.  It's like giving away Howie to get Howie back, but getting the better pitcher in the long run."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,lukotheboss,4,Thu Jul 16 07:12:58 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this trade before as well, both started off good this year and have kind of tailed off. I think Ethier would benefit from consistent at bats, which he doesn't get in LA."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,dudmun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:06:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a big Ethier fan. Not so much a fan of Wilson's PMA'ing, but he's been decent this year."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,Titan67,4,Thu Jul 16 21:16:30 2015 UTC,"Considering the market and the assets the Angels have, IMO, I don't think anyone out there is worth trading for. I can't believe I'm taking the Stoneman approach, after years of asking why they would trade during his GM days, but I don't want to give up Gott, not Heaney, and not Sean Newcomb. I rather Artie throw a stupid $$ contract at either Justin Upton or Cespedes in the winter."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,MilkSteakOnDeck,3,Thu Jul 16 06:45:49 2015 UTC,"Jay Bruce anyone??  2 years ago he hit 30 dingers and drove in 100+. With the reds no doubt becoming sellers at the deadline, Bruce could easily be had for the right price. Question now is what's Cincy looking for to acquire Bruce's services? His contract isn't bad either, after this season he's over $12.5, and the year after that there's a club option ($13M). He's also a left handed bat similar to Ethier, but with more light tower power than Ethier would have. Ethier has been the better hitter average wise, but it seems like he gets the day off when facing LHP more than Bruce does. However Ethier has played the rover in the outfield, whereas Bruce has only played RF, he would obviously have to learn to play LF on the fly, but in the meantime the Angels would DH him and have Joyce (ugh) man LF while Bruce learns that side of the outfield.   Could be an option, Bruce is like a Mark Trumbo build, and the Angels seem to have a hard on for big white dudes that can hit the long ball. Who the Angels would have to give up would be a big concern though, as the Reds will be sellers, they would be looking for youth to build the farm. The Dodgers on the other hand are looking to solidify the rotation, so would prefer to take a seasoned vet (CJ, Hector) over prospects."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,MilkSteakOnDeck,3,Thu Jul 16 01:51:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of a Bruce trade. He's a little expensive for a one-dimensional player. He's below-average against lefties over his career and his power numbers are little inflated because of Great American Ballpark. On road games, his power numbers drop. Angels should get a good contact hitter that can drive the ball and bring a good glove to LF. Ethier is a good hitter, but has below average defense and he's expensive. That's why Scott Van Slyke is worthwhile to me. Good bat, good defense. His weakness against rightys is not that bad considering is career wRC+ against them is still 106 (100 is MLB average)."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,MilkSteakOnDeck,2,Thu Jul 16 05:46:31 2015 UTC,"SVS would be nice but he makes $500k+, whereas CJ pulls in $16mil. Salaries don't match like they would in a CJ, Ethier trade. Even though the Dodgers are throwing money at everyone I doubt they'd be willing to add on an additional $15.5mil to their already bloated team payroll. Maybe we can trade them someone else where the salaries match? Who? They are in the market for a rotation arm, doubt they'd be interested in Shoe given how inconsistent he's been this season. So for a CJ, SVS deal to work the Angels would have to be willing to absorb some of CJ's deal, or take on an expiring contract of the Dodgers they no longer want. Off the top of my head can't think of anyone that makes a good chunk of change they'd be willing to part with, maybe J-Rol?   So the reason why you've heard rumors of CJ for Ethier is not only because they are both good players that could bring something to their respective clubs, but also because their salaries are almost the same (per year). I'm not a fan of Ethiers contract 2016 and beyond though ($55.5mil for 3 years w/ an option for a buyout in 2018).   We'll see what Stoneman and the brass decide come trade deadline."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,jtkelly86,2,Thu Jul 16 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"Shoemaker is the only person that makes most sense in a trade for SVS. Both are 28 years old with $500k contracts. The Doyers would have to accept a proven pitcher that's been inconsistent this year, but considering their lack of pitching depth, they may bite. I hope the Angels throw it out there to the blue team."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,trabbledot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:40:54 2015 UTC,"They don't have to accept anything, it's not like they're being forced to acquire an arm. Keep in mind they're still in the mix for Cueto, and Hamels. We haven't heard SVS' name on the block for a reason, he's cheap and he's proven he can produce. It's not in a teams best interest to move cheap talent when they've got other expensive players riding the pine that they need to move."
angelsbaseball,3deyww,jtkelly86,2,Thu Jul 16 22:49:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, we will probably wait it out until the waiver deadline in August. I doubt we make moves by the non-waiver deadline of July 31st.   in all honesty, we should stay put and see what happens if the asking prices are too high. Our pitching staff is doing great this season and we still have a shot even with a hole in our lineup in LF."

angelsbaseball,3d7equ,Fourty6n2,18,Tue Jul 14 02:36:40 2015 UTC,Love the new format. I thought the timed round would kill Pujols but he did well. That Joc Pederson guy is gonna be scary good in a few years.
angelsbaseball,3d7equ,Titan67,5,Tue Jul 14 02:57:08 2015 UTC,"I think the timed round is what eventually did Pujols in. He had Joc beat, but he ran out of gas/got too sweaty at the end of his second round.  I was still pleasantly surprised with how well the new format worked out, though."
angelsbaseball,3d7equ,dukiehazzard,4,Tue Jul 14 03:57:36 2015 UTC,"I wish he could have stepped out again to add more pine tar / rosin to the bat, his bottom hand was slipping off the bat pretty often. If he had more grip he would have won"
angelsbaseball,3d7equ,lukotheboss,3,Tue Jul 14 05:26:48 2015 UTC,"Oh I believe if it's was the original ""boring"" format (I liked but whatever) Pujols would win. He was the oldest guy there going against 20 year olds. But he still contributed to a great overall derby. Buzzer beater to beat Bryant was sweet."
angelsbaseball,3d7equ,Titan67,7,Tue Jul 14 07:12:21 2015 UTC,Don't think there's any doubt.  Infinitely more exciting.
angelsbaseball,3d7equ,KennyGardner,9,Tue Jul 14 02:58:12 2015 UTC,Disappointed in this tweet  Seriously?
angelsbaseball,3d7equ,lukotheboss,5,Tue Jul 14 03:59:40 2015 UTC,"So Cincinnati > LA? Way to go, Doyers."
angelsbaseball,3d7equ,neilswank,-1,Tue Jul 14 04:09:11 2015 UTC,I think we can all agree that LA is better than Cincinnati as a city/area though. Fraizer put on a hell of a show

angelsbaseball,3d7equ,wiNNA_monstER,7,Tue Jul 14 03:06:32 2015 UTC,So much fun. Terrible announcing though. And some pretty bad camera work / producing. The producer could not keep up cutting between following the ball and getting back for the next pitch.

angelsbaseball,3d5cdo,lukotheboss,19,Mon Jul 13 17:26:22 2015 UTC,I'm really glad Ned Yost gave Trouty the start in centre over his guy. It's all good and well saying Cain's better defensively but it's only one game and the best player in the league deserves to play his favourite position.
angelsbaseball,3d5cdo,markthewean,29,Mon Jul 13 17:53:16 2015 UTC,It's spelled center you filthy canadian.
angelsbaseball,3d5cdo,cshenton,6,Mon Jul 13 17:59:23 2015 UTC,"Also, favourite"

angelsbaseball,3d5cdo,tMoneyMoney,4,Tue Jul 14 01:22:31 2015 UTC,It's our reward for letting them sweep us in the ALDS last year.
angelsbaseball,3d5cdo,RogerMcRogerson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:15:07 2015 UTC,I don't think you have an option when you have your guy and then the best player in the game.
angelsbaseball,3d5ng6,SwagNoodle,3,Mon Jul 13 18:43:08 2015 UTC,Considering our record of fairweather fans i'd just show up the day of the game and give the cashier a price point and they will find you the best available seats. Or buy the cheapest seats available and move down. If you are an orioles fan the first base side is your friend Sec125-131. However  Trout throws balls out to the front row of sec 239-240 between innings.
angelsbaseball,3d5ng6,i-need-approval,2,Mon Jul 13 19:07:58 2015 UTC,I think the first few rows of anywhere (except waaaaaay down the line in the corners) in the 400 section are pretty good
angelsbaseball,3d5ng6,lukotheboss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:57:00 2015 UTC,We usually find the 500s row a perfect.  They sell the ones behind home for about $10 give or take a few bucks.   Row A gives you leg room and a good view.  400 row a are great as well but the stairs down are steep
angelsbaseball,3d5ng6,halo_will27,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:21:40 2015 UTC,"I always sit in the 500s.  Seems to me like people up there are more in to watching the game.  Had some great baseball conversations up there.  Plus, it's fun to walk down the ramps when I'm drunk"
angelsbaseball,3d5g79,g0angels,6,Mon Jul 13 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"Hell no?  A) he plays RF, so he would have to make the transfer to LF, since Calhoun's going nowhere.  B) His contract is expensive, but it looks like the Reds are ready to eat some if not most of it?  C) He doesn't really add anything over than our other LF options (Robertson, Navarro).  He's pretty much Trumbo (but maybe a little better defensively, which isn't saying a whole lot)"
angelsbaseball,3d5g79,schplat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:28:32 2015 UTC,"For a major league outfielder I don't see why changing a corner outfield position would cause too much of a problem especially in Angels Stadium where left field is completely standard. And to say that he is nothing more than a Mark Trumbo is just foolish. Yes he's having a down year but he's been a perennial top 10 position player in the NL for the last few years. I think his contract certainly matches his ability and he's under team control for 2/3 more seasons. I would much rather see the Angels grab a player that they will have for a couple years than sit around watching Joyce try to figure out how a bat works or go after someone like Justin Upton.   Edit: Not top 10, according to fangraphs he is #28 in WAR from 2010-2014. I just pulled top 10 out of my ass."
angelsbaseball,3d5g79,schplat,2,Mon Jul 13 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"By saying he's nothing more than a Mark Trumbo, I'm saying he's a perennial .250 hitter with solid, but not amazing power, and average at best defense.  His best power year is 34 HR.  In Anaheim that's gonna be 25-30.  He's played a total of 4 games in LF in his career, and all during his rookie year.  And there is an adjustment moving corners at the major league level.  Hell, it was an adjustment even at the HS level.  And after several years of nothing but RF, LF is going to be a bit foreign on anything requiring getting the ball back in quickly, or anything hit down the line.  We all know Joyce is not the answer, but what precisely would going out and picking up a multi-million dollar multi-year contract on Jay Bruce provide that Navarro and Robertson cannot?  Especially when it looks to cost a couple pitching prospects..  I would much rather make a run at Upton than Bruce, but even then, maybe.  It'd have to be a damn good deal in order to happen, as I think Robertson/Navarro as our 3rd and 4th OFs works great (and yah, I know Navarro is down, but I think that's short term)."
angelsbaseball,3d5g79,HippiesBeGoneInc,3,Mon Jul 13 20:18:56 2015 UTC,"How about not giving up the prospects we don't have for an expensive, and not very good, rental."
angelsbaseball,3d5g79,tMoneyMoney,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:06:32 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting who our new GM is. If you've heard of the player on the table, Stoneman can't pull off the deal. If we're lucky, we might get some minor leaguer named Bruce Jay."

Filming games for a big promo. My other guess would be they are looking to sponsor a player (CJ would be my guess), and need footage for an upcoming commercial featuring him (I'm aware CJ exclusively wears New Balance), CJ would be the guy that goes against the grain and wears the less popular brand. Kind of like the hipsters in DTLA that tried to bring Fila or LA Gear back in the mix. This is purely speculation here, but CJ looks like he would be the ""hipster"" of the clubhouse, amirite??"

angelsbaseball,3cvlcg,nimannn,7,Sat Jul 11 06:04:45 2015 UTC,"Let's not discount Santiago. In a season where our other starters struggling to find consistency, Hector has really stepped up and has been lights out, throwing nothing short of ace-level stuff. It's been incredible to see him evolve from a guy who'd fall behind trying to nip at the corners to a guy that attacks the zone and has confidence in his stuff."

angelsbaseball,3cvlcg,FuntCision,3,Sun Jul 12 03:31:30 2015 UTC,"He has been a bit streaky. That being said, he is hitting over .300 with a great OPS. He is second in the league in Runs, top ten in RBI, and leads the AL in HR's (tied with Albert) and WAR currently. His defense has been solid in the game's I've watched. He is doing great and is pacing toward a .300, 45 HR, 115 RBI, .950-1.000 OPS, 125 Runs, 20 steals, 11 WAR & a 2nd straight AL MVP."
angelsbaseball,3cvlcg,FuntCision,2,Sun Jul 12 03:37:31 2015 UTC,I guess the error in my ways is focusing too much on one stat. But he's just up there in every stat

angelsbaseball,3cusp2,lethalred,7,Sat Jul 11 01:34:13 2015 UTC,There's something ironic to me about an Angels fan who says the Home Run Derby is too long.  Like our fans don't show up in the 4th and leave in the 7th as it is.  It's supposed to be a spectacle. It doesn't need to be perfect. It's supposed to be power hitters going against each other and trying to crank as many balls out of the park on a slow-pitch fastball as possible.  It doesn't need to be made better. It just needs to not be boring. More home runs = Less boring.

angelsbaseball,3cr0rw,dslicex,2,Fri Jul 10 05:19:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, so here's a fun question. Who's our pro tempore closer? Is it Smith? Or, will Gott be stepping into the ring because Sosh wants to subject him to high amounts of pressure?"
angelsbaseball,3cr0rw,IAmTheWalkingDead,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:47:16 2015 UTC,"I think the answer is Smith. It might be interesting to experiment with Gott but with a chance to take 1st before the break, I don't think Sosh is going to unnecessarily screw around right now.  Depending on when the relief/closers are brought into the game, I wouldn't be surprised to see something like Gott take the 7th then Smith just does 8 and 9 since sometimes Joe likes getting extra work. Or run Gott 7 and 8 if he's good for it, then Smith finishes 9. Or if the starter can go 7, then just do Gott/Smith for 8/9. I think that combo, if necessary, can take the team through the weekend. Worst case scenario is that one of them blows it then Ramos or someone has to step up. Overall, assuming Street is back after the break, I don't think it's too big of a deal."

angelsbaseball,3cp9wh,legionfresh,3,Thu Jul 9 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"Depends upon what they want... But, I'd say no for the price tag they'll put on him."
angelsbaseball,3cp9wh,naaahhman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:52:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think it ever hurts to inquire but I'm with you, the price would probably be too high. Maybe asking the D-Backs about Peralta would be better."
angelsbaseball,3cp9wh,Kelmon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:36:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, the Dbacks are competin, the gots to .500. Mr Stewart is a genius, we'd have to give them nothing of value to get something of value."
angelsbaseball,3cp9wh,naaahhman,3,Fri Jul 10 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"I've mentioned it before, I'd say.. Maybe.  It'd have to be a sweet deal.  I think with Navarro and Robertson platooning in LF, we're in an okay state."
angelsbaseball,3cp9wh,schplat,2,Thu Jul 9 18:53:50 2015 UTC,or Ian Kenedy for that matter
angelsbaseball,3cp9wh,acalomin,2,Thu Jul 9 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"Upton is a free agent at the end of this year.. But then again so is Matt Joyce. Cowgill is also on the DL. It'd be a bold move, the type of one we've seen Arty go for in the past"
angelsbaseball,3cp9wh,Titan67,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:21:29 2015 UTC,"Before this I totally saw him as an Artie big money contract move. Him, Trout, and Calhoun in the outfield would be pretty sweet but idk at what cost"
angelsbaseball,3cp9wh,cshenton,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:09:31 2015 UTC,"As everyone seems to be saying, depends on asking price. If he comes at a good price, pull the trigger.  Personally, I'd rather us get Jay Bruce from the Reds, but he'd obviously take a bit more doing."
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,Shogun_36,26,Wed Jul 8 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"Compared to 2 or 3 weeks ago, this sub is WAY more active.  The whole front office fiasco last week and then this hot streak have definitely perked things up."

angelsbaseball,3cku1b,muzakx,21,Wed Jul 8 18:26:19 2015 UTC,MATT JOYCE
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,OneOfAwe,12,Wed Jul 8 20:05:47 2015 UTC,"We are fully stocked when it comes to young pitching. We currently have Heaney, Newcomb and Skaggs from the left. Along with GRich on the right side.  Then we have Santiago who has been awesome and has given us more than a 5th starter otherwise would. CJ and Shoe have recently been giving us very strong starts.  I'd say pitching wise, the Angels are looking at some bright years ahead.  Oh, and that Trout guy is alright too."
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,muzakx,3,Wed Jul 8 20:58:02 2015 UTC,"Santiago has been amazing, he just hasn't had any run support. If he had the support he'd be in the all-star game.  For prospects you didn't mention Nick Tropeano who had an impressive showing. Plus I'm liking Gott in the 7th. Finally we have some velocity.  The question is what do we do with Weaver after he comes back from the DL."
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,ninjew9,2,Thu Jul 9 06:01:49 2015 UTC,"That's why I didn't mention Weaver. His future is a huge question mark.  I've always loved the guy, but I feel like I'm watching his brother out there. I wonder if it's a genetic thing related to their frame. Jered is exhibiting similar signs to the one's his brother showed near the end of his career(i.e. lower velocity)"
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,Firstadam,6,Thu Jul 9 15:06:12 2015 UTC,Yeah trout is a great pitcher

angelsbaseball,3cku1b,Titan67,6,Wed Jul 8 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"That looks like his draft day pic, which would make him 17 in the pic. Though, I could be mistaken."
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,Scuttle-B,3,Wed Jul 8 20:23:24 2015 UTC,That's what I'm talking about! :)
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,ninjew9,10,Wed Jul 8 19:48:12 2015 UTC,"It seems a lot of people here really thought Jerry DiPoto was the next coming of Billy Beane (still has no rings) for some reason. I wasn't happy to see him go but if it was between him and Scioscia I'm taking Scioscia 10 outta 10 times. Trust the Scioscia, Love the Scioscia"
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,Scuttle-B,7,Wed Jul 8 19:40:22 2015 UTC,"The playoffs are a crapshoot. Beane has still put together fantastic teams on really small budgets. They get more wins for less money than just about anyone.   I'm certainly not a fan of the A's, by any stretch, but you can't deny what Beane has done."
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,muzakx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:52:24 2015 UTC,not this year. This year he messed up
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,cshenton,3,Thu Jul 9 03:03:09 2015 UTC,"No one's going to get it right every time, but he's been getting it right for long enough now that pointing to his lack of rings is not a legitimate criticism."
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,OneOfAwe,3,Thu Jul 9 03:22:38 2015 UTC,I think it all started with the Céspedes trade. That was a big mistake.
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,Samthescott,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:07:28 2015 UTC,"The A's have been insanely unlucky this year. They have a positive run differential, and really have played quite a bit better since their catastrophic first month. But, when you dip to 20 games below .500, you aren't coming back from that."
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,muzakx,3,Thu Jul 9 22:35:49 2015 UTC,"DiPoto has the right idea, he was just handcuffed. With the right data, statistics will dominate Scioscia's 'feelings'. Hell how many times do I have to watch Scioscia put in Alverez to blow a game? The math has already said he shouldn't bt be pitching."

angelsbaseball,3cku1b,tMoneyMoney,-17,Thu Jul 9 07:30:33 2015 UTC,"I'll get excited after July if Albert's still producing after ruining his swing in the Home Run Derby, and if the two stooges manage to make it to the trade deadline without making a shit deal."
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,Titan67,11,Wed Jul 8 18:52:18 2015 UTC,That's a little pessimistic though dont you think?
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,minifocusizer,-13,Wed Jul 8 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"What reason do I have to be optimistic? JeDi was the voice of reason. Now we've got a month of trades, a coach that doesn't care who plays as long they respect his authoritah, and an owner that likes to make trades to get big names that will contribute shit-all to help the franchise and neither one of them has a GM that will keep them in check.  It's going to be a dark July. I'll consider get some sun at a day game in August (if there's any sunshine left to be had in ANA)."
angelsbaseball,3cku1b,cshenton,10,Wed Jul 8 19:03:19 2015 UTC,"What reason do I have to be optimistic?   Were you not following this team during the last Stoneman era? The guy won't even give up our worst player in the farm system, and the only blockbuster trade he's ever completed was renting a DVD. He might swap some garbage here and there, but this team will look the same at the end of the season (or until we find another GM)."

angelsbaseball,3clnmv,liberaljedi,9,Thu Jul 9 05:19:09 2015 UTC,According to Statcast Trout's second home run went 477 feet. I can't help but wonder sometimes how many dingers he'd have if Coors Field was his home park.
angelsbaseball,3clnmv,seeg6,4,Thu Jul 9 05:08:39 2015 UTC,ESPN HR tracker has it at 465 ft
angelsbaseball,3clnmv,schplat,3,Thu Jul 9 06:44:14 2015 UTC,"STAT TRACKER BATTLE!!!  But I'll probably take MLB's measure since it's more accurate and I make this choice not out of logic and scientific evidence, but rather the fact that I'm an obviously biased homer in this case ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

We have no choice but to conclude that it’s fiction. If we consider all the ways that the statistics should behave if there is no curse, we find that they consistently match that model. Certainly, some players will have a decline in power-hitting statistics from the first half of the season to the second after participating in the Derby, but it is clear from the analysis that this would have occurred for those players regardless of whether they chose to participate or not."

Stats wise, Prince Fielder is definitely in the argument, but Albert has him beat in both WAR flavors plus actually plays 1B about 70% of the time (Prince has played 1B in 11 games this year).  EDIT: Well fuck   To determine the new ASG starter, the All-Star reserve who received the most votes on the Player Ballot at the injured player's position moves into the starting lineup.   So, if Hosmer or Fielder make the team as a reserve, they will automatically start over Albert.  Yeah, that's a crock of shit.

angelsbaseball,3bwcph,naaahhman,11,Thu Jul 2 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"While I do believe that JD could have genuinely wanted out, I don't think it was because he didn't like Orange County, or he wanted a vacation, or he just wanted to see his son graduate high school and shit out. I can definitely understand why he would want to leave; Sosh would always wield more power over him in every realm of the organization and this was being enabled Arte. He wasn't allowed to assume the full roll of General Manager with Sosh and Arte having full clout over any and all of his decisions. I think JD leaving was a result of both parties not being able to compromise and Dipoto realizing he would have been a puppet for S&M. Leaving before the end of the season is what irks me about this whole situation but then again it might not be in the teams best interest to have someone who feels no responsibility or loyalty towards the club to be ""acting"" as General Manager. But ultimately I think it is time for the Angels to move on from Scioscia. He has been a good manager for the pass 15 years but the majority of that success came 10 years ago with a coaching staff that turned out to be filled with major league caliber managers. And his playoff record aside from 2002 is abysmal. 8 playoff series, 2 series won, 3 series SWEPT, 3 wins total in the ALCS, and 9 playoff wins in 13 years. Yah I think it's time to move on.  source: http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/ana/history/postseason_results.jsp"

angelsbaseball,3bwcph,g0angels,0,Thu Jul 2 19:22:11 2015 UTC,Hell if Moreno wants to throw ~$80 mil to the Rangers for a rental then hell $18 mil should be nothing! But in all seriousness why doesn't Sosh just assume the role of GM after this season? I've been seeing people/rumors(?) talking about doing that and hiring Bud Black to come back. Maybe he can get Ianetta to lay a fucking bunt down.
angelsbaseball,3bwcph,g0angels,4,Thu Jul 2 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"Stoneman is practically Scioscia, he'll stand pat, which is good and bad.

Fuck it, I'll always ride the Angels ship, whether we sink or reach land."

Making an effort to acquire a huge contract (seemingly for no other reason than he was a recognizeable name because he sure as hell wasn't worth the money) is an entirely different matter. When you know from the outset that the guy is being overpaid, you make no efforts to get any cash, and you give a guy like Mike Napoli to get him, you're either drunk, or bad at your job.

angelsbaseball,3bwcph,rex_llama,5,Thu Jul 2 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"Lol I don't think you can find a better neighborhood than Newport Beach. Why is it so hard to fathom that Jerry was making the necessary moves to get the hell out of Anaheim? I'm sure it's a tough job having to deal with Mike and Arte in your ear completely disregarding your advanced scouting, that you and your staff worked so hard on. Someone on the AngelsWin forum hit it right on the head when they said Arte is the Hispanic Jerry Jones. He's the owner so we as fans must deal with his ""from the hip"" deals that almost always amount to us shaking our heads in disbelief."

You have to believe Ken Rosenthal and others wouldn't have been so confident in the story if they didn't have a super credible source.  Can't really blame Jerry for doing it either.    Also, good points on Sosh.  While I would rather have DiPoto as GM than Sosh as manager, that doesn't mean he isn't a shitty manager.  The guy indisputably was a top 3 manager in the league until the last couple years.  4 losing seasons over 15 years.  Year after year of outperforming Mr. Pythagoras. The same people tearing him a new one on /r/baseball are probably the same people who praised him just a couple years ago."

angelsbaseball,3bsack,neferiousrich,14,Wed Jul 1 19:09:15 2015 UTC,"It's amazing how you guys seem to forget that Dipoto has had some questionable choices. Joe Blanton, Sean Burnett, Ryan Madson, Tommy Hanson, Josh Hamilton, and Matt Joyce. He has done some good things but you guys act like he is perfect. You guys have also seemed to turn on by far the best manager in franchise history."
angelsbaseball,3bsack,HaloManiaC27,7,Wed Jul 1 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"The only real mistake he made there was the Blanton signing.   Sean Burnett would have been awesome had he not gotten injured, the Madson signing was a low risk move that didn't really cost us anything, and we just got plain unlucky with Joyce, who had been a solid platoon player his entire career until now.  The Hanson trade was a little more questionable, but it's easy to forget how erratic and unreliable Walden was at the time, so that was pretty much a wash. The Hamilton signing was pretty much all Arte's doing like the Pujols one was, so I'd take most of the blame off Dipoto on that one too.  DiPoto was overall a good, even great GM. It's a damn shame Arte screwed with his authority, or his legacy might have even been greater. ."
angelsbaseball,3bsack,choking_da_chicken,8,Thu Jul 2 01:45:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Arte is a controlling, conservative, asshole. He can't work with others and causes chaos around him.  Or that's just a bunch of speculation, but it's a gut feeling."
angelsbaseball,3bsack,Redpubes,7,Thu Jul 2 02:16:06 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt. Most media and insider info support that opinion.   Why hire a competent, bright general manager if you're just going to override his authority to make baseball decisions? Why force him to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a few big names and then try to scrape together a supporting cast with the leftover scraps? Why sit tight when your manager's ego and stubbornness interferes with your GM's plan for the team?    A normal organization puts the manager at the bottom of the food chain, with the general manager having the power to hire and fire staff at will. When your GM is so hamstrung by the owner to the point where he can't fire his manager and pitching coach, you know shit's gone reeeeal bad."

angelsbaseball,3bsack,tMoneyMoney,2,Wed Jul 1 21:01:41 2015 UTC,Maybe. I'm sure the guys are more loyal to the coaches than to the front office. But if they weren't - it's not like they're going to speak out about it and risk angering those who control putting them on the field. Only a handful of guys on the team would have immunity from speaking out like that.
angelsbaseball,3bsack,IAmTheWalkingDead,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:04:02 2015 UTC,I think the players need to be diplomatic when it comes to disputes between manager/coaches and the front office. I have no doubt that scioscia knows arte has his back no matter what and was able to get pujols to join him. When you get guys like pujols or other veterans to start taking sides with the manager there is no point to having a GM anymore. Might as well just have a puppet like reagins.

angelsbaseball,3bsack,iusebadlanguage,4,Wed Jul 1 20:16:06 2015 UTC,"Players typically don't have a close personal relationship with GMs. His agent may be comfortable negotiating with Dipoto, but really, every team is going to want Trout. I think it will ultimately come down to the success and direction of all the teams involved at that time. It's certainly possible Dipoto could turn around the Phillies, then make a run at Trout. But it's also possible the Angels figure it out by then and entice him to stay.  That's a long way off. If things start going poorly, the team will have moved in a different direction by then. Scioscia won't be around in 6 years if that's the case. The fact that Moreno was attempting to get Jerry to stay gives me some hope that he's not entirely sure about this decision, and there will be a lot of pressure on Scioscia to succeed."
angelsbaseball,3bsack,dukiehazzard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:54:25 2015 UTC,"I've always been curious about the relationships between GM's and the players. After reading money ball I assumed it was strictly business so it makes since that players wouldn't be really close.   I do agree it was a good sign Arte tried to get Jerry to stay, and it also makes me really curious what Dipoto's ultimatum was. I don't find it very likely that he said ""its either me or Sosh"" just probably something along the lines of enforcing the power he has over the organization. I wish it would have played out more along the lines of the Eagles this offseason, where Lurie gave more power to the strengths Chip and Roseman.  Edit: I just saw Stoneman will be the GM for the rest of the season. Which is actually probably the best way we could have moved forward since hes a firm believer in building the farm."

I'm not sure how much of that can be blamed on Sosh. In the end though, he gets the blame.   If he were to go I wouldn't be disappointed. I might be if the next guy gets worse results, but I quickly learn to end my love for traded players, etc.    One other thing, I feel this roster is more suited to Sosh's management style that got the Angels some of their best seasons.

I really liked Dipoto as our GM, but I knew Scioscia was not a good fit for the team he built. I really don't understand this teams unbreaking loyalty to him just for bringing us a single championship well over a decade ago, when the landscape of baseball was very different than it is today. I just want something different. I wish Arte would have let Jerry do his job and allow him to get his own manager and coaching staff instead of choosing to stick with the guy who refuses to move into the 21st century."

Look at his track record! Trumbo- Skaggs/Santiago [BIG ANGEL WIN], Kendrick- Heaney [BIG ANGEL WIN], Conger- Tropeano/Perez [BIG ANGEL WIN], Alvarez/Rondon/Lindsey- Street/Gott [BIG ANGEL WIN]. Even small moves like picking up Giavotella this year, trading for Frieri, trading Frieri for Grilli, the Iannetta signing, sigining Joe Smith. He has made a couple iffy moves (Blanton, Tommy Hanson, Sean Burnett, Raul Ibanez, Matt Joyce) but his overall track record is outstanding. I 100% consider the Pujols and Hamilton signings to have been forced on him by Arte, so lets ignore those. DiPoto also modernized this franchise and took it from the stone age to now we are playing the same game that everyone else is playing. By the Angels choosing Sosh over DiPoto they are choosing to live in the 90's due to loyalty over a coach that won a championship way back in 2002. Pathetic."

It seems clear to me that Sosh and Albert want him gone.  Other clubhouse leaders like Weav will certainly side with Sosh.    What a fucking strange year.  Honestly, I can be the biggest Mike Scioscia apologist at times, but I don't think I would be too mad if Arte fired the entire coaching staff and stuck with DiPoto as GM.  It would probably risk a mutiny by the players but I can say with certainty DiPoto has done more to move this team in a positive direction than Mike Scioscia over the last few years."

angelsbaseball,3bq2so,dslicex,3,Wed Jul 1 06:30:38 2015 UTC,"Stability and a consistent 'system' are certainly benefits of having a long term presence as manager.  I think players like that.  However, especially in this situation, I think those benefits are outweighed by the benefits of having a great GM.    I do actually think that, if this goes down and Sosh 'wins' this battle, it will galvanize the team in the short term.

angelsbaseball,3bpyn9,naaahhman,2,Wed Jul 1 06:16:16 2015 UTC,"Sciocia didnt fire him, Scioscia didnt go up to Arte with an Ultimatum."
angelsbaseball,3bqdhb,g0angels,10,Wed Jul 1 08:24:46 2015 UTC,"DiPoto.  Not all of his moves have worked out well, but I see the logic behind them and he's done a lot to bring talent to his team.  That said, talent needs coaching. Scioscia's been dogshit the last few years, and I question almost every decision he makes in-game.  Whens the last time we won a game because of a good coaching move? Not sure, but they're rare  Whens the last time we lost a game because of a bad coaching move? A couple times a month.  If Scioscia had been managing well the last few years, we wouldn't have to have this discussion (and the 5000 other ones about his coaching, usually ending in his being called ""lasagna boy"" or ""fat mike""). The simple fact that we question him is enough to show that he isn't 100% for us.  Random situation off the top of my head. We had a game a while ago with the tying (or go-ahead, dont remember) run on 1st with 1 out. Kubitza AB. Old Sosh would bunt to second and try to have the lead-off hitter bring him in. New Sosh doesn't.  Kubitza ended up GIDP. One small example but I see shit like this all. the. time. At least 10 games over the last year have been blown because of poor scioscia decisions.  I also don't understand the comments about how the players side with Scioscia. Maybe Pujols because his ass was stuck in the 3-hole despite the fact that he was had short runs where he was complete dog shit. If I was playing horribly and the coach kept trusting me in the 3 spot, I'd like him too. I've seen Weaver want to mash Scioscia's face in on more than one occasion.  the bad relationship here was sparked by the firing of Hatcher. If i remember right, we were offensive SHIT at the time. Hatcher had to go, and his firing is none of Scioscia's business. That transforms into today's issues, with coaches not relaying ""info"" to players. Thats pathetic, imo.  I side with DiPoto. Power to him"
angelsbaseball,3bqdhb,srzhk,3,Wed Jul 1 08:53:34 2015 UTC,Idk I'm kind of on Sosh's side for this one.  Unfortunately I haven't been totally able to stay updated with everything regarding the team but I don't really agree with some of Dipoto's GM decisions. It's sad for either of them to have to leave but I'd choose Sosh
angelsbaseball,3bqdhb,YellowShorts,2,Wed Jul 1 08:35:23 2015 UTC,I'm on Sosh's side as well. I don't think he's been flawless as a manager but I also think that a lot of our problems this year are due to the fact that our roster just isn't as strong as it was last year. We still have some great pieces but there are too many  holes in the line up now. It's the GM's job to make sure that we have the right roster pieces and the roster took a big step backwards this year (this was Albert's argument as well). We see constant whining on here about why certain players are still playing. In a lot of those places it's because we don't have anyone else to play in their spot.
angelsbaseball,3bqdhb,provoaggie,2,Wed Jul 1 16:34:59 2015 UTC,"Sosh is an overrated coach who has seriously underachieved. It was Dipoto that gave him that roster last year. Lets not forget when he and his puppet Reagins were running players they traded for and PAID most of Vernon Wells contract. Sosh has too much leeway for winning 13 years ago. Since then he's been a mediocre manager who hires his buddies. BTW as a Dodger fan, Mickey Hatcher sucked at his job for us too."
angelsbaseball,3bqdhb,TNinLosAngeles,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:20:45 2015 UTC,"I understand that Dipoto gave him the roster he had last year...and with that Roster they won 98 games, won the division by 10 games, had the best record in all of baseball and then lost in the playoffs to a red hot Royals team that won the wildcard, swept the next 2 series and took the World Series to 7 games. Scioscia did exactly what he was supposed to with that team and then fell short against a team that didn't look like anyone could stop them."
angelsbaseball,3bqdhb,provoaggie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:31:43 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on those decisions you don't like?
angelsbaseball,3bqdhb,YellowShorts,3,Wed Jul 1 08:41:32 2015 UTC,"There just haven't been any front office decisions that I've been super excited about. But like I said, I haven't really been able to keep up with everything the past year or so in detail so my knowledge on what exactly Dipoto/Sosh have done is pretty limited.  Seemed Sosh did pretty well last year with 98 wins"
angelsbaseball,3bqdhb,srzhk,7,Wed Jul 1 09:06:53 2015 UTC,"The Angels could have had a cat as a manager, and still reached 98 wins.  We had the HIGHEST scoring team in ALL of baseball. You have Trout and his MVP numbers. Kendrick, Aybar, Calhoun, Pujols with solid offensive numbers.  Then you have ERA by pitcher:  Santiago 3.75 Weaver 3.59 Grilli 3.48 LeBlanc 3.45 Salas 3.38 Diaz 3.18 Kohn 3.04 Shoemaker 3.04 Morin 2.90 Herrera 2.70 Jepsen 2.63 Richards 2.61 Rasmus 2.57 Smith 1.81 Street 1.71 Pestano 0.93  So we had the best offense in the AL, the best defense in the AL, and a top-ranked pitching staff/bullpen, and we finished at 98? I also think we had the highest run differential in all of baseball, passing the A's during the later part of the season if memory serves correctly.   With those figures, that could have been a 108 win team.  tl;dr: We had an AMAZING roster and solid numbers. More of a result of DiPoto's moves than Scioscia's coaching"

angelsbaseball,3bqdhb,soupdup,3,Wed Jul 1 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter now, JeDi gone, Sosh stays! Really thought that Arte would let Sosh go? Does he ever follow baseball logic?  And as for the game changing, Sosh knows this. He has been implementing more shifts, pitching matchups, and is using the scouting reports he has been given. Maybe he wasn't using everything he was given as much as DiPoto wanted, and that's why they had the closed door meetings to decide to give scouting reports directly to the players rather than coaches.  When it's all said and done, we need an interim GM who can make some solid moves this month to improve the team."
angelsbaseball,3bqdhb,tMoneyMoney,3,Wed Jul 1 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"Truth is, given the current state of the unemployed managerial market, Sosh would be much harder to replace mid-season than DiPoto right now. The players respect Scoscia, so we'd have much more to lose by bringing in a new leader they don't care for over canning a guy in a suit they rarely even see. We could definitely use some midseason trades, but we also have a decent farm system to tap into and fill some of these holes like we've already been doing with pitching. Even if DiPoto was around, there's no telling if he would've even made any changes by the deadline, so the difference could be negligible."

Sure we all loved seeing Trumbombs, but at the time, we needed SP depth pretty badly (this was before we knew Shoe was gonna be in the mix).  And Trumbo was poor on defense, and a streaky hitter who trended towards .250  Even if Skaggs doesn't bounce back, we got good value with how Santiago has come around.  Santiago was actually really good last year, his biggest hurdle was he would lose his focus when a runner got on base, and the rails would come off.  He seems to have conquered that this off season, and now he's really shining."

angelsbaseball,3bnnw2,cshenton,6,Tue Jun 30 18:37:46 2015 UTC,"Seriously, this trade was a steal as soon as it was made. Two young pitchers with upside and years of team control remaining for an outfielder whose career OBP was under .300 at the time of the deal, and has only one plus tool (power). It's only going to look better as time goes on.  For a nice evaluation of Trumbo currently, look at the return the Dbacks got for him from Seattle. He went over with Vidal Nuno (a decently-high-upside long reliever), and back came Welington Castillo (a catcher who had only gotten 25 ABs), Dominic Leone (a relief pitcher who was good last year but had an ERA over 6 for Seattle), and two minor leaguers who project as a maybe-everyday-player and a utility player.  Would you trade Santiago and Skaggs for a backup catcher with no bat, a struggling reliever, and two decent AA guys? I hope not. We killed it in this trade."

angelsbaseball,3bnytn,photo_gal2010,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"He's too ""clued in"" actually. Really involved with things that his GM and manager should be handling."
angelsbaseball,3bnytn,MartOut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:42:52 2015 UTC,Oh! That makes sense
angelsbaseball,3bnytn,photo_gal2010,2,Thu Jul 2 07:42:51 2015 UTC,"As this sub has been over a million times, yeah, Hamilton was Arte's fault. Arte is dumb.  But Hamilton is gone. While the team might be left in his wake short a more productive outfielder, it's time to stop using Hamilton as an excuse or scapegoat.  If JeDi has some stats that might help the team make up for the Hamilton situation, the team needs to use it while JeDi figures out how to fill that gap with a more capable player unless one emerges from within the ranks."
angelsbaseball,3bnytn,IAmTheWalkingDead,-3,Tue Jun 30 22:43:30 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with Scioscia on this matter, I feel that all the data any analytics are making the game overly complicated. While it has it's advantages I prefer instincts and gut feelings over data and computation. It makes the game feel so... robotic. Scioscia is the longest tenured manager in the game for a reason, he is one of the best. Messing with his formula and method just doesn't sit right with me  Edit: downvote because I don't add to the discussion, not because you disagree. This is just a different opinion, it doesn't make it bad."

The way Trout reacted was very political. He acknowledged it, smiled and pointed as if to say, ""I get what you're saying by soft tossing that out here.""  I'm getting way to psychological but if it was Aybar both times, it all makes sense. The soft toss at Trout could have been his way of closure, and ending it with a little humor."

angelsbaseball,3biomr,rawrimazombie,7,Mon Jun 29 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you are local or are traveling from out of state, but here are some suggestions in case you are visiting from out of state.  If you guys are looking for drinks to literally pre-game, check out Noble Ale Works. It's a craft brewery around the corner from the Stadium.  You can then enter the stadium 2 hours before the game, but only from the gate behind home plate. Between the two big red hats.  Once inside you'll find a fair selection of craft beer from the area and rest of California. Along with plenty of food, your usual ballpark fare.  If you want something a little bit different head over to Chronic Cantina for some Mexican food. I recommend the Chronic Nachos, about $10, but honestly gets you a lot of food.  Post game is a little quieter outside of the stadium. You'll find a few bars and restaurants open late around the stadium.  If you're looking for nightlife, Downtown Fullerton is the spot to check out. A nice collection of bars and clubs near Cal State Fullerton and FC. The Slidebar is one of the more well known in the area, owned by Lit guitarist Jeremy Popoff.  If you're looking for something Disney related without spending the money for admission, go to Downtown Disney. Parking is free in the Downtown Disney lot for 3 hours, an additional 2 is added if you watch something at AMC theaters. It's a nice outdoor mall with plenty to see. It also has a few places to eat and drink; Rainforest Cafe, ESPN zone, House of Blues, and a few others that I can't recall.  Hope you have fun."
angelsbaseball,3biomr,muzakx,6,Mon Jun 29 16:22:53 2015 UTC,First let me thank you for the in depth response.  I've heard enough to be fully convinced to get some 10 dollar nachos.

angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,dslicex,10,Thu Jun 25 00:19:51 2015 UTC,Stayed the whole game and got to move right behind the Astros dugout. What a game. LTBU!

angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,tacocarnitas,8,Thu Jun 25 00:09:52 2015 UTC,That was most definitely a balk
angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,parrosstach,15,Thu Jun 25 00:07:37 2015 UTC,What the fuck is the point of manager challenges if the crew chief is gonna challenge everything close anyways?
angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,Cooleybob,3,Wed Jun 24 22:54:27 2015 UTC,The problem with playing the Astros is that I feel like at any moment they could homer

angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,adf714,5,Wed Jun 24 21:56:10 2015 UTC,LOOOOOOOL THAT BALL WAS HIT SO WELL IT MADE IT ALLTHE WAY TO THE WARNING TRACK
angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,MartOut,6,Wed Jun 24 21:53:54 2015 UTC,I've noticed Rojas getting really excited about routine flyballs to the outfield lately. Like even off the bat I could tell it didn't really have a chance
angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,adf714,5,Wed Jun 24 21:56:04 2015 UTC,"I noticed that yesterday too. With these two teams, though, he's right more times than he's wrong"
angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,MartOut,2,Wed Jun 24 21:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I suppose, but I've always assumed that most broadcasters have been around the game long enough to have a pretty good idea of what is going to be a homerun and what is not. I'm not saying Rojas isn't knowledgable, but it kind of comes off as amateurish. Oh well, still love the guys in the booth"
angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,adf714,5,Wed Jun 24 22:01:09 2015 UTC,"He's a human being who is bound to get excited about things. It's actually more impressive to be excited and enthusiastic while maintaining a lack of bias towards the home team in everything else, like this duo has. There are more professional sportscasters out there, and there are more enjoyable ones, but this duo us alright, mostly because of that attitude"
angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,MartOut,2,Wed Jun 24 22:03:52 2015 UTC,Yeah that's true. I always love his bluntness when talking about an underperforming player and the chemistry he and Gubicza have. The only Angels broadcaster I'm not fond of is Langston.

angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,dslicex,6,Wed Jun 24 20:29:48 2015 UTC,Is this Heaney's first start with us? I feel like I've seen him pitch this year but I can't remember
angelsbaseball,3ayv5z,Fuzzylumpkin,5,Wed Jun 24 19:58:25 2015 UTC,"He pitched v Dodgers, right before the start of the season. Other than that, no."

Needless to say they were super butthurt to see him leave, let alone to the team that their roommate roots for. One took it in stride as well as one could given the caliber of player, but it took the other years to come around. They are now happy to see him doing well. But I think it helps that we aren't stomping around the NL. But HOLY FUCK it was awesome to see him hit that grand slam with them sitting there with me.

Eventually strikes out having been upset and thinking about something other than the at bat at hand the entire time and it boiled into not telling him the correct way. I think you see Gio totally understand he won't do it again right away, but thats where Kole kinda keep driving it to hard. And Gio is forced to tell him to chill out.  Tldr Gio messed up Koles mindset.  Kole over reacted.   Glad they made up, winning always helps that!"

You can buy same day tickets for sometimes as low as $5/ticket, but I think you have to pick up the tickets at their office to avoid convenience fees (right across from the Honda Center, on Douglass and Katella). You should be able to find tickets together! Hope you have a good time at the game!  Oh and parking at the stadium is $10 I think. I prefer entrance from Douglass (it seems to be the quickest way to drive out). I think there's fireworks that night, which are shot from the parking lot behind center field, so the best view of the fireworks is usually behind home plate or somewhere along the 1st/3rd baselines."

Gia slapped Kole (who was about to bat) on the helmet in excitement after scoring, Kole then struck out, was frustrated and let Gia know no head slappies when he's on-deck and in the fucking zone.

Weaver and Shoe have been the weak points of the rotation. I still have faith in Weaver considering his career with us, but Shoe should have some time to clear his head. We should call up Heaney for a few starts. We need to look at teams not in contention for bats. CarGo is a possibility but he is expensive. He has hit over .300  since late may.

angelsbaseball,3ahkx3,dazed_0ne1,3,Sat Jun 20 10:47:49 2015 UTC,Ethier is pretty much without a position on the Dodgers with Crawford Puig Joc and Van slyke out there so he is more than expendable. CarGo would be way more expensive than him but would bring a superstar here

angelsbaseball,3a9col,dgmilo8085,2,Thu Jun 18 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say they have been at any staggering rate. Nothing Sosh is doing this season is staggeringly bad; the team's just scuffling, so people want a scapegoat. Call it what it is: people want to bitch when we lose."
angelsbaseball,3a9col,cshenton,0,Thu Jun 18 17:47:19 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with that to a point, but there has been little to no rumblings regarding Sosh since the 02 run. He lost his coaching staff to managerial positions, and soul crushing injuries ruined a few seasons, but then you have the tenure of players like Blanton & Frieri, the absolute stop light to the running game, a Yankees payroll of players & a current .500 record. I think it's completely understandable for people to start hounding for Sosh's head. He's the longest tenured manager in baseball & his team's have regularly fallen short of expectations for 10 straight years."
angelsbaseball,3a9col,dgmilo8085,4,Thu Jun 18 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"Let me go through point by point:   There has [sic] been little to no rumblings regarding Sosh since the 02 run   Wrong. He was on the hot seat as recently as last year. Then he went and led the team to 98 wins and that talk died out.   The tenure of players like Blanton & Frieri   Both of whom were in the positions they were in largely due to a lack of organizational options. Frieri was good for awhile here, and people hailed him as the bullpen savior. Then he went sour, and naturally people wanted him out. Sosh would've put someone else out there if he'd had good options. He didn't, so out Frieri went again.  Blanton was the same way. You really think Sosh would've kept running him out there if he had other options? He absolutely did not have other options. Blanton was worth trying, solely because the alternatives were just as miserable.   the absolute stop light to the running game   One thing Sosh does not get nearly enough credit for is managing to his current roster. Sosh likes to run, it's well-documented. You know why he doesn't run with this squad? Because it's not a team that's equipped to run. Trout is the only guy with plus speed, and thus is the only guy who steals bags. You really want him sending guys like Aybar, who is not a good base stealer, just to say he has the running game going? No, you'd complain about how he sends runners when he shouldn't, and how that's a good reason for him to be fired.  Sosh teaches base running very well; his teams' track record will prove that. This just happens to be probably the worst running team he's ever managed. And we still go 1st to 3rd and score on sac flies quite well, given how slow our team is.   A Yankees payroll of players   Take that up with Tony Reagins and Arte. Those two are directly responsible for every huge deal we've thrown at someone during Sosh's tenure with the exception of Trout (whose deal I hope you don't take exception with or I'm wasting my time here completely)   He's the longest tenured manager in baseball & his team's [sic] have regularly fallen short of expectations for 10 straight years   Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. Last year's team was not even on anyone's radar as best team in baseball. Most people had us out of the playoffs. We've had a huge amount of success under Sosh. The only stretch that can be construed as otherwise is the 5 years between 2009 and 2014 where we missed the playoffs, and that was largely due to an extremely competitive AL West, transitioning between core groups of players, and some really bad contracts that hampered our flexibility.   The thing managers should get credit for, above all else, is maintaining clubhouse morale and cohesiveness, as well as managing playing time and the pitching staff without egregious errors. Sosh has done this to a T since he's been here. Whenever he's had a bullpen to work with, he's used it like a scapel. I'm stoked we have him as our manager. There's a reason he's the longest tenured skipper in the bigs, and has been around longer than all the managers in the AL Central combined. But hey, if you want to end a good thing, by all means. Call for his head."
angelsbaseball,3a9col,cshenton,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:14:10 2015 UTC,"The thing managers should get credit for, above all else, is maintaining clubhouse morale and cohesiveness, as well as managing playing time and the pitching staff without egregious errors. Sosh has done this to a T since he's been here.    I disagree with this completely. Especially in regard to clubhouse morale and cohesiveness.  It is my biggest issue with him.  The clubhouse has been anything but cohesive during his tenure, to the point where Pujols and Hunter almost came to blows.  There was an exception last year for a few months, credit where it is due, but it died the second we made the playoffs.  The team's dugout/on field demeanor goes from playing fun and loose one day to stiff and robotic the next.  The old stories of animals in the clubhouse of spring training and smashing guitars on the rocks left with Maddon. I wrote this two years ago, and it states my opinion on the matter more in depth.  I do disagree with you also in regards to how he handles playing time as I feel he puts waaaaaaaaay to much trust in struggling veterans at the expense of giving young talent a chance with consistent at bats. I agree with almost everything else you said, however, and I'll never ask for the man's head for on field moves.  I will second guess, arm chair manage and be generally frustrated, but I understand there is more than one way to get things done, and you mostly end up with the same results in the long term.  But this clubhouse has been nowhere near continuously cohesive since Maddon's departure IMHO, and unless we get back that chemistry/morale we had for a while last year and keep it, I will start to ask for his head again."
angelsbaseball,3a9col,Banggie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:19:36 2015 UTC,"I think I probably used wording that was a bit too strong when I said ""to a T"". I also think you make a good point regarding his hesitancy to give young guys at bats; if I had anything to change about his style, it would be that. But I also think he deserves credit for working guys like Kole into the lineup quickly.  Ultimately, I spoke a little too strongly about his team management. I do believe that he does a good job getting out of the way of the team, and promoting an atmosphere that allows them to handle the clubhouse as they see fit. Lately, we've had players on our roster who prefer to go about their business individually, and we've seen that on the roster. But it's been far from a toxic environment."
angelsbaseball,3a9col,cshenton,2,Fri Jun 19 21:01:09 2015 UTC,"It isn't toxic, but it is an area that needs a lot of improvement IMHO.  I think you and I are both in agreement that a manager has the biggest impact on day-to-day play by controlling the atmosphere in the locker room and dugout more than anything.  If he is simply letting the players police themselves, then is he really doing anything at all?  I guess I am just more of a fan of the Francona, Maddon, Bochy type of managing (which has shown to be pretty successful as well).  They create a fun atmosphere.  Everyone tends to get along more, have each other's backs, and just play loose and have fun.  We don't have that.  We rarely ever have that.  We did in the early 2000s and we played above our heads for a while.  We've had a lot of big names come through since then and haven't done a lot.  Even our post season appearances, which in themselves have been limited, have been brief.    Like I said, we get a little chemistry rolling like last year and I won't have issues.  But if we don't, or it seems to disappear in the playoffs or down the stretch as it has in the past, then I think it's time for a different approach and someone new at the helm."

angelsbaseball,39r4op,IAmTheWalkingDead,8,Sun Jun 14 02:38:10 2015 UTC,I mean it was a failed hit and run. We should definitely keep trying to produce runs
angelsbaseball,39r4op,Fuzzylumpkin,0,Sun Jun 14 02:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying let's go full ""Moneyball"" here and never steal, but our guys aren't very good at it for the most part it seems. The team is bottom 5 in number of steals and stolen base percentage this year. We're also in 9th for percentage caught stealing.  It would be interesting to see a statistical analysis for the team on if advancing the runner to 2nd or 3rd on a steal actually enabled this team to get a run it otherwise wouldn't have and compare that to how many potential runs we've lost because the runner got tagged out on an attempted steal."

angelsbaseball,39rv3n,g0angels,11,Sun Jun 14 03:43:39 2015 UTC,"We talking about Scioscia, his thought process, and all this entails. He didn't go for the bunt because it's early in the game and would give up an out. He is more than confident in Gia's ability to get a hit. He probably wanted to see the team get a big inning instead of a run against Graveman.   He's not worried about a lack of runs against Graveman or the A's bullpen. Though, it looks like in hindsight a run or two would been better than looking for a big inning.   Had it been early in the game against Sonny Gray or another ace, it would have been a different story. The bunt would've been on."
angelsbaseball,39rv3n,naaahhman,2,Sun Jun 14 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"But i feel like in that situation in a close game runs are runs regardless of the opposing pitcher and bullpen, especially when you have someone like CJ on the mound who can be as volatile as he is(given he pitched a gem tonight) Although I am very confident in Johnny G as he has been one of our clutchest if not the clutchest hitter this year, in that situation you have to put two RISP with one out. and as far as having a big inning i dont feel that a sac bunt in that situation for the first out is a big inning/rally killer at all. I just dont see how sosh cant be swelling up at the idea of sac bunting with two men on and a contact hitter like Navarro on deck. I think the only players who dont bunt in that situation are trout, pujols, and ianetta (but only because he absolutely blows at bunting)"
angelsbaseball,39rv3n,chopstewy,4,Sun Jun 14 04:43:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe Sosh is counting on him making solid contact swinging away, as he has doing as of late, like in the 2 walk offs recently? But you do make a great point - 2000s Sosh would've bunted him in a heartbeat."
angelsbaseball,39rv3n,soupdup,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:13:34 2015 UTC,imagine the reaction from fans and players if sosh didnt put the bunt on in a situation like that back in the day
angelsbaseball,39rv3n,soupdup,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:38:39 2015 UTC,"I think he has the confidence in Johnny G to make the hits, like has been all season long. Since he has proven to come in clutch %99.999 of the time, why bunt with no outs and two on? Could have been an RBI for him. Navarro is nowhere near as much of a solid bet as Giavotella is."
angelsbaseball,39rv3n,Banggie,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:49:58 2015 UTC,come on 99.99%? baseball is and has always been a game of failure so when you have the opportunity to make a succesful move like a sac bunt putting two RISP you have to. and in that situation the infield would be playing in on the grass opening up holes on the infield and even just a sac fly brings home a run.
angelsbaseball,39rv3n,NoisomeOne,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:58:22 2015 UTC,"I would still rather let Johnny swing with 1 RISP than waste an out and rely on Efren to make something happen. I mean, at least Efren would be out of a conventional DP situation, but he could also strikeout and then you have two outs."

angelsbaseball,39hqf7,Rogueofoz,4,Thu Jun 11 21:37:58 2015 UTC,"Hey Angels fans! My dad accidentally bought tickets to tomorrow's game back when they went on sale (he was trying to buy ones for Saturday, which we did eventually get). Problem is: we still have them! We thought they'd be easy to sell on stubhub because it's a bobblehead game, but no go. We paid $106 each for them BEFORE service fees. They're now listed on stubhub for $80 $70, which includes fees. You'd be getting a steal. 4 tickets available. They're Field MVP 125, Row Z. Instant download, so you could buy them today or even tomorrow and print them out. Please please someone buy them! Haha. Right now they're listed as only being able to buy all 4, but if you are really interested in them, we're getting desperate and we could probably change it to selling in sets of 2 if you message me with your interest.   Meanwhile, I will be at the games on Saturday and Sunday. :-)  EDIT: $70 NOW!"
angelsbaseball,39hqf7,callie06,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:07:19 2015 UTC,Hope you find someone to take them! I would but I already have tickets i bought months ago. If you are near the stadium you could sell them in person to someone pretty quick. like in the restaurants/bars next to the stadium.

Back in the mid-late aughties, I remember lauding that I could drive to Anaheim from SD with a group of friends and go to a game for less money than seeing the Padres. The ""cheap seaters"" always seemed to be louder and more invested in the game than the luxury box gaggle. Even then, caring about the game had never been the strong suit of an Orange County crowd. I can only imagine what the big A sounds like (or rather, what it doesn't sound like) now.  The front office seems to be trying real, real hard to get me to stop loving my team."

This is why tickets at Disneyland have shot up so high along with all the tickets at Angel Stadium. It's the price we pay (or don't) for a team payroll and ulterior motives of the organization. Though, it's no longer a secret. That dumb fucker should've never said that they are effectively pricing out poor people.

Since then, Anaheim has regularly taken in at least $1 million annually, peaking at $2.2 million in 2005-06.  Parking: A 25 percent cut of parking money goes to the city after the Angels reach a certain amount, based on inflation. The city has received parking funds 10 of the last 16 years, from $7,388 to $372,453 in those profit-sharing years.  Last year, parking didn't hit the needed $6 million threshold, so the city received nothing.  http://www.ocregister.com/articles/city-516321-stadium-angels.html"

angelsbaseball,38l13v,Mister_Sassafrazz,0,Fri Jun 5 15:43:35 2015 UTC,I have been meaning to go but they've been playing poorly and tickets are just too damn expensive. I usually just end up watching the game at home or a restaurant.

angelsbaseball,38l13v,Neverend3r,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:53:47 2015 UTC,I went to about 15 games last season. I've only done 2 so far this season and one of the factors is the rising price.

angelsbaseball,38l13v,IAmTheWalkingDead,2,Fri Jun 5 20:21:31 2015 UTC,That's a problem you're going to have at nearly every stadium and really every single place you're a captive audience. You bought a premium food item. Angels still have the cheapest domestic bottom shelf beer per oz out of every team.   At least with baseball at the Big A you can bring in outside food and be slightly less of a captive audience.

angelsbaseball,38ju0u,Flipper3,8,Thu Jun 4 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"You should be perfectly safe wearing your O's jersey.   We've had a number of people asking similar questions, so i'll point you to this discussion from a couple weeks ago:  http://www.reddit.com/r/angelsbaseball/comments/37deyi/ill_be_attending_my_first_angels_game_on_saturday/"
angelsbaseball,38ju0u,wiNNA_monstER,7,Thu Jun 4 19:08:17 2015 UTC,"Bring a glove, snag tickets in 420-422 section for $25~ for your best shot at foul balls, buy a beer and helmet of nachos, enjoy the game. You will not experience any hostility unless you bring it with you. Angels fans love talking, with ANYONE. We just love the game, our team, and are pretty humble. We know when our guys are hot, cold. When the opponent has our number or we're stomping on them.  If you want a shot at getting autographs from players on your team, get there when the gates open and they are doing batting practice. Bring some baseballs and a Blue Bic pen or photos and a Blue Sharpie, wear your jersey and hat with pride, and most teams will reward their fans for being loyal. You'll have to go along the railing on the third base line, and ushers will let you go behind the dugout. You don't need front row tickets to get down there."
angelsbaseball,38ju0u,soupdup,5,Thu Jun 4 20:55:52 2015 UTC,"You'll have to check ticket prices because they can vary, and it depends on what sort of vantage point you most enjoy. I personally like to sit in either right field, or along the third base line toward the foul pole. Both relatively cheap depending on the game.  Angel's stadium is a pretty relaxed crowd. Not many people outside of California know that Angels stadium is in Orange County, not LA. There are A LOT of families that go and in my 22 years of going to that park I can't recall ever seeing a fight, let alone any major hostility. So the answer is yes, you'll be completely fine. This isn't Dodger's stadium ;)  As far as food, I can't really think of anything particularly unique to the stadium that's available to all (They probably have better food in club level). If you don't mind walking I would just do a lap inside the stadium. That's a good way to see your food options and to also see the entire stadium first hand."
angelsbaseball,38ju0u,jwgrabo,2,Thu Jun 4 19:31:58 2015 UTC,When I still lived in CA (moved in '01) I remember going to a Rams v. Raiders preseason game in which I ended up watching more fights in the stands than the game itself.  Angels games are definitely more mellow.
angelsbaseball,38ju0u,mistere676,3,Fri Jun 5 02:39:45 2015 UTC,"May be a bit off topic, but if you're up for a drive head over to the Irvine Spectrum and grab a bite at TLT (The Lime Truck). I recently tried it and it's very very good. I had the pork-belly nachos my first time, and substituted fries for nachos my second time.   Back on topic, you should be fine in your jersey. Proud to say the Angels have one of the nicest fan bases in the league ;-)"

Except if you're a Yankees fan or boston fan you'll be fine. If you want to get food before the game hit me up, I'll take you to this awesome taco truck in Santa Ana 10 min away from the stadium and the best tacos you'll ever have north of the border. Nothing like tacos and seeing the Angels beat the O's. You can bring food and water into the game. If you're down, I have season tickets but I split them with the fam, I'll see if I can grab those tickets and I'll get you in. I sit in 411."

angelsbaseball,38h9rk,seeg6,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:06:59 2015 UTC,I also think that Shoemaker being a fly ball pitcher and the fact that he leads the staff in HR given up while the team is playing in Yankee Stadium may have helped the decision.

angelsbaseball,38a9t4,Mackinacsfuriousclaw,3,Tue Jun 2 22:16:26 2015 UTC,"I've played on this field, albiet some years after Albert. I really like how it's down that hill and tucked into those woods. Neat little field."
angelsbaseball,3866pe,nimperatori,23,Tue Jun 2 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"Our main rival is the A's, with the Rangers probably number two. Astros don't really feel like a rival yet. Also, the Freeway Series are games against the Dodgers, as they are a drive up the 5 away. Also, the Angels are the only team with a winning record against your former Yankees.  The stadium nickname is ""The Big A"" named after the large A-shaped structure that once was used as the stadium scoreboard now located in the parking lot. After every win, the halo at the top is lit (""Light up that halo."") Gene Autry is our former longtime owner and is known as the 26th man. #26 is retired in his honor. If we're tied or behind late in the game, the Rally Monkey makes an appearance to stir up the fans and get our team the lead. Beginning last year, the Light Wave has become popular in the stands. Fans will strobe their camera flash on their phone to create a twinkling light visual throughout the crowd. Seems like young people like it, older people don't really care. Mike Trout isn't our only fish-named player; ""King Fish"" Tim Salmon played for the team a long time and is considered by some to be our best player in franchise history. We have the cheapest beer per oz in the league."
angelsbaseball,3866pe,icanbeyourzero,8,Tue Jun 2 06:34:31 2015 UTC,"""Light up that halo.""   As a note for OP, fans will also say, ""Light that baby up."" This is what the ""LTBU"" in winning game threads means."
angelsbaseball,3866pe,PavementBlues,2,Tue Jun 2 16:03:36 2015 UTC,"I was wondering what LTBU stood for, for the past week or so. But I was to afraid to ask. Now i know :)"

angelsbaseball,3866pe,icanbeyourzero,5,Tue Jun 2 18:46:29 2015 UTC,A's fans really hate the light wave in /r/baseball. So I naturally love it.
angelsbaseball,3866pe,sweetwattah,7,Tue Jun 2 17:39:09 2015 UTC,I was going to comment but this pretty much sums it up!   GOHALOS/GODUCKS
angelsbaseball,3866pe,DwightSchrute27,3,Tue Jun 2 11:23:57 2015 UTC,lol @ old people not caring about the light wave.  I think it has more to do with the fact they are intimidated by technology and they aren't even sure if their phones can twinkle so they'd rather not try and make themselves look silly.
angelsbaseball,3866pe,SynXacK,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:03:26 2015 UTC,"You could be right, or we both could be. I personally feel its more older people tend to be more interested in the game. No real way of seeing who's right/wrong"
angelsbaseball,3866pe,icanbeyourzero,2,Tue Jun 2 18:49:42 2015 UTC,You're probably right. I do love the Lightwave though. Such an ominous silence comes with it. So intense. Like you know something magical is about to happen and everyone is collectively holding their breath.
angelsbaseball,3866pe,SynXacK,2,Tue Jun 2 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"Adding to the first point: the A's are the only other team in the division to have a World Series title, so they get some level of respect as a rival. The Mariners have never even been to the World Series, so as much as every year is ""their year"" they will be a joke come late August."
angelsbaseball,3866pe,henrycaine,2,Tue Jun 2 21:07:35 2015 UTC,What's cheapest beer option in stadium?
angelsbaseball,3866pe,Neverend3r,2,Tue Jun 2 22:30:38 2015 UTC,"I think your best bet is 2 small beers. It cost less than 1 large, per oz. This only qualifies for domestic as they only let you buy ""premium"" beers in the large souvenir cup. I think the 2 small beers option is better than the 24oz cans as well."

angelsbaseball,38011q,mpkorpiel,7,Mon Jun 1 02:58:49 2015 UTC,Because the regulars who would probably fill this thread with posts primarily use the chat room instead.

angelsbaseball,37vau2,LolaBot22,-6,Sat May 30 22:47:41 2015 UTC,Good! I'm happy for him! It is awful to root against people. I can't believe the way some of the Angel's fans along with the organization have been acting towards Hamilton.
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,SitDownRando,20,Thu May 28 21:02:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. I still want to visit Petco, I haven't seen the Padres play at home since the Qualcomm days."
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,iisdmitch,7,Thu May 28 23:07:34 2015 UTC,Petco is quite pleasant to be at.
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,fuckeverything_,5,Fri May 29 06:34:30 2015 UTC,"agreed. Petco is almost like you are watching the game in your living room, but your living room is a baseball stadium in beautiful downtown San Diego, and a bunch of friendly other people happen to be there too. its fantastic"
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,dill911,10,Fri May 29 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"Petco is a beautiful park with a great atmosphere. Location is great, the people are polite, and they do a lot for the military which is always nice. I try to visit it every time I go home."
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,Imazushi,2,Fri May 29 03:13:17 2015 UTC,Agreed! I go there to root for the Nationals when there are (almost)in town. Padres fans are always fun. Thats what baseball is suppose to be.... Fun.   Not where you have to worry about being stabbed or beaten into a coma... Don't know where that would happen though.
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,trabbledot,6,Fri May 29 16:53:30 2015 UTC,"Best park in California, in my opinion. Love it there."
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,stuckinthepow,5,Fri May 29 04:48:20 2015 UTC,I have only watched a game there from a hotel room once that over looked the park lol. I should try to make a trip down there soon.
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,iisdmitch,17,Fri May 29 04:51:20 2015 UTC,"It also helps that we love Bud Black, and find the Padres to be the least hateable of all the other California teams."
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,jtaylor9449,12,Fri May 29 01:01:17 2015 UTC,"This.... This is the reason I fell in love with Angels Baseball. My whole life I played baseball but never liked it. Growing up in a Hispanic household it was all about ""los Doyers"" . Going to Dodger stadium to catch a game was just a bad time man, all the people ready to start fights. Parking was terrible. The location is terrible. And everyone was drunk. never had a good baseball experiance there. And I stopped playing baseball and that was that. And then... and then I went to my first angels game. Everyone was having a good time, everyone was here, to watch baseball! Everyone dressed ""normally"" and casual it was great!! I can't explain you you really how it was that day but it changed me. I fell in love with the sport for the first time. It was beautiful. Everyone just having a good time.  That stadium war really nice too! I owe my love of baseball to the boys in red and this fanbase. Love you all!!!!"
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,Ferniekicksbutt,3,Fri May 29 04:44:48 2015 UTC,I agree with you on this but at Petco Park. Being at your park and interacting with your fans really cements my feelings of baseball. I am a season ticket holder and just love how everyone at both parks are friendly and can joke and poke fun at the opposing team and not crying or wanting to fight over it. We have some rotten eggs but the majority is friendly and just love the sport. Go Padres! Go Angels!
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,betonthis1,6,Fri May 29 13:53:21 2015 UTC,I made a similar post so you know us Padres fans love you guys. I'm following both teams so get em Angels!
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,betonthis1,5,Fri May 29 03:12:10 2015 UTC,Cheapest beer at any professional sports venue too if I'm not mistaken.
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,Dirtiimartini,3,Fri May 29 06:44:48 2015 UTC,I wish Angel Stadium had the craft beer selection like Petco. Only downside. I had some of the Goose IPA which was really good and affordable but a good Mission Double IPA is where its at!
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,betonthis1,2,Fri May 29 13:54:57 2015 UTC,There's a stand called the draft (I think) on the first base side of the home plate gates at ground level. That stand has about 12 taps of good beer.
angelsbaseball,37n2oj,prpldrank,1 point,Fri May 29 16:33:37 2015 UTC,The stand I was at had Goose IPA and some other IPA which was at the Diamond Club entrance where we were sitting.

Also, if you were wearing Green and Gold, it would be a much different story. We'd navigate you right out of the park. God, I hate the A's!  Alternatively, I LOVE going down to Petco. Best stadium, best beer selection (where else can you get Speedway on draft..no where), great food options (PIzza Port!!), and you can easily hit Gaslamp after the game. Nothing but win all the way around."

IE, we cut him we owe the remainder of $516K. However, if we cut after the year before next season, we owe him nothing. Also, he has no options, so he can't be sent down without clearing waivers."

angelsbaseball,37je1z,naaahhman,6,Thu May 28 01:40:53 2015 UTC,"Travs season ticket holder here.  I think Brian Hernandez is a great player and he should get a shot next spring.  Though Angels have great depth at first with Cron and Pujoius, he could be good trade bate for a team that could use a first baseman (ahem Phils...).  OF Cal Towey looks like a great outfielder too.  He made one helliva catch tonight to hold a tying run on 3rd from right field.  Nate Smith is the top pitching prospect.  Gott and Brady are solid relievers.  Travs were loaded with great relievers last year and most are in Salt Lake or Anahiem.  Gooooo Travs!"
angelsbaseball,37je1z,davesnoz,3,Thu May 28 02:41:48 2015 UTC,when I was looking through the stats of the players I noticed Hernandez is really driving some runs. Next year spring would be the time to try him out as he 26 years old currently.  35 RBI in 44 games is quite impressive.  He seems to have a decent eye also and doesnt strike out a whole lot.
angelsbaseball,37je1z,davesnoz,2,Thu May 28 02:46:31 2015 UTC,Last year I think he was second in the Texas League in RBI (1st was Alex Yarbrough who is with Salt Lake now) and I think he had one of the highest batting averages in the league too.  This year he moved to third base and really has improved as a fielder.  He is also the leader of the team.  He is a great guy and has great chemistry with his teammates.
angelsbaseball,37je1z,IAmTheWalkingDead,3,Thu May 28 03:48:55 2015 UTC,"Travs season ticket holder here.   Out of curiosity, what do AA season tickets cost you?"
angelsbaseball,37je1z,davesnoz,2,Thu May 28 03:29:27 2015 UTC,They vary from $300 for reserved or $450 for box section.  It is cheaper to go with the 3 year rate.  Other wise they increase by 50%.
angelsbaseball,37je1z,naaahhman,2,Thu May 28 03:43:32 2015 UTC,How many games?
angelsbaseball,37je1z,davesnoz,2,Thu May 28 03:45:20 2015 UTC,"About 70 games.  72, I think.  They also do bulk ticket packs where you can buy 10 or 15 tickets at a discount.  My Dad and I did that our first year to find what seats we liked the best.  We settled for section 104, between the beer garden and the first base dugout."

angelsbaseball,37hamc,ShittyDetectiving,2,Thu May 28 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"This is a great summary but I would add that there is absolutely no rational reason why Joyce needs to be in the lineup.  Efren Navarro and Grant Green have a smaller sample size but either would be an offensive upgrade. Let one of them DH. Of course, we'll have to see what other deals get made. Dipoto doesn't have a lot to work with but at some point teams will start getting desperate for some pitching and he is clever enough to turn that into a solid bat without giving up too much."
angelsbaseball,37hamc,breakfast_cats,3,Wed May 27 21:18:06 2015 UTC,"Joyce had a .349 OBP last year and  currently has a BABIP about 100 points lower than his career norms. Before this season, he's proven to be a fairly valuable player offensively, and I think that he will improve while his numbers regress to the mean and he continues to take walks and get hits like he already has started doing.  TLDR Joyce has been incredibly unlucky this season, and should improve in time with regular PAs and a larger sample size.   However, they should definitely still be looking to add a bat or 2 this season regardless."
angelsbaseball,37hamc,ShittyDetectiving,1 point,Wed May 27 21:40:08 2015 UTC,"We shall see as I imagine the Angels will continue to give him opportunities (unless we make a trade), but it's also possible he is regressing and/or last year was a bit of an aberration. His career BABIP is only .284. 2 years ago in 481 plate appearances it was a paltry .251 (for comparison sake league average hovers just below .300 every year). I don't think he is as bad as he's been playing this year, but his high end is basically an average player that should be easily replaceable."
angelsbaseball,37hamc,cshenton,1 point,Wed May 27 23:00:43 2015 UTC,He's never really hit for a high average; his value is his on-base ability. He will be a useful player come season-end. His failings right now are just more noticeable because almost the entire team is struggling.
angelsbaseball,37hamc,ShittyDetectiving,1 point,Wed May 27 23:31:54 2015 UTC,"I agree about his OBP value but I was replying to /u/breakfast_cats BABIP statistic to try and show that he hasn't necessarily been ""incredibly unlucky"" this year. This line in particlar...   and currently has a BABIP about 100 points lower than his career norms   His current BABIP is .216, career is .284. 68 points lower and only 35 points lower than what he put up 2 years ago in 140 games.  Semantics maybe, but it's just another stat in the overall argument against playing him regularly.  Also ask yourself if not LF/DH where else are we supposed to try and upgrade?"
angelsbaseball,37hamc,cshenton,2,Thu May 28 01:08:35 2015 UTC,"Point taken, I see what you're saying. You'll never hear me dismiss the value of semantics in arguments haha, don't know why that became a thing. Semantics are important.  Definitely agree that it's the obvious place to upgrade if we're going to do so. I just don't think the situation is as dire as many are making it out to be because the team as a whole has been extraordinarily unlucky so far.   We're 29th in the league in BABIP, 1 point ahead of Boston (who was like 10 points behind us before we played them this past weekend, and they got lucky against us haha). We're hitting the ball well, it's just not getting down for some reason.   We're also 26th in the league in defensive cluster luck (poor Oakland is in last, with luck three times as bad as ours defensively). The fact that we're still pitching pretty well is also extremely encouraging.  The fact that we're still around .500 is pretty great with regards to the luck we've had. I have faith it'll turn around, and when it does, we'll be a pretty good ballclub."
angelsbaseball,37hamc,Cooleybob,1 point,Thu May 28 15:26:48 2015 UTC,Has he really been unlucky though? I haven't seen him making good contact and getting robbed of a hit by a good defensive play. Everything is routine pop ups.
angelsbaseball,37hamc,gambit700,8,Thu May 28 14:33:06 2015 UTC,He had just three hits in 38 at-bats before being moved.   This is exactly what we need

angelsbaseball,37hamc,molodyets,1 point,Wed May 27 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"All we gave up was cash. Could be that a new club helps him turn things around, kinda like Grilli kicking it up last year when he got here."
angelsbaseball,37hamc,msing,2,Thu May 28 13:38:58 2015 UTC,"High contact, high strikeout, left-handed, and plays all OF positions. Feels like a move for small-market clubs."
