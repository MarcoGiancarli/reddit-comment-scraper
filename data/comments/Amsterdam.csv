Amsterdam,3e4jtf,davideo71,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:38:58 2015 UTC,"over-priced rooms   The only thing worse than over-priced rooms is the people who rent them. It's at the point that almost non of my creative friends who do interesting things (aka, not work for the big agencies) can afford to live in town anymore. I have a lot of friends in the expat community but it's fucking starting to annoy me. The people who come here for a short while (few years) just don't seem to bring anything to the scene, they just make their money and are too focussed on work to contribute with bands, art or events (even if there were still empty venues for them which there almost aren't anymore with these rents). It's one of the things that really changed the scene over the last 20 years. Ok, end of rant."

Amsterdam,3e495v,TonyQuark,5,Tue Jul 21 21:03:07 2015 UTC,People who offer a place for rent but don't allow you to register are always doing something illegal. Don't do it.
Amsterdam,3e495v,oonniioonn,4,Wed Jul 22 01:34:18 2015 UTC,"About the first part: I doubt she's able to screw you over. Even if you don't register, you'll still have a normal contract, even though nothing is on paper. Make sure that any deposit and such is registered (i.e. write down how much you deposit for the room and sign it both). Alternatively, if the deposit is as much as the monthly rent (or less) you can just not pay the last month if you ever move. That way there's no way she can keep the deposit.  About registering on a different address: many people do it, but you need to find someone who's willing to let you register at their address. This is probably not someone in Amsterdam, but someone in another municipality. It's all illegal (officially you have to live at the address you register), but the chances of getting caught are very slim.  If you do get caught there's a fine for you and the person that lets you register on the address you don't live. It's also a criminal offense, so you'll get a criminal record."
Amsterdam,3e495v,blogem,5,Tue Jul 21 22:03:32 2015 UTC,Maybe report her at the new illigal renting number?   People like her are serious asholes. The only reasons for giving a contract are bad ones that ruin the housing market.
Amsterdam,3e495v,frankwouter,0,Tue Jul 21 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a bit of a harsh reaction. How are 'people like her' assholes based on the very limited info you have available. Ratting someone out for renting a room out is a but much imo. Renting out a room for a short time can have really big administrative impact and create a lot of hassle. From what we know, she could just be wanting to help out a student."

Amsterdam,3e495v,deNederlander,-3,Tue Jul 21 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"As it happens, I know people who can barely made ends meet with rent support that rent out a room in their apartment. They can't afford to be shorted on their rent support and can't offer a contract as they can't get in a position where they have to offer renters rights (like after x months not being able to dissolve the agreement).  Obviously it's not a great situation, but i'd hardly call them the scum of the earth."
Amsterdam,3e495v,davideo71,3,Tue Jul 21 23:46:45 2015 UTC,"No, fuck her. It's fraud, simple as that. She's knowingly abusing the system, the rules are there for a reason."
Amsterdam,3e495v,deNederlander,3,Wed Jul 22 07:51:33 2015 UTC,Big change she won't allow registration because she is illegally sub renting her house. Or will lose her renting subsidy. There are no legal reasons to not register. And it puts the renter in a bad position.

Those are meant to compensate for the no-sex rules in strip clubs, if you are in a place where prostitution is legal a bj or sex would make more sense.  Sure, there might be girls willing to quote you a price for a lap dance, but it's bound to be pretty expensive, they likely do not have any good music equipment/music in their 'peeskamer', and chances are very good indeed they suck at lap dancing anyway, as they are not trained strippers/teasers, but specialize in sex.  Taking all that into account, the answers to your questions would be: yes, not likely, 15-20 minutes or so, fully nude should be fine, I never have, and always specify what you want with a window girl, that's part of the negotiation."

I totally get that going to a club feels awkward, so if that's not an option and you really do only want a lap dance you would need to talk to several girls and be very clear on what you want, until you find one that gives off the right vibe. But I really doubt you would have a great experience for the reasons I outlined.  If it's not morally objectionable to you i would advise just go for the bj+sex with a girl that seems attractive to you. I think the experience will be much better and satisfying."

Amsterdam,3e1yro,got_scammed_,10,Tue Jul 21 09:43:05 2015 UTC,"If the landlord is a private person rather than a commercial company I don't see why they would need a KvK registration.  As for the money, I can see three options:   It is a scam and the guy wasn't going to rent out anything. This is ""key money"", which is illegal. This is a deposit, which should be refunded after the lease terminates except for costs incurred by damages you did.   In the first two cases you could sue him in small claims court (""kantongerecht""), which may or may not be worth your time/fees. In the first case specifically you should also file a police report and the police may or may not go after them.  In the third case the situation is less clear. If you already had a lease you would have to pay rent. You can't just unilaterally break the lease. Since you didn't pay the rent, they can take it from your deposit. The landlord might sue you for the remainder of the rent due if you hadn't cancelled the contract."
Amsterdam,3e1yro,visvis,7,Tue Jul 21 09:56:38 2015 UTC,"I've done some searching, and as far as I can figure out, a landlord does not need a KVK registration. Unless you were dealing with a rental agency rather than a private landlord, a lack of KVK is no evidence of a scam.  I've also rented a lot of rooms/apartments in my days, and I've never bothered with ever asking anyone for a KVK, and I don't see the purpose of it."
Amsterdam,3e1yro,Schaafwond,7,Tue Jul 21 11:03:09 2015 UTC,"You may have fucked up, €150 is a great deal for anything housing related (be it deposit or key money), especially if you liked the place. KvK # is (to my knowledge) not needed in this instance (where did you get this pearl of wisdom anyway?)    Also, you didn't get scammed but decided to back out of an agreement for fictitious reasons."
Amsterdam,3e1yro,davideo71,0,Tue Jul 21 10:43:02 2015 UTC,"If it's a legitimate business it would be registered with the Kvk. Some rental scams present themselves as legitimate rental agencies, but then if they don't have a Kvk number they're obviously bullshit."

Amsterdam,3e1yro,blogem,3,Tue Jul 21 10:58:19 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, I think you screwed up here. I would have kissed my landlord on the face if he only asked for 150 when I moved."
Amsterdam,3e1yro,TheGroovyCamel,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have to pay for a 'reservation'. This is nonsense and a dirty way of the landlord to make money. If you didn't sign anything for this, your money is gone. It's basically a donation now. You don't need a KvK number to rent out an apartment if it's a privately owned property. You do if you're an agency. Use common sense and don't just transfer money without signing anything."
Amsterdam,3e1yro,sscalable,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:34 2015 UTC,I am a law student and I can tell you that any private person renting out part of their own (possibly rented) property does not need a KVK number or anything like that.

For all it is significantly easier to find housing and the commute (by train) is no problem."
Amsterdam,3e1ghr,visvis,2,Tue Jul 21 06:13:31 2015 UTC,"You could also look into Amstelveen, Diemen or Duivendrecht. They are close to Amsterdam. Amstelveen is right below VU (a quick Metro to school). The chances of finding something there are better as the prices are lower.  Otherwise you could look into finding some roomates.  And finally, a commute to Utrecht is not bad. From Utrecht centraal to Amstel Station is around 20min and then take a metro to VU.

Intercity trains run every 30 minutes to Amsterdam and it took about 20 minutes-ish to get there.   If you are international student and you need to go back and forth every day, maybe it's worth looking into Traject Vrij tickets, because it cost like 5 euro per  trip without 40% discount. These are available on monthly or yearly subscription, or you could just apply for the normal 40% discount tickets (this is like 50 euros per year I guess?)  Bear in mind that Hilversum is, well.. quiet (and small), especially if you compare it to Amsterdam or Utrecht. Rent here is reasonably cheaper compared to Amsterdam (think about 400 euro-ish for a room).   In my opinion, I think Haarlem would be better suited for student life."

Amsterdam,3dtp20,jakobjames,4,Sun Jul 19 10:37:04 2015 UTC,are you on Wifi or do you use an cat5 cable? Bad Wifi speeds in built up areas can have many causes look here: http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-howto/31190-when-wireless-lans-collide-how-to-beat-the-wireless-crowd
Amsterdam,3dtp20,ronaldvr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:32:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll check that out. It is quite a built up area, and loads of other networks appear in the list when I check, so it could possibly be related to that.  I'm using WiFi. I don't have a cable."
Amsterdam,3dtp20,blogem,5,Sun Jul 19 11:45:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so get a cable first and hook up directly to the modem. 90% chance that it's a crappy wifi connection.  Best way to solve it is to use devices that support 5GHz, although these days more people are using that, so sometimes that won't solve it either."
Amsterdam,3dtp20,blogem,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:04:13 2015 UTC,"I've switched over to the 5GHz channel and that seems to be hitting 120MB via the WiFi (at least sat next to the box)  The box seems to randomly switch itself off though, still. So I'll call support about that."
Amsterdam,3dtp20,frankwouter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:29:22 2015 UTC,"That's odd, yes. Good luck!"
Amsterdam,3dtp20,frankwouter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:32:09 2015 UTC,Probably a broken box.
Amsterdam,3dtp20,frankwouter,2,Sun Jul 19 15:51:53 2015 UTC,Try calling their service line and report internet issues. Your internet should not be unstable.   Are you using a cable or wifi? You can get interference issues if you live close to a lot of neighbors and your router is very weak/on the  busy channel. I had that issue (never buy a 40 euro router) and bought something better (5 GHz is a less used frequency) and that fixed the issue.
Amsterdam,3dtp20,twentyfumble,2,Sun Jul 19 11:33:53 2015 UTC,"I'm using WiFi.. and just using the default box they gave me. It's supposed to do TV/WiFi all in one.   My TV is still in England so I can't set that part up yet, so I did wonder if it would be related to that (i.e. if there was some kind of installation process to follow on the screen)  I will try giving their service line a call though, as the shop was shut today when I just visited."
Amsterdam,3dtp20,crackanape,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:45:19 2015 UTC,"The TV shouldn't matter. It is just an internet tv decoder and the internet shouldn't be affected by it. Those boxes do have a pretty poor router and they are also locked up well, so you can't change the settings yourself.   Call them and be persistent, because Dutch internet should be 100% and pretty fast."
Amsterdam,3dtp20,bbbBennie,2,Sun Jul 19 11:58:45 2015 UTC,Probably interferences on your wifi channel. Connect with a cable first to check if the connection is stable. If the connection is ok on cable then connect to the administration panel of your router and change the wifi channel/frequence.

I'd consider going to Hema (cheaper) or V&D (probably more choice). Both should sell them well under € 100 (example). Bever should offer some good bags as well, but will most likely be rather expensive."

I do recall that it wasnt in perfect condition by the time we got it home (Australia) but everything inside was fine and we didnt need another suitcase so we got rid of it.

The most important roads are also shown on Google maps.  One walking route is the NS walking route.

Amsterdam,3dtldw,blogem,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:04:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you! And great link! 15km seems a bit much for today, but I'll just follow the route till the dunes and then go directly Castricum aan Zee instead of heading to Egmond."

Amsterdam,3dqwfm,visvis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:34:31 2015 UTC,Sorry! I have a space in a garage which is designated to me.
Amsterdam,3dqwfm,visvis,7,Sat Jul 18 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"In that case you should have a contract with the owner of the garage which specifies whether that is allowed. Regardless, your neighbor s may not like you for allowing strangers to enter the garage though."
Amsterdam,3dqwfm,frankwouter,5,Sat Jul 18 17:51:05 2015 UTC,His neighbours might be interested in a second parking space though.
Amsterdam,3dqwfm,runawaylemon,4,Sat Jul 18 21:41:39 2015 UTC,This makes the most sense. Likely one of your neighbours will have more than one car.   Also make sure if you can't just exclude the parking space from your contract! It might be cheaper.
Amsterdam,3dqwfm,LaoBa,3,Sat Jul 18 22:00:48 2015 UTC,"And more importantly, will 17 policemen drag me into a van kicking and screaming in front of my neighbors?   Someone renting out their parking space is exactly the kind of emergency our overworked police will assign 17 policemen for."

Streets with lots of gay bars will be crowded, but that is just 2 or 3 streets. The parade is a little crazy, but not as weird as a couple of years ago.  Most of all, it is a lot of fun."
Amsterdam,3dkfge,comicsnerd,9,Fri Jul 17 05:59:07 2015 UTC,You'll be fine. During the Canal Parade the crowds are very concentrated along the route. You can join and watch and if you feel too crowded just move to another spot. I do recommend to at least give it a try. The atmosphere is very friendly and fun. Not rowdy at all.
Amsterdam,3dkfge,Yellow_guy,4,Fri Jul 17 08:15:22 2015 UTC,"You'll definitely be alright. I always enjoy seeing the parade as the crowds never get uncomfortable. Just find yourself a nice spot well in advance for a good view of it. If it does become too crowded for your tastes you can simply walk away from the canal to return to the relatively calm city. Street parties are concentrated around Westermarkt, Rembrandtplein, Zeedijk and a few other spots, but they are easily avoided if you prefer. Please don't get intimidated as it's a super fun event, even for the introverts among us. Consider coming to the Drag Queen Olympics the night before the parade for a laid back camp event."

But. there's no escaping the tens of thousands of people in costumes, drinking and smoking and looking for a good time.  Some places are ""worse"" than others (from your perspective), for example, Rembrandtplein is a hotspot.   I think you'll find being here on parade day extremely uncomfortable, and would recommend you go elsewhere. The festival lasts a week, and on the other days it's busier than normal summer days, but pretty typical Amsterdam."

Amsterdam,3dhh9w,Andromeda321,14,Thu Jul 16 10:53:20 2015 UTC,"Noise of rolling suitcases in a residential neighborhood in early morning, people shouting in the middle of the night, people ringing the wrong doorbell because they forgot their address/key to open the front door downstairs/key to the bicycle shed, etc.  My next door neighbor is using Airbnb and that last thing happens a lot, almost every month (she rents out her apartment basically every weekend). I've told her a few times to instruct her guests better, but it hasn't really helped yet.  I'm used to noise (hotel across the street) and I don't really care about that. It's just that inside the building it's normally quiet (and should be, especially at night), but with those Airbnb guests it turns in a right mess. You can imagine that someone trying to open your door or stumbling through the hallway while shouting is a bit much."

As far as finding something similar to Zatte: Belgian-style tripels are hardly rare in the U.S. There are quite a few good American tripels as well as lots of Belgian imports.

I recently went for a tour with these guys; http://www.thosedamboatguys.com/  A small company that hires electric boats with a maximum capacity for 10 passengers at a time with a total tour duration is 90 minutes.  Super friendly tour guide and a very comfortable atmosphere, rather than it just being a memorised script the tour is quite interactive as they welcome questions or input.   The single part of the tour I did not like was an 'introduction' we had to give at the start, where we all went around saying our names, where we are from and what we have liked about Amsterdam so far. I was alone and I can be quite shy, so this was a little uncomfortable but it was super short and it was a nice way to get to know the other passengers.  In terms of the tour itself, the 90 minutes flew by extremely quickly, which was a surprise as I thought it may drag on. It was both informative and fun, quirky humour from our guide and just a very pleasant atmosphere. If/when I come back to Amsterdam with friends, I would not hesitate to book another trip with them. If I recall correctly it was 21euros per person (1 euro booking fee)."

Amsterdam,3dcc55,PQ_,2,Wed Jul 15 06:36:15 2015 UTC,"Get windproof jacket(s). It's more important than water resistant clothing because the rain is rarely very heavy. As long as you don't stay outside in the rain more than 30 mins or so, you'll generally be dry enough that it's not a bother.  However if you live in a warm US climate, you may be better off shopping here because you'll have a better selection. Umbrellas are cheap, so I'd just buy one here as well. They're only useful about half of the time because of the wind.  If you have any electronics from the US that you want to use over here, verify they work on 220V or buy a step up converter.  Lastly, if you can bring an unlocked mobile phone, you can just pop in a prepaid sim card sold at any grocery store, HEMA (like Target), airport or phone shop and immediately be able to make calls/use data. Always nice."
Amsterdam,3dcc55,bill_cooks,2,Wed Jul 15 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"Hiya!  Fellow American here. One thing I can recommend is clothing. By and large clothing here is much more expensive than in the states.  Also only small electronics need power voltage converters. Your cell phone and laptop just need plug converters. Check the power supply to be sure. If they say 110-220v, then you don't need a voltage converter. IMO if you're gonna be here long enough, don't bother with the converter and just get what you need here (l.e. hairdryer etc.)  Good luck."

It's also pretty far from the city center, but it's close to the metro, which is a must when you're a VU student as the VU university is pretty far away itself.   Main question you'd have to ask yourself: can you get anything better? Going here without a room would be very stupid, MANY people are looking for affordable and good rooms. And most of the available rooms are not furnished.   You should totally check out the rent benefits you could get. It's called huurtoeslag in Dutch, they'll probably give you 100-200 euros a month for this apartment.

They do indeed charge a fee for this.  You can also do it yourself at the municipality. If this is at Waterlooplein (town hall) or one of the smaller offices depends on where you're living in the city. This will also determine if you can freely walk in or have to make an appointment (I prefer an appointment, otherwise it can take forever). Not sure if you need to bring a birth certificate, this might be a requirement for non-Dutch citizens. You do indeed need a copy of the rental agreement/permission of your landlord (if you're renting a room), although they don't always ask for it when registering (probably only if the address is flagged or has other people registered on it already).  After registering you'll also get your BSN. Then you're all set to live and work here.  If you want to do it yourself, but you're not entirely sure about everything you need, then you can call the city at 14 020 and ask them."

You can cycle between major cities with no big deal. 5 or 6 hours cycling might sound crazy to some but you truly get to see the landscape change and the hidden gems that aren't talked about.  Go to the small villages and talk to people, it's wonderful how life is so different there. Explore the countryside, you can't regret dealing which such peace and honesty overall.  As in Amsterdam, there are many places of true beauty. There's a bench somewhere near a canal a bit off the center, there's a small little park that looks private but it's perfect for a picnic. There are places where you can swim in clear blue water, not so far from the pontje.  You can visit a buurderij too, talk to people on volunteering, help your neighbors. There are a lot of networks of kind and honest help in the city, that are quite satisfying to be part of.  And of course, you can also go crazy and visit the Rijks on LSD, if you know how to handle it. But my main point is, as long as you are able to really look at things and be willing to experience them, there's nothing really stopping you from making a conversation in the bus stop and learning something new, therefore creating an adventure.  I hope this doesn't sound too poetic, Amsterdam can't have a list of do's and don'ts. It really just comes to the way you want to experience it."

I'm moving to Amsterdam in a month or so and i can't live without supporting a local football team (Zenit's the one in my heart though).  Could someone please give a quick rundown on Amsterdam football clubs? To be completely honest i only know Ajax and was thinking of sticking with it seeing how all the stars that played there are some of my favorite players of all times (Edgar Davids).
Amsterdam,3d41kn,NewAccountPlsRespond,2,Mon Jul 13 11:52:39 2015 UTC,"In the netherlands there arent that many good teams that are from the same city. In Russia you have a ton of  clubs from moscow but in amsterdam the only club on a professional level is Ajax. So if you wish to support a team from amsterdam, ajax is kind of your only choice. Of course i love the club so you can only get positive opinions out of me.   I suggest you go to a game someday. oh, and take hulk with you!"
Amsterdam,3d41kn,NewAccountPlsRespond,2,Mon Jul 13 12:03:15 2015 UTC,"Haha, sure will!  That sounds just like Saint Petersburg, we only have Zenit there.  Mind if i message you some time in August-September? I'd really love to go to an Ajax game some time. I've been to football in the NL before only once - this year, when Zenit played PSV in Eindhoven."
Amsterdam,3d41kn,NewAccountPlsRespond,2,Mon Jul 13 12:07:41 2015 UTC,That game ended in a 0-1 win for you guys right? Last-minute goal if i remember correctly.   Yea of course! I'm not a season ticket holder but i go to games quite often. Already bought tickets for the two CL/EL qualifier-rounds in early and late august.
Amsterdam,3d41kn,NewAccountPlsRespond,2,Mon Jul 13 12:17:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. Loved the stadium, the fans and the city.  Nice! Is it easy to get tickets for top games, like AZ, PSV and such? How much are they usually?"
Amsterdam,3d41kn,NewAccountPlsRespond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:22:56 2015 UTC,"Well, my experience with top games is that you'll need atleast a regular clubcard to buy tickets. Those games get sold out pretty fast. Most times the sale gets open for everyone when there's like 2 days left untill the game starts. There are some little exciting games you can attend though without a clubcard. (Clubcard can be obtained for free btw, ir a small fee, not sure).   About the prices: Cup games are cheap, as is Europa league. But at every match the side alongside the field is more expensive. And the sections behind the goals are cheaper but get sold out way quicker. I bought my ticket second ring alongside field(lange zijde) for CL Ajax-Apoel for like 52 euros. But behind goal 2nd ring Ajax-Dnipro for 25 euros if i remember correctly."

Amsterdam,3d43la,blogem,2,Mon Jul 13 20:00:04 2015 UTC,"Yes to all. Keep in mind that 3G is not LTE (that's 4G).  Robin Mobile is legit. They use the KPN network, which is the best in the Netherlands (the other two are Vodafone and T-Mobile). Do check their website though, because they have different speeds for their subscriptions (their €19.95 subscription is only a very slow 64Kbps).  If you want a good deal, then don't focus on unlimited data. Instead, get an idea of how much you use and remember that there's wifi basically anywhere. If you want unlimited data with high speeds, you're gonna pay a lot for it in this country."
Amsterdam,3d43la,Jan_van_Bergen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:04:04 2015 UTC,"You should get a pre-paid sim, for which you don't need a bank account. There are lots of companies, just choose one that works with your phone. I, personally, use T-mobile. 10 Euros gets you 1gb LTE, 50 minutes and 100 text messages for 30 days - it's a pretty good deal. There are other rates if you need more data or minutes or whatever.   Your host family will likely have good internet, but it's not guaranteed. People on this sub tend to take the attitude that everything in Amsterdam is first class, and I'm sure you can get first class internet. But your host family might not want to pay for that (like my landlord doesn't) and so they might use a crappier internet connection - they do exist here too. Either way, the LTE mobile data works fine, so you should be covered either way.   Finally, there is always the library if worse comes to worst. Good luck!"
Amsterdam,3d43la,erikkll,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:08:19 2015 UTC,"Well, to be honest: even the cheapest DSL connections here are a lot better than those in other countries.

Amsterdam,3d43la,Jan_van_Bergen,2,Mon Jul 13 17:58:42 2015 UTC,Speed does nothing if the connection is not constant. I'm in a building where the connection is not constant.   But you only serve to make my point. Amsterdam is the best place in the world! Cheer! Cheer! Downvotes to all who suggest otherwise! Cheer! Cheer!
Amsterdam,3d43la,blogem,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"Nobody is cheering that Amsterdam is the best place in the world. Internet in the Netherlands (and Amsterdam) is among the best, though.  If your connection is not constant, check your own devices first (does it happen too when directly hooked up to the modem with a cable?). If that's the case, then contact your ISP. They will likely swap your modem first. If that doesn't solve it, they will check if the connection is good and then fix that."
Amsterdam,3d43la,runawaylemon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"If you want a contract you need a Dutch bank account and a European passport. If you don't have a European passport you need documentation to prove you have permission to live in the Netherlands that is valid for at least one year from the date of requesting the contract. If you don't have a Dutch ID you also need a monthly statement from your bank no older than two months addressed to you at the address you live on.   All in all, it's probably easier to get a prepaid sim card. You can get these for as little as €0,01 for the card, plus whatever credit you put on them.   Source: I sell phone contracts."

It was our first time to the Netherlands (but hopefully not our last!)   To answer your questions: - We enjoyed shopping in Amsterdam and focused our attention on cheese, chocolate, art, and other goods that we cannot get from home (Canada)   Biggest problem was inflated prices, which is also what prevented us from purchasing goods. This is not unique to A'dam of course and my strategy is to choose what I want as souvenirs while browsing in-store then order items online (I would order from Dutch websites if at all possible). This way I can pay less and not have to lug stuff around while travelling.  Hope that helps!"

There seem to be lots of international students and also a good community, they even have a homepage: http://derxl.nl/news/  As the others said, at the end of the road, there are two big supermarkets, a good chinese restaurant, a good kebap house and sometimes huge markets.  The train station is also not too far away and it should take about 13min to get to the central station. More information at www.9292.nl.  I'm also trying to get a room there at the moment, but it will probably take some month till I'm sucessfull. :-)"

Just for all the people which will see this thread later via Google: Rode Kruislaan is one of the very rare student housing where you can park your car for free (at least at the moment, if I understand it correcly, Diemen is permanently enlarging the zone where you have to get a permit)."

Amsterdam,3crwh2,Houwert,3,Fri Jul 10 15:57:52 2015 UTC,"Lived there for almost two years. It's okay. Kitchen can be a bit dirty but if you invest in socializing with the other tenants it could be a nice place for the semester.  And the end of the street is a sort of shopping mall with an Albert Heijn XL and Deen supermarket. And some clothes.  It's 20 minutes by bicycle to the center of Amsterdam and 5-10 minutes to the Amsterdam Science Park.  Public transport can be a bit annoying, is slow as fuck and limited options.  If you have any specific questions you can always ask me."
Amsterdam,3crwh2,jhskdfvcnwisu,3,Fri Jul 10 10:42:35 2015 UTC,Did you also see the appartments with non-shared kitchen and toilet there? How are they? At studentenwoningweb.nl there are even appartments with >60m² which seems a bit large for student housing: https://www.studentenwoningweb.nl/en/Eenheiddetails/300026754/1
Amsterdam,3crwh2,Houwert,2,Fri Jul 10 15:30:25 2015 UTC,No I never did. There's only 2 of those rooms per floor. So 1 per hallway. And since they have their own kitchen the other tenants barely socialize with them since they never see them.
Amsterdam,3crwh2,huffy83,2,Fri Jul 10 15:40:29 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that's good to know, thank you! I thought it would be about 50%/50%, but if I'm the only one in the whole hallway I will reconsider applying for one of those."
Amsterdam,3crwh2,Ursikka,2,Fri Jul 10 15:42:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah a hallway contains 5 ""normal"" rooms, who share 1 kitchen. And 1 larger room with its own kitchen.  The shared kitchen is usually the place where the tenants socialize. You eat together, just hang out etc. It's your living room. But the larger rooms have their own kitchen so they never see other tenants when they go in to the kitchen."

The A room is on the corner and has another window. The C and D rooms don't have a balcony, but a bit more space.  The rooms are a bit bigger then 12m2/14m2 actually. Every room has a small hall and its own bathroom, which adds about 3m2 to the total space.   The purple flat is rumored for having the most problems. Might be a good idea to avoid moving into that one. (13xx, I think)"

Amsterdam,3cqhdq,MurkTwain,3,Thu Jul 9 23:25:27 2015 UTC,"Check out this thread about the Eerste Ringdijkstraat, Pierre Lallementstraat and Caroline Macgillavrylaan (ignore the bit about the Student Hotel, which is non-DUWO).  I'm not too familiar with the other locations, but I know where they are.   Daalwijk: it's in Zuid-Oost. Far away from all the fun and really only interesting is you're doing medicine @ AMC (and even then I'd opt for housing closer to the city and commute to AMC). Krelis Louwenstraat: not too bad. Still inside the A10 highway ring, not too far to the city center. Voorburgstraat: a bit further away, but still not too bad.   Personally I'd go for Eerste Ringdijkstraat or Pierre Lallementstraat (same neighborhood), with a slight preference for Pierre Lallementstraat because the building is newer and the supermarket is literally next door instead of a 4~5 minute walk.  I've lived at Eerste Ringdijkstraat myself and it was totally fine: short cycle to Science Park (where I studied), short cycle to the center (10~15 minutes to Leidseplein or Rembrandtplein). The neighborhood is a bit boring (former industrial/business area), but it's improved quite a bit. Recently a restaurant+bar opened in the area (De Vergulden Eenhoorn) and there are two supermarkets now. There's a nice park at about 5 minutes cycling (Frankendael). Public transport to the city and the rest of the country is awesome, with Amstel station within walking distance (less than 10 minutes)."
Amsterdam,3cqhdq,blogem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your answer, great insight.  Would you recommend Pierre Lallemstraat/Eerste Ringdijkstraat over independently looking for housing closer to the city centre?  Also, how is the community at these locations?"
Amsterdam,3cqhdq,blogem,6,Thu Jul 9 23:54:58 2015 UTC,"Looking independently is a pain in the ass. Don't do that unless you have some serious leads. ""Closer to the city centre"" isn't all that meaningful when you're talking about cycling 5 minutes instead of 10 minutes... sure the buildings are more beautiful/Amsterdam-ish, but you'll be paying a hefty premium and in the end it doesn't matter to anyone (whether you cycle 5 or 20 minutes, you all end up in the same bars and have a great time).  About the buildings: I lived in the ""Dutch"" part of the Eerste Ringdijkstraat-building (first two floors), so it was kinda different to the rest of the people living there. From what I noticed, there isn't really much of a community. There is a Facebook group for the Eerste Ringdijk building, but there's hardly any activity (other than ""I'm selling this crap"" and ""I need a bike for a few days""). However, I think it's fairly easy to make friends with other international students, since y'all are only only here for a year or two (the Dutch already have their friends and stick around a bit longer)."
Amsterdam,3cqhdq,jhskdfvcnwisu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice.  I really appreciate it, you have some great points.  I chose Pierre Lallementstraat."

I'm looking at the moment for a place (after living for one year at Carolina MacGillavrylaan) and it's really a pain in the ass (at least if you want to have no shared living; shared living is a bit easier to find), so I would take Pierre Lallemstraat/Eerste Ringdijkstraat any time over looking on my own.  I would say it that way: It's definitely possible that you will find a better place to stay, but it will be annoying and you will need a bit of luck. Depends on the risk you want to take. If you are studying at Science Park, I would take Carolina MacGillavrylaan, as there are many students also studying at Science Park and you can cycle to the center fast enough.  If you have a two year master and only get housing for one year, better register sooner than later at www.studentenwoningweb.nl, then you will have a much easier time next year to get a room!"

Amsterdam,3cqhdq,visvis,2,Fri Jul 10 00:19:17 2015 UTC,"As mentioned in my other comment, I've lived in the Eerste Ringijkstraat building. I've been inside the Pierre Lallementstraat building once. They're both pretty much the same. They're also both in exactly the same neighborhood. If your options are those two, just pick the one that's objectively better and don't worry about it... neither of the buildings has any real advantages over the over. Only difference is that Pierre Lallementstraat is slightly newer (2007 vs 2014), so if everything is the same, go for the newest building."

Daalwijk: Amsterdam Zuid-Oost, which is very remote and very boring. It also has a reputation for being unsafe, although IMO that isn't justified anymore.  Eerste Ringdijkstraat and Pierre Lallementstraat: this is a fine location, not even that far from the city center. Also close enough to most UvA locations.  Krelis Louwenstraat: convenient for having many shops nearby, but far away from the more eastern UvA buildings, especially Science Park  Voorburgstraat: a nice place and not as far from the city center as it seems because you can go through the Vondelpark. Rather far from most UvA buildings though.  If I were to make the choice, it would most likley be Eerste Ringdijkstraat or Pierre Lallementstraat."

Amsterdam,3cnjh3,blogem,2,Thu Jul 9 09:46:25 2015 UTC,"Polaris expedition:       The Polaris expedition (1871) was led by the American Charles Francis Hall, who intended it to be the first expedition to reach the North Pole. Sponsored by the United States government, it was one of the first serious attempts at the Pole, after that of British naval officer William Edward Parry, who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. The expedition failed at its main objective, having been troubled throughout by insubordination, incompetence, and poor leadership.  Under Hall's command, the Polaris departed from New York City in June 1871. By October, the men were wintering on the shore of northern Greenland, making preparations for the trip to the Pole. Hall returned to the ship from an exploratory sledging journey, and promptly fell ill. Before he died, he accused members of the crew of poisoning him. An exhumation of his body in 1968 revealed that he had ingested a large quantity of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life.  The expedition's notable achievement was reaching 82°29'N latitude by ship, a record at the time. On the way southward, nineteen members of the expedition became separated from the ship and drifted on an ice floe for six months and 1,800 miles (2,900 km) before being rescued. The damaged Polaris was run aground and wrecked near Etah, Greenland, in October 1872. The remaining men were able to survive the winter, and were rescued the following summer. A naval board of inquiry investigated Hall's death, but no charges were ever laid.    Image i     Relevant: Tookoolito | Charles Francis Hall | George M.

When the euro was introduced we got back those 1 and 2 cent coins, but soon we were fed up with them again. So many shops started rounding again and refusing the 1 and 2 cent coins. There are a few shops that will still accept them (and return them as change), but most don't.  The rounding is very fair. 1, 2, 6 and 7 get rounded down, while 3, 4, 8 and 9 get rounded up. So in the end it evens out. You could even run a small profit by always buying three .99 products, so to the total becomes .97, which is then rounded down (2 cent discount!).  If you really hate this, then pay with plastic. Those transactions aren't rounded."
Amsterdam,3co0a5,blogem,9,Thu Jul 9 12:05:40 2015 UTC,"This system is not unique to the Netherlands. Canada does the same thing. If you assume perfectly random prices, the net effect should be €0. Even if you assume everything is priced €x.99, unless you're always purchasing one product at a time, the final digit should also be random. Some research from economists suggests that the net effect is a fraction of a cent to the benefit of the consumer.    But the real benefit is that the Netherlands does not have to spend money minting the coins, stores do not have to carry the coins, and you do not have to carry the coins.    Even if you could ask for your €.01 back, why would you? Do you really want to have a clump of those in your pocket all day?"

They still count as legal tender, meaning the shops SHOULD  take em although they mostly don't. The price rounding is common practice (and law) for cash payments, you only pay the exact price when you pay with card.  Coming from a country were this isn't the case it's confusing at the beginning, but not having to carry around pretty much useles and worthles copper is really nice"

It just happens that almost all shops in the Netherlands decided that they won't accept 1 and 2 cent coins and that their totals get rounded to the nearest 5 cent."
Amsterdam,3co0a5,Obraka,2,Thu Jul 9 12:09:02 2015 UTC,"You're right that the rounding isn't a law, mea culpa. The statement that 1 and 2 cent count as legal money is true though.

The guy showed up at my place on time and we exchanged small talk, really nice guy made me feel comfortable straight away. I found him quite attractive but he wasn't a supermodel, but I didn't expect Channing Tatum anyway. After getting to know each other a little and sharing a laugh he asked me where I wanted to be massaged and if I wanted him to be clothed or not. I said the bedroom and told him to get naked as well. He brought his own towel and oils. Not that it matters but his penis was quite average sized, I'm not a huge fan of monster dicks anyway. The massage was great he gave me a full-body massage and gave orgasms using his hands, i came twice in total and he let me play with his cock a few times, i even put it in my mouth. Sorry that this got a little explicit, just had to share.  Overall a pretty great experience, lasted about an hour and cost me 80 Euros. I'll probably get the same again in a month or so..."

Amsterdam,3cllze,Arrewar,6,Thu Jul 9 00:35:26 2015 UTC,"Masseurs who give happy endings without a sex work license are illegal because they won't get checked for human trafficking, underage girls, etc.  If the masseur states up front it's erotic and has a license it's 100% legal."

With all the Argentinian restaurants here in A'dam you would almost think there was some kind of a special connection (e.g. former colonization) between Amsterdam and Argentina, although I'm pretty sure that is not the case...  I found this page about the same topic on trip advisor and the most plausible explanation IMO is what commenter no. 7 says, and I quote:  ""There are many Argentinian ""restaurants"" in Amsterdam quite simply because the steak & chips formula works the best in the big touristic centre Amsterdam is and gets most revenue. If you want to make a money with a small restaurant in Amsterdam without wanting to invest 100 000's of €, you cover your place in goat skin and put a big sign above the door ""Argentinian Restaurant.""  In short, the Argentinian restaurants seem to be a way to earn some easy money from naive tourists."

A bit like Chinese food later on and Thai restaurants now. That is true because Amsterdam isn't the only town with a series of Argentinian restaurants.   They used to be owned by Israelis, who then sold them to Egyptians later on. So it's more of a left over of an old fad, which is mostly popular with tourists because cheap meat and chips make a tasty meal when pissed drunk or stoned."

Amsterdam,3cm4et,CloggedBathtub,7,Wed Jul 8 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"Just to get this out of the way: in the title you mention GVB, which is the public transport company that operates in Amsterdam and nowhere else. This means you can't use a GVB ticket to get from Amsterdam to Hilversum.  Anyway, if you have a regular OV chipkaart, then you can use it for your journey to Hilversum. Make sure to activate it for use on NS trains, which you can do at one of the yellow ticket machines at any train station. Traveling by train also requires that you have at least €20 credit on the card at check in, instead of €4 for local public transport (bus/tram/metro).  If you're traveling to Centraal with a bus, tram or metro, you first check in at the start of your journey and check out at Centraal. Then you check in again at Centraal for the trains. After arriving at Hilversum train station you check out again, and, if necessary, check in again in a bus.  If you don't have a OV chipkaart you can buy separate tickets. These are more expensive than using the OV chipkaart, but since the OV chipkaart costs at least €7.50 + the hassle of having enough credit on it, it's sometimes worth it. You buy a ticket for the bus or tram at the driver and for the metro at one of the machines in the metro station. For the train you buy a ticket from one of the yellow ticket machines at the train station.  The Amsterdam - Hilversum commute is totally fine. Unless you have other reasons to stay in Hilversum (you like quiet, hate commuting, or whatever), I would stay in Amsterdam."
Amsterdam,3cm4et,blogem,3,Thu Jul 9 00:08:37 2015 UTC,"Definnitely get the OV Chipkaart.   Also, just as a practical note, try and take the Intercity to Hilversum and not the Sprinter.  Ironically, the sprinter is slower, and stops at every small little station on the way."
Amsterdam,3cm4et,untoastablebread,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:11:02 2015 UTC,"Side note on this. Say you have 16 euro on your OV Chipkaart and you want to travel from Ams Centraal to Schiphol, which costs 6 euro. Can you use that 16 at a kiosk to purchase the 6 euro ticket, leaving you with 10 euro on the card, but keeping you from traveling on credit?   I know you can preload specific tickets on your OV Chipkaart, but I've never tried to do it at a kiosk that way.   This would be especially useful info for folks who are here for a limited time. I remember last summer having 18 euro on my OV Chipkaart, having to load another 10 because that was the minimum (as I recall) and then only needing like 5 euro to get to Schipohl from Lellylaan. It was really, really annoying. But I held on to the card, so I got to use it again this year."
Amsterdam,3cm4et,Jan_van_Bergen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that's possible, although I've never tried.  You can however load up to an amount these days. So if you're doing a single train trip, you can load up to 20 euros (even if you already have 19 on it; in that case you'd pay 1 euro) and then at least be left with as little credit as possible on the card.  I agree that the card kinda sucks for people who are here a limited time. Especially since you can't get the credit back from the card, unless you have a Dutch bankaccount. It would be a lot better if you could just go to a counter and get the money back in cash. They are however looking into special tourist cards, but these will probably focus on getting you to and from a tourist destination, not really on making the OV Chipkaart system move convenient."

The city has a number of alcohol-free zones where alcoholic beverages may not be consumed in the public space. These are mostly areas with a lot of tourists and where such behaviour has caused nuisances in the past.  For the most part, the main canals are ok (excluding the area around the westerkerk)."

To be clear, I'm a totally heterosexual guy, but with a open-minded spirit like most people in Amsterdam. I totally enjoyed the festival as it's not too large, location is in the city centre (so no travelling for me), and the crowd is always up for a good party. Of course there are a lot of gay people, but everybody is welcome and feels welcome, absolutly no problem at all."
Amsterdam,3cj8fi,egokiller71,2,Wed Jul 8 18:21:33 2015 UTC,"My wife and I will be in Amsterdam this weekend, wondering if it's worth going? Sounds like it might be an interesting thing to do!"

Amsterdam,3cj8fi,levenburger,3,Wed Jul 8 12:46:53 2015 UTC,"Too add to what was said above, westerpark is a cool location for a festival. Usually will be set up with stages in the grassy areas of the park with a boom boom techno room inside the gashouder (gas storage silo). It's close to centraal and easy to get to.  Other options for this weekend:  Georgie's wundergarten - sold out ATM but tickets are popping up on ticketswap.nl. A little bit further out but will be a great intimate festival with a big variance of music.  Somewhere Else - not a festival but a party at ot301. Very Amsterdam venue and music.  10YEARS80 at studio 80 (Friday night)  Konijen van Catan - free festival on sat and Sunday somewhere in Noord. Music, workshops, food, drinks all sorts of stuff. You register for the free guest list via the Facebook page and donate something when you arrive. They are doing a big shared dinner on Saturday and a breakfast/brunch on Sunday. Massive variance of music from dancey stuff on sat night to indie rock and folk during the day on both days.  Edit: I forgot about a day in the park at Amsterdam bos. Will also be a fun festival a little bit south of Amsterdam"
Amsterdam,3cj8fi,levenburger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:25:11 2015 UTC,Thanks. Geogie's looked awesome and thought that we would rather go to that... but that is this weekend and we aren't there until then next weekend.

Amsterdam,3cizis,Waterpolopower,3,Wed Jul 8 09:16:15 2015 UTC,It's been a while since I had my photo taken at one of their shops (for my passport) and I believe it was something like €10 for a bunch (so you can use them in the future too).
Amsterdam,3cizis,zeegroen,3,Wed Jul 8 09:30:26 2015 UTC,"I had to pay around €10,- for 4' x 4' pictures. Got 4 of them. Not cheap but pretty well made and with the correct rules and regulations."

Amsterdam,3cizis,crackanape,3,Wed Jul 8 08:24:33 2015 UTC,Chances are photos from a booth will be rejected for passports.  They have a lot of rules for photos on official IDs.
Amsterdam,3cizis,proxwell,3,Wed Jul 8 08:58:31 2015 UTC,"They're usually at train stations, or maybe they were... I don't really pay attention to them.  Btw, photos for official documents need to follow very strict rules. it's better to go to a professional photographer. Not only do they exactly know the rules, they also almost always give you a guarantee that the photos will be accepted (or you get new photos/money back)."
Amsterdam,3cgw9n,sarsykins,6,Tue Jul 7 20:35:20 2015 UTC,Amsterdamse bos is pretty big. The festival is all the way on the south side apparently. And festivals in the Amsterdamse bos never block any of the other facilities. You should be good.
Amsterdam,3cgw9n,Androide456,4,Tue Jul 7 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"Amsterdamse Bos is 3x NYC Central Park. So yeah, there will definitely be space left for you.

If not, then I am not 100% sure if I would recommend Amsterdam. The housing situation is catastrophic; for the money I pay here for a one room appartment at the city boundary, I would get a 100m² flat in the best location back home.  But yeah, Amsterdam is beatiful and unique, of course! But it is also always extremely full of people and food is expensive. Only you know if it's worth for you to ""be in Amsterdam"" or if you go for another city where you get much much more for your money and visit Amsterdam for a vacation sometime else...  Your question about the opinion on the school is much to vague if you do not tell us where and what you will study here. And even then, the rankings you find on Google are probable more reliable than some single opinions here."
Amsterdam,3chuxy,jhskdfvcnwisu,2,Wed Jul 8 01:57:58 2015 UTC,Great thank you. Are groceries expensive? I guess what I meant is how is the atmosphere at the school? Is it very chill? Does it have lots of parties? Are the people friendly? This isn't the first thing I'm looking for in the school obviously but it's something I can't really tell by going on the website.
Amsterdam,3chuxy,jhskdfvcnwisu,4,Wed Jul 8 02:18:36 2015 UTC,"You can check the groceries prices here: http://www.ah.nl/producten. There are cheaper options, but it should give you a feeling and Albert Heijn is omnipresent in Amsterdam.  As for the questions about the school, I cannot answer as I am studying at the UvA. But of course here are parties and the people are friendly (everybody speaks English) and there is a big international community. But I think that is true for every city with an university. For me, it is not really ""chill"", the courses are definitely demanding, but that differs probably massively depending on the courses you take.  (P.S.: I am not the one who immediately downvotes you. :O :D)"

Amsterdam,3chuxy,tradingten,6,Wed Jul 8 02:38:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure why.   As far as I understood, this subreddit was generally flooded (before ""my time"", I'm here only for some months) with lots of low effort posts of people demanding to give them visiting plans or even tours through the city. These kind of posts seemed to be very annoying, as they were repetitive; also, there is a great wiki in this sub which most of the low effort poster seldom checked before.  I think that's why the downvotes here are coming extremely quick as soon as a post seems touristy or ""low efforty"". This goes so far, that even some of the posts linked in the wiki have negative votes, although providing good information."
Amsterdam,3chuxy,jhskdfvcnwisu,0,Wed Jul 8 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"""There are cheaper options"" honestly dear what terrible advice. Only a handfull of places are more expensive than the appie and if your grocery budget is of concern there are a million way cheaper options. Having said that, groceries are the least of your concern, Amsterdam really is a quite expensive place to live."
Amsterdam,3chuxy,Jan_van_Bergen,3,Wed Jul 8 09:40:11 2015 UTC,"Could you name some of the ""million way cheaper options""? I would be really interested; until now I only found Lidl (which has a much reduced choice), food markets (which are not held everyday and are not really that much cheaper) and Turkish supermarkets (which have a nice choice of fruits, but missing some of my day to day food). Deen and Jumbo are nowhere near my place, so no idea about them."
Amsterdam,3chuxy,tradingten,3,Wed Jul 8 14:51:05 2015 UTC,I've found Dirk van den Broek is almost always cheaper than Albert Heijn. Havn't compared to Lidl.
Amsterdam,3chuxy,Chamarazan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"Well if you really care about cutting down on your grocery spending I suggest going with what's available cheaply, in stead of saying I need this daily. Besides that here's some tips; coupons can drastically reduce price http://www.voordeelmuis.nl/ for easy browsing. Dumpsupermarket like Gekke Gerrit have great value, think packaging with a dent. Food markets absolutely are held daily all throughout the city except for sunday, go late in the day for last hour extra reductions. For good value Dappermarkt and Ten Katemarkt. Toko's can offer great deals, like 20kg bags of rice for under 30 euro's and giant bags of tauge for 50c."
Amsterdam,3chuxy,NewAccountPlsRespond,3,Thu Jul 9 10:58:19 2015 UTC,The people at VU are very friendly and used to international students. Some programs have more international students than others. If you're looking for parties and recreation you should join student clubs. You can join multiple clubs which should keep you in the loop about what's going on at campus. There's is also a club for international students which hangs out regularly.

See, for instance, the Paris-Plages along the Seine.  Blijburg is one of Amsterdam's most popular beaches, but due to nearby construction work this year the water is not on the national list of officially-approved swimming holes.

Especially for that last category, there is no infrastructure to charge them and creating that infrastructure will take a lot of time. Outboards can be removed and charged elsewhere but that is not an option for boats with inboard engines.

Amsterdam,3c9pvk,comicsnerd,9,Wed Jul 8 20:35:46 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not, Amsterdam is very safe. In the years I've lived here (in one of the poorer neighborhoods) I've never seen any crime nor know anyone who was a victim. I know there are indeed some pickpockets targeting tourists, but you have them in any large city and there is no risk if you take normal precautions. Also, if you want to buy drugs, only do so through official outlets (coffeeshops), not on the street."
Amsterdam,3c9pvk,visvis,7,Mon Jul 6 05:13:52 2015 UTC,One of the safest cities in Western Europe. Don't worry.
Amsterdam,3c9pvk,gentleroar,3,Mon Jul 6 06:19:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, pickpockets are an issue. Especially distracted or inebriated tourists are their favourite target. This is an issue in all major European cities and you should act accordingly. Read up a bit on how to protect yourself from them.  Other crime is very low. If you ever find yourself in a neighborhood you feel isn't safe, just act like you know where you're going and that makes you a way less attractive target. I doubt you'll need this advice in Amsterdam, because pretty much all places tourists go feel safe (and are all objectively very safe too), but it might help you if you ever end up in a place that's less friendly."
Amsterdam,3c9pvk,blogem,2,Mon Jul 6 09:19:57 2015 UTC,It's very safe. Of course there is the occasional pickpocket. Those are in every city in every country but not something you should worry about more than anywhere else.

If you are going to live in Amsterdam why not live where you can enjoy the city at any moment. Of course everything is reachable but when it's raining and you have to cycle 20 minutes to get to the city, leaving the house becomes less appealing. That's just my experience."
Amsterdam,3c6x7g,2nd_law,3,Sun Jul 5 16:16:29 2015 UTC,"Osdorp is a fine place to live, but rather boring and a bit remote (depending on where you want to go). I would say it's not too far away if you go to the VU or the parts of the UvA in the city center but for Science Park I would say it is so far as to be inconvenient.  Although it is safe everywhere in Osdorp, the quality differs from neighborhood to neighborhood. As an example, I would say the neighborhoods  around the Pieter Calandlaan/ De Alpen are generally speaking clearly better than those around Osdorper Ban and Dijkgraafplein.  Personally I would probably pick Osdorp in your situation, unless you will be going to the Science Park (too far away) or you love to party (in that case the city center would be more attractive even if shared). That said, I'm not very familiar with Diemen."

I'm okay with doing my own thing most of the time, but it would be nice to have some friends to go out and do stuff with other than with just my girlfriend."
Amsterdam,3bvsty,amsterdamintrovert,5,Thu Jul 2 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"I moved to another city in my country a year back. I was in the same boat - quite literally (apart from part, ""I'm in a relationship"")  I'm an introvert. Social interactions come at a cost. I want to meet people, but parties, groups, pubs are very daunting for me. We are really just trying to put a mask for others. Someday, I'll just realise I don't like pubs, and will completely stop visiting them, instead of giving them 'another shot' every once in a while.  I arrived in Amsterdam 2 days back. I've spent my time cycling around, buying salads, and eating them at parks, or by canals. I visit the Vondelpark at night, and just stare at the water. I love doing this. It's not my idea of a perfect day, but I'd rather do this than awkwardly try to show myself out in a crowded pub.  Coming back to your post. Sadly, I could never truly get over the issue of having no friends in the city where I moved to. Last month, I decided to travel, and it has taken my mind off the issue. I plan to travel a lot more in the future. You might want to try this.  In these turbulent seas, your better half should be your anchor. You could try looking for other introverts online, who prefer 1-to-1 meets. That has worked out for me (on just one occasion, though)  The most common advice you will get (and I got) is to go for meet-ups, talk to relatives, join hobby-groups. Bull sh**. None of this worked for me, and I realised it the hard way.  The only thing that worked for me was having spent time with someone - talking about silly things, sharing insecurities, tearing down the walls around you that you've spent your whole life building, taking off the mask and laughing so hard that feel you might just fall in love and then you're screwed.  Transient, though it was, but heaven even so."

I guess I'm what I always said I would never be when I was 19....a grown up.   And you're right about the most common advice I'll get. I don't really pay much attention to that anymore. I know meetups don't work for me, and I don't want to rely on drinking anymore to make me more comfortable in these situations.   Hopefully, I'll meet someone with this thread.

I started to attended meetups, joined hobby groups and partied with people I didn't even know only to find that I am an introvert. I don't feel entertained in large groups, I'd rather be sitting with a small group of people or by myself in a park.  Worst part, you make friends with someone and then they move somewhere else.  After 2 years of struggle, I now have a bunch of friends (from work, gym). What I do now is hangout with my friends to see movies, go to restaurants, and on weekends do sports like running and biking.  If you like movies, you're welcome to hangout with us (two guys, 1 girl), we have Pathe Unlimited card. I also do cycling on weekends to explore new places close to Amsterdam."

Went looking for some social gatherings like sports clubs and decided most of them aren't for me. Yeah I'm tall, don't play basketball. Then I came across a topic about sport shooting on a forum.  OK, why not, let's give it a try. Got an introductory lesson and was hooked ever since. Not just for the shooting part - yeah it's fun, but I would have called it quits a long time ago if it wasn't for the fellow members. Amazing group of people, and a few of them are now my closest friends.   So pick a sport/activity that is compatible with an introvert personality and make sure it has a social gathering afterwords, that way you can leave any time and stay if you're comfortable enough."

Amsterdam,3bvhdk,gl4ssheart29,5,Thu Jul 2 14:11:11 2015 UTC,"There isn't much of a community vibe in the DUWO housing. At least not from what I can see (but I live in the part without international students, so I maybe they have something going on which I'm not aware of). Unless you have shared facilities, people are using their own little studio and don't really interact a lot with the neighbours.  The Student Hotel on the Wibautstraat is currently still under construction (it's in the building of the former famous nightclub Trouw), so I can't really comment on what that's like.  Locationwise the Student Hotel, Eerste Ringdijkstraat and Pierre Lallementstraat are all pretty much the same. The Carolina MacGillavrylaan housing is a bit further away and I wouldn't want to live there (it's located on Science Park, which is nice if you have classes there, but the other locations are also sufficiently close).   Right next to the Pierre Lallementstraat are two supermarkets (also within walking distance of Eerste Ringdijkstraat), which is really nice. The Student Hotel has one supermarkt across the street. For other stuff (bars and such) you'll almost always venture a bit further, which again makes that all of those three locations are equally fine."

The Eerste Ringdijkstraat and Pierre Lallementstraat are 700 meters from the Student hotel, so that's not much of a difference. The Carolina Macgillavrylaan is further away, but close to the UvA Science park.   And about the 2 extra months of rent, the UvA housing is probably less expensive than the Student Hotel right?"

I went to the Action on my way home, and in several Blokker stores, and nothing - either they didn't carry them in the store of they were sold out.    I did find a couple of other stores that sold them, but randomly as I was looking around. A kitchen goods store had a couple of smaller models that were clearly ""designer"" if you will, and they were selling for more than 50 euro a piece - too rich for something I'm going to throw away donate in a year. The second one I found was at a bicycle parts store that I passed, which had apparently thought it might be a good idea to stock some cheap table fans to make a profit during the summer. They were selling little 10 inch fans for 25 euro. And then the Bruco, which /u/not-a-witty-username/ was so kind to point out. They had several models. The one I got was 16 inches for 35 euro.   Considering that it looks basically identical to this one Amazon sells back home (I'm American too) - and both are probably made in the same factory in China, I think it was a relatively decent buy. As an aside, Bruco was selling the 12 inch version too, for 29 euro.   EDIT: I did also go into a HEMA, which is the closest thing to a general department store that I've seen, although it's not really a department store at all, just has a lot of department store type stuff."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,NoobyTraveler,8,Thu Jul 2 05:03:33 2015 UTC,There are train ticket machines placed in the luggage reclaim area. Just before going through customs. Those generally have no queues.
Amsterdam,3bu98d,Hakunapunani,3,Thu Jul 2 08:16:22 2015 UTC,"Be extra certain to change the ticket from 1st Class to 2nd Class.  These machines, in particular, are set to 1st Class by default and visitors often don't know that 2nd class is fine."

Amsterdam,3bu98d,geert_e,3,Thu Jul 2 08:57:10 2015 UTC,"also schiphol is a very organised airport, you wont have any trouble finding the trainstation underneath the main hall (this hall is full of ticket machines as well) should be straight forward, all machines can be set to english and theres plenty of people to help you out if needed."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,Mulax,3,Thu Jul 2 07:24:50 2015 UTC,You dont buy tickets for a specific time so no stress with missing your train etc. Also I think it might be a lot busier this weekend because of the tour de france
Amsterdam,3bu98d,Lomedae,2,Sat Jul 4 00:29:33 2015 UTC,"Depending on the time it would be crowded to very crowded this time of year.  Ticket machines take credit and debit, with a few machines taking coins. Expect lines of several people for those. There are also ticket counters where you can pay with bills, they could be very busy indeed.  If you have an easy way to get tickets beforehand I would, saves a lot of hassle."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,serioussham,5,Thu Jul 2 05:34:49 2015 UTC,"That said, I've never seen the machines at Schiphol having more than 4 people, and there's like 10 or 20 or them."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,TheGroovyCamel,5,Thu Jul 2 06:22:17 2015 UTC,I have to agree with you. Even during peak time in the middle of tourist season I've never waited more than 5 minutes while an English tourist stabs at the machine with confusion.
Amsterdam,3bu98d,Jan_van_Bergen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:15:14 2015 UTC,"How easy it will be depends on where you are from. If you're from Europe and have a Chip and Pin card, you're all set, just get a ticket from the kiosk in the baggage area while you wait for your bags like /u/hakunapunani/ says, no need to plan ahead and you can just take the first train that departs after you arrive.   If you're from North America, you probably don't have a Chip and Pin card. Only very recently have chip and signature cards started to roll out, and they won't work in the kiosks either. It has to be Chip and Pin only. In that case, your fastest route is going to be either to buy before hand if that's an option or to get cash at an ATM and then stand in line at the counter. Don't listen to the locals who are telling you that the kiosks will accept North American cards - they simply don't know any better.   FYI, you should be able to simply purchase a ticket that is not time constrained. Where are you going? If it's Amsterdam, I don't think the tickets you buy online have a specific time they have to be used. It costs 4.10 euro and you can take whichever train is convenient."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,Jan_van_Bergen,3,Thu Jul 2 14:34:38 2015 UTC,I have an American Chip/Sig card that the bank also assigned a PIN.  I have used it successfully at both NS and GVB machines where it used the PIN.  When I use it at a manned POS it works with a signature.
Amsterdam,3bu98d,tmiw,2,Thu Jul 2 17:25:08 2015 UTC,"Which card(s)?   Like I said, my Arrival+ did not work, and it's supposed to. Last summer, USAA chip and pin worked, Citibank Hilton Visa (chip and signature, with pin secondary) did not work, Capital One Cash Rewards (no chip) did not work."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,Jan_van_Bergen,2,Thu Jul 2 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"Andrews FCU.    I also have a Chip/Sig from US Bank and BofA, but I haven't used them at a kiosk.  I do use them without issue as a Chip/Sig card where credit cards are accepted."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,tmiw,2,Thu Jul 2 17:40:36 2015 UTC,"Only very recently have chip and signature cards started to roll out   Eh, that's only a potential problem if OP's American. It's also possible to get a card with a PIN precisely for ticket machines, which is a good workaround if he has time to apply for (another) card.  BTW, the ticket machines ARE supposed to accept American cards thanks to a recent rule change by Visa. Page 129 of this document from them (PDF) indicates that unattended cardholder activated terminals (UCAT) have to support something called ""no CVM"" by July 1st. All chip enabled cards issued today support this, it's just that it's not normally used for European cards since PIN is ranked above it."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,tmiw,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:41:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he's not going to get one of those cards in the next few days. Besides, all of those cards are either unavailable or require you to be a member of some organization like the military or the UN.   And I'm pretty sure that it would be a problem for a Canadian as well, not just an American, but I pointed that out in the post.   Regardless of what Visa says and what has been agreed, I can tell you the cards won't work. I just came in through Schiphol. I have American cards - they do not work, even if you get a pin number from the issuing bank for use in a kiosk. You'll note, in the reddit link you provided, it specifically says that Chip and Pins are necessary for ""places that are known to have problems with signature (e.g. the Netherlands or self-checkouts/merchants known to void signature transactions)?""  EDIT: My bet is that the standard the VISA document discusses will be for new kiosks. So as they get replaced or upgrades, the no CVM requirement will start to spread. When it comes down to it, OP will have time in baggage to try every card in his/her wallet. IF they won't work, they'll have to stand in line if they don't pick up a ticket before hand."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,Jan_van_Bergen,2,Thu Jul 2 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"Canadian cards are chip and PIN, so it likely won't be a problem for them. Hence why I was saying it's a mainly American problem.   Also, those cards that you refer to are the ""true"" chip and PIN cards like what Canadians and Europeans have. There are other cards that are still chip and signature but have a PIN for ticket machines (e.g. the Arrival+ from Barclaycard or something else from this list). Depending on what cards OP already has it might just be a matter of requesting a replacement card. He could likely have the card expedited as well if he needs to apply for a new one but I didn't see anything in the OP or comments indicating that he only has a couple of days until he leaves.  Re: chip and signature having problems in the Netherlands--I think I put that in because of anecdotes of smaller businesses refusing chip and signature cards entirely, not necessarily because of the ticket machine thing. Any insight here would be appreciated.  BTW the July 1st requirement is for existing machines as well as new ones. Newly installed ones have had to support it for a while now. It might be worthwhile to report them to Visa/MC if they're still having issues with those cards."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,tmiw,3,Thu Jul 2 15:25:32 2015 UTC,I've never once had trouble using any of the three Chip/Sig cards I have in The Netherlands.
Amsterdam,3bu98d,Jan_van_Bergen,2,Thu Jul 2 17:30:46 2015 UTC,Good to know. Did you try using ticket machines at all?
Amsterdam,3bu98d,tmiw,3,Thu Jul 2 17:52:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have used my Andrews FCU card at both NS and GVB machines successfully.  I regularly use the GVB machines to top up my OV Chipkaart.  I use them, on average,  twice (two OV Chipkaarts) per week, for three months at a time when I'm in town."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,Jan_van_Bergen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"Canadian cards are chip and PIN, so it likely won't be a problem for them. Hence why I was saying it's a mainly American problem.   I was unaware of that. My Canadian colleagues have often complained about similar problems and asked for similar solutions.   The Arrival+ card is the exact card I tried to use. I ended up getting it to work with a PFCU Visa Gold, which is true chip and pin. This was June 3. And it's not ""smaller businesses"" either. Albert Heijn won't take the Arrival+ - I've tried, It gets rejected. Same with Dirk van den Broek. On the other hand, HEMA did accept the Arrival+ when I went there. (All three will accept my PCFU chip and pin card - which is also a credit card, despite what the folks at Albert Heijn saying they won't take credit cards).  But this is the point that I'm getting at. I've read over and over and over that these are supposed to work, yet I have such cards, and they don't actually work. Perhaps it is only a problem for Americans, but it is an actual problem and lots of Americans come to the Netherlands.    I'm going to visit friends in right over the border in Germany tomorrow, and will have to load up the ole OV-Chipkaart to have enough credit to make the return journey from Nijmegen. I will attempt to load the card at a kiosk using a regular American debit card (no chip), the arrival+, and then my PFCU chip and pin card and will report back here on what works. Who knows, the July 1 thing might actually be a real life saver for Americans in OP's position."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,tmiw,2,Thu Jul 2 15:40:11 2015 UTC,Re: PFCU -- is that PenFed's card or some other CU's? I want to go look for more info on that because if it's PenFed I thought it was still chip and signature with a PIN backup.
Amsterdam,3bu98d,brenman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:44:44 2015 UTC,"PenFed Visa Gold and Promise are both chip and pin only. That's what they default to. They have others, but I didn't inquire about them. They are both 0% ftf as well.   The only other card I'm aware of that is both chip and pin default and 0% ftf - which is just as important in my book - is the Andrews FCU Platinum Rewards Visa, but I had a bad experience trying to sign up with them last summer, so I switched to PFCU - that was relatively painless, just had to join some weird organization.   EDIT - my account is several months old, so they might have just recently changed the types of cards they issue, but I doubt it. The card I have in my wallet is definitely chip and pin."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,rusemean,2,Thu Jul 2 15:50:54 2015 UTC,"I actually have that Andrews card. It's not ""true"" chip and PIN in that it requires signature the majority of the time (like the Arrival+ and other similar cards). Not sure about PenFed but the cards that are listed here seem to be set up the same way. That said, the card does seem to work better so it's likely a good option for the ticket machines at least."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,kingvolcano,2,Thu Jul 2 17:24:18 2015 UTC,Not sure. My card is not on your list. All I know is that it works everywhere I've tried to use it and I cannot say the same about multiple other cards I have.
Amsterdam,3bu98d,PQ_,2,Thu Jul 2 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"From what I've observed, all card products from a bank are typically set up the same (with the exception of corporate charge/credit cards, if a bank offers them). For instance, my Aviator card from Barclaycard is set up the same as the Arrival+. It's likely that your particular PenFed card is set up the same as the others as well.  BTW credit goes to /u/hawaiian717 for the list I linked to."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,crackanape,2,Thu Jul 2 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"Australian here, I had issues with my cards both MasterCard and VISA, all with CHIP and PIN. Had to buy cash tickets from the attended service desks."
Amsterdam,3bu98d,PQ_,-2,Sun Jul 5 15:31:44 2015 UTC,"Cash is probably best. Few machines take credit card, though if you have a chip and pin maestro card, you should be able to use pretty much all ticket machines. There can be busy times at the machines, but rarely more than a couple minutes' wait."

If I understand this correctly, it indicates that certain areas are basically taken over by Airbnb guests. This is really worrying. Between the increase in Airbnb addresses and hotels, it's displacing a lot of local residents. Soon the city center will just be tourists (even more than it already is)."

Airbnb just gets a lot of attention at the moment and I'm not sure why here especially, as it seems to be rather fine in other big cities.  Tourists would come anyway, whether they stay in hotels or people's apartments. Not to mention people have friends over all the time.

Previously it was much more work to find guests. Airbnb gets a lot of attention in different places, there was lots of discussions in NYC.  There are 3 types of hosts on airbnb: regular people who want to occasionally earn some extra cash off their place for example when they are away, or they have extra room. Semiprofessional landlords who have 1-2 extra places to rent them out all the time. Illegal hotels basically people who operate hotel chain under disguise. I personally see no problem with first. The other two create three problems: 1) tourists where you don't want them, in residential buildings 2) disneyisation of city, increase of % of properties that are for tourists and not for residents 3) driving real estate prices up. I strongly believe that this will cause more troubles in a long run for the city then the benefits of increasing tourist flow. Not to mention shady tax schemes.  And statistics across different cities clearly demonstrate that private owners who share their place are in minority and majority are clearly commercial enterprises of different sorts.  Regarding data - they don't pinpoint exact locations of apartments, this is all public data scraped from airbnb website."

This seems to me the most important objection to Airbnb. Amsterdam will be full of tourists anyway, and the Netherlands as a whole should profit from that (by means of increased tax-income)."

Amsterdam,3br7zd,Jan_van_Bergen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:50:20 2015 UTC,"As an AirBnB user, renting an apartment right now in Amsterdam, I can confirm that AirBnB charges the city hotel tax for reservations.   Not sure if this is the tax you're speaking of (perhaps the hosts should also be paying tax on the income?), but AirBnB definitely charges taxes, above and beyond their fees."
Amsterdam,3br7zd,FarkCookies,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:32:13 2015 UTC,"I think Amsterdam authorities forced Airbnb to pay city hotel tax, this is good start. I (and probably ventus0012) meant income tax and whatever tax you must pay as a landlord."
Amsterdam,3br7zd,Jan_van_Bergen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:00:14 2015 UTC,"So honest question here:   Back home (USA), this sort of income would be what we would called ""self-declared income"". Meaning, there is not immediate reporting requirement by AirBnB to the tax authorities like there would be if, say, AirBnB were your employer. So although the host would still owe tax on the income, the tax office wouldn't know unless the host self-reported the income on their tax return.   The reward of not self-reporting the income is obvious - you pay less in taxes. But the risk is that, if you get audited, the tax office will find out, you will be charged with a crime (so jail time, a monetary penalty or both if convicted), and you will be forced to pay the back taxes with interest (even if not convicted of a crime). This means that although some people will invariably try to scam the system, most will not, recognizing that the benefits are significantly outweighed by the risks - especially for someone who is making only a modest sum from such enterprises in the first place. Granted there are probably some large operators out there who are really scamming the tax office, but I'd bet, like /u/VinceNL/ mentioned, those types of folks will be doing this anyway, regardless of how the city and AirBnB get along.   Is the basic system not similar here- at least for the ""regular folks"" who are only doing this for side income?"

Amsterdam,3br7zd,FarkCookies,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:59:00 2015 UTC,"Sure, I  even highlighted it. I mean that the problem is not with airbnb but with people reporting or not their income properly. Lots of people take cash for various things, how do you know if they report it."

We have the low speed version so we can easily drive it in narrow uphill streets in a medieval town with mostly cobblestones.. Starts easily on 3rd gear in the worst hills! It is so fun drive! Has so much torque it could probably pull ten of itself with parking brakes on!  Just contact anyone in your country who imports vespas and they can get you one from the factory. Probably used too!

Coffeeshops will lose their license when they get involved with other drugs.  In the Netherlands research chemicals are pretty much all qualified as either illegal (e.g. methylone) or as a drug that requires a medical license to sell them. I know that some smartshops sell liquids and capsules with research chemicals. However, they rarely specify which RC and it's all under the counter.  If you want any RCs, I recommend just ordering them online."

If someone is good enough he/she can work remotely for a big studio.  The access to talent pool is much easier than in the Netherlands. Here are just not enough skilled programmers.  1st of all, Poland has 2.3 bigger population. 2nd, historically, Poland has very strong technical schools, see for instance the results of this years international collegiate programming contest. All 3 big polish Universities are in the top 15 (Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw). There's also a bunch of other Universities that are not that good, but you don't need best algorithmists to write node.js. Young people know that IT right now is the easiest way to get a well paid job, so they run for it. Here, in the Netherlands, the economy is more diverse, you have great architects, city planners, water engineers... In Poland, not so much, in the 70s coal was the big shit, but now it's not.

Its mostly cruising around Amsterdam, getting to know the city a little, meeting other people, couple of lectures about the structure and organization of the UVA.  They don't really give you essential information, but I would highly highly recommend going for the social aspect. There are lots of times through the tours and such to grab beers or go to a party, and the students that didn't end up going really missed out. This is especially true of meeting people who are in your same faculty but not the same programme."
Amsterdam,3bmk20,mongoosefist,5,Tue Jun 30 17:20:00 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I've been at the intreeweek and to my understanding, it indeed is aimed at starting bachelor students. You are put in a group with other students (from the same bachelor) and you do all types of activities. I thought it was great fun though. So you'll probably have a lot of fun, but you'll also probably be (one of the) oldest of your group, and be in a group with people who are studying something else than you.  Maybe there is a group specifically for new international master students of which I am not aware, in that case you can disregard what I said. I found this emailadres (intree@uva.nl), maybe you could ask there."

Amsterdam,3bmk20,AmDamfin,3,Tue Jun 30 18:50:17 2015 UTC,Ill also add that its nice to get to know the dutch students as well but realistically your social network will mostly be the international students and the dutch intro will have a lot of younger dutch students who are more comfortable speaking dutch together and most likely will be speaking dutch as a group. at least in my experience dutch students stick together a little bit more and you will most likely be living around the international students at student housing. if you attend the international events you'll be more likely to meet the people you will be living with and not the bachelors students from the dutch intro week. also since you will be starting a masters you will probably be 2-4 years older than the other students in the intreeweek.

It uses nice cars with drivers that have all the necessary papers. Usually they're slightly cheaper than normal taxis, but not by much.  There's also Uber Lux. I believe that's a slightly fancier version of Uber Black, with matching price. Never used it myself.  Finally there's UberPOP, which is 100% illegal in Amsterdam. It uses regular cars with drivers that are just regular people without the required papers. However, as a customer you can't get into trouble for using them. There might be insurance issues in case of an accident, but I believe Uber managed to cover this with additional insurance.  A few months ago regular taxi drivers were messing with a few UberPOP drivers, but afaik the taxi drivers ordered the UberPOP themselves, so as a normal customer you shouldn't end up in that.

Amsterdam,3bllyp,hieronymus_boss,2,Tue Jun 30 06:02:31 2015 UTC,"First things first, you need the proper set and setting:    Set is your mindset. How are you feeling? It's ok to be nervous, but generally you need to be in a good mood and ready for some mental adventure. Be calm, happy and curious. Setting is the time and place for your trip. Bad: busy places with lots of people you don't know. Good: a quiet, private space where you can chill and not be disturbed for a few hours. Don't go into the city center. Just don't. Parks are ok, but still pretty busy this time of year. The Amsterdam forest (Amsterdamse Bos) is supposedly pretty nice for tripping. My favorite place to trip is the dunes, but that is like an hour away by public transport.   I always recommend having a ""sitter"": someone that stays (relatively) sober and can help guide the person/people tripping. While tripping you may start to doubt everything and you could need someone that you know is still firmly rooted in reality. Someone who's decisions you can trust when you don't trust yourself. It's calming to know you have someone like that with you and helps you focus on your trip.  Bring plenty to eat and drink. Fruit is amazing while tripping. Candy usually isn't.   Good luck. Be safe."

The earlier mentioned Erowid is a good start, but even Reddit has its own subreddits that should have loads of information already. Start at /r/shrooms and also check out /r/drugs.

It takes you through a large chunk of Amsterdam Zuid (south) which is a very interesting place. Designed by Berlage, it has beautiful large buildings which follow strict patterns and geometric forms to be visually pleasing. Turning the landscape into a painting.   Coupled with purposefulr green spaces and emphasis on egalitarian communal spaces, was meant to ensure people would try to become better because their environment would enspire them to be better.  A wildy idealistic thought for city planning and architecture, one which was shattered by the second world War. But managed to be copied by the Soviets. You will see buildings with Soviet Realism style sculptures in the corners, but without the mantra of state dominance. Or the Russian bleakness.   BTW you also pass the Hinton Hotel, so if your a Beatles fan, Yoko and John Lennon had their famous bed in there.  You pretty much finish by the financial district, so you will see the modern side of Amsterdam, with tall, sleek glass buildings then its worth seeing.

If you like cycling, the area around Broek in Waterland (NE of Amsterdam) is quintesentially Dutch. I used to do that one for fun: Broek in Waterland, then head due west to Den Ilp, cross into Twiske recreational area, have a swim, and return to Amsterdam through Oostzaan.  The area just west of Haarlem is a national park in the dunes. You might have to pay admission for the latter, though, but it certainly is worth the few €, it's gorgeous.  You would be in for a 50km trip minimum on that one, though, so make sure you get a decent bike. You could also take the train to Haarlem and cycle from there, or go to Santpoort Noord and do the walkie thing. You can take bikes on the train outside of the rush hours (which are 6:30-9:00 and 16:00-18:30) for a €6 fee. i don't know if that would be a two-way fare, though.  Enjoy yourself!"

That is, it's home to part of it, because it's so huge that it's actually in three different municipalities."

Amsterdam,3bey8h,DarkwaterV2,2,Sun Jun 28 23:34:03 2015 UTC,"You don't even have to go as far as Amsterdamse Bos. Even the VondelPark is quite lovely. Really big, and even if it's a warm day and it's crowded, you can find a little quiet area and take a nap or smoke a joint, if that's your thing. And Westerpark is very cool, but like a sort of more modern park. If you like the building style in Amsterdam, then the Westergasfabriek, a part of Westerpark is a group of quite cool buildings that used to be a gas plant (I think) and is now like a little cool cultural area, with restaurants, bars, companies and studios and stuff.  If you do decide to go to Amsterdamse Bos (The Amsterdam forest), and you feel like treating yourself, you could stop into Spa Zuiver. It's an amazing spa with tons of saunas, steam rooms, a pool that goes from the inside to the outside (you swim through a little porthole). It's not too expensive if you don't get a massage or anything, but you could easily spend 4 or 5 hours just wandering through the different tubs and rooms and such. Although I guess it depends on how much of an introvert you are, because it's a co-ed nude spa. But, hell, you're in another country, you'll never see these people again, and everybody looks kinda weird when they're nude. Anyway, I really like it there, and it'd be something unusual to do. Spa entrance starts at around 23€ for the whole day. Spa Zuiver  Another couple of cool things to do: Go see the flower auctions at Flora Holland. It's a bit of an adventure, you have to take the bus out there pretty early in the morning, but it's really interesting and cool. If you like shows like How It's Made, then you'd probably dig it. Flower Auction  If you want to do a day trip, one kind of unusual little town not too far away is called Giethoorn (Goat horn). There aren't any roads there so it's all just canals and walking paths. Super charming and peaceful. Giethoorn Images  Oh also you can check out Roest. It's a bar/restaurant/urban beach place, right on the water. It's in a really cool industrial area. There's always art shows or music shows going on either there or in the nearby warehouses. Really cool, laid back vibe. If it's nice weather, go by and have a couple of drinks. It can get pretty crowded on the weekends, but during the week it should be a bit more mellow. Roest  Oh, also De Hallen is really nice. It's pretty new (just in the last year or so). It's a group of buildings where they used to build and maintain the tram cars, so again, very industrial. They've turned them into these big halls with different things going on. The food hallen is the main one, where a bunch of local restaurants and caterers have set up little booths selling food. So, it's a nice place to go and look around for something tasty to eat. Then there's movie theaters and lots of cool shops and artists galleries. De Hallen   Anyway, that's about all I got for now. Enjoy the city. And like everyone else said, just hang out, go to little sidewalk cafes and watch people go by. It's a great city for that."

Amsterdam,3bey8h,nish1500,2,Tue Jun 30 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"If you want to go explore other towns as well and don't mind a longer ride, you could cycle to Utrecht via the Vecht river (via the villages of Abcoude, Loenersloot, Loenen aan de Vecht, Breukelen, Maarssen, and entering Utrecht via the Amsterdamsestraatweg). It's about 2,5 hours and you could opt to take the train back from Utrecht to Amsterdam. Should be ±15 euro including the fare to bring your bike with you; however on weekdays they won't allow you to board with a bike during rush hours (4 pm to 8 pm I think)."

Amsterdam,3bc06q,Assess,8,Sat Jun 27 19:48:38 2015 UTC,Contact ING. There's a phone number on the ATM (which I would've called right that minute). You can probably find the phone number online too or just call the general ING support thing.

Amsterdam,3bc06q,oonniioonn,0,Mon Jun 29 01:56:59 2015 UTC,This happens sometimes when the ATMs are incorrectly refilled -- that is a rare occurrence but it does happen. The bank will find out about it and credit your account.   Typically you hear about these situations when it's done in the reverse: the ATM spits out more money than it's supposed to. Word about that then spreads and everyone tries to get free money which obviously never works because the bank always figures out what happened.

Amsterdam,3b7zvk,Nautster,6,Fri Jun 26 19:26:34 2015 UTC,I loved the architecture and how much fun it was to bike everywhere. Vondell park was gorgeous and we spent a very enjoyable afternoon there just relaxing after biking to Molen van Sloten. The canals were so cool and it was great to sit and watch people boat around. All of it made us fall in love with the city.

Amsterdam,3b7siz,xryhax,6,Fri Jun 26 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"The monument on Dam square is for WWII.  Het Verzetsmuseum (The Resistance museum) is all about the Dutch resistance/people in general during WWII.  The Hollandse Schouwburg is the national holocaust memorial. Jews were collected there for transport to concentration camps.  Cemetery ""De Nieuwe Ooster"" has a couple of WWII graves of soldiers from the Commonwealth. There are also a few monuments there linked to WWII."
Amsterdam,3b7siz,blogem,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"Perfect, thanks for that mate"
Amsterdam,3b7siz,Jan_van_Bergen,4,Fri Jun 26 18:53:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely check out the Hollandse Schouwburg - it's free entry, and sobering. As another poster noted, it was the main collection point for Jews before they were transported to Westerbork, and eventually, further East.   Conveniently located nearby are the:   Jewish Historical Museum - Amsterdam had, at one time, a relatively thriving Jewish community, one of the largest outside of Eastern Europe.   The Verzetsmuseum costs €10 pp. Never been, but I'd imagine that it would be interesting.  The Portuguese Sysnagogue - one of the largest synagogues in Amsterdam. Now a museum.     If you feel like venturing a little further from the city, Police Transit Camp Amersfoort is about an hour away by train/bus. This is one of three main camps in the Netherlands.   Kamp Vught is about an hour and a half, but you'll have to taxi to get there from the train station.   Finally, if you're really feeling adventurous, Kamp Westerbork is about 2.5 hours away by train. The vast majority of murdered Jews passed through Westerbork at some point in the war, including some of the most famous, such as the Frank family and Etty Hillesum.   The Anne Frank House is going to be crowded, so it's best to try and get their really early. It's worth it, but remember that it's a really small place (it was a hiding place, after all), so once you're in, it's a really quick tour.   And the last thing I'll say, if you're more interested in academic material, the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust, and Genocide Studies is located in the Herengracht, and has a large library and archive that is open to the public."

It will tell you what Jewish families lived in your street, and who were killed."
Amsterdam,3b7siz,MrAronymous,2,Fri Jun 26 20:14:15 2015 UTC,"I have to correct you there. Wibautstraat was not demolished. The Jodenbreestraat (hence the name), however, was. Before after. What's now the Wibautstraat used to be railway tracks leading to the Weesperpoortstation, which got demolished after Central Station and a new rail link to it were built. The route from the station was called the Rhijnspoor, hence the name Rhijnspoorplein. So they didn't really have to demolish anything when building those big office buildings from the 1950s onwards."

It's in the beautiful silent park of Amstelpark just south of the city. A little bike ride along the river amstel takes you there.  The monument is made of 110 little seats each having a name and a date of birth written underneath where you can have a seat and remember those fallen for freedom.   It doesn't hurt that the park itself is a great alternative to the more crowded Parks.

But of course there's plenty around the area if you'd like something nicer. The idea behind the place is that meeting other ""young professionals""/zzp-ers and sharing ideas will benefit the work of all. Which, to be fair, I haven't seen happening, but in theory it's nice. Maybe not perfect for reading (no comfy chairs), but for a productive day of working/writing/studying it can be quite a good place.  edit - and they open early morning, they close quite early though (I think at 6pm). Regular working days..  edit 2 - Volkshotel werkplaats! This is a great tip. Downstairs there's working areas and also couches if you want to read. Open all day. Better than seats2meet for sure (except for no free coffee)."

Amsterdam,3b4f5z,blogem,2,Fri Jun 26 11:14:42 2015 UTC,"De Buurvrouw is still there and still a good place to go. I prefer the De Bloemenbar though, because I like the vibe more, but also because it tends to stay open a little longer.  Keep in mind that there is no true 24h economy (yet). That means you'll have to figure out something to do in the early morning (from 5 till 8 or 9am). Personally I'd go to sleep, but going by your post it seems you're not planning to do that. Maybe you're better off going to a club instead of bar, because some of them are open a bit longer. E.g. Radion will have a nice party going which lasts till 7am.  Safety is not really an issue. If you're drunk and/or look like a tourist you might be a target of pickpockets or a scam, but if you look like you know where you're going, there's not much to worry about. In general I wouldn't worry too much... I've stumbled through the city at all kinds of hours and in all kinds of states and never ever had any issues."

Amsterdam traffic is very hectic, and a lot of people won't follow the rules (e.g. ignore red traffic lights, biking on footpaths, etc). I'm not saying you should be afraid to walk outside or something, but keep your eyes open when crossing roads and stuff. Every day i see tourists (almost) get hit because they don't understand the Amsterdam traffic and just randomly cross streets without looking.

Amsterdam,3axypy,blogem,4,Wed Jun 24 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"Traveling by public transport is very safe anywhere in the Netherlands. Schedules are accurate, although small delays can happen. Especially buses might arrive a bit earlier or later at a stop. There's no nationwide 24 hour pass. I think you'll end up buying separate tickets.   Something important to note: sometimes it can take very long to leave a festival site and often buses are packed, which means you might miss the bus and train you planned for. Make sure you have alternative options (e.g. a later train). Otherwise leave the festival half an hour earlier or so."

About the public transport tickets, how does it work? Do I buy 1 ticket from a ticket machine before each trip or do I pay in cash?"
Amsterdam,3axypy,nattetosti,4,Wed Jun 24 12:30:32 2015 UTC,For the train you can buy a ticket from a ticket machine at the train station. In the bus you pay in cash to the driver.  People who travel regularly with public transport will use the OV Chipkaart system. This is slightly cheaper than single tickets. You can read a little about the OV Chipkaart in the wiki (link in the sidebar). I doubt it will be useful for you to buy such a card (costs €7.50 + you need at least €20 credit on it to use it on the trains).
Amsterdam,3axypy,goudewup,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:07:22 2015 UTC,Will buy tickets for each journey accordingly then. Thanks again :)
Amsterdam,3axypy,frankwouter,2,Wed Jun 24 18:29:22 2015 UTC,"EDIT:sorry, somehow missed that the question had already been answered  It is completely safe, some drunkenness may be encountered in some train compartments.   There's a full night train/bus schedule in place between and in Dutch cities, check a week before whether there's some work being done on this section.   I can't really find a tourist/24hrs tickets that covers the whole trip, but there's one for Amsterdam. I'd recommend buying the (night) train ticket(s) seperately"
Amsterdam,3axypy,goudewup,2,Wed Jun 24 12:48:50 2015 UTC,I'd say an anonymous OV Chipkaart would be perfect for this.
Amsterdam,3axypy,frankwouter,2,Wed Jun 24 14:21:35 2015 UTC,You still need 20 euro to even start a train ride.
Amsterdam,3axypy,nattetosti,2,Wed Jun 24 16:42:25 2015 UTC,Well if you go Amsterdam - Breda back and forth it'll probably cost more than that anyway.
Amsterdam,3axypy,nattetosti,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:51:33 2015 UTC,So let's say I buy the card and top it up with 20 euro (costing ~28 euros in total) what advantage will that give me over buying tickets individually? Can I travel all day by using it or does it just give me discounts on rides?
Amsterdam,3axypy,MrAronymous,2,Wed Jun 24 18:35:18 2015 UTC,You safe 1.5 euro or something like that on not having to buy a 1 time usage ticket.

Amsterdam,3aqjmh,CustardOpple,5,Mon Jun 22 18:19:58 2015 UTC,"If the appliances are included in the rent, the landlord is responsible for maintaining them. Although you are liable if you break them due to misuse, the landlord should fix issues due to normal wear and tear. If, on the other hand, you buy them from the previous tenant, the landlord has no responsibility.  In the former case, you don't need to check during sighting viewing (although it may be wise) but you should check during inspection when you receive the key to document prior damage. In the latter case, you should check them before signing for buying them.  As for negotiation, it never hurts to try but generally speaking the market is easier for landlords than for tenants. It would be easy to find another tenant so you don't have a lot of leverage."
Amsterdam,3aqjmh,visvis,2,Mon Jun 22 18:55:41 2015 UTC,Just a small English note...it would better be called a viewing than a sighting.

Amsterdam,3aqjmh,visvis,0,Tue Jun 23 07:49:50 2015 UTC,"Hey. Thanks for the reply. Is asking two months rent as advance is common? Considering dutch landlords mostly wont return deposits, that seems little high to me."
Amsterdam,3aqjmh,visvis,5,Mon Jun 22 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty normal. However, the deposit is legally required to be refunded, except to compensate for damage you did to the apartment (assuming it's more than normal wear and tear). If a landlord won't refund it, you can certainly force them by going to court over it. The Huurcommissie may also be able to help in that case (not 100% sure)."
Amsterdam,3aqjmh,oonniioonn,3,Mon Jun 22 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"Considering dutch landlords mostly wont return deposits, that seems little high to me.   They will, but will often offer to use it for the last two months of rent instead."

Amsterdam,3aqp18,vv999,6,Mon Jun 22 19:00:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about it because you can indeed prove the amount with the bank transfer later. For extra clarity, you could clarify in the description, something like this:   € 1234 deposit + € 1234 rent for July 2015   That said, if it worries you, why not simply ask her to include it in the contract? I don't think it would be a big deal for her."
Amsterdam,3aqp18,visvis,2,Mon Jun 22 19:08:30 2015 UTC,Please make sure that the deposit amount is  CLEARLY STATED IN THE CONTRACT. This way there can be no ambiguity in the event of you are your friend moving out or falling out and one of you has to move. I have friends who had to fight for months to get their deposit back just because it was not clearly stated in the tenancy contract.
Amsterdam,3aq6g7,jdl_developer,2,Mon Jun 22 16:42:09 2015 UTC,Being here in person definitely helps but it sounds like you at least have the benefit of having some in-demand skills.  Keep in mind that you will need a visa to work here. Unless you have EU/EEA citizenship you'll probably want to use the Highly Skilled Migrant program. Keep in mind that smaller employers may not be willing/able to do the formalities for this.

Amsterdam,3aq6g7,cogito_ergo_subtract,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:45:45 2015 UTC,Well by law they must offer permanent employment after three years of temporary (no 4th year of temporary).
Amsterdam,3aq6g7,SBCrystal,2,Tue Jun 23 10:54:10 2015 UTC,"The law is based on the number of temporary contracts given.

Amsterdam,3aq08d,flippertheband,8,Mon Jun 22 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"AFAIK you can't deregister unless you're moving abroad. If you (fraudulently) pretend to be moving abroad I can definitely see this having consequences for your visa. If you stay registered at your old address, you won't receive official mail and your old landlord may give you trouble. In addition, the city of Amsterdam wants to step up enforcement and has recently decided to start handing out fines to people who are registered incorrectly.  I wouldn't do it. It could give you trouble and it enables the fraudulent landlord. Either register (this will only give your landlord trouble, not you) or find another place."

The airport is about a 20 minute train ride from the Central Station, which is right in the heart of the city.   When I last flew into the international terminal at Schiphol, getting through customs and baggage took about 45 minutes (as a non-EU passport holder). Assuming that you also have to return with two hours to check in and go back through security, that should give you at least three hours to pal around the city.    Have fun!

And it is illegal for any coffeeshop to sell anything to anyone under the age of 18.  There is a zero-tolerance policy: Sell to anyone younger than 18, and you lose your license -- forever.  If law enforcement officials encounter anyone younger than 18 in your coffeeshops, the place will be closed for a length of time (several weeks to months).  Have it happen again, and the coffeeshops can lose its license.  No business owner in his or her right mind is going to risk his business for you."

By train is 2,20, by subway 3,50(!). IN the center everything is walkable.  You can also walk from Sloterdijk to the Westerpark. It's about a half an hour walk. Then take it from there, for example to the Haarlemmerstraat.  I gather from your history you like classical music? There's a free organ concert 16:00 at De Duif.

Especially now, when we have dropbox, google drive, icloud drive, and more professional s3 and others. I'm sure it's a nice place to work for, but don't you think the business model is a bit outdated? (I've heard you raised beefy $25M earlier this year)"
Amsterdam,3aiap6,ziom666,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:54:33 2015 UTC,"When I started working here, I didn't get the appeal either. However, I soon realised that it's mostly about preference, knowledge and expectation. As a tech person I prefer/know how to use tools like ssh, rsync, scp. For me, WeTransfer doesn't really make a lot of sense to use while doing my job, unless it's for TPS reports or so. I've started using it privately more and more though, as it's very convenient in collaborative audio projects.  There are whole data/content-generating industries still waiting to be freed from the wrath of FTP, sftp etc. They want something that is easy to use, free of charge, and no funny business with account names and passwords and hostnames and what not. Especially now, when Big Data is becoming more and more common even in households (think of digital photo/video/music collections) and small/medium business, there is an increasing need for easy transport of bulk data.  There are of course the services you mentioned, and indeed many, many others. However, most/all require setting up an account by at least the sending party, and filling in details you perhaps might not actually want to share. WeTransfer doesn't. And using the link-only option you don't have to fill in an email address either. An account is currently only available/needed if you want to pay us. Again, it's really a preference/knowledge/expectation thing.  Our web application is very easy to use, and the actual app part only uses a small rectangle of the browser's canvas. This rectangle is the most technical part a non-Plus user will see of our product. I think this is because we do not strive to be a tech company per se. WeTransfer's functional roots can actually be found at a design agency that produced large digital design files, often then put on USB sticks that in turn were sent to the customer by courier.  Transferring files is really one of the easier challenges, from a tech perspective. AWS S3 is at the heart of our product, and solves a lot of the capacity/volume-related challenges. I gave a presentation on how we use S3 at the Amsterdam AWS Summit a few years back. Also, we try to make use of other AWS-managed services where possible. This enables us to keep devops staff count low, as there are less self-ran services to maintain.  And so, that leaves us with this whole canvas to display (usually) beautiful content on. A dedicated team of art designers assist our advertisers and agencies to make sure the ads we display uphold to a strict standard. For instance, we don't like lots of text on ads we display, as it only distracts from the imagery, which we think is more important.   Also, we do not only display ads. We have a wonderful editorial team that is responsible for mixing in beautiful pieces of art. This offers a unique exposure to independent artists, as well as more localised stuff like festivals, museums etc., and non-editorial-staff picks.  Broadband internet connectivity is still surprisingly terrible around the globe, and so sending and receiving transfers that can be up to 10GB in size can sometimes result in multiple hours of waiting for this process to finish.   So we try to make the background content, which can even be interactive and/or animated (even heavier restrictions apply here), as worthy as possible to look at. This way, we hope to make the whole experience while transferring your files a bit more pleasant. This makes for a unique, desirable and non-intrusive experience, with continuing overwhelmingly positive feedback from both our users and advertisers.   It all sounds very cliché, but we really do try to make a better product, and fortunately for us, it seems to stick with our users.  To answer your questions: I personally feel WeTransfer has a bright future ahead. The $25M investment opened up a vast new range of possibilities, as you might understand. It means we're growing, and facing many new challenges. We have extremely capable people on staff, dealing with the growth and challenges like the pro's they are.  I think the comparison between us and dropbox-like solutions doesn't really fly. Even though I suppose we have some overlapping audiences, they simply have different expectations.  Also, no, I don't think it's an outdated business model. I mostly disagree because business is good, quite positive actually :)"

We bought a house there, and overall I regret it. €450k, repayments €1100 a month. 105m2 1600's built, new foundations, refurb'd cheaply-but-acceptably.  Pros:   So damn close to everything Public transit, for biking, shops, work (1017PB, cannot beat the 5-minute ride to work!) It's fun to help tourists find their way, I never find it a bother, and do it maybe 10 times a week in summer When not plagued by noise (below), it's actually quite quiet (!) Sometimes in the wee hours, drunk Scotsmen wander home and quietly sing a folk song, it's quite lovely   Cons   At night, yahoos from the red light district,  Asshole cab drivers and their horns,  Trucks unloading for the hotel from 0600 every (and I mean, every) morning.

Quieter than De Pijp, but just on the other side of the river from it, so convenient to shop or dine there. Halfway in between Oosterpark and Sarphatipark, with nice greenspace along the river Very close to the OLVG hospital. Neighborhood is growing, lots of new bars/restaurants have opened in the last year or two. Convenient to the Hogeschool and UvA Cheaper than De Pijp, with slightly bigger apartments.   Cons:   Lots of students, so late night parties. Wibautstraat is like a dividing line between the nice Weesperzijde and a much less nice area.

Pros:  Amazing architecture - Amsterdam school through and through, plus the area, like all of zuid is by the city planner Mr. Berlage, called Plan Zuid, hence my screen name.  Big apartments with historical details, mostly pre war so astetically  Well connected with tram 12 & 4, sadly 25 is gone. And busses 62 & 65,  so getting anywhere is a breeze. Amstel, RAI and Zuid stations are no more than 5-10 minutes away by bike. Plus biking, but that's a given.  Lots of hip restaurants, shops but still has lots of old school amenities like cheese mongers, fish mongers, butchers, bakeries, hardware stores and seamstresses.   Close to the Pijp and all of that.  Parks, like Martin Luther King Park and Amstel Park plus lots of little parks and large courtyards with sports facilities (basketball, football, tennis).  Cons:  Expensive, like really expensive. Social housing of which there is lots is of course under 710 but free sector is upwards of 1500 per month exclusive. That's generally for 80-100 m2.  Rijnstraat is busy during the day with traffic as it feeds into the A10 and A2. But at night it's quiet, mits for the occasional scooter or motorbike, which I hate.  Wierdly desired by criminals to hang out. Riverbar had someone shot in the doorway. But other than the criminal underworld, actually daily crime that would affect you is extremely low.

Amsterdam,3advd9,Volumeknop,2,Fri Jun 19 10:43:24 2015 UTC,"It's impossible to say because there is a sharp divide between social housing and private sector rentals.  Social housing is below € 710 per month (sometimes as low as a few hundred per month) but requires many years (sometimes even decades) on a waiting list and is therefore often not a realistic option.  In the private sector, I would say Nieuw West is the closest place to the center where apartments below € 1000 per month can realistically be found, sometimes as low as € 800 per month if you're lucky."

I lived in The Kinkerbuurt in the Baarsjes and in The Museumquarters in Oud-Zuid, but Noord is what i call home.  Strong Points:   Near Het Twiske (nature) Amsterdam Noord has a lot of shoppingcentre's. Boven Y is 20 min and Banne Centrum 15 min by bike, Molenwijk at 5 mins walking distance. lots of green in the neigbourhood, Its a tuindorp (gardenvillage) afterall. It is Amsterdam, but the Amsterdam on the other side of the IJ. Very close to Central station. Its a volksbuurt (workingclass quarter?) so social control is quite high, people tend to look out for each other.   Weak Points:   Houses are small and still expensive, i live alone on 29m2 for 690E, and its a ""normal"" house. Public tranfer is horible, one bus to Central Station and one to Sloterdijk, but that one does not go after 20:00 and not on sundays, same goes for the NDSM pont. Still no bridge over het IJ. Lots of problems with youth groups (would not call them gang's)    General misconception is that cause there are a lot of blue collar workers, the majoriy of Tuindorp Oostzaan are antisocial, single minded people. Yes, on a hot day you can see some  shirtless dude with a beergut doing his groceries, a thing you would probably not see in Oud-Zuid. But that makes Noord Noord."

Welcome to Amsterdam.  -First, if you want to get STUFI you have to be registred at a university, it doesn't matter if you do an intership or are actually following courses, you just have to be registred at an uni. I don't know the specific rules to international students though. - Secondly, from september on, a lot is gonna change. Previously your STUFI loan (depending on your income and housing ranging from 180 to 680-ish) would transform into a gift once you graduated. From september on this isn't the case anymore, you can get STUFI but you have to pay it all back. FOr more (Dutch) information about is, search for ""Leenstelsel"".  - Third, Studentenwoningweb is a bitch if you didn't subscribe a long ago. I recently moved in an amazing place in the city centre through Studentenwoningweb, but i got really lucky and i have registerd 5 years ago. The site works like you mention, your ranking is dependent on the length of time since you've had your account.  Last thing: contact your university in the Netherlands (I am guessing VU or UVA), they know all these things. It can be a bit hard to get the right department."

Amsterdam,3a5hd9,Coffeeshopman,2,Wed Jun 17 16:09:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah try. Walking through the neighbourhoods looking at the buildings, finding little side streets that look interesting, finding some secret gardens, finding a small local theatre, see a bench with an interesting view, end up in a local bar and then try to find your way back ""home"". I still do this when I have time and don't have to be at a place at a specific time, I will pick a street I haven't gone through yet."

A good street map is recommended for those going to try this.  This one is my personal recommendation.  I should confess I don't live in Amsterdam/Netherlands, but do visit and my parents were very much citizens of the Netherlands before they decided to move to Canada."

Amsterdam,3a5m67,ikkannietbelastinggv,6,Wed Jun 17 12:22:44 2015 UTC,"This is more complicated than it at first appears.   I am going to assume that both you and the customer are located in the Netherlands. If not, then you're moving into international waters. Intra-EU is pretty easy to figure out because of the reverse-charging mechanism, but once you start involving third party states (i.e. Not NL and not EU), you get into complicated waters. I'm also assuming that you do not fall under one of the exceptions listed here. You should read that list carefully in the event you believe you fall under an exception. You may also consider hiring a tax professional for advice.   The first thing you need to do is to register your business (which even if you're an individual selling a service - that's a business) with the tax office so that you can get a tax ID number (which should be included on your invoice). If you don't have that, then the customer (which you said is a business) will not be able to reclaim the VAT from the tax office on their quarterly return. That means, if the customer's accountant is worth their salt, will not pay the invoice unless it's properly formatted. You can read more about this here.  As regards what you need to collect, VAT in the Netherlands is, I believe a 21% inclusive rate. For example, a bill of EURO 100 would contain BTW of 17.36 and a regular charge of 82.64.   Alterntatively, you could try and get it done under the table, but if you're dealing with a well run business, that will not be possible. If you're dealing with a smaller family shop, it might.   I should note that I've been doing VAT work for years on behalf of American companies, so I'm moderately familiar with the process there, but only there. You may (probably!) need to register your business with the gemeente as well and possibly with the local chamber of commerce. Those are more administrative things that I don't know as much about since American companies don't have to do that (but they have to pay taxes, hence my knowledge of that part!)  Good luck."
Amsterdam,3a5m67,Jan_van_Bergen,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:36:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for your input. Assumptions are correct, I looked at the exceptions and I do not fall under them.   I called the belastingsdiesnt and since it's a one-off thing, I do not need to register for a KVK. It falls under the ""overige werkinkomsten"" or so and as long as I declare it when doing my aangifte, it should be fine. What I'm still in the dark about is how much I need to withhold. It seems that I pay this tax based on how much income I have from my (normal) employer. I also have no clarity in if I need to charge the party I'm invoicing for BTW. I might just have to subtract the BTW from my invoice. Thanks for your response, it's a kind of an odd situation I guess."
Amsterdam,3a5m67,Jan_van_Bergen,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:51:50 2015 UTC,"since it's a one-off thing, I do not need to register for a KVK.   Well there you go. This tells us that your best bet is to get back on the horn with the tax office and just ask your questions. I've spent many an hour on the phone with them, they are generally really helpful. And if you get a jerk, then just call back another time and you'll get someone else.   Good luck."

Amsterdam,3a5m67,PQ_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:17:55 2015 UTC,"OK I have one addition to all that has been said: It is customary for business to business  to quote prices without VAT. So if you and the customer agreed on € 100, you are expected to invoice  €100 exclusief BTW, and add the BTW (21%) on a separate line, totalling € 121"
Amsterdam,3a5m67,2nd_law,0,Wed Jun 17 17:50:19 2015 UTC,I don't see why you shouldn't have to include the BTW. All the other things depend on how you're registered at the Kamer van Koophandel.

Amsterdam,3a393q,tomgs,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:33:34 2015 UTC,I don't know what the cineville pass entails. I have the pathé unlimited card which costs me 19€/month. Lets you go to as many films at the Pathé cinemas in NL as you like (but you pay a little extra for 3D and/or IMAX films).  It's perfect for me as you get your money's worth if you go at least twice a month and because I mainly enjoy mainstream films. Maybe cineville is more for arthouse? But I'm not sure.
Amsterdam,3a393q,bipin2011,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:01:40 2015 UTC,Well...if you like mainstream movies you should go for the Pathé pass. The cinemas are also very big and well kept and the movies are of good quality. In City and Tushinski you will also find some indie films. With the Cineville pass you can visit all the art-house cinemas including De Hallen which is very popular and trendy and also shows some mainstream films. You can also visit Eye where they have the Imagine festival and lots of classics. Which is a big plus for me.

Amsterdam,39y5i4,blogem,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:26:53 2015 UTC,"One of my friends coming has access to friends/family rates for Hilton hotels. We made a reservation at the Doubletree next to Centraal station, then I noticed the Doubletree NDSM had a really good points and money rate. We'll pay less cash plus I'm trying to get rid of Hilton points, just needed some convincing whether or not it was a good idea."
Amsterdam,39y5i4,blogem,2,Mon Jun 15 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind cycling, I wouldn't worry too much about either. Sure, NDSM takes a bit longer, but most of that journey is the ferry. Unless you're really set on getting to and from the hotel as fast as possible instead of just cycling a minimum distance, I think both are fine.  To be honest, I wouldn't cycle from either location. Going to the festival is fine, but afterwards I would find it too far. However, getting a taxi after the festival sucks balls, so I'm sure if you're up to that.  PS: I just noticed the times you put in your original post. Those seem to be for the car. For cycling you have to set it to the correct mode of transport (in Google Maps I have to click on the ""..."" next to the walking guy). Use as destination for the festival ""Nieuwe Meerlaan 3, 1182 DB Amstelveen""."

Amsterdam,39y5i4,Valkuil,2,Mon Jun 15 22:12:41 2015 UTC,"The festival is held at different locations, so that 25 minute ride is probably for the Amsterdamse Bos events.  NDSM would be cheaper, but the direct ferry stops at 1:15 at night and you'd have to take the one straight across the IJ to Buiksloterweg (goes all night) and then cycle quite a bit further -easily add 15 minutes to the journey.  The ferries themselves are perfectly fine, and free of charge.  Have a map of Amsterdam public transport, and if you click on line 905 (the one to NDSM) and line 907 (Buiksloterweg) you'll see the difference.  Don't try to use Google maps on this route, as it thinks you're Jesus and make you walk across the water."
Amsterdam,39y5i4,blogem,2,Mon Jun 15 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"Dekmantel festival (the main festival days) is way out of town, I would check other options in maybe Amstelveen or Amsterdam Zuid (south)  Ndsm is too far from it all to be honest."
Amsterdam,39y5i4,britamstel,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, distance was what mainly went through my mind, plus I forgot to consider the time to walk when leaving the festival ground to get back to the locked up bikes at night...that's probably minimum 15-20 minutes? I'll keep looking at other options too."

But although some areas are more fun or prettier, most of Amsterdam is fine, and everything is very reachable by bike or public transport. Therefore pretty much everywhere is ok. A nice guideline to hold on to, is ""de ring"". It's a highway that circles around Amsterdam and it's very recognisable on google maps. Inside there, or just outside of it is fine.   If you have a choice, I would personally go Centrum > Oud West > De Pijp > Oost > Nieuw West. But only go live in the center if you can cope with the busy streets filled with tourists.  Enjoy your time!"

Amsterdam,39w6hc,FatCanelo,3,Mon Jun 15 08:05:41 2015 UTC,Are you hoping to open a local bank account and work or are you just going to be a long term tourist?  If it's the former you need to find a place that will allow you to register at if it is the later then any place would do.    Have you looked at airbnb? Or through what is recommended in the wiki?
Amsterdam,39w6hc,2nd_law,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:12:08 2015 UTC,"I am hoping to eventually open an account and work, but the thing is that there are two cities we want to try out, of which amsterdam is first on the list,  so I was asking about rent for less than 6 months because I figured that if it didn't work out it would not be a convenient situation to have a year long contract that we risk not to honor if the job hunt does not go well in Holland. I think in this sense I fall under the ""long term tourist"" category for practical purposes. What do you mean exactly by ""any place would do"" then? Also, I've heard about people renting out there places when they go off on holiday short-term and I wanted to know if there is anywhere I can look to look for this specifically. Or maybe just single rooms in a large , shared apartment, although I know that generally couples are not welcome for room sharing type deals."
Amsterdam,39w6hc,HenkieVV,3,Mon Jun 15 13:43:03 2015 UTC,"If you want a job (and/or a Dutch bankaccount), you need a BSN for which you need to register with the municipality. To register with the municipality, you need to prove you actually live in the city.  There is something of a market for illegal subletting, but these places won't allow you to register there, which means you won't be able to get a job (and/or Dutch bankaccount) as long as you live there.  On the other hand, if you want a legitimate rental where you can register and everything, you're typically required to commit for a year.  Also, how sure are you that you've got the migration-stuff sorted out? Your wife should be allowed to come, no problem, but I'm not 100% sure your wife is allowed to bring over a non-EU partner just like that, if she doesn't have a job here. I could be wrong, but it may be worth checking out."

In terms of migration stuff I am totally cool. We have spoken to the immigration officials in Holland and spouses (be they from whatever country) count as family and I can get my BSN along with her when we arrive. This is also true of Germany and Spain and I believe across the board in the EU. EU citizens have ""freedom of movement"" within the EU and their spouses also have this right, you just have to go through the red tape and get yourself sorted. Now, about the BSN, and this is info we've gathered from resources for expats based on actual expat experiences...there is a sort of temporary BSN that one gets the first time. After four months it becomes an official BSN (even though it is the same number) and when this happens you do have to register with a legitimate rental."

As for the food (not weed, no idea how much that costs) if you're preparing it yourself it should be possible to stay below € 10 per day for food for two people. If you eat at restaurants, count on at least triple that if you're going for the cheapest options.  As for the museums, it obviously depends on which ones and how many.

Amsterdam,39q9bg,paulmccarkey,3,Sat Jun 13 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"This could be it. I live in De Baarsjes, right off the Rembrant Park. I wouldn't call it an immigrant neighborhood, but there are definitely lots of immigrants, if that distinction is clear.   I remember last summer, I was doing some work in Den Haag, and I kept hearing the entire neighborhood erupt in screams. Then again, and again, and again. The entire time, the streets were DEAD.   I finally figured out it was the Netherlands vs. Spain match."
