oldpeoplefacebook,3dw1fw,Dikpox,8,Mon Jul 20 09:31:02 2015 UTC,I like how she acknowledged walmart briefly but then feels the need to hog the limelight and tell everyone about her day in all caps.
oldpeoplefacebook,3dw1fw,etselecaira,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:40 2015 UTC,The all caps are on purpose! I just thought old people would accidentally press the all caps key and not now how to turn it off

oldpeoplefacebook,3dt6za,ohgodhowdidthisget,21,Sun Jul 19 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"Semi-related: One of the most frustrating things to me was when one of my friends texted me and told me she was going to OD (I was in Florida, her NY) and I couldn't convince her to call anyone for help or give me her address.  So I called the local police in my hometown and they asked if I had her address and I said no, just the town and her name and that they had sent help to her house previously. The woman said they didn't know her address and couldn't do anything, so I asked what am I supposed to do? She was very condescending, like ""okay so this person just texted you..?"" and I'm like there is a history. And yes. I called other local police stations and they couldn't find one either apparently, so they said there was nothing they could do. I ended up finding her sister on fb and sending her a message. She didn't get it until the next morning. Friend ended up ODing, but luckily not seriously enough to do major harm. Definitely felt helpless that night."

There have been too many stories of people calling for help for a mentally ill family member or friend and ending up with a dead family member/friend. I wish there was another option."

oldpeoplefacebook,3dt6za,Buffalo__Buffalo,15,Sun Jul 19 07:21:19 2015 UTC,That x-wing is the icing on the cake
oldpeoplefacebook,3dt6za,ECHTECHT,5,Sun Jul 19 11:13:19 2015 UTC,"Oh fun but not fun story. My fiancee has a really old x wing set from the 80's that was completely built and perfect from his childhood. Like a kid when he built it he never super glued it, just built it for fun. He kept it for all these years perfectly intact never sealing it or anything. He placed it in a box on top of one of my boxes in our closet. I'm kinda short at 5'4"" and I needed something out of my box. I reach up to pull his box off of mine, it's barely in my fingertips and I am on the very tip of my toes. I didn't really know what was in the box, I just needed it down so I could grab mine. Well, of course you know where this is going, I grabbed the box and it was too tall for me, it slipped right out of my hands. The box landed on the ground behind me and the lid flies off. With it all of the pieces of the vintage xwing. Lego pieces everywhere. I stare completely stunned and, hearing the crash, my fiancee runs in the room. He looks at the lego pieces and the box and then at me and starts to cry, just right there, starts bawling like a baby. I had only ever seen his cry once before this. I start freaking out and apologizing saying I should have asked for help and hoping maybe we could find some of schematics online. He just slumped to the ground quietly sobbing. I started to cry from the guilt and horror. So there we are, sitting on the ground crying surrounded by vintage lego pieces. I thought he was going to leave me right then and there for breaking a piece of his childhood, it was horrible. He picked up all the pieces and put them back in the box and left them there and silently walked away and pretended it didn't happen. He hasn't talked about it since.    Tl;dr broke my fiancee ' s xwing. Know anywhere I can find a schematic from the late 80's or walk 90's? I wanna rebuild it eventually."
