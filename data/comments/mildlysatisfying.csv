mildlysatisfying,35mwf4,nd235,1 point,Tue May 12 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"Not that lucky really, this often happens to me, I think the trick is letting it get as cold as it can but without freezing and then opening it in a single continuos motion.   I buy activia because I like to poop at least two times a day, and they work nice, both on cool opening results and pooping time, which is more than midly satisfying. So there's that. Other brands that work for me are some local spanish brands that are more dense in texture than danone or yoplait, almost every time turn up like this.  Anyway, if you want to know more about yogurt or poop, google it, I can only bring anecdotical knowledge, so you better find good sources before doing any experiment.  On a side note, the combination of baby towels and toilet paper to clean your anus is also midly satisfying, on the other hand, if you keep the baby towels on the fridge, well, if there's something I can recommend it is that, also keeping savings but that's for another conversation.  So, yes, I feel like this happens to me a lot, sorry, good night! Not the yogurt thing, well yes, but not that, I mean this, commenting. Anyway."
