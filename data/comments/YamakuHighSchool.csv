YamakuHighSchool,3e5n7d,Shika_Hattori,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:27:59 2015 UTC,"It was on my first day that I found out that this school had a pool. Bella had informed me when listing through a bunch of ideas about what we could do, but I refused the pool idea. I'm not sure my joints can support me in water, and honestly I'm not up for making myself look like a fool anymore than I have to.  However, I've been acting as a fool quite a bit recently, to put it lightly. Whether it be from presuming the wrong, to slipping up on disabilities, to the... err... yeah, let's not bring up The Wolf incident anymore than I have to. My head still hurts from that and is clouded up, so I want to ignore it until I have time to think it over.  Attempting to push that thought to the back of my mind, the reason for me remembering the pool is the fact of all the people talking about it around the place. I've been walking round alone for  a while today, so it gave me a chance to listen in on people's conversations.   ""Hey, you heard about Mi... and the pool... ty?""   Mi? Do you they mean Miki, the athletic girl that Hanzo informed me of on day 1? Or maybe there's somebody else... I know there was the girl called Mikato on day 1 as well, but she... didn't seem like the pool type. Also, ""ty""? I wonder what that means.   ""It's gonna be awesome, I'll bring drinks!""   Drinks to a pool? Isn't that usually a no-go thing to do at a pool? No running, no eating, no drinking, no throwing your friends in the pool. Maybe Yamaku has different rules according to that? Hmm, could be the case.  All this talk of food, however, has made me hungry. I decide that I should grab one of the vending machines that Shika told me about, and get a bite to eat. They're slowly becoming more prevalent to me than they were at first, possibly due to me actually knowing the school a bit better and getting to know the area well. I find a machine and order a cheese baguette. It's not much, but I just want a light snack if I'm going to go anywhere near to the pool. A few students pass behind me   ""Yeah, Mis... organised a po... party, it's gonna be gr....""   The words trail off. Okay, so the person organizing this is called Mis-something... not heard a name like that yet. Hmm. Wait, did he say party? Like, a pool party? What the heck is that? I think the closest I got to a party in a pool once was when a kid back in Hanado was inviting people to his birthday party at the pool. Is that what this is? Mis-something's birthday?  I decide I should probably text one of my contacts about it, and see what they can do. I grab my phone in one hand, whilst trying to unwrap the cheese baguette in my other hand on it's own, and scroll through my contacts. I've deleted the old numbers from my old school, so every contact in here is either family or Yamaku.   Bella   I got Bella's number at the Shanghai on the first day. She did mention that there is a pool, so she will most likely know of it's whereabouts, but she also said she is knew so I doubt she'll have any idea who this Mis-person is, or what is happening. scroll   Dad   That number is for... sentimental reasons. Probably shouldn't go too far down that route. scroll   Hanzo   Hanzo's number was the first number I got at Yamaku, but he didn't really seem like the active type. His preferences are a lot more to do with Gundam, anime, figurines and that kind of culture, and I honestly can't imagine him swimming. I mean, what would he do about his eye socket? Wrap it up? Hmm. scroll   HOME   Useless at this moment in time. scroll   Mum   Useless as well. scroll   Shika   Oh hey, I forgot I'd gotten Shika's number down at the racetrack. She definitely seemed like the active type of person, and she was running and said she'd go to the gym as well. She'll probably know where the pool is, and considering how long she said she was at this school, she may know the Mis-tery person as well. This seems like my best bet.  I click on the contact and begin to tap in a message.   hey shika its hinata, theres talk of a pool party with some people. somebody called mis organising too. any idea what is hapning.   I send the message, and feel the delightful ""message sent"" ding in my hand. If Shika receives the message, then I'm sure she'll be fine to tell me what's going on if she knows, and if not, we can try to find out together. Alternately, if she doesn't receive it, I guess I can try another one of my contacts.  I wrap open my baguette fully, lean against the wall, and begin to eat as I wait for a reply.

Oh wait, I never checked my messages from back when I gave my number to Hanzo. I wonder what he sent as a test message.   Hello :)   Oh, pretty generic, but it works.

I guess I'll tell her where I am   great im in the hall by the classrooms at one of the vending machines, cant miss me.   I send that, without fully thinking about what we're going to do about the pool party. Wait... is Shika intending for me to go swimming... oh shit. I send a second message to her.   also are you going swiming   Makes sense to ask that. I don't even know if I have any swimming trunks packed... the last time I went swimming was back in Hanado when I was 10 or 11, I think, so I don't think I do actually.

I grab my keypad, let out a deep sigh, and begin to send another message.   dont have any swimwear so im prety sure i cant go swiming. i can watch tho   That should do it, although it does leave Shika to question me about my motives. Eh, should work for now.  I close my eyes as I lean back again, and think about how easy it would be to try to basically re-learn swimming.

YamakuHighSchool,3e4c9z,Mari_Yanagawa,3,Tue Jul 21 21:21:56 2015 UTC,"I can hear mom crying, the shaking in my chest hasn't stopped for hours.  A single night was all it took to ruin everything. I just got here, it was like he was waiting for me.  He looked fine, just a little pale. How was it possible for it to happen so fucking quickly. I feel like throwing up again, but there isn't anything in me besides bile and stomach acid.    A chime goes off that feels like it so far away, yet close enough to bring my attention to my phone.   u there? - Mari Yanagawa   I know I should respond, but I just don't have the energy. I've been sitting here on the floor leaning against the bed for god knows how long.  How did we get back from the hospital? I remember now, mom drove.  How long where we there? 12:37 was when she got the call, then it was 4:47 before I knew it.  What time is it now?   Picking up the phone, I guess I should respond  Dad died today.    Hitting the send button, I drop it on the floor as I let myself daze out again."
YamakuHighSchool,3e4c9z,Amane_Tsukahara,2,Tue Jul 21 21:49:42 2015 UTC,"It took a little longer than usual but the buzzing of my phone soon goes off. As eager as always, I pick up the phone and scroll down to read the message. That eagerness went away pretty damn quick.  I don't know what to do. I was never good at comforting people, I'm still not good at it now. I don't have the words to tell him it will be alright. I know they will be empty. They won't reach him. I can't even relate to him. My parents and I... our relationship... it isn't anything like Amane's.  video call?   At least with a video call it will feel more personal. Writing words doesn't sit right with me. I need him to know I'm here, to see me."
YamakuHighSchool,3e4c9z,Amane_Tsukahara,2,Tue Jul 21 21:55:37 2015 UTC,"The chime comes through again dragging my eyes to the floor where it fell.   I should probably answer it, but would anyone blame me if I didn't?   Dad would,  he would say never to keep a woman waiting.  I can almost here his voice ring out in my head.  Deep and powerful, with just the hint of a fading accent. I feel a painful stinging in my eyes again as I close them to try and stop it.    Reaching out to the phone, I read the message and send the call request."
YamakuHighSchool,3e4c9z,Amane_Tsukahara,2,Tue Jul 21 22:05:59 2015 UTC,"I was worried he would ignore me and simply hang up the call but I catch my breath when I see the call request and quickly answer him.  The video soon appears and shows Amane, I can see his face stained from tears, a pained look on his face, a look I've never seen before. I try uttering something, anything, but any words that I might have had before comes out empty. I can't even comfort my boyfriend.  ""Amane..."" The only thing I can say is his name."
YamakuHighSchool,3e4c9z,Amane_Tsukahara,2,Wed Jul 22 03:59:15 2015 UTC,"Setting the phone on the floor, I can only imagine the camera is trying to focus on the ceiling in the low light.  I don't particularly feel like talking, but I want to hear her voice.   She says my name, but nothing else as the silence weighs heavy on my shoulders.  I can't stop thinking about him, all the advice, the time, the knowledge that I have lost.  The foundation which allowed me to push my self to a point that should have ruined me.    Now it's gone, all that's left is a memory and a body.  Just like last time, I wonder if I'm doomed to repeat this."
YamakuHighSchool,3e4c9z,Amane_Tsukahara,2,Wed Jul 22 04:38:21 2015 UTC,"The silence is stifling. Like it's choking on my words. I can't seem to say anything no matter how hard I try. I want to say I'm sorry and that I'll be there for him but those words... I don't know if they're the ones if he should be hearing right now.  I wish I could be there! I wish I could hug him! I knew how to make him feel better like that. Words always failed me.  ""I... I want to be with you...""  All I can say to him is my desire. But I mean every word of it."
YamakuHighSchool,3e3ur8,Doctor_OS,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:24 2015 UTC,I wish to ask for a couple things before I submit my flairs. I would like to give Shinji's flair headphones and a game controller. I'd also like to do a little Photoshopping on my end to add some scars to Hisako (Rinmaru only allows 1 scar at a time) and Rinmaru doesn't have the eye color I want for Shinji
YamakuHighSchool,3e3ur8,Shinji_Yasuda,2,Wed Jul 22 09:56:52 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure doing edits to the character profile is fine, overall. I mean, for Hinata's flair (see above), I wanted to get a blue streak of hair, so that took a quick bit of image editing in Paint.NET but it worked :D"
YamakuHighSchool,3e3ur8,HinataSureiya,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:04:43 2015 UTC,"As long as the image in general stay intact (No alteration to the background and it remains a solid color) I'm fine with you photoshopping in the color and scars.  On the Accessories, I'm personally limiting it to one.  These are essential school ID photos, while I am lax on them you must maintain dress code.  Bella got the controller though for the most part it was cut off.  I would recommend the headphones."
YamakuHighSchool,3e3ur8,Shinji_Yasuda,2,Wed Jul 22 10:05:14 2015 UTC,"Works for me, thanks"

YamakuHighSchool,3e3ur8,Chie_Ayamine,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:19:24 2015 UTC,"I can assist now, what style are you liking for Misha? K-ON or Rinmaru?"
YamakuHighSchool,3e3ur8,Chie_Ayamine,2,Wed Jul 22 03:33:30 2015 UTC,"I think K-On might be better for my Misha, because she has brown hair with pink tips."

YamakuHighSchool,3e3ur8,Souza_Kewe,2,Wed Jul 22 02:51:19 2015 UTC,Can you change my flair again? I think it looks a bit stretched. Should I submit a different picture?
YamakuHighSchool,3e3ur8,Suzuki_Suzu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:53 2015 UTC,I'm working on it with those submitted from the kon character creator like I noted in my post. You are welcome to submit another picture if you like but the current flair is by no means the final version you will receive.
YamakuHighSchool,3e3ur8,Souza_Kewe,2,Tue Jul 21 20:03:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay. Then I'll just stick to this one. :)"

YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,HinataSureiya,3,Tue Jul 21 15:56:02 2015 UTC,OOC: Poor Sureiya. ; A ;
YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,AlexanderGarland,0,Tue Jul 21 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"He has a grin on his face as he calmly makes his way over to Hinata. He's got a proper cigarette in his mouth despite everyone telling him not to smoke on the premises and he is dressed in his usual outfit consisting of the heavier leather trench coat, camouflage cargo pants and powerful kickers. He looks the kid over and stays silent for a good minute. His eyes don't shine and instead they show a more bored expression.   ""Mind sharing the joke?""  His voice lacks in the emotion department and he has little to no actions. He wets his lips after the cancerous smoke and stands there tall and fierce. Hinata Sureiya. Status: Broken. Has Hinata tried to get Blake's name already? He hopefully has otherwise this wouldn't be that fun."
YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,Blake_White,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"I stare up at The Wolf, making sure to meet him in the eyes with my gaze. My emotions are firing on all cylinders at this point, and if I didn't know better about my joints, I'd have gone forward and attempted to strangle him to death. But no, I am stone cold. Fury builds up in my system. I think back to the nightmare, Hanzo, Bella, Shika, everybody who I've cared for, and how the Hunter is to them. My fists clench, my teeth grind together, and my stance becomes strengthened. My lips snarl into a grin, a grimace almost, like I was in pain from a needle injection. Stupid, stupid Wolf.  ""Good evening.""  My voice comes out expressionless, met only with the spit of my mouth on the end, like a viper only less venomous. The venom is elsewhere for me. It exists within my soul, my mind, and my nerves. Here and now, in the courtyard, it is just me and the enemy of my life. I shall be victorious.  I take a step forward."
YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,Blake_White,0,Tue Jul 21 16:20:53 2015 UTC,"""Wow... You're absolutely awful at jokes.""  He observes the movements and his eyes narrow. So he did it. Blake barely smirks as mirrors Hinata and also takes a step forward. Again, nothing much happens. It barely shows but he has moved all of his weight over to his right foot, the one he is leading with. He is safe for now but he still looks at the kid.  ""Are you going to cry? Your sobs are simply fascinating. I wonder how much you would cry if something bad happened.""  Anger him. Anger him so much he breaks. Blake wants this. He wants to see the kid break. He wants to see him break in some sort of way. Any way. He has to break."
YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,Blake_White,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"The Hunter's remarks are pure, uncut hilarity. He thinks he can topple me? He's already pushed me past breaking point, so there's no way he can beat me now. I'm running on high octane anger.  ""Fuck. You.""  I say the words clear and concisely, coating them in a layer of poison and hatred. This Wolf thinks he's so perfect. He will pay. He will fucking pay for tormenting me. I'll leave him on a bench the way he left me. I will break him. I'll find out his name, his disability, his anything, I will end him with it all.  He's created a monster, and that monster is beginning to fight back. I take another step forward, still with the same body positioning as before.    OOC: I have dinner now, shall continue this later - looking forward to it :D"
YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,Blake_White,0,Tue Jul 21 16:35:48 2015 UTC,"""Oh my... What have I made? It's alive! It's alive!""  He grins and takes another puff on his cigarette. The smoke is blown into Hinata's face and the cigarette is then put threateningly close to him before being flicked away. Blake squares in on smaller boy and looks down at him, hands ready to shield and counter any type of attack. You don't mess with a boxer. He will even shove the kid if he has to.  ""Puny.""    OOC: Have pun~! See ya later."
YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,Blake_White,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"I can't help but make my smirk larger at the sound of The Wolf's remarks. Yes, look what you've created, and watch how quickly it destroys you.  On the inside I wince at the smoke that billows into my eyes and mouth and nasal cavities, but I don't let my guard down. I can't let my guard down. It'd be foolish to let my guard down, and I won't be made a fool again. I blink once to dispell any smoke particulates from my eyes, and look up once more to my foe.  He's moving around a lot, shuffling around, and his hands... they're moving as if he's ready to attack. He's backed into a corner. He's trapped. I'm moving in closer on him and he's not expecting it. Perfect. I take another step forward.  ""Fuck. You""  I repeat the statement again, this time more clear cut than the last. The bile is clear in my speech now, and I'm practically grinding my teeth into pieces at this point. I will not back down. This fight. This fight is mine."
YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,LegionaresCZ,0,Tue Jul 21 17:00:41 2015 UTC,"Time to use a little violence... But what? He contemplates taking the boy's shirt and lifting him as high as possible but then that leaves the possibility to kick. If he darts around and picks the kid up from behind then nothing will happen aside from the rather weak backwards kicks. He will do that. It is the perfect move.   ""I'm not scared, disturbed, worried or anything. Wanna know why?""  He stalls for time so that he can take the perfect opportunity. He doesn't want to mess this up. He doesn't want to. He will make Hinata fight back physically. He will make him fight back."
YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,Blake_White,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"The Wolf has stopped moving, and I can see the cogs physically turning in that thick skull of his. He's plotting something, but I have no way to know. He can attack me if he wants, and I don't really care at this point. He will still suffer. I don't care about my wellbeing anymore, I care about decimating his.  I take a step backwards, to try to re-evaluate the situation. I've lost a lot of the anger I had before, but it is still existent, lining the bottom of my emotional barrel. I can't do anything physical to The Wolf. I have to use my brain and wits...  Oh but that didn't work in practice last time, did it? I failed myself, I failed, because my own brain is worthless and my ideas are not worth the time or patience. I let the Hunter win his hunt because I tried to use brain rather than brawn. But I have no brawn, so I'm stuck again, aren't I?  No, fuck that. Fuck it all. I'm not allowing The Wolf another tally on his victory chart. Fuck that. I need a new plan, one that will break The Wolf apart. One that will make sure he can't lay a hand on me.  I take another step backwards."
YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,Shika_Hattori,0,Tue Jul 21 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"With fleet feet he starts darting around in front of and to the side of Hinata. He is threatening to go behind him. He is easily flanking the kid, no question about that. He can do such an action thanks to parkour, kick boxing and regular boxing as dodging in things like kick boxing are crucial. The kid is moving awfully slow too, so flanking him and lifting him up is amazingly easy. He feels his hand slip and he has no way of adjusting himself to make carrying the little guy any easier, so for now he has to try and hold on by the means of the kid's trouser pocket.   ""I dropped you before, I can do it again and again and again. I will give you a chance to fight back. Go."""
YamakuHighSchool,3e30u0,Blake_White,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:53 2015 UTC,"What the fuck? He's trying to physically fight me still? I'm not working this with hand-to-hand combat, not at all. I'm not a guy for brawn, especially with my joints, so I have no way to fight back against this guy. Besides, he's at least a good foot above me, so me trying to do anything against him would be like a beetle trying to scale a skyscraper. Worthless and fruitless.  He wants me to fight back. He thinks I still have the venom and anger I did before. But I don't, I've lost most of that now. All I'm left with is a bitter hatred. The deepest hatred a man can feel.

YamakuHighSchool,3e0j99,HinataSureiya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:46 2015 UTC,"What is it with this school and people moping around on benches? Mikato, I think was her name, did it on my first day, and this random guy is doing it here, and... I guess.... I was... uhm... doing it yesterday. Damnit, The Wolf (OOC: /u/Blake_White, fyi) will pay for fucking me over. What can I do? Ah, screw it, I'll think of something.  Maybe it's something about benches that just draws people to them. I used to see a lot of homeless people lie on them back in Tokyo, and I guess they are better than the grass or the concrete, but why not sulk in your dorm if you're gonna sulk? Actually, nevermind, I did the same thing. Probably ease of use, then.  I regret not getting emotionally invested with Mikato on the day that I met her, and trying to help her out, and after Hanzo was sad the other day and I treated him to the canteen, I've been wanting to help out more. I mean, I'm really not great at all at this stuff, and my skills are ""Throw it together and hope for the best"", but it seems to work... sometimes.  It was when I was walking past to go the toilet that I noticed the boy on the bench. I'd seen him walking round in the hustle of students, and let's be honest, his haircut is distinctive, and so are the massive metal structures emanating from his wrists. I wonder if he has a more severe injury than some other hand-injuries I've seen or heard of, like Shika or Miki. Hmm, I probably shouldn't ask about that until I at least have this guy's first name.  I walk forward to the boy and look around. He's practically taking up the whole bench, so first step will probably be to... move him?  I guess I can't do it physically, and my joints definitely won't be able to support those metal machines. I'll have to try verbally.  ""You alright there... uhm... person?""  Calling him ""person"" seems needlessly rude, but I guess I don't know his name so I can't really be blamed."

This guy is in need, and even if he doesn't want help, I'm gonna have to give it to him.  ""Come on now, guessing something... err... hurt you pretty bad, right?""

I take a look around - nobody else seems to be paying attention to the figure on the bench. I can't leave him here, he'll end up here for ages if I do. Hmm... I'm gonna have to be a bit more forceful, but it seems to mean to do it. The guy is clearly weak.  ""Listen. I'm not leaving until I at least know who you are.""  That seems like a good way to get this moving in a new direction. Make it seem like I'm just curious about who he is, rather than leading into a push-and-pull exercise with no use. There's a chance he'll just say his name and say go away again, but if it gets to that, I can try to combat it."

I guess it's going to be fruitless to try to carry on my conversation with him, if you can even call it a conversation. I should probably stay here, though, just... in case he decides to talk more than 4 words at a time.  I sigh heavily, and sit down on a bit of bench that is not covered by the boy, and I lean back and pull out my phone. I start scrolling through my apps and other stuff, just occupying the time. The bench isn't comfortable by any means, but I lean back and rest my self against it. I'm sat by the feet of the boy, so it's a clear possibility that he could kick me off. Hmm.  I sigh again."

It's a little after morning, my habit of waking up early in the morning slowly coming back to me, and I was in the middle of doing my home work but I had my phone on my desk just in case he would message me. And sure enough, he did!  I quickly finish up the question I'm on while I wait."
YamakuHighSchool,3dz33f,Mari_Yanagawa,3,Mon Jul 20 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"Before, I can even turn the phone back off it feels like the call is coming through already.  Hitting the answer prompt the image comes through fuzzy before clearing up on her face.   ""Good morning!"""
YamakuHighSchool,3dz33f,Mari_Yanagawa,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:39 2015 UTC,"""Hey!""  I answer back in equal enthusiasm. More so, as I felt my body lurch automatically to hug him, my brain stopping it at the last minute making it remember he isn't actually in front of me. I really do miss him...  ""How was your day?"" I ask, while twirling a pencil in one hand."
YamakuHighSchool,3dz33f,Mari_Yanagawa,2,Mon Jul 20 18:38:07 2015 UTC,"""It was...boring as all hell to be honest.""  I smile with a shrug as I look at her.  I didn't do anything today, except watching some old movies on tv trying to pass the time till tomorrow.   ""What about you? Class starts soon right?"""
YamakuHighSchool,3dz33f,Mari_Yanagawa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"""Yeah. Just woke up early to finish up some last minute homework is all. It's... English."" I say with a slight frown. Even saying the word causes a bad taste in my mouth.  ""I may need your help on it when ya get back."""
YamakuHighSchool,3dz33f,Mari_Yanagawa,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"[What? I'm sorry I can't understand you.]  I hold back a chuckle as I smile even wider at her. I'm better on a glare from her, but I can't help but to try and tease her."
