Tomorrowland,3e3puf,Bananaslug56,0,Wed Jul 22 07:48:31 2015 UTC,"I never said alcohol was safe, and I rarely drink. You asked for sources, so I gave you real sources - not some shitty leftist paper. Perhaps I'll have one or two drinks at Tomorrowland but other than that it's christmas/new year and a handful of other times. The only drug I take on a daily basis is Caffeine.  I would happily live in a world where alcohol is banned, I am able to enjoy events like tomorrowland without drugs/alcohol because I appreciate the music and that's why this is my 9th year. As I said, getting drunk to the point of memoryloss is stupid as well in my opinion - especially a festival like tomorrowland.  I think it's a shame people are actually worried about not getting their E because of increased security. Dunno how people can claim to enjoy a festival if they only enjoy it on drugs.  Same people will be complaining in the future when the government can't afford a decent level of mental health treatment, just like smokers with lung cancer and complaining treatment times are too long.   If you're so passionate about E, then fund your own research and publish your findings on the back of a petition for legalisation. I'm happy for it to be illegal because it's quite amusing watching people like yourself panic you won't get your daily fix - not to mention all the medical evidence against its probation."

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, or anyone else's that actually understands it, that alcohol is more dangerous than MDMA. Ecstasy is so totally ingrained in electronic music culture and it far from makes people act like 'pricks;' it actually does scientifically the opposite. Unless a prick to you is an incredibly friendly person having an awesome time not being a danger to anyone (other than maybe themselves due to too much dancing)."
Tomorrowland,3e3puf,Bananaslug56,-1,Wed Jul 22 09:20:48 2015 UTC,"If you were a medical professional you would not say ""I am a doctor"", you would have instead said you were a gynecologist or a pediatrician etc - in this case neurologist.  Secondly, if you claim to understand it then you would most likely not be a medical doctor, you would be a post-doc researcher - most likely again with an MSc or PHD rather than an MD.   You evidently have no idea about what you are talking about if you're going to use the term ""scientifically the opposite"" when talking about behaviour.  I could go on, but I think it's sad enough trying to impersonate a doctor. You evidentially have never been in contact with people who have OD'd, both on drugs and alcohol.  Whether or not people agree with my view on drugs people should agree that impersonating a selfless profession is very low. Obnoxious individuals like yourself who think there are no harm in drugs are probably the same individuals I'm cleaning vomit out of their mouth at 4 am when they are admitted with a seizure.

You felt the need to look back through a lot of my posts; I've just done the same with you and almost every single comment you've made seems to be condescending. I genuinely cannot tell if you made this account simply to post the most ridiculously obnoxious and insulting posts or you are simply that uninformed. I am sorry but it's not even an unspoken thing among medical professionals that drugs aren't actually 'bad.' ODing is abuse, recreational usage is not. I don't want to stoop to your level, but you seem to have some sort of underlying issues with the amount of aggression you are posting with. I understand if you have strong opinions about these things, but just because you or someone you may know have had bad experiences with drugs (some people I know have too), does not mean that people that take MDMA are 'generally pricks.'   Edit: maybe I do have a skewed perception, I studied my medical degree  in a city with a huge party atmosphere, but I would much rather be surrounded by a bunch of happy, loving, talkative people than the average drunk or even someone like you if you act in real life the way you do on the majority of posts you've made here."

Argueably the best study done about MDMA that controlled for many limitations that others have always had, shows there are no effects. They controlled for things like alcohol abuse, previous drug abuse, psychiatric problems in the family. Many studies, including the ones you tout, don't do that, so that means it might have been MDMA and it might have been all the other shit they did in between or before.   Not to mention your shitty 15 year review takes in about 90% studies that were funded by the war on drugs in the 80s/90s. Half of 'm are outright paid for by some ""Mothers for a Drug Free America""-like institute. Animal studies on MDMA are notoriously terrible and the fact that you'd bring them up while saying ""you have never studied medicine"" is something that makes me laugh and cry. ""Guys, if we administer 20mg/kg doses four times per day to these rats, they show cognitive deficits"". Good job. They probably also do that if you administer them fucking Tylenol in those doses.

You can plan the whole weekend if you really want, but from experience you'll just spend the whole time rushing round and constantly checking your watch to see how long it is before you need to leave and go to the next stop on your list.

Tomorrowland,3dzhg1,Goggles10,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think they even check ID's. You don't even have to bring your e-ticket, just your bracelet. So I'm not sure how they'd be able to verify your identity, as you had to type your name in order to create an account to activate the brracelet."
Tomorrowland,3dzhg1,Goggles10,2,Mon Jul 20 21:24:16 2015 UTC,Exchange desk is long closed. Viagogo is too late unless it's a willcall ticket. Best to sell it online
Tomorrowland,3dx6po,sanantoniojackson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:28:17 2015 UTC,There are approximately 8 zones when you arrive at the airport and the bus take you to the hotel related to this zone. Te days of the festival instead the bus is only for your hotel.

Tomorrowland,3dw1l0,_firecracker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:58:50 2015 UTC,There was one at some banking kiosk last year. In the food area behind the main stage. Right next to the cigarette stand. You either had to be a member of the bank or pay a crazy fee. I forget what the fee was.

I'd share my tent if you'd like.     1 ground rule is if there is a sock on the tent come back in an hour or until you hear the girls stop panting ;)  To be honest splitting a bit of my cost would be awesome.  My tent is a 3 person  so it's got a bit of room with two.    How much do you figure is fair?   I'll have my phone there so you can text me to track me down in the mayhem.   Send me a line if you want to talk more.

But i usually ignore this rule. If you are really uncomfortable with smoking inside against the rules, ask some people around you if they mind. If they don't than you can smoke at that spot, if the do, you just go outside or too another spot. If they guards catch you inside, they will only say too throw you sig away.

I know this is in Belgium, but it could be something similar where only one type of Visa is accepted.  There used to be ATM machines, although I don't know whether this will be the case in cashless.

You could withdraw the money in a city before you travel to Tomorrowland so you don't carry it all vacation (Don't know your plans). You could also put it in a locker at Tomorrowland if you want to put 200 on first.  Just make sure your bank allow cash withdrawals abroad of such a large amount of money. I've had my account blocked for not telling my bank before I went to America and withdrew $500. Took an hour on the phone to get access back! (tell them first so they know it's you not fraud)."

Tomorrowland,3dm1wq,dromedaris88,2,Fri Jul 17 11:22:18 2015 UTC,They assign you one when you arrive. If you want to be together with a big group you have to arrive at the same time.

Tomorrowland,3dmlc5,darrylvh,2,Fri Jul 17 14:23:39 2015 UTC,You can de-activate a bracelet by logging into the account the bracelet is registered to here but this only appears to be a security measure for lost bracelets. You may not be able to re-activate it. Your best bet would be to email tomorrowland and ask what your next steps are  - need help?
Tomorrowland,3dmlc5,ManLJ,2,Fri Jul 17 14:28:13 2015 UTC,"Same happened to a friend last year...just gave the bracelet to a friend of us and he didn't have any problem getting in dreamville or the festival. I saw no one getting his ID checked to see if its the same name which the bracelet is registered on, it would take the staff of TML hours to make sure each bracelet is registered to the actual visiting person. As long as the new owner doesn't lose the bracelet he will have a great time.  Cheers"
Tomorrowland,3dmlc5,Jason_Rage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:55:49 2015 UTC,if the passport is held by customs you can go to your local passport office and you can buy a 1 day passport
Tomorrowland,3dmlc5,TLJordan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:32:08 2015 UTC,Cheers thanks all. Think will just walk in with the incorrect passport then. Trouble is we live in Bermuda and hold SA passports so its not as simple as getting a 1 day passport.
Tomorrowland,3dlzou,gabrypecio,3,Fri Jul 17 10:20:20 2015 UTC,"I have no problems with this, the job they do on the mainstage is incredible and it is a lovely piece of work. but I wouldn't expect new stages every year.. plus the cost would be insane, also I go for the music and not too bothered on stages regardless.  On another note, in Australia most festivals have a very basic and boring stage setup, so anything beats that!"
Tomorrowland,3dlzou,Sunda01,2,Fri Jul 17 18:47:30 2015 UTC,"The Gathering gets a new stage design this year and one of the smaller stages has a new design too.   I'd prefer new stage designs, but I don't really care that much. As long as the main stage gets a great design, it's fine. Yes, we can expect some great stages for these ticket prices but it's not the most important thing to me."
Tomorrowland,3dlzou,SebasD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:42:43 2015 UTC,Do we know for sure that it's a new gathering stage this year?
Tomorrowland,3dlzou,ManLJ,3,Fri Jul 17 10:44:44 2015 UTC,"There's a special edition of the Tomorrowland newspaper for the ""neighbors"".

I haven't seen any pictures though."

Tomorrowland,3dlzou,Capricamper,3,Fri Jul 17 10:22:26 2015 UTC,"Excluding the Gathering, last years the second stage (actually the opera) changed every year.. And also the q-dance stage"
Tomorrowland,3dlzou,jeandepester,2,Fri Jul 17 11:11:27 2015 UTC,"The second stage was always made of recycled parts of previous mainstages, the butterfly was the first orginal design"

Tomorrowland,3dlzou,ManLJ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:59:47 2015 UTC,I don't see the problem with it since they seem to change some of the stages every few years. Even though it's a massive festival it would cost too much to change every stage each year.  There's a picture on twitter (CLICK FOR SPOILER) that shows the opera stage has been painted and looks a bit different this year other than the layout.

The police will remove all illegal caravans/campervans in the neighborhood of TML. There are no commercial campings in Boom where you could go as a backup either."

Tomorrowland,3dg8cs,Mailbox538,5,Thu Jul 16 11:19:49 2015 UTC,"Is Tomorrowland a restaurant? How are you comparing a restaurant to a festival? You also know that glass is not allowed at Tomorrowland.  Use the thing between your two ears, a brain it might be called."

Tomorrowland,3dg8cs,Natriumz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:21:35 2015 UTC,I say this as an over exaggeration. Was hoping to bring the point home that bottled water is ridiculously expensive in Europe for absolutely no reason. I spent 30-40% more on water last time I was there for the tiniest bottles of water.

Tomorrowland,3dg8cs,oolibel,3,Thu Jul 16 22:51:44 2015 UTC,"So judging by the other comments in this thread you are looking for general advice on water, not just at Tomorrowland, since you are continuing your travels throughout Europe. Umm.. and no, water isn't scarce at all. I'm typing this in my garden, sitting on top of 1500 gallons of rain water, and the rain tank is quite full thank you :-)  1) asking for tap water in bars is sometimes free, sometimes not. In Belgium, people don't usually give it to you for free. In France they always do (mandatory). It's a mix of legal and cultural stuff, and it probably won't surprise you to see that each country has much of its own culture.  2) tap water is drinkable in most European countries, especially West, Central and Southern Europe. Only in rare cases it isn't. Can't vouch for Eastern Europe. Source: personal experience. Just don't go drinking water in some cabana in the woods, obviously that may be a little less fit for consumption.  3) in supermarkets, bottled water is cheap (I'm talking cents). In bars and restaurants, it's relatively expensive.  Bottom line: if you don't want to pay an arm and a leg, just be clever and don't. It's not that hard.  As for tomorrowland, see my previous comment: it's free if you want it to be and want to do the effort of going to the refresh points."

Tomorrowland,3dd99q,Brookey_,-2,Wed Jul 15 11:41:13 2015 UTC,You mean i shouldn't complain that someone stole my money?
Tomorrowland,3dd99q,Jetgel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:43:31 2015 UTC,"Complain all you want, but do it in the right place.   Clearly you won't get any money back by complaining here. And don't confuse complaining with venting. You're doing that last bit. If you want to go vent, go outside and take a walk. I really hope that can make you feel better. If it doesn't, I couldn't care less if you go ""complain"" to some random folks face to face.  Now, follow the advice of some others in this topic and trace your issue. As some said it seems you can get a refund in some cases, and you can still get your box at Will Call after the event, if you want to."
Tomorrowland,3dd99q,leaveittobever,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:06:16 2015 UTC,"""Stole my money"". You didn't receive a little box containing bracelets you don't need at all if you've bought tickets. You can get them at the festival too.   The treasure box with the bracelets is more like a service, compared to other festivals where everyone gets their wristband at the entrance. Didn't receive it? Well, just get it there next week and ask for your refund.   Stop complaining. Contact them politely, you'll get what you want and enjoy the festival like you should."
Tomorrowland,3dd99q,HendelDendel,4,Wed Jul 15 12:02:52 2015 UTC,"You do realize the ticket prices increase because they send everyone those boxes, right? It's not like it's a free little thing they do because they're TL. Hell no, it's all in the price of the ticket. I spent $2,800 on a GJ Themed Hotel package and they didn't ship me 2 of my 4 tickets. They're off to a pretty bad start for me so far."
Tomorrowland,3dd99q,HendelDendel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"We'll never know how much they charge for these boxes. They charge €40 for them IIRC. It's an extra cost. Sure, we have to pay more because of it. But would you rather queue longer, waiting extra long because they have to hand these different types of bracelets at the entrance?  Tomorrowland being overpriced is another discussion, but I do like having my bracelet in advance. I haven't seen that many complaints about shipping issues this year btw. Looks like they're doing a better job than last year."
Tomorrowland,3dd99q,Capricamper,2,Wed Jul 15 14:08:01 2015 UTC,"I understand how you feel I got an email yesterday about this  Dear Global Journey traveller,  As of this year Global Journey travelers will receive their Tomorrowland bracelet(s) at the address you submitted during the purchase of your travel package. Due to problems with the post office in your country, Tomorrowland bracelet(s) won’t be shipped.   You are staying at a hotel so your Tomorrowland bracelet(s) have to be picked up at the Global Journey Desk in your hotel as from:  Thursday  July 23rd between 17h00 and 22h30  I emailed them back asking if I will get the case as well and they said they are working on a solution for everyone that didn't get them and will let us know more during the festival.  Keep watching your email  sure they will send somthing out soon. :) again totally understand how you feel."

Tomorrowland,3dapg4,_firecracker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:17:59 2015 UTC,is a cab really just 40-50 for 33km after midnight?
Tomorrowland,3dapg4,_firecracker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"The issue is, they know they have you in a tough spot. Especially if you have luggage they will try and rip you off to get to the airport as they know you don't want to miss your flight. You probably won't find a cab at all till 2am. It usually takes cabs a few hours to get caught up from the the end of TomorrowLand."
Tomorrowland,3dapg4,Mailbox538,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:34:26 2015 UTC,"sure, I get the point. 50 will be okay for me, though. If I have to take a late flight, I'd have to spend 200 euros more on the flight, so I'll be ok if it's 50 euro for the ride"
Tomorrowland,3dapg4,basshead69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:38:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure it will be more than that, unless they are far cheaper than Netherlands (less than 50%).

Tomorrowland,3das6y,_firecracker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:43:39 2015 UTC,"Almost all international trans Atlantic flights don't have wifi. The reason domestic flights in the U.S. Have them is be cause there is land to put the towers on. Lufthansa has wifi and it's expensive because they had to put their own satellite in the air to do it. All of your airlines in the U.S. that fly to Brussels that have wifi domestically, their international flights usually don't have wifi on them at all as its bigger aircraft that never get used domestically."

(1996) - u should have ur whole future ahead and im for something urself  im very worried by number of kids attending from reading reddit past few weeks... has anyone been before? is it a 18 year old sausage fest or are there mature people also (mature compared to 18 - im 25)

Tomorrowland,3d97b5,Bananaslug56,3,Tue Jul 14 14:13:11 2015 UTC,This is reassuring. I have attended a few other major festivals and been a part of their respective subreddits and I must say that the vibes in this sub are the worst of any festival. Nearly every topic has more downvoted comments than upvotes. Im hoping this sub isn't a reflection on the People of Tomorrow.

Tomorrowland,3d97b5,chastrength,3,Tue Jul 14 21:25:11 2015 UTC,"Tomorrowland crowd is awesome, but every year it gets more and more hype and more and more idiots are going to go - the same idiots you find at every festival.  Some of the questions asked are not even worth replying to, such general questions that any 5 year old could answer them. You have someone asking how to get a drink...  I think people, myself included, are getting frustrated at the constant spam in this subreddit and as a result giving sarcastic/snide remarks. Do we really need 12 threads on a packing list and 43 on viagogo/bracelet tracking - 3 weeks before the festival even starts, I understand if its a few days before... I could name 5-6 stupid topic makers off the top of my head because they spam them.  There are some good useful topics, but sadly they only last a day on the front page before 5 more viagogo topics have bumped them down."
Tomorrowland,3d97b5,Mailbox538,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:51:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't mind people asking questions, even though they've been asked a hundred times before. I enjoy helping people with questions or helping them out with small stuff. An example: I helped some people get tickets, bought some SIM cards for other folks, helping folks with other stuff... For me, thats the whole point of this reddit.  If people somehow keep asking the same questions, they do it for several reasons: they have a genuine question and/or they want to share their enthusiasm. The former implies people can't, or don't, find their way to the info they need on Tomorrowland here or elsewhere. That's, IMHO, mostly not their fault but more of an issue with the medium we're using, or rather, how the info is organised. Which in this case makes sense since Reddit is a place to discuss, not store static info.  Either way I find it inappropriate to respond negatively to any such questions."
Tomorrowland,3d97b5,oolibel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:06:55 2015 UTC,"It's your time you're wasting if you're going to answer questions on 'locker dimensions', 'shuttle bus destinations', or any other information that has its own dedicated page.  Similarly, if you want to waste time with trolls asking how to get a drink, then that's your choice and your time.  There are genuine questions, and there are lazy questions. The first is the purpose of reddit, not the latter. The latter only encourages spam, meaning those with genuine questions miss their answers because it's quickly bumped to a second page.  Anyway, i'm not going to argue over the use of reddit. Just don't see the point feeding the trolls when you have people asking 'how do i get a drink'. Feel free to feed them if you want, I just think it encourages them. I try to just answer genuine questions like ""Where is a nice place to sit down and chill?"" - things that are not on the website."

Tomorrowland,3d74xw,fumi24,2,Tue Jul 14 13:49:06 2015 UTC,"thats pretty hard, we tried to get in a bottle of water last year, but hide it in your pants or bring one of those bags with a drinking bag inside."
Tomorrowland,3d74xw,vegas4life,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:52:36 2015 UTC,do they check you pretty hard?   do they go through the entire bag?

Also, this weekend camping option is a bit confusing.. do you have to get your own camping stuff or is it the easy tent option where you just go and crash ?? I am going solo so need some advice .."
Tomorrowland,3d73zz,_firecracker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:09:44 2015 UTC,"Well I can answer this question. Secure TomorrowLand pickup is now the method of delivery for non etickets. They have them in boon for pickup at an unknown location   If your ticket includes dreamville access, There's no tent provides unless it says easy tent. You probably won't find an easy tent ticket at this point"
Tomorrowland,3d73zz,ih4ysm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:58:58 2015 UTC,Do they defo come up as easy tent on viagogo? have you seen this? I have only seen camping vs non-camping tickets listed.

Tomorrowland,3d68no,Clochie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:10:54 2015 UTC,I don't have mine still (canada) so looks like I'll be picking mine up  Question for you! Do you still get the cases they come in ? :/ I really hope so
Tomorrowland,3d68no,Brookey_,2,Mon Jul 13 21:59:37 2015 UTC,"Yea if you haven't recieved yours yet you'll have to pick your bracelet up at Tomorrowland. It sucks because they still haven't figured out a better way to assure everyone gets their bracelets (which they pay extra fees for). To answer your question about the box, you should be able to get your box too. BUT, after the festival.   Last year if I remember right, when they registered our bracelets and gave them to us they gave us a small card which allowed us to head to the will-call booths on monday (after Tomorrowland) to collect our souvenir box where the bracelet normally is placed in. Alot of people did and so did a couple friends of me but I and 2 more friends didn't. Because the night before (last night of Tomorrowland) I accidently bought 100 boozetickets instead of 100€ worth of boozetickets so we had to drink a shitton in order to consume all of the tickets, best mistake ever! So I had a hangover and had to pack everythinf which lasted terribly long so we had no time anymore and actually forgot :p"

Tomorrowland,3d7gq9,leaveittobever,3,Tue Jul 14 04:16:16 2015 UTC,"11th time, since the very first edition back in 2005. The first 2 editions I got in for free by ID&T (company that is the organisation behind Tomorrowland), since they had trouble to attract a crowd to the first ever dance festival. Camping A was on the hill in front of main stage, where you now enter when coming from dreamville. Dreamville was then called Camping B. It was not until 2010 that you could still buy tickets on the day of the event. After that aftermovie spread across social media it went bananas (onfortunately).  In the early editions you could still go easily backstage. You saw David Guetta, Armin Van Buuren, Steve Angello etc. strolling around by themselves. I remember very well when Guetta had finished his set, I was backstage and yelled at him ""Hey David, awesome set!"", ""thank you, it was awesome indeed"" he replied.  I even was ON the main stage right next to Paul Van Dyck when he was playing, pretending to be a photographer with my 50€ camera. I even managed to get the crowd to wave their hands from the left to the right. Best TML moment for me!"

Native speakers have the easiest job reading the website but you have that greenroody and erby who refuse and instead make questions like ""How do i get a drink from the middle of the crowd"", a question which a 2 year old could answer.  We could do with reviving the stupid question topic... It actually worked alright for a few days. Most people just troll the stupid questions and give them BS advice so that's fun to read.

Not worth it bro and the fact that it is dangerous with such a big crowd. Some people can panic and will cause a chain reaction (Love Parade Berlin)

No drug dogs though, that's just an everlasting myth (only 3 drug dogs in Belgium, mostly used when customs and federal police work together). The police dogs that are there are just to look out for people that get nervous seeing them, so they will frisk that person. But that's off topic and probably not what you were asking."

Tomorrowland,3d1zxx,andy86xxx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:48:13 2015 UTC,"you can always send to a near-by hotel and receive it from there, just notify the hotel, some hotel ask for charges and some refuse it, just check with a hotel"
Tomorrowland,3d1zxx,Tlvoic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:39:17 2015 UTC,"You can send it to my place if you can make yourself available to pick it up on wednesday or thursday (not later, since I'll be inside the festival obviously). I'll be staying with friends in their garden half a mile from Tomorrowland, so should be easy to pick up. Pm me if you're up for it."
Tomorrowland,3d2ubw,greenwoodryan96,2,Mon Jul 13 02:06:32 2015 UTC,What about reading the official Dreamville page?

Tomorrowland,3cywtq,andy86xxx,7,Sun Jul 12 01:14:36 2015 UTC,"11th time going here, never had any thief issues. Tomorrowland is pretty safe compared to certain other festivals. If someone enters your tent it's probably because they are too wasted to find their own (even I did it once not knowing where I actually was :D )  Just go to sleep with your phone and other valuables in your pillow cover or in your boxers right next to your balls."
Tomorrowland,3cywtq,dromedaris88,4,Sun Jul 12 14:07:39 2015 UTC,"Regardless, invest in a locker, the peace of mind is nice. There are thieves, allegedly they're adding more security this year because last year at least once a night someone would try to come in my tent with a flashlight. Just be cautious. If you don't use a locker, put all your valuables at the bottom of your sleeping bag."
Tomorrowland,3cywtq,THE_BANANA_SHOW,3,Sun Jul 12 06:18:31 2015 UTC,Valuable stuff in the locker defenitly
Tomorrowland,3cxrik,321ProteinFart,3,Sat Jul 11 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"As nerdy or whatever as they can look, I use a fanny pack at festivals. Keeps everything within reach without filling my pockets."
Tomorrowland,3cxrik,xtremeschemes,2,Sat Jul 11 19:02:10 2015 UTC,"I think a phone in your pocket is fine if you have zipped or tight pockets, for example on denim shorts the pockets tend to be quite tight so I think that's what I'll do.  You won't need to carry money around as it'll all be on your bracelet (cashless!)"
Tomorrowland,3cxrik,greenwoodryan96,2,Sat Jul 11 19:40:43 2015 UTC,Camelback or fannypack is your best bet. If you're going to just use pockets make sure they zip up for sure

Tomorrowland,3cxrik,Lyktan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:31:16 2015 UTC,I actually just bought a clear plastic pouch thing with a string for £1 (in B&M if you're from the UK and were wondering) so I'm planning on just wearing that to keep my stuff in under my top or something so it's not too visible! Great for if it rains too since your phone won't get wet. Or if you were wearing it outside your top then there's nothing stopping you putting 2 pieces of paper inside it and putting your phone or whatever between them so no one can see what's in it.
Tomorrowland,3cxrik,Jlst,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:17:09 2015 UTC,I bought one of these: http://www.amazon.com/FlipBelt-Worlds-Running-Fitness-Workout/dp/B00GT388KG  Should be able to keep your phone on you without having to worry about thieves.

Tomorrowland,3cxrik,hegelstad,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:19:34 2015 UTC,"well i dont know if its that bad but last year i didnt care about thieves and had my money,phone and gopro in my pockets (it would have been so easy for them cause my pockets werent tight,but somehow i was just lucky i guess) then after the festival i heard from a lot of friends and facebook groups that they have been stolen..especially on the campsite and in the mainstage crowd..so i just wanna be careful this time haha"
Tomorrowland,3cyy3o,greenwoodryan96,7,Sun Jul 12 01:27:35 2015 UTC,You think there would be a bar in the middle of the crowd?
Tomorrowland,3cyy3o,chastrength,3,Sun Jul 12 04:49:07 2015 UTC,"Actually, I recall there being a small bar in the middle of the crowd. It was hard to find. Now to be fair, I'm not sure if I dreamt that.. I might be wrong on this one since I don't spend much time @ main.  Anyone else remember?"
Tomorrowland,3cyy3o,oolibel,3,Sun Jul 12 07:18:06 2015 UTC,There were a few small bars in the middle of the crowd. One on each side in front of the stage (where the crash barriers divide the crowd) and at least one on each GA platform. I think they only served beer though. Not even water. And they were closed during the first few hours of the day.
Tomorrowland,3cyy3o,SebasD,2,Sun Jul 12 08:43:20 2015 UTC,"During the day it's perfectly fine, but you will regret standing in the middle when the biggest headliner(s) is playing in the evening, then the main stage will be PACKED. Don't bother going to the bar or the toilet as you will lose your friends for sure, and it will take you roughly about 15 minutes to get out of the crowd to continue your path. I've did it a couple of times thinking I would find them back, but forget it. There's no possible way of orientating in such a massive crowd.  My personal advice: stay close to the LEFT bar (when you're facing the stage), in front of the camera swingarm on the left of the stage, that's the best place to enjoy the main stage and have drinks within seconds (and to find back your friends if lost). Drink away!  Source: myself since the 1st edition (2005)"

Tomorrowland,3ctw46,maborel,-1,Sat Jul 11 12:46:57 2015 UTC,E is not MDMA. If you are lucky it contains MDMA.  I don't think they will list ALL legal things that you cannot bring.
Tomorrowland,3ctw46,djpeekz,6,Fri Jul 10 21:39:47 2015 UTC,"Idk where youre from, but in Germany, which is central Europe and a rather short drive from Boom(tomorrowland), E is clearly considered MDMA; also you will only get anything else if youre -un-lucky. For reference: German testings in 2014 found that 99,4 of all tested pills only contained 1 substance. Out of all 92,2 contained MDMA, 6,6 only had Speed, 0,7 % m-CPP and 0,1% MDE or MDA. This is party of the yearly test of the EMCDDA (europead drug admission), they test about 5million pills per year for this. out of 5 million, 92,2% only contained MDM. I have heard of other countries having worse restults, but nonetheless its not like you only get sold BS here. Sure, if you ask the shady guy in the park, you get bullshit, ask friends or meet nice people who are on and maybe ask them, surely dont buy from a guy who passes thru the festival asking to buy."
Tomorrowland,3ctw46,autowikibot,4,Sat Jul 11 00:30:43 2015 UTC,"E is not MDMA   Real E is. What people sell in pills might not be, but then they're not E pills anyway."

Tomorrowland,3cs8qy,Tobiaske,4,Fri Jul 10 10:30:02 2015 UTC,"OK, despite what most people say and what is listed on the official site, Dreamville REALLY opens at 10AM sharp, not 11AM. It's a good time to be there in the front, since that lets you set up your gear in relative peace. Nearly no one is on-site at that time, and the inflow of new people is limited by the gate checks, so that means not much discussion about room to place your tent on.  Bear in mind Dreamville opens up in stages, so you won't just be able to pick any place; most of the place is cordoned off as they release small tracts of land for you to pitch on.  Source: myself, for the past few years."
Tomorrowland,3cs8qy,oolibel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:58:36 2015 UTC,So we get a small area where we can choose from?
Tomorrowland,3cs8qy,oolibel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:02:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't call it ""choosing"". it works like this: a few Dreamville volunteers hold a long rope and gradually release new land as time passes. In the beginning not many people are waiting at those ropes - but that quickly changes as people enter Dreamville. That's exactly why being there right at the start (= you are right at the entrance when they open Dreamville) is very convenient. Pretty soon after that it gets a little more crowded and you have to be more assertive to get the space you'd like with your group.  No different from any other festival.  But no worries, there is plenty of space for everyone and once you're set up, the fun starts! And do yourself a favor and have a few beers on the ready before & while you're setting up."
Tomorrowland,3cs8qy,Dominicvw,2,Sat Jul 11 12:38:26 2015 UTC,Why can't you read your ticket or the Tomorrowland website?

Just a heads up though, it was really hot and there is not a lot of areas offering shade in the tent areas. Seriously, bring a gazebo, you will be everyones best friend."
Tomorrowland,3cqa3h,greenwoodryan96,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:09:20 2015 UTC,"The lockers are small. Good for keeping your valuables in, like passports phones and the like.

My travel partner emailed tonight about clarification on when exactly they'll show up since we're flying out Monday. She's also asked if we'll be able to pick them up at the airport on the 16th as that's when we arrive or if we'll have to go back to the airport on the 17th before getting the train to Amsterdam. Oh and if we pick up the bracelets for the bus to Paris with everything else.  Anyway, I'm sure it will all work out."

Tomorrowland,3ckf5i,odoylerulezzzz,2,Wed Jul 8 16:32:46 2015 UTC,"I also live in the US. Flying to Stockholm Monday evening. Bought a Viagogo ticket (not listed explicitly as e-ticket) and this is what came in the order confirmation:   This is NOT your Ticket, and will NOT allow you entry to Tomorrowland. In July you will receive an e-mail containing a PDF file with your ticket to Tomorrowland. You need to print this ticket and bring it with you to Tomorrowland. Buyers will receive one e-ticket per person. On the day of the event, you will need to exchange each of your printed tickets for a Bracelet at the festival’s box office located at Tomorrowland’s main entrance or Entrance 1 of Dreamville. You must bring a passport per person attending in order to exchange each ticket for each Bracelet (photocopies of passports will not be valid).   So I'm expecting sometime between now and two weekends from now there will be a more ""official"" ticket w/ TL graphics on the way to exchange at Will Call on the 24th."

You should try that and get back to us. It pisses me off a little that it's not clearer on what their process is especially with the amount of money we have invested in going to tomorrowland"

Tomorrowland,3cesms,djpeekz,2,Wed Jul 8 06:52:30 2015 UTC,"Some clues.. they occaisionally post a picture on their instagram hinting stuff. Like recently, they posted a picture of Eric Prydz saying something like 'he played such a great session last year'. Why do that if they werent bringing him back this year? Could have just posted a picture of those two clowns dimitri vegas and like mike.  Next hint - they released the line up of The Gathering, and there was one artist (I dont remember which one :( ) that when you went onto their tomorrowland.com/xxxxx page, its said  playing at stage : unannounced also at : The Gathering. will get to searching for who the DJ was and update this post if I find it.  EDIT : FOUND HIM.  For this DJ for example the page has the names of his stages : http://tomorrowland.com/artist/kenn-colt  This guy just has a time he's playing.. no stage. http://tomorrowland.com/artist/prinz  Dunno if i'm being overly optimistic but I can hope."
Tomorrowland,3cesms,leaveittobever,2,Wed Jul 8 09:15:52 2015 UTC,"Hm...I can see the clues but jumping to conclusions that one of the most prolific DJs will play on a secret stage is a bit farfetched.  As much as I would love to see Prydz, especially after releasing his new EP yesterday, I don't see him playing.  As for the other two DJs. The unannounced at the Gathering is probably a local. Prinz (Prinz -> Prydz? HL3 confirmed!!! /s) seems to be a Belgian DJ too. So if there is going to be an unannounced stage, I think it is for the local DJs.  And the Instagram pic was maybe not really thought through.  I think the marketing is really bad this year anyway. Constant rescheduling, leaks on the website, the current lineup page with this side scroll thing looks horrible."

I wouldn't recommend walking back to dreamville during the day, as it's a long walk (app. 1 km) and you will miss out on the party.  Glass is forbidden at the camping, but if you hide it well (e.g. at the bottom of your bag), the people at the entrance won't usually bother to check that deep. Also, if you enter the camping grounds at a busy moment, the chances of a thorough check are much smaller. Additionally, if there are only young people (15-16 y.o.) checking at the entrance, it get's even easier."

Tomorrowland,3cbttq,ddomino1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:02:42 2015 UTC,"I have a question that goes pretty much into this topic.  About cashless top up and all this intellipay system. I understand that for every 100€ I upload onto my bracelet, I will receive bonus pearls up to 1 beer value. So let's say I upload 1000€ onto the bracelet, so I should receive 10 free beers, am I right? Okay, that sounds pretty logical.  Now, I will spend, let's say 300€ during the festival and will get refunded 700€ (minus refund fee for 2 pearls). So I have only spent 300€ but have collected 10 free bears during the festival, at least with my logic. So is there a catch somewhere? Or they just bid on the fact that 99% people waste all the money that they upload onto the bracelet? :D (Might happen to me too though)"
Tomorrowland,3cbttq,rattledog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:25:57 2015 UTC,"You will just benefit of the ""bonus pearls"" when you spend all your money. Because they wont refund the bonus pearls at the end. :P"
Tomorrowland,3cbttq,Friedel2k,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:10:30 2015 UTC,"No-no, I didn't think I can get bonus pearls refunded. What I mean is, that in the case when I upload 1000€, I will get bonus pearls equal to 10 beers, am I right? So if I spend 300€ AND will use all my bonus pearls during the festival (as I buy 10 beers), wouldn't it work?"
Tomorrowland,3cbttq,rattledog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:49:29 2015 UTC,"You cant ""use"" the bonus pearls before you have used all others. :P So you have to spend 1000€ to buy the beer with the 20 bonus pearls you`ve gotten. Do you see the problem? :D"

My experience from the past 2 years is that it has always rained atleast 1 time during Tomorrowland.   2013 was the worst for me, they forecasted all day long rain and quite low temperatures for a mid summer day for friday but we ended up getting high as fuck temperatures and sun all day long, at the evening (approximately around 19:00) we had a huge storm which lasted for like half an hour and then the sun came back. The storm caused some small floodings though (at Tomorrowland and Dreamville).  In 2014 we had a shitload of rain a couple of days before dreamville opened it's gates followed up by amazing temperatures and sun, we had small amounts to no rain last year at weekend 1, infact I was happy we had a little bit of rain to cool down.  tl;dr -> Belgium is unpredictable, make sure you take pre-cautions, such as taking a spare pair of shoes with you, spare clothes, ... etc. You never know here, it can suddenly start raining a shit ton."

Magic.  3) But if it's really hot I'm going to drink nothing to combat the weather, that's what I'm going to do differently because I normally drink water in the hot weather - that's logical right?"

Tomorrowland,3c8e5h,Friedel2k,2,Mon Jul 6 09:09:41 2015 UTC,"I suppose there isn't any room left for another decorated outdoor stage? I don't mind the Opera stage being used once again, but I'm afraid we'll get the frame stage back too (which was less interesting imo). The Club d'Anvers / Minus stage has been used for years now and we're getting the same stage again next to the new bridge (8th pic on imgur - with all the sand).   It would be a bit disappointing to see all these stages again while tickets are getting more expensive each year. I know Tomorrowland is doing a great job at giving us probably one of the best edm festival experiences in the world, but it's TML: we just expect them to do more than the other festivals do.   That being said, the main stage already looks more 3D than last year's stage. Very detailed too. Can't wait."

Tomorrowland,3c0xic,east_village,3,Fri Jul 3 19:27:12 2015 UTC,"Use your US Sim cards and use Wi-fi. I'm from Amsterdam and I can tell you now that most places, including trains, provide free-wifi (Restaurants/bars/coffeeshops). Buy a prepaid card in Belgium with one of the bundles for Data. I know in NL you can get a 250mb or 500mb plan on a top-up card (and 5? 10? for the sim). Paris will be similar to Amsterdam in the sense that wi-fi will be often available. I'm sure you can go in-between shops without wi-fi, otherwise it'll be expensive buying Sim cards in every country. All the cheap-roaming packages I know are contract based. Until 2017 there are roaming tariffs in Europe - then they will be scrapped."
Tomorrowland,3c0xic,Mailbox538,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:46:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. So if I bought a sim card in Amsterdam then went to Paris would that Sim card still work? Or do Sim cards only function without roaming in the Country you purchased them in?
Tomorrowland,3c0xic,Mailbox538,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"Only the country for ""cheap"" rates. A Dutch Sim in Paris will work, but it will be more expensive than using a Dutch Sim in Amsterdam. I have a contract with T-mobile NL and I think I pay 3 euros (?) a day when abroad to have access to my normal data plan. I don't know how non-contract rates are for roaming.  As I said, I would say you are best to not buy a Dutch/French Sim card, and just use your US sim card and make use of the free-wifi. At Tomorrowland there isn't free wifi (that works fast) so you could buy a Belgian sim card for these few days where you won't have much wifi access.  I hope that's clear, let me know if not. It's a little confusing."
Tomorrowland,3c0xic,eBrY,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:01:41 2015 UTC,I have covered this. Never roam. Even on tmobile the 3g data roaming package is still expensive for 500mb just get a prepaid local Sim. In the rest of the world outside of us you don't need to worry about prepaid data for 15 euros u get 2 gb in the US we are used to either some of us having truely unlimited data on Tmobile or paying an arm and a leg just don't worry. At tml don't plan on selfie ING so much it's a turn off. Just enjoy! Like a Chinese food-pak  I've decided not to majorly analyze on this trip.

Other nations would need their passport (unless they're relaxed) - but they would have that anyway to enter Belgium. 2) No idea - but the last part is often the best on most stages. I would suggest you're better off missing part of the morning and not evening. That's personal and you can see the line up to decide. 3) They will most likely be busy all day except early evening. Never taken one, but I know most people arrive between 12-4 - or so it feels. 4) Sunscreen you can bring in - but I don't know the allowed bottle size. Probably 100ml like airports (?). I doubt you need spare clothes unless the forecast is rain. Could just leave a spare t-shirt in for the 3 days incase? Sunglasses you'll want, get some cheap pairs incase you drop and break (rip my ray bans 2013). I normally just put sun screen, spare sunglasses and a jacket in (i leave all week)."

It doubles protection if u dropped it from 10 feet up it would still protect and more importantly if it starts raining which is likely it'll defiantly keep the water out. I don't have pictures but it is hung around ur neck or wear like in ur pocket and then tie the sturdy cord to ur pants. This is be perfect protection and u can easily get it up to take. Quick pic and then drop it back in ur pocket or hanging on ur chest

Tomorrowland,3bocft,Ryuuken1127,10,Tue Jun 30 20:48:48 2015 UTC,"Hello friend, 4 time tomorrowlander here. It will probably my last not due to weak line up or anything, i want to do other stuff next summer, but i am sure this will be my best.  And yes i am kinda angry that Prydz and A&B are not on the line up, not making a fuss about it because if i want to see 15 names, there are probably 12 of it already there. A few good trance acts (Andrew Rayel, Ferry Corsten), some really good techno acts (kalkbrenner, richie hawtin, maceo plex, sven vath) , some good progressive sounds (Steve Angello, Arty, Kryder, Dimitri Vangelis & Wyman) and so on..  But the problem here is that the ticket/package prices went way up, considering last 4 years. I am stating this because tomorrowland has immense amount cash available, that other festivals simply DO NOT HAVE. Instead of having Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike or Hardwell show up twice during the festival, or Steve Aoki god knows how many times (3?4?), do not replicate yourselves, be a bit different.   People are not saying oh my god where is Gareth Emery, who i think is a great DJ and should be here, but hey its fine because he is not a must on every festival. But the fact that Prydz is a unique guy and booked in almost every other major festival but not here, and knowing that they have A LOT OF MONEY, i just simply cant understand why tomorrowland is playing this safe. Thats why at least in my opinion, people are kinda angry.  Other than that, great festival, my fourth and final time, first timers you will be amazed and please dont listen crap like DVBBS and stuff =)...   Just my two cents..."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,ziyanettin,6,Tue Jun 30 21:06:16 2015 UTC,FUCKING EXACTLY THIS
Tomorrowland,3bocft,boomHeadSh0t,3,Tue Jun 30 22:09:20 2015 UTC,"But the fact that Prydz is a unique guy and booked in almost every other major festival but not here, and knowing that they have A LOT OF MONEY, i just simply cant understand why tomorrowland is playing this safe.   Eric's fear of flying is well known and he's already spending time in Ibiza from mid July to late August."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,djpeekz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:56:53 2015 UTC,He tours all over though. It's not like he only does a few shows a year.
Tomorrowland,3bocft,leaveittobever,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:05:49 2015 UTC,"He minimises flying wherever possible though. Lives in LA, only toured by bus around the USA this year. He'll fly to Ibiza for the Cream residency, then up to London for SW4. These would have already been locked in well in advance (not saying TML doesn't book artists in advance either though) so he's not going to fly out of Ibiza just for one or two sets/days. If he could get there by land, it might be a different story."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,djpeekz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:52:15 2015 UTC,"He's been at Tomorrowland every year since 2012, probably during times that conflict with Ibiza residencies. So that's not the reason to why he's not coming this year."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,herro67,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:02:46 2015 UTC,"its completely normal that people expect all major headliners at a major, kinda overpriced festival, theres no reason why they shouldnt."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,HendelDendel,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:39:11 2015 UTC,"Tomorrowland is more about the experience and atmosphere. Festivals like Ultra cater for 'big names' and little added atmosphere.  I'm not complaining about Tomorrowland line up, and nor will I. If I have an issue with someone like DVBBS on mainstage I'll go explore a smaller stage - simple. There is so much talent around I can't understand people who have time to cry."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,Mailbox538,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:15:46 2015 UTC,"You do realize as any festival gets bigger, some of the djs basically sign life contracts that's not talked about publically devoted to even just 1 major festival as though it's a label or brand.   That is why it's many peoples first and last time at the festival because we realize the festival scene is indeed dying. You cannot deny it. I'm just glad I caught the very end of the wind, and right now is the best time to go. Indeed the peak will live on and it'll just get more massive. But in the sense of why we originally love festivals, is it getting any better?  Next year I will concentrate on discovering some of the up and coming festivals if at all.. With the hope that it'll bring a fresh feeling once again."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,eBrY,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"well this is one of the reasons im saying quits to tomorrowland next year. will do barcelona off-sonar week in june and ibiza at august. festivals are not making me excited anymore, lets get back to clubs, more intimacy..."

Tomorrowland,3bocft,djpeekz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:14:07 2015 UTC,"well if you like some tech sounds you wont be disappointed at amnesia or at dc10. if you are more in to edm, hit ushuaia and pacha. it does depend on your taste the lineups are already posted."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,ziyanettin,3,Wed Jul 1 10:52:16 2015 UTC,"besides the points made earlier keep in mind TL now gets to recycle their stages on 4 continents so all proceeds are pure profit. considering these high ticket prices - give us the best (take a page from Pasquale Rotella, give us atmosphere/production and a stellar lineup) - yes I'm pretty upset that my festival favs A&B / Prydz / Skrillex / Diplo / Bayer / Mat Zo aren't there but I'm not devastated as I have 2+ opportunities to get caked by the very talented Steve Aoki."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,mirajd11,2,Wed Jul 1 07:24:24 2015 UTC,"this is exactly what I mean, TL ticket prices are comparable with other top notch festivals, and pretty much all of them had a more mind blowing lineup this year"
Tomorrowland,3bocft,HendelDendel,3,Wed Jul 1 08:32:59 2015 UTC,"Not a single one of these Festivals had a nearly as good Techno Lineup.  Tomorrowland is about all Genres. (maybe except Trap, but thats not a thing in europe)"
Tomorrowland,3bocft,Stunt88,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:02:07 2015 UTC,"maybe techno is not really a major genre anymore? I know some people would like to kill me for saying this, but have you checked whats ""popular"" recently, its all about trap and future/deep house, whereas at tomorrowland we have older house artists and techno artists at the side stages and 3/4 generic bigroom all produced by maarten vorwerk at the mainstage"
Tomorrowland,3bocft,HendelDendel,3,Wed Jul 1 10:27:25 2015 UTC,"I WILL KILL YOU FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!   Joke aside, techno is not ''popular'', probably never was, god knows i dont want it to be ''popular'', but it is a big thing in europe, whole london/amsterdam/berlin nightlife and a big part of ibiza is going with techno. Even festivals, a huge festival like Awakenings Festival was all sold out, but it is not ''popular'' in US, and lets hope that it will never be. But it has a huge crowd in Europe, huge."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,ziyanettin,4,Wed Jul 1 10:58:45 2015 UTC,"It's almost the polar opposite of 'trap', which is extremely unpopular in Europe (thankfully for me!) but huge in America.   Of course you have fans of it in Europe, like you do with techno in America. It's just not big."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,Mailbox538,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:13:35 2015 UTC,"but TL pushes this brand image of being global and international why tf isn't there trap then? (personally not a fan of it but just saying)  what I am saying is... where is the prydz genre, the A&B genre, jack u genre, all artists that deliver that unique live sets experience.   not mad though, and regardless of TL being misers and unaccommodating, I can't wait to explore smaller stages and see artists I've never seen before!!! three more weeks people!!!"
Tomorrowland,3bocft,mirajd11,2,Wed Jul 1 10:38:52 2015 UTC,"I'm stoked and ready to go, but I can see where people are getting upset. To be fair, the 3 names you listed in the title are some of my absolute favorites, but I think most people are upset because they have some people playing 2,3, even 4 times. Most of them have space in their schedule."
Tomorrowland,3bocft,THE_BANANA_SHOW,2,Tue Jun 30 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"Well selling tickets a bloody stupid suggestion. We bought tickets before we even knew the line-up so obviously we wanted to go regardless of whether or not a specific act was there. Some people would simply like to see a certain act during their time there, and are maybe a little disappointed that they can't see them, but obviously there is enough to supplement the absence of a few acts.  Yes, of course we are all excited, but it's also good to try and see if maybe, just maybe you will get to see that act you were hoping for."

Tomorrowland,3bp2g5,TLJordan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:58:00 2015 UTC,"That was not the gathering, that was in the market place at Dreamville. The gathering has its own stage."
Tomorrowland,3bp2g5,Mailbox538,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:41:21 2015 UTC,I refer to the gathering as Thursday as a whole. I am aware there is a specific stage but there is so much more going on than just the one stage. Similarly I refer to Tomorrowland as more than just mainstage.
Tomorrowland,3bp2g5,eBrY,0,Wed Jul 1 11:26:16 2015 UTC,Hardly. People can buy the dreamville pass just for the gathering and zoom on out get rested and rage to the core at the perfect timing the next day for the opening. And smell like a bed of roses too! I'm not one of them though. ;)
Tomorrowland,3bo1ff,lukeb96,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:29:09 2015 UTC,You have paid several hundred euros on the festival but can't seem to spend 40 on a taxi? Come on man

Its my first time going so I don't know if taxis are going to be extortionate as they are here in the UK. But if they are 40 euro then that's much cheaper than what I assumed bad."
Tomorrowland,3bo1ff,kebirek,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:03:35 2015 UTC,"I checked online. It's about 40-50 euro one way. You could consider taking the train to the festival, and taxi back. That's what I would have done"
Tomorrowland,3bo1ff,Johny_leFok,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:31:36 2015 UTC,"I found a cheaper option for Saturday/Sunday, extra trains are available so I'm getting a train ticket for each day 11euro each, it provides a inward and outward train journey to Antwerp.

Tomorrowland,3bo1ff,transp-tomorrowland,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:53:37 2015 UTC,"I suggest looking at: http://www.tomorrowland.com/en/how-get-there  I'm looking to take a taxi, but I found this PDF (it may not be updated, but it's on Tomorrowland servers) that says that the ""Kiss and Ride"" of Dreamville (this is where a taxi would drop you), would be in P11, Rumstsestraat, Rumst.  I don't know exactly where that's it, but I know that street is here.  However, I know the shuttles that go from the train station to Dreamville leave people here. This is MUCH closer to dreamville entrance, specially if you're staying at relax rooms, cabanas, dream lodges, easy tents or any other tents that are not on the far side of Dreamville."

Thanks"
Tomorrowland,3bn9rn,tomorrrrrowland,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:15:42 2015 UTC,I suspect it will be the castle. They also show this inside the music box. I saw a picture of the stage under construction. It appears to be less wide than other years but I think it will be incredibly high.
Tomorrowland,3bn9rn,Kaszzzz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm I think it won't be as spectacular as it was past years when they go for a smaller, but higher, stage. The massive look of the crowd with the big mainstage would be gone then"
Tomorrowland,3bn9rn,Kaszzzz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:27:31 2015 UTC,It is still in a very early stage of construction so anything is possible. I agree it would be less impressive if they make it less wide. We just have to wait and see. I trust they will come with something good.
Tomorrowland,3bn9rn,Stunt88,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"Been there for the last 5 years and I liked the 2013 one best, which wasn't as wide as others, but the 3d effect of the vulcano was so impressive!  Maybe the castle follows that design."
Tomorrowland,3bn9rn,Kaszzzz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:29:07 2015 UTC,But 2013 still had 'gates' on both side. It appears this year the whole stage will fit in between the two paths.   Build pic: http://imgur.com/iUZVXRn  Promo art: http://imgur.com/cp7j1AL  I am curious if they bring some new effects to the table like the waterfalls and the working volcano last years.
Tomorrowland,3bn9rn,Tommyy0,2,Tue Jun 30 17:52:53 2015 UTC,"They just started building it, give them a week or so and you'll see that it'll be fkin huge  i just hope that its more 3d this year like in 2013"
Tomorrowland,3bn9rn,Friedel2k,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:42:56 2015 UTC,Dont worry. :) They allways start to build the center of the stage and the sides are followling a little bit later. I dont think that its gona be smaller than the last 3 years.
Tomorrowland,3bn9rn,Friedel2k,0,Tue Jun 30 18:31:32 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm I hope so! I am so excited, but I have some kind of feelin it wont be the same as the past years. That's why i am curious about the stage"

Tomorrowland,3bn9rn,greenwoodryan96,0,Tue Jun 30 18:59:49 2015 UTC,For me those stage feels not right at tomorrowland. I liked the bigger stages more
Tomorrowland,3bn9rn,Friedel2k,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:16:40 2015 UTC,I've been last year and in my opinion the stage looked amazing... Someone said that it was the biggest stage until that moment.

They thought we were crazy and then they gave us a full bottle of Gin and told us to share it with everyone as they could just go and get some more from behind the scenes. So we did.

Tomorrowland,3biq4f,Ryuuken1127,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:16:58 2015 UTC,"There are, they're priced averagely if you're looking for a few hours of wifi. It'd be cheaper to just get a sim card for the time you're there though."
Tomorrowland,3biq4f,Flupperz,2,Tue Jun 30 14:38:29 2015 UTC,this question has been posted before. best is to get a sim card at the airport when arriving
Tomorrowland,3biq4f,snowboardoli,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:42:39 2015 UTC,"so, buy in airport over buying online before? are prices comparable?"
Tomorrowland,3biq4f,eBrY,2,Mon Jun 29 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"Do your research. Unless you are buying from a carrier directly that is a value mvno and they are willing to send it to your hotel address upon arrival it most likely will be overpriced or a complete ripoff like a tourist trap before you even get there. If you don't have the freedom of being a non camper and will be locked into the festival only from start to finish, then just get at the airport. Don't worry. If you are uses to traveling you would know that even in third world countries in Asia you can get an lte Sim in 15 min at the airport. The problem with Europe is they have you register your passport. Make sure you have at least AN HOUR FROM AFTER YOU LAND TO THE SHUTTLE PICKUP TIME to assure you have enough time."
Tomorrowland,3biq4f,Mailbox538,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:07:33 2015 UTC,"A UK Sim will work in Belgium, but it will be more expensive than a Belgian sim. There are laws in EU that don't make other sim cards 'super expensive' compared to using a non european sim. You'll probably pay like 3e/day 'roaming fee' and then you can use your normal data plan. I'm Dutch and I have German/Dutch sim cards and I know when I go to another country there is a small roaming fee.  However, you would be cheaper to buy a sim of the country you plan on using the most data in - so guess that's Belgium."
Tomorrowland,3biq4f,Damnitwhathappened,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:29:36 2015 UTC,"I'm roaming with my carrier in Australia, I can use all my data services and calls for an extra $5 a day. A lot more convenient than purchasing a sim card and credit. Most travel sins I've seen charge $.20+ per mb."
Tomorrowland,3biq4f,eBrY,0,Tue Jun 30 08:54:54 2015 UTC,"Quick question about data. I plan to get a data only sim I can easily kill 2gb but at the tml grounds how great is the lte or even just 3G data? At any big gathering festival of even just 80k+ people the data just shuts down. In the states we have an advanced network but people use too much of it at once. So was everyone able to have a connection? I use VoIP and text thru data, but at the festivals only traditional calls or text thru the regular protocols go through sometimes they don't even not even emergency. Please let me know or I just rather leave my phone at the hotel."

Tomorrowland,3bin2x,Ngplayer50,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:15:15 2015 UTC,There is a cigarette stand in both dreamville and TL. Last year dreamville opened at 12 (local time) I wouldn't worry too much about where you stay just try and fe the best place possible when you get into dreamville as it is just a free for all! It is roughly a 5/10 min walk from dreamville entrance to TL entrance
Tomorrowland,3bin2x,tbeech20,3,Mon Jun 29 15:35:46 2015 UTC,5 - 10 min. did you ran? :D

Tomorrowland,3bhsxx,Damnitwhathappened,2,Mon Jun 29 09:46:22 2015 UTC,Purchased breakfast every day. Totally  worth it imo 😊
Tomorrowland,3bhsxx,Suzaru-ac,2,Mon Jun 29 10:25:03 2015 UTC,Where was the breakfast? Is it packed? Could you give me more detail :)? I'm considering buying it
Tomorrowland,3bhsxx,eBrY,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:03:32 2015 UTC,It's too late. The vouchers were all gone for these restaurants a few days ago within 24 hours. All 3 days are gone. The idea of a complete gourmet meal at a festival is still new to some festival goers. They even added extra ones and they were scooped up within minutes just like the actual event tickets. Wow it feels really an honor to come this year for the first time!
Tomorrowland,3bhsxx,Suzaru-ac,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:16:23 2015 UTC,"It's located in Dreamville. You pick what time of day to eat, so it's always a max amount of people eating there. The food is delicious, fresh baked bread, eggs, juice and so on. It's really worth getting some actual food in the morning, instead of fast food. It's great in that you get a spot where you and your friends can sit down to relax and eat in a peaceful manner. Breakfast all days are 50euro, and that's 100% worth it in my opinion."

Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,shillishelli,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:11:54 2015 UTC,"what's your opinion on where to stay? I could get a ticket online with a camping pass, but I'd also need to buy a tent and leave my stuff in the tent when I'm gone. honestly, I'm willing to bite the bullet and buy a ticket now online."
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,shillishelli,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:28:57 2015 UTC,I would stay in a tent at dreamville. A tent won't cost you much ( for 50€ you have a really good one) and if you have to you can leave it back after the festival. What's more important is to make sure the ticket is real and you get in
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,shillishelli,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:44:17 2015 UTC,"man I'm getting close, all your advice is so helpful! what do you think about staying in Antwerp so my stuff is at least safe and buying my ticket online from viagogo? I guess I won't have a wristband but it sounds like I can go to will call.  THANK YOU EVERYONE!! I can't believe this is going to happen."

Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,snuffles289,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:08:43 2015 UTC,where did he stay?
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,snuffles289,2,Mon Jun 29 15:26:25 2015 UTC,"last year I went with him to tomorrowland and we ended up booking a hotel in brussels after one night in dreamville. I believe its called Hotel Motel One Brussels. Also a warning, when we headed to the Boom train station Saturday morning, we were told there were no outbound trains that day and took a cab. There are also shuttles that travel between Brussels and the festival."
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,eBrY,2,Mon Jun 29 15:46:42 2015 UTC,What happened in that night?
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,bawss,2,Mon Jun 29 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"Nothing too bad. but it was insanely hot in the tent all day to the point where it was unbearable (showering was useless, you sweat all over again). Add that to the ashes from the main stage fireworks staining our skin, piss-filled main stage mud smell stuck on our clothes, and the dreamville showers being closed at night…we decided to pamper ourselves :) camping is a nice experience for some, especially with all the great people you meet, it just wasn't our thing. + many people got robbed that night. met a guy by the train station who had nothing but his camera left"
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,snuffles289,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:28:54 2015 UTC,"what's your opinion on staying in Antwerp? I'd really like to lock my bag up even though I'd usually prefer camping. Solo travel complicates things, especially since I'll only have a tiny bag."
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,bawss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:20:24 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what you want. The distance from Antwerp to Boom is only slightly shorter than that of Brussels to Boom. Antwerp has a train going straight to Boom, Brussels does not. Antwerp might be easier depending on what transportation you plan on using."
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,snuffles289,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:19:32 2015 UTC,"I am choosing to stay in Antwerp instead of Brussels because it's almost 2/3 closer than Brussels and there is the public bus 500 as a transit backup. They will be running that all night for tml weekend special  and lots of people are intimidated to take the bus to a festival but it's doable late at night. Yes heard lot of horror stories About camping last year. I have booked a real lovely apartment with a big living room and one of those really long group l shaped  sleep plush couches and a separate bedroom. Actually looking for 1 or 2 people to split the cost maybe. When you don't camp it solves lot of issues like hygiene, proper food and plenty of rest so you can rage to the fullest when the time comes and not feel like the walking dead for the next few days after. I have a 20 hour connecting flight to catch Monday night back to home."

Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,bawss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:40:45 2015 UTC,"they take bottle caps away inside, making it really uncomfortable and impossible to keep water with you for long, if you're taking a backpack like I did, hide a standard sized bottle cap in there somewhere that may fit the bottles (they don't check much if you go in the afternoon) last year the water bottles they sold were SPA"
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,timdopte,2,Wed Jul 1 18:04:52 2015 UTC,"You can try buying tickets online or more risky, try buying them at the festival. I have seen several people trying to sell tickets on the spot the last 2 years I've been there."
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,bawss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:18:35 2015 UTC,Do you know if they were trying to sell for way over face value?
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,Mailbox538,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:24:59 2015 UTC,some were but nothing over 50 euros over standard price.

Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,jeandepester,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:40:28 2015 UTC,"If you fancy living 30 mins away and taking taxis, and paying $1k for a ticket, you'll find something. If you don't plan on spending ~$1500 for 3 days (without food/drink) then no."
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,greenwoodryan96,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:24:33 2015 UTC,honestly I'm willing to do this. do you recommend places to stay or camp?
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,Mailbox538,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:29:41 2015 UTC,"http://www.viagogo.com/Festival-Tickets/Festivals-in-Belgium/Tomorrowland-Tickets  You can buy a camping for 100 and ticket for 750, so 850e. Last time I looked it was 850 a ticket and I didn't see camping (so assuming a 30e taxi each direction etc) I came up with $1500.  Your own risk, but at least with viagogo if it doesn't work you'll get your money back afterwards. Buy from some guy in cash and you won't get that back if scammed. As I said - your own risk."
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,jeandepester,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"so it looks like I'm going to get a ticket from Viagogo, and only go for 2 days. its expensive but it should work. I guess I go to will call and get my ticket since I have no wrisrband? It will be a scramble, but I think I'm close to committing to 2 days!"
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,thedesertfox25,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"how much better is camping do you think?  my only concern I leaving all my stuff, no tent, solo travel, might make sense to stay in Antwerp. Any thoughts?"
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,eBrY,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:18:56 2015 UTC,You can hire a tent there - at least in previous years there was tent rental. I don't remember the website...
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,thedesertfox25,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:55:28 2015 UTC,Could you find a ticket and lodging? Probably. Is it gonna cost you an arm and a leg? You better believe it. Tomorrowland is probably the most widely recognized and one of the oldest EDM festivals in Europe and the world. It's not really something most people do on a whim unless you're rolling in the dough
Tomorrowland,3bhi4m,eBrY,5,Mon Jun 29 07:11:37 2015 UTC,"one of the oldest???  We have had these ""EDM"" festivals for 25 years now.  TML is a copy of Mysteryland, that's being organised since the early '90s"

Dutch people invented this shit, there are many older festivals in the Netherlands; Thunderdome, Awakenings,...  Even in Belgium events like Laundry day and I love techno have been around for 20 years now.  TML's predeseccor Antwerp is Burning started 16 years ago.  TML didn't invent anything, they just took it to the next level."
Tomorrowland,3bjr28,elparcer0,4,Mon Jun 29 20:04:30 2015 UTC,To put out there that you would try to invade a festival where people have put their life savings as hardworking or students that have saved year round to go in is just being disrespectful. Try for next year and be well prepared. To get into Tomorrowland is a combination of luck and  even a sense of meant to be spiritually. Even if you had all the money in the world or all the stealth skill to sneak In if it's not meant to be it just isn't!
Tomorrowland,3bjr28,eBrY,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"This. I saved for a very very long time to be able to go. I don't see what the issue is with trying again next year. I mean this isn't some smaller festival where it isn't that big of a deal, it's one of the biggest in the world. Just need to try your luck at the gate from a scalper."
Tomorrowland,3bjr28,chastrength,0,Mon Jun 29 21:41:37 2015 UTC,"This isn't like I'm planning to go to Europe only to try to sneak into the festival. I merely happened to notice that the dates when I'm around coincide with the festival. I'd much rather pay and get in rather than risking going to jail. Was merely asking about how difficult it would be would I decide to do so.   Which leads me to another question: is there any way where you can buy someone's wristband off of them? Like if someone has to go to work on Monday and has to sell their sunday ""ticket"""
Tomorrowland,3bjr28,Mailbox538,0,Tue Jun 30 02:02:29 2015 UTC,"How does that make me sound like I'm trying to ""hustle""? Just because I'm wondering how difficult it is to sneak in doesn't mean I'm the type of person that profits by ruining other's festival experience. I'm more than likely going to find a legit way to go, I'm just not willing to give an arm and a leg to go to a music festival."
Tomorrowland,3bjr28,Jlst,4,Tue Jun 30 02:39:30 2015 UTC,"Really pathetic to try and sneak in. People pay decent money to support Tomorrowland, and to support the genre. Sure I listen to a lot of free music, but i also buy a lot of albums. Buying festival tickets is the same as buying albums, to support something you want more of. You can't buy anything without a bracelet, and neither would people buy for you as your money would be useless. You'd probably just get dehydrated - and good thing too. Try if you really want to, but you'd be better spending your time doing something else given the chance of you getting in and having a good time."
Tomorrowland,3bjr28,Supsoni,2,Tue Jun 30 07:48:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should try sneak in. I do, however, suggest that if Viagogo prices don't go down by the time you leave for Europe, then if you're passing by Tomorrowland on the dates you should buy a wristband off the many sellers outside of the festival. You get them at all festivals or events and I'm sure you've seen them before. There's just a small risk it might not work, but it probably will. Good luck finding a ticket and might see you in there!"
Tomorrowland,3bjr28,eBrY,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:26:50 2015 UTC,You got around 0% chances for getting a wristband for face value. And i highly doubt that you can sneak into the festival.
Tomorrowland,3bjr28,avetis94,-6,Sun Jul 5 12:08:33 2015 UTC,I've sneaked into multiple festivals before. It's easy to break in as long as they dont have multiple layers of 3m+  fencing
Tomorrowland,3bjr28,THE_BANANA_SHOW,0,Mon Jun 29 20:37:55 2015 UTC,"You make it sound like you're risking your life to sneak into a country illegally. Although the message of the festival is for everyone to unite, its just bad vibes all around to invade a celebration and I bet some of the people that do this get off on it. Surely if this was any other festival it's good but can you imagine If everybody that wants to get in actually do what you're proposing what is made to be the best celebration becomes a killing spree of trampled people because of the evident demand to get in. It's just bad vibes."

Tomorrowland,3bgw5p,Stressmove,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:29:19 2015 UTC,The bus 500 will definately be running past regular scheduled time beyond 2am the whole weekend I've done my research. I'm going alone. But there must be taxi or rideshare hire. On Sunday night after the festival I'll need a ride back up to Antwerp asap with no Delay. Was hoping to find a group to share a ride with as I want to sleep before heading up to Amsterdam for the next leg of my long Eurotrip. I also would like to see if anyone is down to share my airbnb apartment in the hip part of Antwerp close to the bus station. I don't plan to take the train its more trouble than its worth and won't run until 6 am Monday earliest. Please If anyone want to split the cost of my apt it's much appreciated prvt Msg me.

Tomorrowland,3begv1,danialdy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:12:55 2015 UTC,I wonder if this will make ordering drinks & food faster or slower <.<
Tomorrowland,3begv1,_firecracker,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:13:51 2015 UTC,I'm going to assume they sell merchandise at the festival.. anyone can correct me if I am wrong (i've never been) So how will this work with the cashless system? It says 'food and drinks & most other things'  Will pearls be accepted for EVERYTHING? Or is it still important to bring cash for someone who wants to purchase other items?
Tomorrowland,3begv1,MissMoustache,0,Mon Jun 29 14:38:55 2015 UTC,1 pearl = 2.5€  Intellipay has been charging 5 of its local currency to issue refunds so if a refund is 2 pearls it most likely means 1 pearl = 2.5€
Tomorrowland,3begv1,_firecracker,0,Sun Jun 28 18:25:14 2015 UTC,Last year one token was 2€ right ? If I remember correctly I bought a BoozeBag for 50€ and there were 25 tokens in it..   It's getting more and more expensive.. of course
Tomorrowland,3bfib9,Tommyy0,2,Sun Jun 28 19:37:22 2015 UTC,Its first come first serve They are free but lines are very long so get up very early if you want to have a shower Its a key and have it on you when you go to the festival I never heard of anyone getting mugged in Dreamville before No you cant get people into easytent dreamville you need to scan you wristband to get in past a turnstile
Tomorrowland,3bfib9,TLJordan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"No idea on the East Tents, but normal camping is just filled as people arrive, so it might be the same. Showers cost 1-2 tokens, or in the past they have, not sure if that has changed this year. You keep it on you. It might have been on a wrist back to make it easier to keep hold of, I never actually got a Locker when I went so I am unsure (it was a friend that had it).  I've heard all sorts of stories, but never actually seen anything first hand or even heard anything second hand. It's always someone told someone who told someone else etc. Not sure how much truth there are to the stories. People have been known to get in to the ET area with friends etc, but I think officially they aren't allowed and it just comes down to the security who guard the area. Or at least, that's what I read on here from people, I stayed in general camping both years."
Tomorrowland,3bfib9,ThisIsSoIrrelevant,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:50:18 2015 UTC,Everyone keeps telling me that showers @ the et's area are free tho
Tomorrowland,3bfib9,ChucklefuckBitch,2,Sun Jun 28 22:07:05 2015 UTC,They were free last year and only the female showers had gigantic lines. I showered every day and never experienced a line. In and out took less than 5 minutes.
Tomorrowland,3bfib9,ThisIsSoIrrelevant,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:43:50 2015 UTC,"Oh that's a point it might be different for ET, didn't think about that. General cost tickets, but yeah I guess ET could be free."
Tomorrowland,3bfh7p,Tobiaske,3,Sun Jun 28 19:28:22 2015 UTC,"Yes I would really advise to buy a locker. Don't leave any valuables in your tent. There were plenty thieves last year and the year before. They jump over the fences and scavenge the tents. One woke us up last year with a flashlight in his mouth, when We asked what's up  he just said ""wrong tent sorry"" and rushed away."
Tomorrowland,3bfh7p,Limp0r,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:00:36 2015 UTC,"They all do that shit, it's really annoying that there isn't more security in dreamville. I hope they do something about it this year, we caught people trying to come in our tent several times last year."

Tomorrowland,3bapak,Synthlover,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:45:46 2015 UTC,They leave a slip saying you need to collect it at your local post office.
Tomorrowland,3bapak,ohsweetsensi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:40:43 2015 UTC,They leave a note saying they tried to deliver it and will try to deliver it again. Also you can call the post office and ask them to hold it at the office and then you can pick it up from the office during business hours .
Tomorrowland,3bapak,Jabbap88,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:29:56 2015 UTC,I'm in the same situation (will most likely be at work when they deliver) - so basically if they try to deliver and can't will they just return it to your local post office to pick up? Or do you mean contact the post-office first and get them to hold it?
Tomorrowland,3bapak,The_Elementary,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:53:49 2015 UTC,"Depends of Country/Post-office.  In Belgium, they automatically hold it for around 3 days, then it gets send back to TL."
Tomorrowland,3bapak,ohsweetsensi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:45:24 2015 UTC,I'm from the US and if you contact them first they will hold it. You can wait for them to try and deliver it and then call too. Not positive how it works in other countries though :\

Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,Mailbox538,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"The only reason there is hope is because I have not heard -anywhere- of anyone getting an e-mail.  The only worry would be if they sold them all to viagogo, for extra money/easier, and viagogo will sell for even more. It is possible considering viagogo/ID&T partnership.  I'm checking the large unofficial FB group, the official FB, and reddit. Also doing a daily google search. So far heard nothing."
Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,Coocooo0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:16:14 2015 UTC,This. There is no reason for them to open the waiting list while people are buying official tickets using viagogo for +600€.
Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,oolibel,2,Mon Jul 13 11:02:06 2015 UTC,Sadly I can imagine them selling tickets to viagogo for 450e and viagogo selling to us for 600e.   Both sides make money... I'm only suspicious this year because it's 13 july now and it's the first year of the partnership. Never seen this in previous years.
Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,avetis94,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:18:59 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned before, Fairly confident I was one of the first people to register on the waiting list.. registered in a couple of minutes with a number of emails.... absolutely nothing to any of the emails from tomorrowland.  There is absolutely no reason for tomorrowland to delay the waiting list ticket allocation unless: 1. The Small amount of tickets were allocated to tomorrowland staff or their friends 2. Tickets have gone to viagogo or a deal was made with viagogo that the tickets would not be released until last minute to waiting list people to maximise viagogo sales.  Very Much Losing hope at this stage. Really looks like corrupt practise at this stage"
Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,avetis94,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:56:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's why I decided not to rely on exchange desk this year. I bought 3 tickets for Parookaville for this friday.

Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,ih4ysm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:33:30 2015 UTC,Seems to be a problem where the voucher codes are not properly sent along with the mails. Plenty of people with a voucher code that is missing.
Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,spykerrang,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:40:56 2015 UTC,A friend of mine said me that last year that link worked also without the 7 characters code... but idk if it's true.

Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,gabrypecio,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, last year this was the case: the link was open. Not this year.

Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,Bananaslug56,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:50:12 2015 UTC,I Think It's extremely worrying that no emails have been sent out. I'm fairly sure I was one of the first people to register with a combination of emails April 10th Before 3:30 GMT. Absolutely nothing.   I'm worried that tomorrowland is giving the exchange desk tickets and allocating them to the viagogo tickets that they had reserved.   It makes absolutely no sense otherwise for tomorrowland to not have released the exchange desk tickets to us.... they will release some last minute (ie tickets that havent been bought on viagogo)
Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,Bananaslug56,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"I'm loosing my hopes I've registered the same day, at 6.30 p.m. CET, so you're certainly before me"

Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,Mailbox538,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:52:21 2015 UTC,Same here and I have e-mails from 5:46 CET. Luckily I'm Dutch so it's not hard for my friends to be last minute and come with me - but for people further away it must suck with the transport because of how slow this is being.
Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,avetis94,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:03:10 2015 UTC,"Yep! I'm waiting very impatiently to see if I'm lucky enough to receive the email but it's so late, even if they were to email me, I don't know if I'd be able to sort out travel and accommodation arrangements so shortly. They don't seem to take into consideration that people who need to travel to the event need to obviously book things in advance. And they should understand that seeing as most nationalities attend. Poor planning TL! :("
Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,avetis94,2,Mon Jul 6 16:36:13 2015 UTC,I hope you get lucky and can make it! I really do feel bad for anyone who gets told (soon) they can go and then find it is too last minute and flights cost soooo much. According to that leak twitter it should be this week...
Tomorrowland,3b8cfj,avetis94,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"im really...really hoping. I have everything booked ready to go. my flight takes off July 20th.

I remember hearing that last year they went through the global journey flight luggage with dogs but all the people who made their own travel arrangements weren't automatically searched. They can't be. There are tonnes and tonnes of guys in the festival offering drugs. They charge 10€ a pill generally, and you have no real way of knowing what they are. So if you're gonna do it getting your own is probably better. If a bit more risky. Vastly more people get into the festival with drugs then are caught. All your bags are searched going in, so you'd need them on your person. I didn't take anything at tomorrowland but my friend did and he had it in a bag next to his nutsack, didn't have any issues."

It's the voucher that says E-voucher on the top left with your order number to the right of it.  The one that contains this text:  ""Upon your arrival at Brussels Airport the Global Journey Crew will welcome you at the Global Journey Desk in the luggage claim area. Make sure to bring the confirmation email, this e-voucher and your passport in order to receive your personal Global Journey Envelope. The Global Journey Envelope includes: • Personalized welcome letter • Global Journey Shuttle Bracelet"""
Tomorrowland,3b71yz,danialdy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"I see what one you mean now. For this email also, only one person in my party received it. I'm going to maybe guess because the global journey packages are usually bought for (2) people, that all vouchers, or E-tickets, will cover both of you. I don't think it would be any different than printing it out twice..."
Tomorrowland,3b71yz,danialdy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:46:30 2015 UTC,"I think you're right.  I just checked, and the Order Ref # on our original purchase is the same as the one on our E-Voucher.  Not sure why I received it and not my GF as she is the original buyer.  I still wish there was a way to call them or get into contact with them just to make sure.  I'd rather be safe than sorry ya know?"
Tomorrowland,3b71yz,THE_BANANA_SHOW,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"I understand! The whole process is kind of freaky. I have received some emails while my friend has received the rest. It's kind of weird, but I just chalk it up to the amount of emails, and vouchers etc. they are sending out in a short amount of time!  Since you can't reply to any of their emails, my only suggestion is the online contact form (which you said you have done) but I know a lot of people don't get answers back very quickly or at all that way. I wouldn't worry about it though! I think we are all dealing with the same sort of issues :)"
Tomorrowland,3b678m,eBrY,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:17:47 2015 UTC,"TL dont put on shuttles from Antwerp so you can either get a free bus (500 I think) from the bus station or a train to Boom where they have shuttle buses running from boom train station to the festival site a few miles away. We paid a few euros for the train once and the other time we didn't have to pay for some reason. I think the train home was 5 euros though. I couldn't find any buses back to Antwerp so we had to get the train back and it never ran by its scheduled time, it just seemed to go at random times when the train filled up I think!"

Tomorrowland,3azxs5,Sponge15,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:19:09 2015 UTC,"Well, the cheapest way is definitely to buy all things seperately. Although, the chances of getting tickets is very small cause you have to buy the Full Madness passes (3 days) on the regular sales (millions of people want to buy those tickets at that time so it is very risky!!). Your other option is Global Journey, it's a package with includes flights, transport between airport-hotel and hotel-tomorrowland and Full Madness passes. Those packages don't sell out immediately but after 1,5/2 weeks. It's a diffucult choice cause you pay about €250-€500 more with GJ than you should've with all things seperately."
Tomorrowland,3azxs5,tomorrrrrowland,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:03:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks was thinking that myself, if only the official website listed the prices still them we would have an idea for how much"
Tomorrowland,3azxs5,tomorrrrrowland,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:00:11 2015 UTC,"With GJ the cheapest hotel you could get was €650 +/- (Hotel Package, without flight) So I think Flight Package were like €800 or something like that."

This isnt a must but who likes their drink warm right? A nice comfortable chair! Clothes, schampoo and stuff is basic but i might aswell mention. That about sums it up :)"
Tomorrowland,3avtap,TimHortons_Eh,2,Tue Jun 23 23:23:59 2015 UTC,To add to above; spare sunglasses in case you lose yours. I only brought the one pair and was fine but my friend lost his. In the end it didn't really matter because we found so many cheap pairs about the place.  Also markers if you many to make a sign or something.  Sun cream...  A chair for the campsite if possible. And earplugs if your a light sleeper and get cranky without your beauty sleep...  You can rent mobile phone chargers so I wouldn't bother bringing any. Maybe bring a spare charger cable in case the one they give you isn't good.

Tomorrowland,3atsgp,irakleideas,2,Tue Jun 23 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"Sure.   Depends on the restaurant, B-eat is usually sold-out within the week, some other restaurants still had open spots up to the week of the festival itself (last year)."

Tomorrowland,3au1bh,rebelkids,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:11:38 2015 UTC,Showers aren't free.
Tomorrowland,3au1bh,Stunt88,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:50:06 2015 UTC,The lidl has most of what you need and it's pretty reasonable as well. It's worth queuing for the bakery in the morning too!  We were in friendship camping last year and you had to pay 1.5 tokens for the shower I think. I thought it was worth it. On the Monday morning there was nobody collecting tokens so you might get a free one before you go! Presume you must pay for showers in the greens too. You get free head and shoulders shampoo though!  We walked to the shop - probation about 20/25 min walk. Might have been worth if we did Thursday or Friday. By Saturday the cheaper alcohol was gone (I think!)
Tomorrowland,3aubpe,tomorrrrrowland,2,Tue Jun 23 15:59:20 2015 UTC,Booked for Sunday at 4pm. Really looking forward to it

Tomorrowland,3au4dc,augustobvieira,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:02:00 2015 UTC,I've never been to tml before but by my logic if you can access the easy tent area with magnificent greens then there is no way its more organsied
Tomorrowland,3au4dc,Cafif,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:23:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right. Thank you. I guess we will have to stay all the time at magnificent greens then.  Another question: would anyone happen to know if it is possible to take our easy tent sleeping bags to magnificent greens? Since we're gonna stay at magnificent greens and leave our easy tent behind, it would be easier for us to use at least the sleeping bags of the easy tent."

Tomorrowland,3auz7g,AndPatSaid,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"Hi, firstly there is a buying/selling thread. But as a tip, you might be best just to sell it for close to the full madness + dreamville price. You might need to accept a loss on the transport part (or part of it) because you won't be able to get any refund on that (potentially you could try and contact eurostar directly, not sure how it works). Good luck selling anyway and enjoy the festival - maybe see you there!"

Tomorrowland,3apx45,oolibel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:02:09 2015 UTC,If this is on an actual boat in the lakes does that mean there's only a certain time Yu can 'hop on' to it? And does that mean there will be a huge queue to jump in on the action? They play classic dance songs?that I like. Will look for videos on it.
Tomorrowland,3apx45,eBrY,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:45:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get my hopes up too high, if I was you.  The ""lakes"" aren't nearly deep enough for a real ""boat"".

As far as I'm aware viagogo are the only ""official"" third party, other than a few sponsors and stuff. Last year there were people on here who purchased third party global journey and most were scammed. Some people received bracelets and no flights, and paid 2k or so.  You might want to phone them up to figure that out. Most people here use official channels from tomorrowland and don't have knowledge of every third site"

Tomorrowland,3arbyz,eBrY,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:50:53 2015 UTC,"It's open on two sides, one is mainly for the camping crowd and the other is mainly for everyone else. The mainly camping entrance can still be accessed by everyone else though. They're both on opposite sides of the festival. One is by the mainstage and one is by the opera stage. I don't know the cardinal directions specifically.   From my experience and talking to people the camping is definitely the quickest, where there were days I'd walk right through without stopping. This was getting there around 1-2ish also. I heard the other entrance can have some long waits."
Tomorrowland,3arbyz,Flupperz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:04:41 2015 UTC,I mainly speak directions in North  south east west. Will need to go to a will call booth desk I have a Sunday single day viagogo voucher I need to exchange for my wristband.   Is that entrance on the left closer to town of boom where it looks like there is a small parking lot with that big concrete circle or do you Mean the one down by the tennis courts going up north or do you mean there an entrance on the very top south of those big patches of farmland?   I am planning on which bus to take to drop me off right at the entrance Sunday afternoon thank you! I have posted a map with  it facing north aligned directly please guide me.

Tomorrowland,3arbyz,Nabajo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:31:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That is very helpful. When you were there, were the Belgian municipal busses still stopping on the main streets or were they making detours during the festival? Just don't want to get there late and missing all the great acts even during the day. I don't know how much time to allocate to getting in. In the USA it takes nearly 3 hours from traffic jam to people jamming into the gates. But then again Europe is more efficient when it comes to that."
Tomorrowland,3arbyz,Limp0r,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:20:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure but I think that there are some detours with the festival. There still should be plenty of bus stops nearby the entrances to go to though, and depending on where you are coming from I'm sure there are dedicated Tomorrowland busses."
Tomorrowland,3arbyz,Mailbox538,0,Tue Jun 23 08:34:12 2015 UTC,"Aren't there shuttles from Antwerp to the main Entrance @ Tomorrowland, why would you take the public bus? I've camped the past years so I don't really know how the situation is at the main entrance.  If you are only there on Sunday I'd come as early as possible (before 12!!! , maybe around 11?), so you have the whole day."
Tomorrowland,3arbyz,Limp0r,0,Tue Jun 23 08:38:01 2015 UTC,The official Tomorrowland shuttles page is up but there aren't any official busses from Antwerp or are there? I can't find any information just for Brussels shuttles.

Tomorrowland,3ap1xu,eBrY,3,Mon Jun 22 09:56:56 2015 UTC,"Never been to EDC but out of all the US festivals it looks the best (Imo). I've been to Ultra and I was very disappointed. It was just a stage with names on it, nothing past that. No feeling, no atmosphere, no awesome decoration. Tomorrowland is more similar to EDC in the regard of decoration, except every tiny detail is decorated. Not just the stages, but the shops, paths, etc."

Tomorrowland,3ap1xu,Warden04,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:19:42 2015 UTC,"I have been to every EDC from 2012-2015, and I went to Tomorrowland last year. I think most people would agree with me when I say these are the two best EDM festivals in the world. The main difference I would say is that EDC is more about production and Tomorrowland is more about Music. The main stages at EDC and TL are somewhat comparable in quality, but the EDC mainstage is bigger and holds far more people. I believe around 80k people at the EDC mainstage alone, compared to 60k attendees in total for TL. Also there is a lot more people at EDC, 100-110k to 60k at TL. You'll notice it takes longer to get to different stages at TL because EDC is one giant area spread out and TL everyone has to walk down pathways to get places. I say Tomorrowland is more about music because they have a lot more DJs (300) and 17 stages compared to EDC's 7 or 8. You will see a wider variety of music and since most people there are European and a lot are from Belgium/Netherlands the people at TL are more knowledgeable about Electronic Music and all the different types. Another difference is that a ton of people at EDC, I'm guessing 65% or more are on ecstacy, where as there are lots of people on it at TL but I think more of them smoke weed/drink instead. As for vibes I felt both were amazing at both EDC and TL. Also you are going to see a shit ton of crowd surfing/boating at the TL mainstage where it doesn't happen at EDC.

Tomorrowland,3anajf,Tommyy0,2,Sun Jun 21 22:11:42 2015 UTC,"You should Always use a locker for valuables. Tomorrowland will not be held accountable for any theft.  If you're honestly worried about losing a key then I have no words... It is so easy to keep a key safe. Put it under the insole of your shoe, you won't even feel it if you have good shoes. You can also tie it to your belt strap on your shorts/trousers (if you arent in sport shorts) on a bit of string.   There are so many easy ways to keep a key safe... IF you don't want to do that then you can always risk it/carry it around all day.  Lockers might be pin coded anyway - which have got really big at festivals here in NL this year (compared to previous years)"
Tomorrowland,3anajf,Mailbox538,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:06:55 2015 UTC,I'm not worried but i'm planning on not wearing much during the festival so i have no idea where to put the key tbh pin coded lockers would be amazing
Tomorrowland,3anajf,Mailbox538,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:11:16 2015 UTC,"You're wearing shoes right? I personally recommend strongly against flip-flops/sandals...   Take the sole out the bottom of your shoe and put the key under it. IF there is a key ring, leave it in the locker so you can return it complete at the end. What i've done in previous festivals and you don't even notice it if you're in good shoes.  The bit that lifts out the bottom, no idea on the English word... The soft part. I hope you understand? Unless you lose your shoe, you can't lose the key! But as you said before, perhaps there will be pin coded or even bracelet use to unlock. But it will certainly be one of the 3   E: Insole? Apparently that's the English word"

You can pay with the chip in your bracelet, but groups can also buy an extra chip to pay with.   Yes, you still have to top this one up and as far as I know there is no simple way to transfer money from your personal chip to the ""group chip"", but it's better than only personal chips IMO.   In a perfect situation, they should make it possible to transfer money / credits from bracelet to bracelet from a mobile app or vending machine. But that's a bit unrealistic probably."

If you put the money on the bracelet with a credit/debit card, they will reimburse you after the festival. The reimbursing can take quite some time though.   The exchange rate was the same as the year before.   I can't remember how much it was, but if you put a certain amount of money on the bracelet prior to the festival you got a discount. I want to say if you put 100 USD on the bracelet, you get 110 USD worth of tokens (something like that)."

If you look at his tracklist for EDC NY, 67% of it comes from his UMF Miami set and he got through 28 tracks in an hour (not including about 12 remixes/mashups). Eric Prydz played 9."

Tomorrowland,3a7sbs,Pingom,2,Thu Jun 18 14:34:23 2015 UTC,"For the techno heads, Gary Beck is a can't miss.  I was hoping for a Drumcode stage this year, but alas it wasn't meant to be.  GB is part of Drumcode and plays a real upbeat, banging style of techno.   His tracks have some great female voice samples and he's got such a ''shuffling'' beat style of techno.  Fucking love his shit  For the Trance heads, Brian Kearney is a real rising star on the trace scene.  Mark Sherry is the king of tech trance.  He fuses techno and trance so well. I've waited for years to see him and finally get to.  For the Hardstyle fans, Coone is wicked.  Saw him once in Edmonton and he just destroyed the place.    If you want to hear some good psy-trance, you'll want to see Astral Projection and Astrix on Sunday.  Both have some pretty banging stuff and will put on a good show when the sun goes down and darkness sets in.  OP mentioned Johan Gielen , who is playing at the 90s stage.  He was the 2nd DJ I ever saw, and I definitely won't be missing his old school set.    And I know he's pretty popular, but Markus Schulz's opening  set on mainstage will be different then what you normally hear from him on his peak hour times.  He'll play a deep progressive style that will be absolutely perfect for when the crowd is starting to build up.  I like his deep prog more then I like his banging stuff, so I'll be sure to watch his 3 hour set."
Tomorrowland,3a7sbs,Stunt88,2,Fri Jun 19 01:10:11 2015 UTC,That GB tune sounds really good man. I'm Just creating my timetable now but I have a clash on Saturday between the two acts on the main stage (AVB and DV&LM) and Gary Beck's session at the Kozzmozz stage. Do think GB is worth leaving the acts and your position at the main stage for on Saturday night?
Tomorrowland,3a7sbs,eunoiax,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:19:46 2015 UTC,+1 on Mark Sherry & Bryan Kearney. Although they put Kearney up against Bonzai All-stars & Sven Vath.  But quality post! Deffo will check out Gary Beck!
Tomorrowland,3a7sbs,nedeox,2,Fri Jun 19 12:29:11 2015 UTC,My recommendations: wildstylez on q-dance and Henrik b on Mazda journey island

Tomorrowland,3a7sbs,iWonderWhyi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:18:22 2015 UTC,"Basically everyone on the Trance Addict stage, except maybe Andrew Rayel. He's more of a banger-trance type of guy.  And on the Fullon Stage I would recommend Jochen Miller, Cosmic Gate (depending on their mood) and if you're lucky Ferry Corsten. His sets in the recent year(s) were more cheesy than not. But giving the fact that he resurrected his Gouryella alias gives me hope he'll be the Trance DJ he was known and loved for."
Tomorrowland,3a7sbs,bulkley,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:26:46 2015 UTC,"Dzeko & Torres, Mike Hawkins, StadiumX, The Chainsmokers, Laidback Luke, Sander van Doorn, The prototypes, Matrix & Futurebound, Lush & Simon, San Holo, Vicetone, Didrick, Dillon Francis, Jay Cosmic, Tom Swoon, Fedde le Grand, Orjan Nilsen, Andrew Rayel and Aly & Fila are the ones I will be at."

Also, it starts at 11 at night so dont think itll draw a fullhouse sold out arena Im going to TML from Mumbai because no tomorrow-event can match up to the real one.

In some parts it says you will receive your bracelets at home at the beginning of July, whilst in other parts it says you will collect them at the airport. How do I know what to believe or what applies to me?!"
Tomorrowland,3a6ofm,physicsdood,2,Wed Jun 17 21:51:00 2015 UTC,Your bracelets get sent to the main buyer's house at the beginning of the July. You then pick up a SECOND bracelet when you're in the airport in Brussels which is your shuttle pass to and from the festival :)

Tomorrowland,3a6ofm,Eckiro,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:20:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, last year... This year they've said that they will be posting the bracelets to your house."

Tomorrowland,3a6ofm,Eckiro,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"No, I'm sure I found on the site last year that you had to pick them up from the airport when I was researching.

I don't know why everyone is saying they're not when Tomorrowland have specifically said ""This year we have decided to post the bracelets to everyone's house, including GJ who last year had to pick up their bracelets in the airport/festival.""

Tomorrowland,3a6fsc,Stunt88,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:34:33 2015 UTC,"But is also risky for her, if I get to the festival first they are just going to say the ticket is already used, no?"

Tomorrowland,3a6fsc,Jlst,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:45:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe meet up, get the bracelets and transfer her money through PayPal while you're with her? PayPal are usually good with getting your money back if you've been scammed or there's a problem."

They're quite promt with replying and they let me know that they will no longer be mailing me the bracelets (fucking waste of delivery costs) and I can pick them up at the will call desk with my ID and a printout of my eticket.

Tomorrowland,39wucz,bigbadwilson,2,Mon Jun 15 21:41:36 2015 UTC,"I never tell people ""you definitely have to catch this person"" because it's all subjective. For example,  lots of people like Carl Cox but he's really boring to me. Because I don't really like tech house that he plays. I wpuld go to as many djs as you can for 30 minutes each. Then you'll find out what you like. Then you start to learn the genre and get to know more djs who play that genre."

Steve Aoki will be closing day1, anyone can recommend me another stage that I should be? any of the others will do - I will not waste 1 minute of my time on this piece of shit.  p.s  MY RECOMMENDATION: Sunday - Andrew Rayel will be 10-11, you will ""miss"" half of david guetta's set and half of avicii, both were terrible last year."
Tomorrowland,39wucz,HapoelSmite,2,Mon Jun 15 15:00:38 2015 UTC,"Markus Schulz playing a Trance addict set will be amazing. If you've never tried out hardstyle, check out Coone!"
Tomorrowland,39wucz,Slater488,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:07:13 2015 UTC,"I think that I will check out Markus Schulz, I always heard the name but never had the chance to hear an actual track/set from him.  Coone - an hard debate, again, I always saw Headhunterz shows from Qlimax and Defqon 1 but I never been to an actual hardstyle set, it just doesn't seem something that I might enjoy without being totally wasted.  I think that schulz it is, thanks!"
Tomorrowland,39wucz,HapoelSmite,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:09:23 2015 UTC,Here is a good Markus Schulz festival set https://youtu.be/DB28iyrY-vE
Tomorrowland,39wucz,leaveittobever,2,Mon Jun 15 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the closing act being shit on the main stage. The closing act doesn't get the biggest show and it allows you to check out headliners on smaller stages. I understand what you're saying, Aoki doesn't deserve that spot (his main stage set last year was terrible) but you'll probably find a good alternative.   I'd go for the Carl Cox stage btw."
Tomorrowland,39wucz,SebasD,2,Mon Jun 15 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, I felt a complete moron last year in his set, won't do the same mistake again."
Tomorrowland,39wucz,HapoelSmite,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:45:26 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen from videos. Carl always has a nice fireworks display with his set.  To me though that's icing on the cake though. Carl's sets are always top notch. I've never once seen that man spin and thought ""Meh..."""

Tomorrowland,39wucz,HapoelSmite,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:24:20 2015 UTC,"Not sure about its accuracy, I think it's still being updated and moved around. Why? 1. Nick van de wall daybreak is 12 - 2:30, rest are 12-3. 2. Huge gaps - haven't checked if people are missing or more acts will be added 3. Sunday mainstage has 4 acts  Nice to see but I think we could see a lot of changes and moving around... Not sure tho"

Tomorrowland,39ucqp,rebelkids,2,Sun Jun 14 21:15:57 2015 UTC,"IF you have at least one other person going with you, this is how you make sure the bracelet you're buying is legit.   Give the seller cash for one bracelet, have your friend walk in and make sure his/her ticket is legit. If it wasn't, the seller wouldn't agree to let you do this. Once your friend is in, you give the seller cash for your bracelet and you walk in. Chances are that your bracelet is good."
Tomorrowland,39ucqp,bawss,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:45:06 2015 UTC,couldnt you just tell the seller to go thourgh the gates with the bracelet while youre watching him before even giving him any of your money

Tomorrowland,39qsk3,Cafif,-3,Sat Jun 13 22:43:13 2015 UTC,"hardwell is enough to represent dannic and dyro, garrix can play some spinnin record stuff aka maarten vorwerk stuff from dvbbs, so they can be removed as well, and blasterjaxx is generic bigroom as well, whereas they totally ignore the upcomming hype towards Kygo, or the fact that Jack U closed UMF this year."
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,HendelDendel,-1,Sun Jun 14 15:52:34 2015 UTC,"If you're saying that Hardwell can represent Dyro, you clearly didn't hear Dyro in the past 6 months!  He got a new label, WOLV, with a sort of NEW GENRE, he tends to call this genre ""WOLV"" as well.  You should check some tracks from this label because this is fucking awesome, Dyro is one of the most talented and maybe the most talented guy this year in Mainstage."
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,HapoelSmite,-2,Mon Jun 15 06:50:51 2015 UTC,"That's what i/we call: YOUR OPINION.  Yes i would prefer have Jack U, Diplo or Skrillex more than Dvbbs or Dyro. It's just opinions, of course i would prefer to have Kygo more than anyone. But i don't care that much, i just wan't to have fun there!  And of course it's my opinion. :)"
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,harlibu,8,Sun Jun 14 16:37:43 2015 UTC,I see no problems with the lineup this year.
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,Ryuuken1127,3,Sat Jun 13 22:50:40 2015 UTC,"Personally the only 'better' thing I could think of as an organiser (in my opinion) would be to remove one of Afro/Nick mainstage times, give daybreak or the normal slot, and give the other to someone else (Prydz did daybreak last year - I'd rather that as it's one new face, lets not debate on if he should be late with lasers!). Just would add one new face.. I know he will play 2 different styles but it's still the same guy :)"
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,Mailbox538,4,Sun Jun 14 10:02:09 2015 UTC,"Zedd, Kygo, Skrillex, Above&Beyond, Paul van Dyk, Dash Berlin, Eric Prydz, Kaskade and probably a few more that i would've hoped to see on the lineup. Definitely a first world problem, bust still slightly disappointing."
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,cfcru,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:05:40 2015 UTC,couldn't agree with you more on these DJs and sentiments!
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,adventuresofjon,2,Sun Jun 14 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"Looking back through the news page on Tomorrowlands website, the last two years they've said when the full lineup was complete but they haven't yet for this year so more announcements may be on the way. Again on the news page, a stage was added to the lineup a week before Tomorrowland started, so be patient, more may be on the way."
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,BuddhaBobby,2,Sat Jun 13 22:56:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I don't think that massive stages will be added to the line up. They're on the FB event page announcing stages like B2B and Coincidence. So there aren't gonna be more big names i think"

Tomorrowland,39qsk3,bulkley,6,Sun Jun 14 10:19:05 2015 UTC,"I'm also a bit dissapointed about the line up. Not only about the line up, but just everything. It seems like they're putting more afford in TomorrowWorld than in Tomorrowland.  I just spat water over my computer at how stupid this post is. Jesus it's getting so boring hearing people crying over a festival line up. No one is making you go and if it's so disappointing there is a buy/sell reddit thread im sure people will buy. The line up is more or less identical to previous years. IF 1-2 DJs change EVERYTHING from good to bad, you probably want to be at their shows and not a festival."
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,Slugeater69,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:34:25 2015 UTC,thank you. This is exactly what i thought.
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,Greepyrawa,3,Sun Jun 14 08:53:16 2015 UTC,I was going to write a detailed post explaining how wrong you are... Then my phone died so a -1 will suffice.
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,Mailbox538,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:18:26 2015 UTC,"Tomorrowland and Tomorrowworld have different line-ups because they're focussing on slightly different crowds. IMO, TML has more bigger acts than TMW.   Acts that aren't touring in Europe around Tomorrowland are harder to book and I doubt Skrillex is a priority for TML. Calvin Harris isn't too expensive for them btw, smaller festivals have booked him the past few years. He closed Pukkelpop last year here in Belgium but the crowd didn't really consider him as a headliner. It's probably just a matter of tour schedules and stuff like that. They booked him in the past (when he already had the same status) so I don't see why they wouldn't be able to do it again."
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,SebasD,-5,Sun Jun 14 07:04:18 2015 UTC,Theres honestly no argument against the fact that this years UMF lineup totally shits on Tomorrowland
Tomorrowland,39qsk3,HendelDendel,-3,Sun Jun 14 06:55:55 2015 UTC,"I think the Line-Up is worse in regards to last year because they missed a few huge acts in their respected genre. A few examples would be, Hardcore - Angerfist, Korsakoff; Drum 'n' Bass - Sub Focus, Sigma, or Netsky; Trance - Paul van Dyk, Paul Oakenfold; ProgHouse - Eric Prydz. Though the artists I mentioned are of course debatable. Also they unfortunately failed to get artists which became huge in the recent year. The ones OP mentioned, Odesza, Zhu, the Anjunabeats crew (namely: Andrew Bayer, Ilan Bluestone, Lane8, Fehrplay, Genix, Jason Ross). I know it's complaining on a very high level but I think they just changed their focus of artists a bit. Which is not for better or worse, I think ID&T knows their shit and knows that this line up appeals to more people than before. I'm just sad I don't get my fair share of my must-have artists, but am in the minority I guess.   Should have gone to EDC this year and TL last year. The line-ups would have been perfect for me, lol. But I was lucky enough to choose the worse (for me) each year."

Tomorrowland,39kkgk,HendelDendel,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:06:54 2015 UTC,"It is nice indeed, but I wanted to see artists i couldn't see at UMF 14 and i thought TML will help me with that, I'm just hoping they have a few more announcements to make for the lineup.   So far im planning on martin solveig, arty, alesso, nicky romero, romeo blanco, an21 and the guys i mentioned above. Still need to figure out the others - i really dont want to repeat performances i saw in UMF (even though the tracks are different and new every year, each artist has a stage energy that is different imo)"
Tomorrowland,39kkgk,likedom,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:20:27 2015 UTC,"What stages are classed as ""old school house"" ??"
Tomorrowland,39kkgk,greenwoodryan96,2,Fri Jun 12 12:56:52 2015 UTC,You can add Gareh Emery and Dash Berlin to that list too!
Tomorrowland,39kkgk,huntingwhale,2,Fri Jun 12 12:59:21 2015 UTC,"I was hoping real bad for a Drumcode stage, or at least Adam Beyer to make an appearance.  He'll never come to my city and as a huge Drumcode fan I was hoping he'd make an appearance.  Oh well, at least Gary Beck is coming!"
Tomorrowland,39kkgk,Zornimal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:05:05 2015 UTC,I know how you feel! I feel a little let down but im coming for the vibe and not just the music this time. maybe i'll explore new artists and stages this time when i dont have the ones im looking for? =)

Tomorrowland,39fwds,Stunt88,2,Thu Jun 11 21:45:25 2015 UTC,Disappointing to be honest. I hoped for a Trance stage for the last announcement (which it is I guess) but Psy is just too annoying. I know all the 'real trance'-circlejerkers love Psy but I hoped for 'normal' uplifting Trance. Also disappointed that Paul van Dyk won't be there...
Tomorrowland,39fwds,nedeox,2,Thu Jun 11 13:59:41 2015 UTC,Does this complete the full line-up then...? Still waitin for Kygo man.
Tomorrowland,39fwds,tomorrrrrowland,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, if i'm counting correctly, every day has 13 stages, which was the same as last year."
Tomorrowland,39fwds,illuvattarr,2,Thu Jun 11 15:38:47 2015 UTC,There were 15 stages each day last year. More to be announced.
Tomorrowland,39fwds,Zornimal,3,Thu Jun 11 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"Just checked the map from last year and its 15 indeed, dunno where I got 13.  So maybe some small stages will still be announced indeed, but those will be the really small ones. Defininately no names like Kygo, Skrillex, Pryda, etc.."
Tomorrowland,39fwds,illuvattarr,2,Thu Jun 11 17:44:18 2015 UTC,"Lane 8 isn't that big yet. I swear to god, I would suck cock if he would be on the line-up!!!"
Tomorrowland,39fwds,nedeox,2,Thu Jun 11 19:22:31 2015 UTC,I wonder if Lane 8 has ties to Chicago. He's always here. Even playing in a festival this weekend http://lineup.springawakeningfestival.com/?sort=alpha
Tomorrowland,39fwds,leaveittobever,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:53:15 2015 UTC,He's German. But maybe some ties with Chicago. Who knows.
Tomorrowland,39fwds,nedeox,0,Thu Jun 11 20:33:40 2015 UTC,You've given me some hope there. Aarrararrar I want Kygo! Also Skrillex has a big gap in his tour dates but yeah.. Don't think he's gonna get his own stage
Tomorrowland,39fwds,tomorrrrrowland,0,Thu Jun 11 16:49:45 2015 UTC,Pretty dissapointing then. First time going and the line-up was way better past years. Too much mainstream (Kygo is also mainstream but I fckng love him). Thought Kygo was a 100%
Tomorrowland,39fwds,tomorrrrrowland,2,Thu Jun 11 15:45:28 2015 UTC,"Im quite disappointed with the lineup to be honest. Mainstage is filled with the same generic EDM crap, except for maybe a couple DJs. Jamie Jones Paradise is a nice stage, same goes for the Bakermat one, Dave Clarke and Carl Cox will also be nice. But for me, there's really not much that stands out.  Was really hoping for a Pryda stage... :("
Tomorrowland,39fwds,illuvattarr,4,Thu Jun 11 14:41:49 2015 UTC,IM STILL HOPING FOR A PRYDA STAGE

Tomorrowland,39fwds,leaveittobever,3,Thu Jun 11 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"So because there's no Pryda stage, the lineup just sucks?"
Tomorrowland,39fwds,Ryuuken1127,3,Thu Jun 11 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"Learn to read, I didn't say that.   Plenty of good names on the lineup, just for me personally not so much as last year.  Just disappointed they keep clinging on to the same names on the mainstage and don't really innovate music-wise."

Regular Magnificent Greens   Full Madness €262,50+Magnificent Greens €72,75   IF you can even get to the ticket swap. We had 8 people trying and only 1 got through. Put all the money in 1 account and whoever (if anyone) gets through they should buy for all. You can buy 4 tickets this way (or you can buy 10 person, nothing inbetween). You need to pre-register months before, and then be online the very second store opens. If one of you are lucky, you get through.

It is possible, but I wouldn't plan on it... 4 is the limit you can buy in 1 transaction. Just be aware of this in advance so no one is left out on the day.  Obviously it might change to 6, or 5, but I don't think it will because there is no reason to. They want diversity rather than groups of 8 I guess... 4 of my usual friends can't make it because only 1/8 of us got in the shop"

Tomorrowland,39fy8w,tbeech20,2,Thu Jun 11 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"No problem :) Good luck getting tickets for you and your friends! Just make sure you are prepared with pre-registration, and being online when the sale goes out. Not much more you can do other than hope for some luck!"

A lot of people aren't willing to go last minute across the world, leaving it only to people around the area(few hundred km prob). People who can't go (Didn't get Visa? Never intended to go and just trying to make money? Injury? Work? etc) would rather get x00e than nothing.   Prices might go low, but they're still much higher than they're worth."
Tomorrowland,39i0sx,Mailbox538,2,Thu Jun 11 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"I got mine April time last year and they had come down by then to approx 40 euros more than the ticket price which I didn't mind paying. They dropped down even more again by May-June. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like that's happening this year. Maybe because there was 2 weekends last year. I'm gutted too as  I was hoping to get some through viagogo again as they sold out so quick again this year but looks like I won't be able to go as viagogos prices are just plain bonkers. The listed price is without the £127 fee on top! :O  sits in corner and cries"

Tomorrowland,39i0sx,rdorrington,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"Yep! You don't see the fee til you add it to the basket- not good! Well that's what it currently is based on the current price of the tickets. If the ticket prices go up, it will be even more, and if they go down, it will be less. But last year I think I paid around £50 fee per £320ish ticket. Plus a few extra pound for delivery- as if the booking fee wasn't enough! Not cool viagogo, not cool!"
Tomorrowland,39i0sx,Twerkforme,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:42:57 2015 UTC,It'll go down mid july maybe not by lots but for sure a couple hundred.

Tomorrowland,39c8ft,smile_today_,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:54:58 2015 UTC,"am i wrong or does live recordings not fall into the category, free for all to record and distribute ?   You are wrong. You don't own any rights to the works being performed or have permission to record and distribute the performance (there's a reason bootleg recordings are called as such). If an event/label/artist wants to enforce their rights, you don't really have any counter-claim I'm afraid."
Tomorrowland,39c8ft,djpeekz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:11:14 2015 UTC,"Please be kind and follow up your claims with references? as for permission it's right there on the TML website    Photo devices/ Cameras  Digital photo cameras and/or video cameras are allowed on the grounds with the exception of (semi) professional equipment. Our advice: make as many movies as possible and put loads onto YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Flickr, etc.!"
Tomorrowland,39c8ft,djpeekz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:45:43 2015 UTC,So what was the reason for your video's take down i.e. who made the copyright claim? It could be the artists or the label who own the rights to the work being performed.   Read this: http://concertblogger.com/2012/08/legal-issues-surrounding-recording-posting-concerts/  Copyright law differs around the world yes but this is a good introduction into how multiple copyright owners come into play and how one of various owners could object.  Just because TML say it's ok doesn't give you free reign to do anything you want.

Tomorrowland,39b1fk,btw03,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Firstly there are multiple shuttle busses for each hotel that depart in the mornings. From last year our hotel had about 3 busses that all left promptly at 12 on the Friday and then on the Saturday and Sunday the busses tend to leave about half an hour apart with the first one leaving at 12. I guess this is to account for the slow risers / hangovers.   On the way back to the hotel from the festival you'll have plenty of time to get a bus. On the Sunday last year we hung around for maybe up to an hour after the last set and there were still a ton of people getting on the bus at 1am. I assume the Friday and Saturday would be similar, although we left earlier those days because we were worried about bus times. This year I don't think we will worry at all about bus times on any of the days.   on the way home, everyone gets on the same bus initially and then that takes you out of the festival to a bus depot where you get a specific bus back to the hotel.  These times are only there to get people to get a move after the festival and get on the busses and aren't strict. It's basically scare tactics to get people to leave earlier so there isnt a massive influx of people after the festival finishes making it an absolute shit fight to get on a bus(which it kind of is anyway)."
Tomorrowland,39b1fk,leaveittobever,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:53:20 2015 UTC,The shuttle bus from Tomorrowland to Brussels will have a nonstop service for atleast an hour after the set is over
Tomorrowland,39azom,Damnitwhathappened,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:04:09 2015 UTC,"Imo I loved everything about Tomorrowland, went last year for the first time and in their 10th anniversary and was unforgettable.  I can tell you they really know how to do a great festival, putting real emphasis in the decoration.  Also, the thing that most brought my attention, was the sense of community like you pointed out, everyone is there to have fun and all for the same: to unite and enjoy that ""fairytale"". I remember myself talking to a lot of people there, from multiple countries and made some good friends there aswell. That makes us feeling like we're home and that feeling is really nice.   The moment that I most remember and cherish, was Alesso's set, the fireworks, oh man... Really awesome, never been to a great festival like Tomorrowland, it's unique and I hope you enjoy this year! (unfortunately didn't get any tickets, but we never know, where there's hope, there's life :D)"

Or if you get dropped at the main entrance just keep walking till you pass the gathering stage and it's the first camping to your left
Tomorrowland,39as0i,adityachaudhri,3,Wed Jun 10 14:08:59 2015 UTC,"Previous years: Tokens. I say previous years because there are rumours that they will incorporate the 'tokens' into your bracelet and do it digitally this year (Rather than the plastic chips)  You can buy tokens with Cash (Euros) or Card. Most major cards (Visa/Mastercard etc) are accepted, some of the more obscure ones might not be (Discover? I only know this from the Apple WWDC :D )  US Dollars are not accepted. Probably more people come from the UK than the US to tomorrowland so if there was a 'secondary' currency accepted I would expect it is pounds. Just as a tip... I've never even heard of dollars being accepted as a payment in Europe.... Have you heard of Euros being used in the US? Maybe in a Taxi... and you'll get some crap exchange rate like $100 for a 30 euro ride"

Only buying food/beer I spent like 100€ a day - no spirit mixers. I plan to take 400 as there are ways extras like souvenirs or something you forget (toothpaste haha)

I know others who do it for far less, and others who do it with far more from our group alone. Some people go back to the tent (not me) and cook dinner at 5/6/7 for a hour which can save a lot with the food prices there... Like 6-10 tokens for a small 'meal'. (12-20 euros, not snack like fries)"

There is also some live entertainment. If I wasn't able to go, I would be watching the stream at home at least... doing something random on the computer/playstation... I would have gone to a viewing party if there was one with some friends :D"
Tomorrowland,3975on,Natasha8989,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:11:48 2015 UTC,No experience with them. But they offer their service on many events. I think they will give you all the info where to pick up when you order a tent from them. Their stand is usually found around dreamville.
Tomorrowland,395hdj,HendelDendel,2,Tue Jun 9 11:51:04 2015 UTC,"Another Tomorrowland in South America only a year after the 1st edition of Tomorrowland Brazil would be a bit weird.   Their dream was to have a TML on every continent and they always say in interviews there's a lot more work and preparation necessary than we expect. There wasn't a big difference in culture with the U.S. expansion. Brazil and India have almost completely different cultures though.   Btw, they visited some locations in South Africa before TomorrowWorld was announced. I don't know why they didn't organize a festival there, but it was definitely on their list.   EDIT: Just found the a screenshot of the post about Mexico. Weird choice IMO. But it's good to see they're expanding though. If Ultra can do it, they can do it too. The only difference so far is the scale of these new festivals. Where Ultra Miami has the biggest stages, best production etc, Tomorrowland uses the same massive stages on every location. That's interesting."
Tomorrowland,395hdj,SebasD,4,Tue Jun 9 12:39:28 2015 UTC,"for me it seems like generating money out of something that became successful because it was unique, I guess thats what happens when you sellout to SFX"

I don't really rate ultra highly other than location. Then again, I'm not so much into the US style of music (trap) which puts me off a few of the acts. Ultra Europe was pretty mediocre as well... But then again the price is attractive."
Tomorrowland,395hdj,SebasD,2,Tue Jun 9 13:20:07 2015 UTC,"he didn't mean to compare UMF to Tml, he compared UMF Miami to the other UMF edition across the globes, no shots fired ;)"
Tomorrowland,395hdj,Mailbox538,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:28:56 2015 UTC,I was only comparing the size of Ultra Miami to other Ultra events (Chile/Buenos Aires/Bali/Europe/...). Tomorrowland used the same stages so far at Atlanta and Brazil.   I'm sorry if that wasn't clear! ;)
Tomorrowland,395hdj,SebasD,2,Tue Jun 9 13:32:56 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, well as I did say ""In my opinion"" :p Everyone is entitled to their own views and opinions, and it depends if you're only talking about main stage or as a festival in general. I just misunderstood :) I have not enough knowledge of music scenes outside Europe (even US is strange to me when I went!) to know where a good location would be.  I can see Tml fitting with India well, based on theme alone (and my experience of travelling that beautiful country!) - I would use it as an excuse to go back!"
Tomorrowland,395hdj,Mailbox538,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:41:37 2015 UTC,"As you've already been to India, do you think they can give the same experience there?   I thought it would be impossible to get the same experience in Brazil, but from what I've read the festival had almost the same level of detail etc. Ticket prices were also more expensive than I expected.   With Sunburn for example being a lot cheaper than Tomorrowland (I know it's a completely different concept), I'm really interested in the ticket prices for the India edition."
Tomorrowland,395hdj,ILoveTrance,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:49:35 2015 UTC,"When I was travelling india I had this feeling of ""magic"" at the scenery, landscape, colours etc. It had a similar ""wow"" factor as tomorrowland had. India is a really bright and colourful place (I also think Brazil looks it - never been tho) so I can't really say...  I also don't know how Indian music scene is and whether they would be super into it. But I can imagine the colours and feeling of tomorrowland fitting in so well with India and it would have  huge ""wow"" factor for any European travelling there for certain... But I don't know how the Indian people would view it. I can only speak for me - but I would love to go back to India because there is still so much I have not seen (it is so big!) and if tomorrowland was there I would 100% combine the two! Shame it is just a live viewing, but in the future I would love it! If you have never been to India I would recommend travelling! Truly beautiful and magical"

The whole point of a festival is to get exposed to new music, new scenes, coupled with an awesome experience, as well as your favourite DJs.

There is NO reason to be 'disapointed' or 'mad' at the line up. The line up caters for almost every genre of EDM (I think). If 1-2 DJs are the difference between happiness and sadness, then I think you should just go and see the DJs that make you happy at individual shows. I have maybe seen 30-40% of the Djs attending, so how can I know I don't like the other 60%? There is so much going on over the last 3 years I've only scratched the surface of the Tomorrowland joys.  If people are so traumatised over no Calvin Harris, I'm sure there are plenty of people in the exchange desk who would happily take their place so person X can afford to go see Calvin. (I'm not Calvin Bashing, I loved him the one time I saw him in Amsterdam 2013 - just using his name because of the example)"

Tomorrowland,38s5z3,BuddhaBobby,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:05:05 2015 UTC,At the moment Friday and Saturday have 12 and Sunday has 11.  I think that Sunday will probably have one more announcement to have 12 stages each day
Tomorrowland,38s5z3,Damnitwhathappened,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:26:47 2015 UTC,Sunday finishes earlier than the other stages so I dint think so
Tomorrowland,38s5z3,BuddhaBobby,3,Sun Jun 7 08:23:56 2015 UTC,The other years they've had the same amount of stages each day and it'd be weird to have a stage empty for a whole day.
Tomorrowland,38s5z3,Kaszzzz,3,Sun Jun 7 11:04:12 2015 UTC,"Niiice! Only doing the friday this year but woohoo!  However, it would not hurt to see a little more diversion on the main. Invite some guys we can't see everywhere. Like a Kygo, Calvin Harris, Galantis. Or some live acts like Krewella last year or Example. This year you are going to hear the same tracks sooo much, especially on sunday!"
Tomorrowland,38s5z3,Stunt88,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:21:43 2015 UTC,Krewella plays on the super you and me stage.

Tomorrowland,38s5z3,Lyktan,3,Sat Jun 6 12:57:37 2015 UTC,Is he really great for festivals? I would love seeing him during the day with a beer or something because it's not like you hype to him really.
Tomorrowland,38s5z3,Kaszzzz,3,Sat Jun 6 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I personally think he is great for an early afternoon, sunny, beer in the hand kind of moment. I dont think he can make a mainstage like this explode."

Tomorrowland,38s5z3,jeandepester,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:42:26 2015 UTC,singing along with a tape is not a live act dude
Tomorrowland,38s5z3,Kaszzzz,-2,Sat Jun 6 12:23:24 2015 UTC,Never seen Example perform live did you? But in general it would be nice to see some acts that bring more to the stage than just a USB stick.

Tomorrowland,38s5z3,HapoelSmite,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"Steve aoki - I don't like his music and above all, I hate when a DJ is focusing about the show more than the actual DJing (yeah, Dimitri vegas and like mike is the best example).  David guetta - just a gut feeling, I don't want to spend my precious Tomorrowland time on him, I was in the first hour of his set last year and was disappointed.  Otto knows - besides Million voices I don't know any tracks he got and same as david guetta, don't want to spend my time on them when I am sure I got alternatives.  Romeo Blanco is a great example for someone I won't be seeing this year as well. Last year he had a good show but it only included bangers, barely any original stuff:  http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/56728_romeo-blanco-at-mainstage-tomorrowland-weekend-2-belgium-2014-07-26.html  have a look, 3 songs that he produced and 1 remix. the rest? bangers."

Tomorrowland,38tdb2,Johny_leFok,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"-Don't worry about French, if you're going to learn anything, learn some Dutch (they speak Flemish but it's very close). Just don't be the person that demands people speak English if they don't.   -not sure what you mean by mobile internet. Wifi? Or normal cellular data? No wifi but if your phone is unlocked they sell SIM cards in the airport when you land, but good luck getting anything to work when the festival is full, it's hit or miss.   Tomorrowland has its own currency and right now one dollar is about .89 euro. Each token is about 2 euro. Cheapest beer is two tokens for a smaller cup.   Don't limit yourself to Americans, many people speak English and even where there is a language barrier, some of my best friends from Tomorrowland and I became close just drinking and sharing company."

Tomorrowland,38oevz,great_mizuti,6,Fri Jun 5 18:57:36 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on what you go to TL for. I'm going mainly for the experience. I live in Chicago and can already see most of the popular DJs on a regular basis. We have 5 festivals this summer and then add the DJs who come every week to our 5+ house music clubs and the various other house music events like the Amsterdam School of House event at a local Park a few days ago where Sunnery James and Ryan Marciano played.   I want to experience something I can't experience in Chicago which is the main stage experience at TL for a set such as DV and LM.

Tomorrowland,38oevz,illuvattarr,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:06:52 2015 UTC,"This. I'm not saying this was all part of a strategy, I'm not sure about that, but DV&LM are popular because of Tomorrowland. The popularity of the festival increased a lot a few years ago and as ""residents"" of the festival (I hate it when they talk about them like that) they got a lot of exposure too. TML puts them on the bill as headliner, gives them a hell of a show and people think they really are a big act. They played at local parties here a few months before the 2012 edition.  That being said, I do enjoy their sets. Not really because of their music,  but because of the experience. Yes, that's a bit sad and there are other acts that could get that timeslot at the main stage. But their popularity is only increasing so far so if there isn't another interesting big act clashing with them I'm going for the main stage madness."
Tomorrowland,38oevz,SebasD,3,Fri Jun 5 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"Although I dont know for sure this is a strategy, I have every reason to think so.   Tomorrowland started to grow bigger from about 2011 and on. This was also the first year dv&lm played at the festival. Conveniently, they were born in a town close to Tomorrowland and the producers were probably looking for creating a big headliner and found them in these two clowns. Then they start throwing some ghost producers at them, start giving them better slots at the festival, creating the most epic production/fireworks around their performance, promoting them via social media in every way they can and even asking everyone to vote for them in the djmag poll at the festival by using ipads AND VOILA. They now have their very own headliner.   Personally, I cant stand them and am really disappointed they get the best nighttime slots at this amazing festival.   Of course, I understand their sets are more like an experience and less about the music, which is fine. But please do realise that they are probably responsible for about 5% of it. The rest comes from the amazing production team behind Tomorrowland and their tracks."
Tomorrowland,38oevz,illuvattarr,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:38:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, without any doubt. I don't have respect for them as ""artists"" and to me they're, as dj's, nothing more than a local dj. But which other main stage headliner still produces great tracks musically and plays live? Sure, I do respect acts like Axwell more than them but the arena tour he did with SHM had almost identical sets every night for example.  Anyway, Tomorrowland isn't the festival I go for to witness groundbreaking dj sets (musically) but I completely agree. DV&LM do not really deserve their status they have and there are better acts, without any doubt. The show DV&LM gets, could be as effective with another dj."
Tomorrowland,38oevz,SebasD,2,Fri Jun 5 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true. Almost everything on the mainstage is the same kind of EDM banging electrohouse music. I really hope some differents acts will be announced for the mainstage, like Prydz, Arty, Angello."
Tomorrowland,38oevz,illuvattarr,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:41:10 2015 UTC,"Nope, they also played 2010 on the Mainstage and 2009 on another stage, when they actually played some good music https://soundcloud.com/beatster/dimitri-vegas-like-mike-live-tomorrowland-2010 https://dimitrivegasandlikemike.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/liveset-dimitri-vegas-like-mike-closing-set-tomorrowland-25072009/  Their manager is one of Tomorrowland bosses since 2008, has been with them since Tomorrowland was just one more festival, so it's not strange they're still playing and giving them more ""fame"", the both (TL and DV&LM) have become famous together"

I hope they put Aoki somewhere on Friday or Saturday (not a big fan of him too, looks like I'm rather picky) no way he's only performing on his Dim Mak stage.   I suppose it's the lack of Guetta on Sunday that makes it look so weird to me. His sets are perfect for Tomorrowland IMO. Maybe it isn't live, yes his sets feel like they're always the same but it felt these 2 hours he played were magical last year. Like a climax at the end of the weekend."
Tomorrowland,38ctzn,SebasD,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:32:50 2015 UTC,"Guetta talks half the time, Aoki always plays like 3 sets, and there will be way more main stage acts (roughly 10 a day)"

Tomorrowland,38ctzn,physicsdood,0,Wed Jun 3 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"Skrillex is playing in Canada the 19th of July and in Colorado the 30th, so that's still possible.  Diplo is playing a set at a festival in Canada the 26th (Sunday of Tomorrowland). Jack U set is still a possibility but if they are playing, it looks like it'll probably be on Friday or Saturday. DJ Snake is doing a show in Las Vegas the 25th (Saturday of Tomorrowland). Still possible - if he's on the line-up it'll be probably Friday - but less likely though.  Knife Party is playing at the same festival as Diplo, but on Friday. Makes appearance on Saturday and especially Sunday possible.    Tour schedules can be crazy though, so especially when they make use of the difference in-between timezones there's a lot possible. The schedules of these artist don't mention multiple shows on a day so far though. We'll see. I don't think Skrillex is the headliner they really want though. It looks like there's a lack of acts on the main stage on Sunday with the announcements we have now, but the with Tiësto - Hardwell - Markus Schulz it looks like Skrillex isn't the kind of act that would fit in."
Tomorrowland,38ctzn,SebasD,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:24:50 2015 UTC,"well I think there's not much hope left for any DJ I mentioned, kinda sucks tbh, they have so many similar big room artists on the mainstage :("

Tomorrowland,383oxy,jeandepester,2,Tue Jun 2 13:56:41 2015 UTC,"Complaining neighbors. Some of them were against the festival, especially against the two weekends last year.   While the majority of inhabitants of the villages around De Schorre I've talked to doesn't want the festival to stop at all, there seem to be more ""problems"" at the festival site throughout the year than with other festivals. It's not just the build up a few weeks before and after the festival, last year there was the bridge etc. On the other hand, the landscaping etc improves De Schorre as a recreational area too.   I'm not a frequent visitor of the area though so all I'm saying is rather relative. From what I've read in press articles, the neighbors who complained didn't really know what the real problem with Tomorrowland was. First it was about lack of communication of the two weekends (I understand this one tbh), then it seemed more about the sound (I remember some ridiculous measures being proposed by their lawyer) and then they wanted to move the festival to another location or just cancel both weekends...

Some of these artist have some hardstyle influences in their sets, don't they? Isn't Headhunterz a hardstyle act too? It looks like a weird combination of acts to me too, but I'm not a fan of hardstyle anyway.   Btw, isn't Jebroer the one from that Banaan track? This stage looks so weird. I do like Dillon and GTA though."
Tomorrowland,37zfk3,Johny_leFok,2,Sun May 31 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, looks like a combination of hardcore(/style) and trap(or whatever you call it).

Tomorrowland,37mb0a,janedough12,2,Thu May 28 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"A friend and I decided to do the Discover Europe option this year. It is costing us 5009 Euros. We went with the longest package which will take us to 5 cities (you get to pick 2 of the cities out of the options of Rome, England, Barcelona and Berlin, the 3 set cities were Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels) and spend 21 days traveling. We went with the Bronze hotel option and a Relax Room in Dreamville.  It would definitely be cheaper to organise the trip yourself. We wanted the experience of having Tomorrowlanders around us throughout the trip and honestly couldn't be bothered planning the whole thing on our own so we spent the extra money."
Tomorrowland,37mb0a,portladelphia,1 point,Sun May 31 06:30:41 2015 UTC,Beautiful thank you! This is the exact kind of thing I was looking for was hands on. Planning might be a bit cheaper but music has played such a major part in our relationship so we definitely want the full Tomorrowland experience even if it's a bit more expensive :) the longest package was the exact one I was looking at so I really really appreciate the info!
Tomorrowland,37lqfv,kebirek,3,Thu May 28 15:22:59 2015 UTC,"No they definitely won't be there sadly, Paavo replied to a tweet asking the same question again only about TML Brazil and He replied that because TL won't let A&B do their own show (with typing messages on the screen, long sets etc) that they won't be appearing at any TL shows this year!   EDIT: This is the tweet- https://twitter.com/paavo_s/status/562390192674603008"
Tomorrowland,37lqfv,offcode,3,Thu May 28 16:18:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm. While I do get why Tomorrowland doesn't allow acts to bring their own production, it's a shame we have to miss some great artists because of this.   They should find a way to blend these shows into their concept. ID&T is working at the Electric Zoo transformation and it looks like they're trying to add some of the elements that make Tomorrowland successful (stage designs, emphasis on the experience etc). I've read there's going to be a live stage too. If they manage to have a highly decorated stage that doesn't look odd with the stage set ups from acts themselves, they might try this at their other events too.   The Opera stage last year was perfect for this kind of acts IMO. It was themed as a stage, so why wouldn't they let acts use their  own production on it?"
Tomorrowland,37lqfv,SebasD,3,Thu May 28 17:16:06 2015 UTC,"It's sad, I think they lose some of the best acts.   It doesn't have to be huge, but minor modifications (like the typing messages offcode pointed out) could be done."
Tomorrowland,37lqfv,nedeox,2,Thu May 28 19:27:24 2015 UTC,"Oh god. I dreaded they won't come. This is really sad for me since I am a huuuuge fan of A&B. But I was wondering, what exactly isn't possible to integrate into TL? Because in 2012 they had their Group Therapy stage, with their messages up and running. But maybe they are too big now and anything smaller than the Mainstage would put security at risk.  And I don't get why the messages (if it is only this) can't be displayed on the screen on the Mainstage?  Also, I think it's a bit unfair towards TL because the last two years they played at EDC Las Vegas and could do their messages, but the screens were largely blocked by the decoration and only the first line was readable..."
Tomorrowland,37lqfv,jeandepester,-1,Fri May 29 08:08:21 2015 UTC,"Why would they change their concept?  To sell more tickets?  If you want live acts, go somewhere else."
Tomorrowland,37lqfv,SebasD,2,Thu May 28 17:35:16 2015 UTC,"I never said they have to change their concept. It's almost perfect now. But a live stage could add more variation to the line-up. If you take a look at the requests people are making, there are a lot of acts that tour with their own production. Tomorrowland doesn't have to change anything, they probably offer the best dance festival experience that's out there. But if they find the perfect way to let these acts perform at their festival, why not? I'm not complaining here, I'm not the one who wants A&B, Deadmau5, Chemical Brothers... It's just an idea."
Tomorrowland,37lqfv,Greepyrawa,0,Thu May 28 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of Ultra 2014. When they played one of the last sets on saturday.

Unless they were going to play on the I Love 90's stage. I'm not gonna miss them.  Above & Beyond has always been about the feels. But when they started out, they actually had some kick to their productions along with groovy melodies.  Now this whole Sun & Moon, We're All We Need, Group Therapy sound is just...boring. And I think they're hiding the laziness in their productions by having an over-the-top feelz moment with the crowd.  Do they belong at Tomorrowland? Yes. They bring a very large amount of positivity which I love. But I just wish they spent as much time on their productions instead of telling the crowd what they want to hear.  However, I will say this. Their remix of the new Jean Michele-Jarre & Tangerine Dream track is AWESOME. If I start hearing more of that from A&B, then I'd join in the chorus of getting them to Tomorrowland.  But for now, they won't be missed by me."

We arranged our own flights (from California) to travel other places-- ultimately flying back from Paris. Flights were roughly another $1650.00 per person for non stop flights from LA>AMSTERDAM; PARIS> LA. I'm sure prices vary depending on date of booking and departure location (I booked the flights earlier this month). Hope this helps."

They have a few trains that go back to Antwerp after the festival every night. This is what I did last year. Not sure when the tickets will go on sale, but you can buy them ahead and they cost €9 round trip."
Tomorrowland,37fte8,HeyImNathanB,1 point,Wed May 27 15:31:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you're from, but Taxi's aren't really very cheap in Belgium; I would reccomend alternate forms of public transport. For this reason, Antwerp would be superior than Brussels for you to stay in. Even if a room was 50-60e more a night in Antwerp, it'll still be cheaper than taxi's from Brussels.   Can't recommend a service because I'm not from Antwerp, but they shouldn't be hard to find. Pre-booking didn't really work in my experience... it ends up just being first come first served. People will just say they are you to the taxi driver and get in it (if he even asks)."
Tomorrowland,37fte8,Mailbox538,1 point,Wed May 27 17:02:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info; pre-booking does sound like it might be a bit of a mission - when you took the train last year, was it definitely running till late?  I'm looking at http://www.belgianrail.be/ and it suggests that the last train leaving Boom Tuinwijk (the stop google maps says is nearest tomorrowland) leaves at 23:44. And while I'm happy to leave 30 mins or so earlier to beat the rush, considering it ends at 0100 each night, leaving at 2300 ish seems way too early.  The alternative seems to be the public bus 500. Does anyone know if this has a crazy queue for busses when you leave the festival? Also, google says it's about 30 mins from Antwerp Central to the stop near tomorrowland. Does anyone have personal experience of how long it would actually take during the festival? (In that I imagine traffic coming in might actually be pretty bad)  Thanks!"

Spartacus Run (an obstacle run at De Schorre) was held there a few weeks ago and there was still some grass missing at the main stage hill.   I don't know when they started the build up last year, but they have an extra week now because they're back to one weekend too. Two months in advance seems a bit extreme, even for Tomorrowland. Where did you find the image?  EDIT: This picture was made last week. Didn't they start the build up earlier last year because of the new bridge too?"

Tomorrowland,36f05v,TLJordan,1 point,Mon May 18 22:04:52 2015 UTC,Naah the people that I know live in Boom :D (The village where the festival is).  So no-one outside that village had received it yet?
Tomorrowland,36f05v,Johny_leFok,1 point,Tue May 19 08:45:46 2015 UTC,... We only have a paper ticket ...  http://www.reddit.com/r/Tomorrowland/comments/2zt3tu/ready_for_the_madness/
Tomorrowland,36f05v,Johny_leFok,1 point,Tue May 19 10:44:50 2015 UTC,I don't even have that one lol :D Only have the confirmation mail :s
Tomorrowland,36f05v,TLJordan,1 point,Tue May 19 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"The people you know were probably too late for the discounted tickets and bought tickets via the ""ticket-garantie"", these are just like normal tickets bought during the BE or international sale. So they will have the bracelet and case send to their home just like all the others.  This will probably be during the last weeks of June or the first week of July."
Tomorrowland,36f05v,TLJordan,1 point,Tue May 19 16:40:09 2015 UTC,the people who live in Boom have not received there wrist bands.. They have only received a paper ticket. I know people who live in Boom and all them say they have no got there bracelet yet and they got told its beginning of July as well :)
Tomorrowland,36dji1,SebasD,2,Mon May 18 15:10:21 2015 UTC,"Well, they're going to get Bakermat a bigger stage if Oliver Heldens plays there... I was expecting him to perform at the main stage (which is still possible though)."
Tomorrowland,36dji1,Greepyrawa,-1,Mon May 18 15:11:24 2015 UTC,"omg. Just because oliver heldens plays at a stage, doesnt mean the stage becomes bigger. Oliver heldens aint thag big/good."
Tomorrowland,36dji1,Dumdumdam,3,Mon May 18 15:42:30 2015 UTC,"Well, he performed at the main stage at Ultra and almost every track he releases becomes a hit. There are even lesser known artists playing at the main stage. I don't see why he wouldn't be considered ""big"" at all. Sure, he isn't headliner material. But he's really popular now.   Being ""good"" or not doesn't really matter here. IMO Krewella isn't good at all (that's just an opinion and I respect the fans though), but they performed at the main stage last year and they entertained the crowd like they had to. I'm sure Oliver Heldens is big enough to entertain a bigger crowd than the small Bakermat & Friends stage could handle last year."
Tomorrowland,36dji1,Greepyrawa,-1,Mon May 18 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"He is populair. Not big/good(opinion). Tchami made future house, Oliver heldens just road along with it. He becomes populair, because the whole house scene needs something new. But just like dubstep, it will die. The main music genre's like techno, house, trance, will keep on going. So dont say Oliver heldens is big, because he is playing a mainstage show at ultra or tomorrowland brazil. Artists like Armin van buuren, Carl cox, Marco corola or all the members of the Swedish House mafia are big. Not some dude that comes allong and thinks that he reinvented the EM scene.   Oliver heldens may entertain a big audience, but at tomorrowland the big audience knows what artist's are great and which are populair. Only the big artist's play on the mainstage, the populair just play on a stage. It's as easy as that.   And oke, i agree, the line up for this stage need's a big stage than that small mirror stage from last year. And he probably will (im guessing the opera or the big mirror stage, where the Qdance was).  But never say a stage becomes bigger, because one artist who is populair, play's on that stage. Because that's just brainless mainstream shit you're saying than."
Tomorrowland,36dji1,Dumdumdam,2,Mon May 18 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"Because that's just brainless mainstream shit you're saying than.   Wow man, have you read my posts? I'm not trying to defend Oliver Heldens. I'm just saying that he's a popular act, so they'll probably have to look for a bigger stage for Bakermat & Friends than the tiny tent.   There's a lot of ""brainless mainstream shit"" in your post though:   Popular acts do get better spots at Tomorrowland, at allmost every mainstream festival. The majority of the audience goes there for the main stage and stages with similar music, so I don't see why you're bringing that argument up.  Typical ""Tchami is the shit, Oliver Heldens is shit""-comment, while I was just talking about the success of an artist so far - not his quality.   You could've just read my comment from the beginning, without acting like this though."
Tomorrowland,36dji1,Johny_leFok,1 point,Tue May 19 06:11:10 2015 UTC,"the big mirror stage, where the Qdance was   At the TML-Brasil stream they called it the ""Frame-stage"" ;)"
Tomorrowland,36dji1,hullaboluu,3,Mon May 18 22:43:27 2015 UTC,He certainly deserves a bigger stage than the small tent with the mirrors last year though.
Tomorrowland,36dji1,jeefke,2,Mon May 18 16:40:20 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, I think his productions need a lot more diversity to be interesting. But have you been at this stage last year? It was really small."

Tomorrowland,36dji1,Slater488,2,Tue May 19 04:40:50 2015 UTC,Surprised not to have seen Kygo announced yet. Would expect to see Kygo and Thomas Jack on same stage.
Tomorrowland,36dji1,Greepyrawa,2,Mon May 18 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"If he plays, I imagine he would be on main stage like he was for Tomorrowworld last year."
Tomorrowland,36dji1,ManLJ,0,Mon May 18 16:30:05 2015 UTC,kygo is just populair. Hasn't been in te scene long enough too get his own stage at tomorrowland.
Tomorrowland,36dji1,Greepyrawa,1 point,Mon May 18 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"I don't mean he should have his own stage, just surprised not to see him playing the same stage as Thomas Jack.  He played the blue flame stage last year (same as Oliver Heldens) and it was absolutely rammed - you couldn't get in!"
Tomorrowland,36dji1,Ryuuken1127,1 point,Mon May 18 15:52:17 2015 UTC,"My bad, read that wrong! Yea, he would be a perfect fit for this stage!"
Tomorrowland,36dji1,Greepyrawa,2,Mon May 18 22:33:36 2015 UTC,Klingande is superb
