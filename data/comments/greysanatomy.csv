greysanatomy,3e46sy,Jose_Monteverde,8,Tue Jul 21 20:43:15 2015 UTC,Maybe it's just a matter of personal opinion - I loved Cristina right from the get go. She did things along the way that I didn't love or agree with but she remains one of my favorites.
greysanatomy,3e46sy,caitlinjr,3,Tue Jul 21 21:05:45 2015 UTC,She was always likable to me... If you don't like her now maybe you will in season 7 or 8.

But I can't imagine there being a better way for George to leave the show, like he did something that really reflects who he is as a character. Honestly, I loved George a lot as a character, and I never found him whiny or annoying. I think having him on the later seasons would have helped out sooooo much, like it would have been 10x better (remember I love George though)"
greysanatomy,3dolop,cindycane,8,Sat Jul 18 01:46:15 2015 UTC,"I cried every time someone died, including George.  I'm sorry though, I wouldn't have shed a tear if Izzie had died.  She was once one my favorite characters until she did the ""George is my penis fish"" deal.  Nothing would suit her but to have him.   A lot of people seem to want her back, but I don't want to see her destroy someone's relationship only to walk away once she gets what she wants."

(She was already watching current episodes). I pretty much just walked up and said 'George?!'  A non Greys coworker asked what was up...and as I was describing the episode I got emotional and literally had to walk away.   Anytime I want to cry and Nicholas Sparks won't do it for me...I watch that episode. I ended up being roomies with the Greys coworker and we started watched it from the beginning...when we got to that episode it was pretty much bedtime...but I told her that I didn't care if she went to bed, I was watching the next episode because I couldn't deal with having those emotions the next day."

greysanatomy,3dolop,Sraniale,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:58:38 2015 UTC,This was stupid. I am rewatching and was just about to make a post about this. They should have sent George to the army so they could have brought him back later as a kick ass trauma surgeon. But instead they just kill him off as a random john doe.
greysanatomy,3dmr6m,_jessucka,14,Fri Jul 17 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"It got way, waaaay too serious. One of the best things about Grey's was always that it didn't take itself too seriously, that it lightened moments with humor and human moments. I still watch, because over a cliff and all that, but it's definitely lacking something from the earlier seasons."
greysanatomy,3dmr6m,stunningmonochrome,13,Fri Jul 17 15:56:31 2015 UTC,We need some more 30 second dance parties
greysanatomy,3dmr6m,alana1999,5,Fri Jul 17 16:17:55 2015 UTC,Yes PLEASE.
greysanatomy,3dmr6m,stunningmonochrome,6,Fri Jul 17 16:21:14 2015 UTC,"Good point. I also loved the dynamic between Christina/Meredith/Derek. They were all hilarious with one another and that's been lost. I think the only one who has remained really great is Alex TBH. His character developed really well, but I hate his gf Jo for some reason. Actually I hate the 5 from her intern/resident group on the whole."
greysanatomy,3dmr6m,power_thirst_,9,Fri Jul 17 18:05:13 2015 UTC,My unpopular opinion is that the show has matured in recent seasons. It has its ridiculous moments but I love the raw emotion they show for characters nowadays. I'm very happy with the show from start to current.
greysanatomy,3dmr6m,Sobrikett,4,Fri Jul 17 18:50:34 2015 UTC,No spoilers actually... but S11 was the most emotional for me.  I cried during several episodes and honestly hope for a little more happiness in S12.  Alex has always been one of my favorite characters.  It's always been apparent to me that he is just a big old teddy bear with holes in him where the love seeps out.. whether he wants it to or not.
greysanatomy,3dmr6m,TheGodOfThings17,2,Sat Jul 18 01:30:44 2015 UTC,Aww! Well I plan to stick with it so thanks for giving me something to look forward to!
greysanatomy,3dmr6m,evergleam498,2,Sat Jul 18 01:38:56 2015 UTC,"It resembles a real hospital to me.  It would be so unrealistic if the same people have been in the hospital for 10+ years.  They need new interns coming in, they need to show the ages change.  BC of this I don't think the show ever needs to end.  Or if Ellen Pompeo leaves, change the name and make a spin-off. I want to know whats happening at the Seattle Hospital for ever lol."
greysanatomy,3dmr6m,Sraniale,3,Sat Jul 18 15:12:00 2015 UTC,I think grey's jumped the shark ages ago.

Even young Ellis and young Richard could have their own spin-off dealing with their experiences as young residents.
greysanatomy,3djplk,Jmark03,17,Thu Jul 16 21:17:32 2015 UTC,"Young Richard and Ellis could be so compelling. In their flashback episode (where they studied early AIDS cases) we saw how they experienced residency as a highly ambitious black man and a highly ambitious woman in this older very white-man-controlled era of American medicine. Plus, their love affair, child Meredith, young Estelle and young Thatcher. There's a lot there to explore."
greysanatomy,3djplk,PSBJtotallyboss,12,Thu Jul 16 22:07:18 2015 UTC,I think richards wife is Adele
greysanatomy,3djplk,charmedfrangipani,8,Fri Jul 17 04:04:10 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Cristina in Switzerland! But to be honest, I never liked Shane Ross and would not enjoy watching him follow her around like a puppy.  I know everyone has their issues, but he just creeped me out."
greysanatomy,3djplk,mremaids,7,Fri Jul 17 04:29:29 2015 UTC,"Cristina in Switzerland, without Ross.  How Izzie started a clinic after her departure from Seattle Grace. George didn't die. He's in the army, and is an awesome trauma surgeon. He might meet up with April."
greysanatomy,3dhdza,rHOWL,18,Thu Jul 16 07:56:48 2015 UTC,April stopped being as incredibly annoying at some point (post wedding to Jackson I think).  When I watch reruns with April they're seriously horrible. She's unbearably annoying.
greysanatomy,3dhdza,glaceauglaceau,4,Thu Jul 16 11:19:54 2015 UTC,April improved a lot after the boards when Owen brought her back. I also feel as though the Actor played her perfectly!!
greysanatomy,3dhdza,alana1999,2,Thu Jul 16 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"I have to agree now when I think back. I was extremely annoyed with April during their boards, and how she handled the situation with Jackson."
greysanatomy,3dhdza,ShuShuBee,6,Thu Jul 16 15:08:22 2015 UTC,I feel like April did a complete 180 in the latest season. I loved her before with Jackson and wanting to have baby. Now I think she's become a whole new person.
greysanatomy,3dhdza,oomps62,17,Thu Jul 16 21:34:57 2015 UTC,Season 9-10 Bailey. Overall became a pretty weak character who didn't act like herself at all.
greysanatomy,3dhdza,bebert,4,Thu Jul 16 15:48:55 2015 UTC,Totally. One of my favorite character became weak. I was disappointed.
greysanatomy,3dhdza,shadowban_,4,Thu Jul 16 17:45:05 2015 UTC,Completely agree. She was so strong but after the incident she fell apart and is just starting to get it back in season 11. But I believe The Nazi is gone
greysanatomy,3dhdza,stunningmonochrome,5,Thu Jul 16 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"Middle of Season 10 to Season 11 - Meredith Grey  I wasn't all that fond of her in the beginning but after Cristina set her striaght about losing her goals career wise and not letting Derek be the sun she, gained points in my book. She realized she is extraordinary and she should shine  Edit: woah I never even noticed because I have friends who spell their name like that. My bad. Thanks for pointing it out hangs head in shame"
greysanatomy,3dhdza,Sobrikett,7,Thu Jul 16 08:03:23 2015 UTC,I swear this sub is the only place I've ever seen people spell Derek as Derrick. And seems everyone spells Cristina as Christina¿?

Private Practice does take a bit to get sucked into, but after you hit that point it's fantastic- and it does SO much to make the Amelia character so great. I feel like Private Practice is the best way to give Addison a fair goodbye, and give a great prologue to Amelia as we know her in the Grey's world."

That, and what ghost is she going to have sex with next?"
greysanatomy,3d47kc,Sobrikett,2,Sat Jul 18 02:13:50 2015 UTC,I kinda liked her before the whole thing with Denny. shrug

greysanatomy,3d47kc,catword,2,Wed Jul 15 00:36:00 2015 UTC,After that her character was put on the back burner developmental wise.
greysanatomy,3d47kc,rHOWL,3,Thu Jul 16 07:26:48 2015 UTC,Low chance but i guess there's still a chance she could comeback for an episode or two like Burke did
greysanatomy,3d47kc,Redditerino77,4,Wed Jul 15 21:19:20 2015 UTC,I would love for her to come back for a short arc to throw a wrench in Jo and Alexs relationship.

greysanatomy,3d47kc,eltytan,2,Thu Jul 16 10:27:05 2015 UTC,I could see this. The fertility clinic could have contacted her (or Alex) to let them know the embryo's were set to expire and then there is a whole what to do series of episodes. I could see it happening right around the time Alex and Jo are supposed to get married. Don't even need to bring Izzy back to create the storyline about the embryo's.

Bailey going back to being the nazi instead of the blithering, whimpering idiot she's become. Maybe then she'd be a great chief.  Meredith making a medical breakthrough; we've waited long enough. How awesome would it be if she finally got a Harper Avery?  Cristina/Izzie/Addie cameo? I've literally dreamt of Izzie coming back; just to get some closure at least.  A definite calzona comeback or having the both of them move on for good.  Alex proposing to Jo?"
greysanatomy,3cxyua,DarcyFinch,4,Sat Jul 11 20:51:10 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more with all of this!! Although I do love flashbacks but I'd love to see more with Cristina. Calzona either need to get back once and for all or completely call it quits. How on Earth could I have forgotten about Jolex!! Really looking forward to seeing how their loft turns out.
greysanatomy,3cxyua,DarcyFinch,2,Sat Jul 11 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"Oh don't get me wrong, I loved the flashbacks at first; but when they began wasting an entire episode with scenes we've already seen before and ""The carousel never stops turning"" ad infinitum it gets a little bit sad really."
greysanatomy,3cxyua,Mr_jon3s,2,Sun Jul 12 09:05:34 2015 UTC,"That's one thing that is starting to annoy me about Greys, the carousel...."
greysanatomy,3cxyua,tigert07,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:03:32 2015 UTC,I quit the show at the end of season 8 and just restarted the series when season 11 came on netflix from season 9. Flashbacks suck for binge watching.
greysanatomy,3cxyua,BraveLittleToastGirl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:44:18 2015 UTC,I love the flash backs to like earlier episode not so much to Meredith youth.
greysanatomy,3cxyua,drh0usemd,3,Tue Jul 14 16:25:07 2015 UTC,I think we're gonna see something about Christina finally winning a Harper Avery.
greysanatomy,3cxyua,WolfVamp826,3,Sun Jul 12 01:56:27 2015 UTC,"I really hope so, especially after a whole episode when we really thought she was going to win it! She 100% deserves one."
greysanatomy,3cxyua,TheGodOfThings17,4,Sun Jul 12 18:04:04 2015 UTC,Any ideas on what the timeline will be? Basically when season 11 ended it was Spring of 2016 in Grey's world. How is that going to be worked out when season 12 starts up again in Fall of 2015 real world time?
greysanatomy,3cxyua,Firecrotch2014,2,Mon Jul 13 04:51:03 2015 UTC,That is a good point actually. Personally I wish they hadn't jumped ahead as it made it fell so rushed and unorganized!!
greysanatomy,3ct18n,aides_free92,23,Fri Jul 10 15:18:04 2015 UTC,it was Peyton from One Tree Hill
greysanatomy,3ct18n,TheGodOfThings17,9,Fri Jul 10 15:41:07 2015 UTC,ah no wonder why everyone liked her.  I never saw one tree hill but I know how it is to see an actor you like from one show in another show.  You are almost forced to like that character even if theyre awful in the part! lol   For me its Alyssa Milano.  I loved her in Who's the Boss and Charmed so anything else she does I usually try to watch and enjoy. Though most of that is attributed to her acting skills.  I think she is a versatile actress who does well in any role.
greysanatomy,3ct18n,Firecrotch2014,2,Fri Jul 10 21:43:58 2015 UTC,"In real life, she is also married to the actor who played Denny."
greysanatomy,3ct18n,TheGodOfThings17,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:26:33 2015 UTC,Oh thats interesting.    Wait alyssa milano is?  Or the girl who played lauren?
greysanatomy,3ct18n,Firecrotch2014,3,Sat Jul 11 09:29:57 2015 UTC,"Girl who played Lauren, sorry. I see what you mean, I like Aria's mom in Pretty Little Liars bc its Piper from Charmed."
greysanatomy,3ct18n,TheGodOfThings17,3,Sat Jul 11 09:32:27 2015 UTC,Yeah i sorta wanted to watch PLL just cause of Holly Marie Combs but it seemed like such a chick flick show.  Not anything wrong with those but theyre just not my cup of tea.  Guess you could say GA is a chick flick show but its just different some how.  Maybe i should give PLL a chance though.  I never thought i would be watching 11 seasons of GA when i started but here we are.  Plus Id so be waiting for her to throw up her hands and freeze or blow up the people who annoyed her.
greysanatomy,3ct18n,Firecrotch2014,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:36:37 2015 UTC,"Piper isn't in PLL much, but enough I guess. It starts out chicky, but you get wrapped up in the mystery drama of the show pretty quickly. as long as you can forgive the show a few things (ie teen show with silly relationships) it's a pretty great show. The sub for PLL is incredibly active, too!"
greysanatomy,3ct18n,mc140797,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:42:15 2015 UTC,"It's very chicky but even more so it's very teeny. You will find yourself rolling your eyes and hitting ""next episode"" over and over because you need to know who A is. I wouldn't suggest it if you get hooked easily."

greysanatomy,3ct18n,ElphabaPfenix,2,Fri Jul 10 18:36:41 2015 UTC,omg!! so it was I knew that I recognized her from somewhere.
greysanatomy,3ct18n,alana1999,10,Fri Jul 10 15:50:13 2015 UTC,I just re-watched those and I am so pissed at Arizona. A good man is a storm my ass...
greysanatomy,3ct18n,Hazelstone37,6,Sat Jul 11 02:27:04 2015 UTC,"She seemed really interesting but way too pushy and inconsiderate considering she knew Arizona was married and had Sophia. Plus, she said she wouldn't leave things as they were, she did."
greysanatomy,3ct18n,DarcyFinch,8,Sat Jul 11 09:16:45 2015 UTC,"I never liked her. From the second she said, ""I'm Lauren."", I knew exactly why she was there. It was from that moment on I knew that I was going to start to hate Arizona even more. And I was right.   God, how infuriating was it that after everything that had happened, Arizona just freaking destroys everything just because someone smiled and flirted. What a bitch.....both of them."
greysanatomy,3ct18n,AncientSummoner,5,Sat Jul 11 04:05:40 2015 UTC,I didn't like Lauren from the get go and I was so happy when she left.
greysanatomy,3ct18n,superr_rad,2,Sat Jul 11 05:39:03 2015 UTC,Honest answer is that she was pretty hot other than that she was a bitch for going further with Arizona after knowing about her family. It definitely was a big ass piss off.
greysanatomy,3ct18n,Sraniale,2,Sun Jul 12 04:59:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't like her at all, the whole affair thing seemed forced and Lauren was just their for the affair. No depth of character just a ""I am gunna sex Arizona!!""  Weak all around."

greysanatomy,3cbhsx,StephosaurusRex,5,Mon Jul 6 22:36:34 2015 UTC,they were the scariest two episodes I've ever witnessed on prime-time television!
greysanatomy,3cbhsx,ChaoticCrayon,3,Tue Jul 7 00:21:18 2015 UTC,I couldn't breathe through most of those two episodes. So amazing.

greysanatomy,3cbhsx,lefferts,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:21:40 2015 UTC,Yup! I was literally on the edge of my seat.
greysanatomy,3cbhsx,zedbra,4,Wed Jul 8 03:52:03 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why but I really enjoyed Callie's Malpractice Trial episode.
greysanatomy,3cbhsx,ChaoticCrayon,2,Mon Jul 6 23:33:41 2015 UTC,"It was an interesting episode and I didn't mind it, but also kind of a stand alone one which was kind of odd. It's such an isolated plot that the overarching storyline is more or less the same with or without watching that episode."
greysanatomy,3cbhsx,dannykim15218,3,Tue Jul 7 03:55:10 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty crucial to watch the first 2 and last 2 episodes of of every season cause so much happens. Generally this is also the case for the episode before and after the Christmas/winter break. They tend to be loaded with huge developments.
greysanatomy,3cbhsx,Sage_Rosemary_Thyme,2,Tue Jul 7 02:07:24 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really great idea and makes a lot of sense! They also always seems to have the season's Big Disaster around episodes 15-18, so I'd probably add those in too since they're usually so heart-wrenching/exciting/terrifying."
greysanatomy,3cbhsx,Mr_jon3s,3,Tue Jul 7 05:46:41 2015 UTC,"Season 2, Episodes 16 and 17 are my favorite. The infamous bomb episode. Also, the shooter episode is great too."
greysanatomy,3cbhsx,ashleyproud,3,Tue Jul 7 04:12:17 2015 UTC,"I am going to skip Season 1, since it introduces much of everything, but here are my recommendations.

I am on break so I will try and bust out Season 2 and 3  Season 2 enter the Addison   0205 Bring the Pain, George and Alex in an elevator 0209 Thanks for the Memories Thanksgiving episode, feel good character building for Iz, George, Burke 0216 It's the End of the World First Big Event At Grey's, I won't say much 0217 As We Know It Continuation of 0216 0215 17 Seconds I don't really care for this, but it is huge setup for Cristina and Burke   Season 3 getting into the swing of things, tons of personal stories   0303 Sometimes a Fantasy I include this because it builds a ton of future Alex working with kids. Establishes some baseline for the season 0307 Where the Boys Are Fun time in the woods with all the major male characters. Some foreshadowing as well. 0315 Walk on Water big season event. Meredith and Derek moment 0316 Drowning on Dry Land same as above"
greysanatomy,3cbhsx,justessforall,2,Tue Jul 7 16:03:32 2015 UTC,"Season 9 Episode 5 ""Beautiful Doom"". One of my favorites and I feel it's really underrated. It's a great episode to show professional and personal development for both Mer and Cristina. I love the way they are shown side-by-side. This episode was really well done, and definitely worth the watch."
greysanatomy,3bvmgf,-Urbex-,26,Thu Jul 2 14:53:08 2015 UTC,There is only a handful of original characters left on the show. Ellen Pompeo’s Meredith Grey is joined by Alex Karev and Richard Webber.   ....what about Bailey?
greysanatomy,3bvmgf,growling_puppy,15,Thu Jul 2 15:18:33 2015 UTC,I noticed that too :(

greysanatomy,3bvmgf,toxicshocktaco,6,Thu Jul 2 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"I could be totally wrong, but I get the feeling ABC will let the show go on even with a ratings drop, as long as Shonda wants to keep telling the story. She could just as easily take her next series to another network, and the higher ups at ABC probably don't want that to happen."
greysanatomy,3bvmgf,Ttucrabtree,5,Thu Jul 2 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"The show started with Meredith meeting Derek, it should have ended when he died. Perfect story arc.

greysanatomy,3brx5r,alana1999,17,Wed Jul 1 17:35:35 2015 UTC,"The only contract I read about was Dempsey and Pompeo renewing through season 12.  I assumed they would both either leave or request an insane raise to stick around.  I also saw (on a tabloid cover in line at the grocery, so it could easily be false) that Patrick Dempsey was having an affair with a Grey's crew member and Ellen Pompeo told his wife.  If that is true, I imagine everyone in question was pretty uncomfortable on set and they might all have individually decided it was time to go their separate ways.  Again, tabloids are hardly a reliable source for information, given that they've declared Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie ""over"" at least once a month for the past ten years, so take that with a grain of salt."
greysanatomy,3brx5r,Kallistrate,7,Wed Jul 1 20:00:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I heard that somewhere about Ellen telling his wife and that is what cause Dempsey and his wives divorce but I didn't believe it ahah. I do however believe that Ellen is in it till the end no matter how much money she is making...
greysanatomy,3brx5r,Sraniale,8,Thu Jul 2 10:51:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think so. I think Ellen has said on her Twitter that she would stick around until the end. I think Ellen wouldn't just leave us especially her being the main character. Also, she did say she was going to retire after greys so it seems like shes a definite stay."

greysanatomy,3brx5r,Lybychick,4,Thu Jul 2 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"I do know that Ellen and Justin Chambers (Alex) said they were both in for the long haul and I assume they plan to stick around until Shonda pulls the plug, so theoretically they could make season 12 then end because I assume ratings are going to drop now that McDreamy is dead.   Honestly they could have made season 11 the series finale the end because of how they capped off that season, just make Bailey the new chief of surgery and called it a series.   Thinking of all the shit that's happened in the series though, the only way they will end the series is if literally everyone gets killed off and the hospital explodes or something.  EDIT: just read the article where Jessica Capshaw (Arizona) renewed for 3 more years, so I assume it could still go until 2018 until they need to renew again."
greysanatomy,3brx5r,Lybychick,5,Wed Jul 1 22:12:08 2015 UTC,"If ratings drop due to McDreamy, I will be very disappointed because for me the show was never about MerDer that was just an added extra . I hope the series ends with Mer and Christina dancing it out, with flashbacks to everyone on the show."
greysanatomy,3brx5r,beainainaess,-5,Thu Jul 2 10:54:30 2015 UTC,Patrick Dempsey supposedly had a contract and McDreamy is dead.  The show has jumped the shark ... season 12 will be a pitiful and painful slow demise.

greysanatomy,3bkd1u,Chokolla,3,Tue Jun 30 15:01:55 2015 UTC,"There is no way to prep yourself. Seriously. I was a new fan, who knew it was coming, and thought I'd be fine, but now I have some sort of Grey's denial/PTSD. I was flipping through channels last week, and GA was on some channel, it was a pretty heavy MerDer episode from S3, I couldn't even watch it.   You just have to bite the bullet and do it."

He was right.    The last episodes of S11 have totally devastated me.  I've been a fan from episode 1 and have never turned my back on GA, even though events have occurred that made shout a very loud ""Are you kidding me!"" in true Meredith style.  But in the final episodes I had to pause the video and get through the tears before I could watch anymore.  I'm a total sob-sister and I was a complete mess."
greysanatomy,3bg69y,DarcyFinch,17,Sun Jun 28 22:59:19 2015 UTC,"AND before the enrolling downvotes   Not sure if you're new to the subreddit, but no, you aren't the only one.  The complaint that all the plots have been replaced by increasingly unbelievable tragedies started around the end of Season 8 with the plane crash.  That's also when characters like Bailey and Arizona started going against their established natures, too.  In my opinion they should've ended the show when Cristina left.  I mean, obviously they couldn't have known what was going to go on in Patrick Dempsey's personal life, but the time to end a show is when your main actors are ready to leave, not several years after they do it."

I know, but like I said, watching Gilmore Girls I just couldn't fathom how Grey's has gone so awry. The fact that it's a medical drama gives it a much more expanded area to work with, let alone the relationship drama, that's basically why I brought the subject up again.  As for what you said about ending the show, I agree. I no longer feel like justifying the renewal. True, Derek's death will give a boost to Meredith's character development, but I feel like we've seen enough."
greysanatomy,3bg69y,Sobrikett,5,Mon Jun 29 04:32:19 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you both.  Not to mention the fact that someone that has been through what Meredith has been through in her life (the mental abuse at the hands of her mother, the bomb, the plane crash, the shooter, her attempted suicide and subsequent near death experience at the same time her mother dies and Derek's death) is enough to make even a strong person just lay down and give up on life.    The fact that she's doesn't have her own chair in a psychiatrist's office and that she's not taking a handful of drugs daily just to be able to climb out of bed every morning is a testament that the writers of this show have never once thought about delving in the real psyche of a human being."

Actually, that's a good point. I never thought of it before, but I would love to see some/any of these characters seeking professional help for the trauma they witness and endure.

The show is aging, I found season 10 and 11 to be boring to watch through sometimes but even if it is, I'm still curious about how things will go around the greys universe. I still love and enjoy the show and will hope as a loyal fan that things can get much better."

To be honest, I'd rather rewatch earlier seasons than to watch Season 12, so I guess that's it for me.  Ah and for the side note, I love Gilmore Girls :) but I think comparing Grey's with Gilmore Girls does not indicate anything, since each one of them focus on different things. Maybe we can compare Grey's with other medical-focused show? I love House MD but I feel that despite the similar setting (hospital) and focus (medical), these two shows are different as well. I have heard that Scrubs and perhaps ER are more similar with Grey's but I have never watched those two."

Shonda has surprised us before, maybe she will again and the show's writing improves!  I compared GG to GA mostly because of the extended dialogue in both. As I said before, GG went on for 7 seasons and the plot was mostly realistic, but in GA, not even two seasons went by before the story required personal tragedies for it to remain entertaining. Granted, with the Denny Duquette incident, no one knew it was gonna escalate so much and at that time it was incredibly shocking; even though predictable. Still, the level of acting by Heigl was magnificent.  And that brings me to another point, in GG I've never, not once, thought of anyone acting bad. They act so damn realistically that I feel like I'm part of them. But several times I've felt turned off by bad acting on GA. Mostly extras as patients, but also regular characters such as Shane and Leah (I hate them with a passion; in my opinion they downgraded the show)."

greysanatomy,3axrt3,Firecrotch2014,6,Wed Jun 24 10:25:34 2015 UTC,"You raise valid points but I don't think we can blame this entirely on Shonda. I think most of the blame has to go to society in general.   Speaking broadly I think the US as a whole is more accepting of lesbians than gays. It's easier to portray a stable couple if they are women because people are more okay with it.  The stereotype of redneck men being okay with two girls kissing but not two guys kissing has some basis in reality, at least in our current climate.   You say there's a lack of stable gay male couples on GA and PP but Scandal has a good one right from s1e1 - Cyrus and James. It's 1.1 so I don't think that spoils anything.   Summary: it's not Shonda, it's society, but I think we are ready now."
greysanatomy,3axrt3,growling_puppy,3,Wed Jun 24 10:37:57 2015 UTC,"From an ""important gay couple"" storytelling standpoint, Cyrus and James are a solid example. They were one of the things I loved most about Scandal early on. (Before the show went downhill...)  From a ""healthy stable long lasting gay male relationship"" standpoint, I think we might need to look elsewhere. Without going into major spoilers, let's just say that Cyrus and James had major, terrible issues.  Honestly, I think /u/Firecrotch2014 has a point: This is one area of diversity where Shonda has not excelled. I'm sad to say that I hadn't noticed, but I'm glad it was brought to my awareness. After all, becoming aware of problems is the first step toward creating change. Anyway, it's kind of strange -- and clearly frustrating to some viewers -- though I'm sure there's no malice behind it."
greysanatomy,3axrt3,grumblepup,2,Wed Jun 24 12:53:17 2015 UTC,Also I don't watch PP so maybe something changes!
greysanatomy,3axrt3,growling_puppy,-3,Wed Jun 24 10:38:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I meant to mention it but I haven't gotten around to watching Scandal yet so that's why it wasn't included.  I think Shonda herself is a lesbian, right?  I don't think she is against gay people or anything.  It's just her portrayal of gay men in general that I take issue with.  Honestly it's almost like its more of a sexist thing than a gay thing honestly.  I can't tell which at this point.  It's like she doesn't mind showing gay people as long as they are lesbians.  I know she makes a lot of television ""by women, for women"" but she's taken it a bit too far.  I don't buy into the it's society not the show.  Gay men have been in the mainstream since will and grace in 1998.  It's 2015, if she hasn't gotten a stable, gay couple on GA by now it's by choice not circumstance.  PS. Typing this from my iPhone so sorry for any spelling errors."
greysanatomy,3axrt3,FinerStuff,6,Wed Jun 24 11:44:46 2015 UTC,"Even then the portrayal of gay men isnt really something that is close to whats true to real life for alot of gay men.   How about the way she portrays heterosexual couples? The guys are either faithful doormats who put up with infinite amounts of abuse from women who primarily seem concerned with having a penis inside of them and are just willing to put up with ""relationships"" to get it (Burke, Derek). Or they're slimeball players like Sloan or jerks like Karev who we're supposed to believe really have ""hearts of gold"" and just need the right woman for them to suddenly become high quality partners.  I think most of the men in Grey's Anatomy are ""dream men"" written to cater to female fantasies (and I'm a woman, FWIW.)   I think it's pretty obvious Shonda is (at least in her head) 100%  pro gay. You just have to watch the first episode of Scandal to see this, but your head might hurt from her message being beaten into it. As a side note, there is a very good long term gay relationship in Scandal--good as in entertaining, interesting, and something that makes you actually care about it, not ""good"" as in healthy. Unfortunately later on in the series half that couple makes some really poopy decisions about his love life.  While I am often annoyed with the relationships in Grey's Anatomy and Scandal, I believe Shonda deserves a lot of credit for developing good characters--she is excellent at allowing main characters to have very obvious and very big faults. We have to realize that characters of a certain demographic (gay/straight, male/female, black/white, rich/poor, intelligent/simple whatever the case may be) are NOT MEANT to be representative of ""normal"" people who are also in that demographic. They're not saying that just because one gay man acts that way, it's the norm--if it was ""normal,"" it wouldn't be very entertaining. It's okay to show one woman who has stereotypical traits--because some women do have those traits. It's okay to show one gay man in a way that many or most gay men cannot relate--because it's only meant to be that one man and chances are there is one person in the world who can relate. Drama television is not meant to show us, ""This is what real life is like.""   Really, though--I haven't seen Private Practice (the episodes introducing it on GA were bad enough--oh God, so bad), but it's fairly obvious to me that Grey's Anatomy is in many ways very unrealistic in its portrayal of people of any sexual orientations. Good Lord, that on call room must be crusty with so much dried bodily fluids--I mean who is the poor unfortunate soul who has to change those sheets or empty out the 32 gallon trash can full of used condoms every single day? They all act like a bunch of sex addicted nymphos who spent all that time and money on school just so they could bang the nearest remotely attractive member of either sex in twin-sized bunk cots that have already been humped upon by a dozen other couples that same day. The show is entertaining, but Seattle Grace is like a total nightmare of a hospital, like somehow it got filled with old-looking teenagers who spend more time furiously humping each other than they do practicing actual medicine."

Shonda's tried really hard in my opinion to take the word ""Fringe"" and set it on fire.

To me, Callie is the best person on the entire show. She loves with everything she has, she always thinks of other and she's a bad ass orthopedic surgeon.  Arizona always acted like their relationship was about her. She's selfish and childish...and on top of all of this she's a cheater. She cheated on one of the best people in the world because she was feeling down about her leg, sure it was a crappy situation but her attitude made it worse and Callie is the only reason she is still alive.  The most upsetting part: I want them back together. I really think Arizona makes Callie happy and I hate that Arizona tainted that."
greysanatomy,3asqbp,BeatsWheats,12,Tue Jun 23 17:48:31 2015 UTC,"because she was feeling down about her leg,    Sorry, I just have to chime in on this part here where you seemed to minimize the massive change to Arizona's life.  She didn't break an ankle or get an ugly scar.  She lost her leg above the knee.  That is a MAJOR change.  That fundamentally changed who she was.  Yes, Callie is the ONLY reason Arizona is still alive.  But Arizona needed time to process the fact that she lost a leg and who she as before she no longer would be in the future.  She suffered from MAJOR PTSD after the crash and Callie told her to ""get up and get over it"" and threw her into the shower.  Sure, it was a cathartic moment for Arizona, but she needed MORE than that, she needed therapy and time, and as much as I like Callie, I feel she pushed Arizona too much and then it was all about trying to have sex again and not about Arizona learning to be a whole new person with a new identity.  She's no longer Arizona Robbins, MD.  Now she's Arizona Robbins, MD, plane crash survivor and amputee.  That's HUGE.  And then she cheated.  And cheating is horrible and bad and unforgivable, but I can understand why Arizona did it.  She was lost.  She had never dealt with her changes and her PTSD and here was this woman who was like ""Hey, I like you.""  Callie loved her, but Callie loved Arizona before the leg, and Arizona needed to feel loved after the leg, and couldn't separate Callie before and Callie after and didn't think she was WORTHY of Callie after because she was not whole.  But this skank comes along and Arizona felt something, she felt like she could be attractive without a leg.  Arizona cheating was wrong and horrible and you may (as many do) think she is selfish and whatever for many other reasons and that's okay.  But she didn't cheat ""because she was feeling down about her leg"".  It was far more complicated than that.  I don't approve of it, but I understand it.  Most of the fandom does not.  Probably because most of the fandom has not gone through something as traumatic as Arizona and can't put themselves in her."

Not because I didn't like them together, but because the writers don't know how to write for the two of them.  Right before their divorce, it was all about the magical baby they were supposed to be having.  That was their screen time.  Who's carrying the baby, what the baby's name will be, are they ready for a baby, yes they're ready for a baby because it will fix all of their problems, no they're not ready because they can't fix their problems, etc.    I don't want to watch them work on a relationship.  That seems to be the case with every relationship on the show with the prior exception of Meredith and Derek.  They always seemed smooth sailing right up until this season when suddenly they needed drama too.  But everyone else?  ALWAYS DRAMA!"

I still wish April had given Stark (the unpleasant peads doc) a chance, when he asked her out to dinner.  Also, I didn't mind Calli and George the first time around (season 3?), but the rewatch is just painful and awkward. How did anyone think this was good tv back then? No chemistry, no nothing.  Well, that's just me. I've probably seen these episodes a million times on afternoon reruns, but putting it all back in order is showing the gaps. (though the Christina breakdown -fishing, bartending- didn't take up nearly as much time as it felt like the first time around).  And I think I completely missed the 'Avery likes Lexie' thing and feel bad :(  Anyway, just some thoughts :)"

He's not a knight in shining whatever. I didn't understand why Burke left before (I was fairly young) but now it's so obvious. Meredith is not as ""dark and twisty""....or maybe I've just become more jaded. I think my OTP is still Owen and Cristina though."
greysanatomy,39tbgi,SaturnChild,2,Sat Jun 20 02:31:42 2015 UTC,"Derek seems like such a jerk in the rewatch! I also didn't catch how much Avery messed up early on, I always thought of him as the golden child.  It's funny what you notice, later.   What's OTP?"

greysanatomy,39tght,medievaleagle,12,Sun Jun 14 19:06:33 2015 UTC,So Meredith is supposed to give up her career and follow her husband wherever he goes because his work is more important? Or because she's a woman and should do what her husband tells her?  She wants to establish herself. Derek has done that already. It's her turn. He got pissed because she tried to assert herself. What is that. That's not a supportive husband.

But for the most part.... I mean, she IS the central character, the Grey of Grey's... she is supposed to be the sun."
greysanatomy,39tght,Echo_of_Hope,3,Mon Jun 15 01:47:17 2015 UTC,"It looks like she does that because of her insecurities, but as Derek points out, she could have continued her research elsewhere.  The main thing that drives her is, I believe, her wish to not be like her mother, but still achieve. She, as opposed to her mother, loves people, and has been kind and helpful and basically a man in a storm for every one of her friends. She was there when they needed her (at least she learned to do that in her first years at Seattle Grace, after some selfish mistakes) and been a shelter for a lot of people (figuratively and literally, by offering her house to everyone in need of a place to stay or in need of company). If people wouldn't die or ditch or leave, she would have like a monstrously huge group that she could call family. She is that person: the one that loves a stranger, the one that can sacrifice her life for a stranger (as easily as for a loved one), the one that is willing to die instead of someone else (the hand in that man's chest thing, the shoot me thing etc) or end her career for someone (the swap of saline with actual active agent for Adele, basically for Richard)... She is the Sun not because of what she is meant to be as a surgeon, but because, like the Sun, she has the power to gravitationally attract people and keep them on orbit and the light to help them survive when they need it the most. So, the way I see it, her refusal to leave Seattle is actually her refusal to leave home, her people, her friends (the ones that are still there), her memories, her family, the place, people and experiences that made her who she is."
greysanatomy,39tght,alana1999,7,Mon Jun 22 17:12:03 2015 UTC,For me it changes from episode to episode. Some episodes she's just annoying like when she was fighting with Derek for not going to Washington. Other times she's awesome.
greysanatomy,39tght,0ne_too,6,Tue Jun 16 11:08:17 2015 UTC,I went through a phase of really hating Meredith but that was slowly put to rest once I realised that she is the heart and soul of Greys and if the best character I have seen on a television show and I think Ellen plays the role perfectly :)

greysanatomy,39tqsx,growling_puppy,3,Sun Jun 14 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"Season 8, episode 13: ""If/Then""  Meredith dreams of a world in which her mother, Ellis Grey, never had Alzheimer's and instead had loving and supportive parents. This leads Meredith to be a happy version of herself, causing Seattle Grace to be completely different. She and Cristina are enemies while April is her best friend, who is sleeping with Meredith's fiance, Alex, who is only with Meredith because of her family's legacy. Owen has married Callie and they have 3 children, although they are not happy. Addison and Derek are expecting a child, only it is revealed that the baby is actually Mark's and Addison and Derek's relationship is falling apart. Lexie has become an orphan and a drug addict. It is revealed that George failed his boards and was never seen again while Izzie went insane after Denny's death. Richard left Adele and married Ellis and Meredith took Webber as her last name. The episode ends reminiscent of how Derek and Meredith first met. Throughout the entire episode all the couples that actually do exist seem to have connections, which includes Callie and Arizona, and also Yang and Owen.  Season 10, episode 17 ""Do You Know""  Cristina comes to experience two very different universes—on a quest to answer the question, ""Do you know who you are?""—after she does very difficult heart repair work on her patient who is on a ventilator and paralyzed from the neck down. In the first universe, the patient decides that he wants to be taken off the ventilator which sends Cristina into Owen’s arms when she realizes that they are throwing away their love for each other. Time is quickly passing as the two get married, move in together, get a dog, have a baby, await the birth of their second child, and see Ross win the Harper Avery Award for Cristina's trial that she quit on to take care of her family. The second universe begins when Cristina comes back to reality and her patient says he doesn’t want to be taken off the ventilator. This once again sends Cristina into Owen's arms, but this time, she's happy. However, the stipulation that they will never have kids still remains, which Owen initially accepts. They continue to have their on-again, off-again relationship which drives Owen to drinking more than he should putting himself and his patients in grave danger. Cristina tells him it's over for good, and she goes on to win the Harper Avery Award for four straight years. Once again, Cristina comes back to reality. This time, her patient decides to be taken off the ventilator; however, she’s able to save Jackson from injuring his hand, and her hesitancy to approach Owen allows Meredith to approach her about a patient, which allows Owen to get on the elevator before she can greet him."

It showed how even if certain circumstances had changed the pairs from s8 would have eventually ended up together because of a deeper connection. It really helped me think Meredith and Zola had a connection because up until then I never felt Mer truly wanted to adopt Zola and just kind of did it because Derek said to. At the beginning she said ""the baby you have is the baby you were meant to have"" and I think the episode showed Mer would have adopted her anyway because she was meant to have her, just like she and Cristina were meant to be bffs and she and Derek were meant to be.

And mainly about how she is not like her mother (which might wreck the Alzheimer's plotline.)  Ellis was left by choice (aka dumped). She ran away and didn't return to where she was hurt. She gave up her child. She wanted to be a strong surgeon and completely shut off from other people. Mer was a widow. She ran away and chose to return home and face what had happened. She kept their daughter together and chose to raise her alone. She's become closer to Maggie and Amelia.

So do callie and arizona, amelia/april and owen, jo and karev etc.  Edwards is another i like seeing alone bcs she can bounce off just about anyone in the cast, not as well as meredith, but she is still good."

Like your friends, I don't remember all the other episodes because I watched them as they came out weekly. I will definitely binge watch the entire series once I'm done organizing my conference but the episodes that always remain with me are:   the wedding Cristina never had. ""Oh God gets this off! Get this off! Get this off!"" UGHHH POOR YANG!!! </3 DAT LVAD wire! House outline of candles <3 007 Derek gets shot! and then Cristina being held at gunpoint during Derek's surgery Henry dies and Teddy makes Cristina repeat everything she did during that surgery.  Dat plane crash Lexie dies Mark dies Derek dies </3 </3 </3    I just realized they're all the heavy, super sad/emotional ones. I LOVED the first season (and second season) a lot, especially Meredith/Cristina tequila moments. With the newer episodes, I've LOVED seeing Karev grow and really fit well with where he is right now. I was really worried when he took the private practice job because I thought that meant he was leaving the series. I wasn't too particularly fond of that musical episode but Callie has a great voice! I was mad at Izzie for leaving Alex a wreck but I was glad she left.. Sorry!   Good luck with the job front!!"

greysanatomy,39g2d7,Floonet,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:57:40 2015 UTC,"Yup! I legitimately, as I call it, was ""cry-sobbing"". I've certainly gotten a little verklempt over movies and tv shows, but this was outrageous, especially because I'm not a crier. I think it wasn't so much what happened, which don't get me wrong was sad, but how it all happened. I was pissed, and crying, and hollering at my iPad like a maniac.

greysanatomy,399il9,daydreamingofsleep,14,Wed Jun 10 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"But in this case the patient was in a coma, might wake up (and did, IIRC). Derek was brain dead.  I still don't agree with Meredith just pulling the plug without giving the sisters a chance to say goodbye, but they're pretty different scenarios."
greysanatomy,399il9,soadorkable,4,Wed Jun 10 08:08:12 2015 UTC,There has been a lot of discussion about his sisters. I started re watching from the beginning and this convo immediately stuck out!
greysanatomy,399il9,bnthrdntht,6,Wed Jun 10 09:24:45 2015 UTC,At that point she was still covering that her mother was ill. Him in the coma happened and for some reason they didn't know who he was until he was brain dead?!
greysanatomy,399il9,ChaoticCrayon,5,Wed Jun 10 06:04:54 2015 UTC,"In that episode the patient had a chance of waking up. Derek had no chance. Very different scenarios. Mer did her best, and even though people disagree with her handling of it, it's not an unrealistic portrayal of how things go down sometimes, speaking from experience."
greysanatomy,399il9,srsowl,8,Wed Jun 10 20:56:54 2015 UTC,"Mer did the wrong thing there but it was the best she could do at the time. Her choice was do it now or move him to another facility and the latter would entail said sisters, their kids, the mother, the whole hospital standing upside down to do something when... there was nothing to be done. It was already over. She'd probably have fled during the whole thing."
greysanatomy,399il9,Mortehl,4,Wed Jun 10 08:32:11 2015 UTC,"Mer did the only thing she could do.  Until you experience it yourself, you can't understand.  I am not trying to jump down your throat, but, this 'experience' hurts..  a lot.  And until you live through it, you can't.. just can't understand.  I pray you never understand.

greysanatomy,399il9,srsowl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:22:12 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant to say, may not have come across. I understand what she did and why she did it. It's only ""wrong"" from the theoretical point of view. People handle things differently, Mer did the best to her ability. Another person would only find solace in calling the family in, but that's not her thing. It was hard enough having your world collapse without permitting you to collapse."
greysanatomy,399il9,Misha726,2,Thu Jun 11 01:57:50 2015 UTC,"Derek in season one and Derek in season 11 had very different relationships with his sisters. I think at that point he's still viewing Seattle as temporarily and he'll go back to New York and his real life, his marriage, etc. I think his relationship with sisters (especially bitchy Nancy) never recovered from the divorce.  Remember with his nerve surgery how he didn't want his sisters informed? When Amelia arrived after the shooting and implied that they were told days after the fact and weren't really informed. In a year they hadn't met Zola, only seen a few pictures. None of these things point to the close family he described in season one and I don't think it can all be blamed on Meredith. I think Derek was focused on his ""new"" life and wanted distance from the past."

First he was the perfect guy; anticipated Bailey's every move and knew exactly how to deal with her, and then, somewhere along the way, he kinda became... passive? I guess. Not really sure how to describe him. Also, I kinda blame him for turning Bailey into the blithering idiot she's become."
greysanatomy,3934lo,DarcyFinch,3,Tue Jun 9 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"Her first husband and having a child did that, not him."
greysanatomy,3934lo,Firecrotch2014,2,Tue Jun 9 20:50:33 2015 UTC,"You're joking right? Bailey may have said she'd gone soft for not preventing the Denny Duquette incident, but she was still the Nazi. Back in season 5 she was still the Nazi - more sentimental sure, but strong and steady. It was way after her divorce that she got weak."
greysanatomy,3934lo,DarcyFinch,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:02:29 2015 UTC,"I think having a child was more the factor than her husband. I think Shonda was trying to mimic real life.  When someone in Baileys position has a child most people do get softer bcs they are juggling a home life and a very demanding job.  They don't have time to micromanage every little detail.  Plus having a child conditions most people to be more empathetic so we don't rip their sweet little annoying heads off like our natural instincts would have us do.  Combine that with two more factors. There was an episode where Bailey had to save the life of a neo nazi or something and she pledged never to allow anyone to call her that again, at least to her face.  The other factor is Ben coming along.  He finally got her to show her feminine side and open up to him.  I think he made her realize that she doesn't have to do everything alone. I never really got the chemistry or saw it on screen with her first husband.  Personally I did like Bailey when she was The Nazi but I think the path Shonda has taken with her character has allowed her to evolve greatly over the course of the show.  Something I don't know would have happened if she was still the hothead from before.  Hothead Bailey almost quit didn't she when Callie was named head resident?  When Bailey had to compete for the board seat, I think she would've quit has she still been hothead Bailey.  Plus I think Shonda didn't want to sterotype Baileys character as one of those big, sassy black women who are just there every once in awhile to put the white folks in their place. (If you dont know what I'm talking about think of the babysitter on The Mysteries of Laura). Yeah that still happen in Hollywood."
greysanatomy,3934lo,Firecrotch2014,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"I do agree that it's Shonda's way of evolving Bailey's character - I just don't like the way she turned out. She's become conceited, expecting to obtain everything she was worthy of, when she's become so wimpy."
greysanatomy,3934lo,DarcyFinch,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:28:35 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of ambivalence towards Ben has to do with his abrupt entrances and exits before becoming a full time main player. For instance, Ben and Bailey was trucking along riiiiight up until Shonda's new show 'Off the Map' needed some leads and the actor who plays Ben took his shot at that instead of being a bit character. Unfortunately the show got cancelled (I thought it wasn't bad, at LEAST better than Private Practice), but while that all was happening we were getting invested in Bailey and Eli.  So at least Ben's rather permanently back and that can grow organically now. I think it's funny/interesting how the writers keep wanting to salvage interesting bit characters by turning them into surgeons but they have to start at the bottom at med school and interning. See: Ben, Teddy's husband"
greysanatomy,3934lo,SoloIsGodly,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:41:04 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm trying to say as well. We haven't gotten to know him as Ben per se, rather as Bailey's husband, mostly."

greysanatomy,392bkp,SillyLilyButt,16,Tue Jun 9 04:46:39 2015 UTC,"I came up with this idea that good tv shows are like life.  The first few seasons (1-4 maybe) everything is fun, and awesome. There's drama but because your young the drama is tame, like middle/high school drama.  Then the middle seasons hit, you graduated high school and the classes are getting harder, your having to pay your own bills. The drama is intense like the deaths of your friends and losing your job and kids real.   After those seasons everything calms down. Your middle aged now. You are used to thing, and you appreciate the fun times more. You appreciate everything in your life that has got you this far.   If your lucky, most shows aren't. You make it until your elderly. Most of your family is gone but there a few good ones left. People who care about what happens to you and how everything plays out. Things are funny, things are sad, thing make you mad. Nothing is ever as intense as it was because you now have the perspective of losing so much and understanding that life goes on whether or not you're ready to. You appreciate everything more because one day Grey's Anatomy won't be on TV anymore. One day, all you'll have are the memories.   In TV life, Grey's is middle aged. It's good, but just like real life you reminisce about being a dumb kid with no responsibilities. And all the fun times all of the interns had with each other, verses now all of the responsibilities they have and what they've lost since then."
greysanatomy,392bkp,BeatsWheats,6,Mon Jun 8 21:46:15 2015 UTC,Love your theory. But personally I think Grey's has hit the resisting-retirement stage of life lol...
greysanatomy,392bkp,grumblepup,4,Mon Jun 8 23:51:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes. I agree. It's that person who should have retired a few years ago, it's past the 'bow out gracefully' stage, but since it used to be a good worker, everyone still puts up with it."

greysanatomy,392bkp,freakoutinout,3,Tue Jun 9 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Izzy's character was probably written that way because her story arc with Denny was so well-received.  I mean, season two probably saw the most recognition of any season.  Unfortunately the character of Izzy suffered for it in future seasons, and Heigl's untimely departure seemed to be shoehorned into the story.  Her exit was arguably one of the worst."

Her lines sound like she's about to deliver a witty or powerful punchline but her execution falls flat. Could be I'm just picky though because she's no Cristina and no Teddy."
greysanatomy,39426r,srsowl,3,Tue Jun 9 10:25:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, but let's hope that that's just her coming into her own as the character and getting comfortable playing her, and it'll get better as the episodes go on."
greysanatomy,39426r,srsowl,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:26:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Nobody's playing their character perfectly right off the bat, takes time to adapt and get a feel for it. Will def watch irregaredless of the first impressions."
greysanatomy,39426r,clarezza,3,Wed Jun 10 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"Watch the trailer again and I try to picture it as Yang instead of Melissa George's character. It seems as if NBC is really trying to copy Yang's sass for this new show. For example, the scene where she asks if she spit on the man and she replies ""Yeah, I do that"", is such a Cristina line and Sandra Oh would have delivered that perfectly."
greysanatomy,39426r,DarcyFinch,3,Tue Jun 9 14:20:50 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with anyone saying she's like Cristina 2.0, but hey, Oh left the show because she felt like she had given her all to the character - no use getting her own spin-off if she's tired already.  On another note, I will choose to believe this is Sadie's future after getting her shit together, I really liked her as a character; she was challenging, diabolical and freakin' sexy [though crazy]."

greysanatomy,39426r,dreaminginventalarms,2,Tue Jun 9 17:26:43 2015 UTC,Here shut up and take my money
greysanatomy,38rtxv,Briannkin,43,Sat Jun 6 07:06:39 2015 UTC,I think there would have been just as much of an uproar if they suddenly replaced Dempsey.  And half the magic of Meredith/Derek is the chemistry between the actors anyway. It would be awkward to try to recreate that.
greysanatomy,38rtxv,caitflorida,5,Sat Jun 6 07:21:27 2015 UTC,Yeah it seemed to be kind of a lose-lose situation either way. :(
greysanatomy,38rtxv,AmandoCommando,12,Sat Jun 6 09:26:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know that there was really any good solution to Patrick Dempsey wanting to leave the show. Replacing the actor could have been done, yes, but that approach is pretty dated. I can't think of a modern show that has done this. And there's the issue - Shonda sees herself and her programmes as very modern and progressive."
greysanatomy,38rtxv,lil_poundcake,3,Sat Jun 6 07:15:59 2015 UTC,I agree it is a pretty dated thing to do (I just looked it up and the mid-90s seems to be where the practice stops). I just wonder if it was ever even considered.
greysanatomy,38rtxv,specificbarista,2,Sat Jun 6 07:30:26 2015 UTC,Happens on soap operas all the time.
greysanatomy,38rtxv,trollboogies,4,Sat Jun 6 22:38:15 2015 UTC,"Probably not. Shonda seemed to get a massive hate boner the second Dempsey wanted out, and took it out on us."
greysanatomy,38rtxv,Mortehl,2,Sat Jun 6 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"....  Yes, that's exactly why it happened."
greysanatomy,38rtxv,msuaussiemom,3,Mon Jun 8 13:10:16 2015 UTC,They did this on Game of Thrones with Darrio. Definitely threw me off at first. I don't think I would want to see anyone else play Derek
greysanatomy,38rtxv,lil_poundcake,2,Sat Jun 6 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah! How could I forget that?   I really hated that choice creatively though. It still throws me off, hence why I keep forgetting that he's Daario Naharis. Makes me more firm in the belief that that would have been a bad choice for Derek. Without Derek, I'll keep watching and give Grey's a chance. Derek played by some other guy? I think I'd stop all together."

greysanatomy,38pv5x,kingkovifor,2,Sat Jun 6 15:10:55 2015 UTC,Comparing photos of it versus the one on the show it's not the same trailer.   Also he mentions it here: http://www.architecturaldigest.com/celebrity-homes/2014/patrick-dempsey-cars-mercedes-benz-porsche-article
greysanatomy,38pv5x,specificbarista,2,Sat Jun 6 16:17:36 2015 UTC,damn. That would have been fantastic. I was on my phone so it was damn similar looking.

greysanatomy,38i3k5,ChaoticCrayon,-1,Fri Jun 5 00:52:55 2015 UTC,"Sure, like the other guy said, it could have been 'past shadowing', but it wasn't planned before."
greysanatomy,38i3k5,DarcyFinch,4,Fri Jun 5 07:00:27 2015 UTC,Maybe its past shadowing? Foreshadowing in reverse? Cuz that's kinda neat.

greysanatomy,3885ci,BeatsWheats,7,Tue Jun 2 16:23:35 2015 UTC,I think out of all the TV show subs I'm on this one seems to like reruns the most. It's also the most spoiler friendly sub.

This subreddit is pretty good, and there's usually spoiler alerts, but it's still tricky, people don't mean to slip, but the show has been around for ages. Also, avoid googling anything, and I mean anything, I found out a HUGE spoiler because I googled a character's name, and there were google images that gave things away.

Personally I like the rule in many other subs where the current season is all considered a spoiler until the next season starts.  So all of s11 would still be a spoiler (even episodes that aired in October 2014) until September XX 2015, when season 12 episode 1 aired.  Then we could consider season 11 fair game.  People, if they don't want to be spoiled, will avoid the spoiler areas.  Example: I haven't watched the season finale of Once Upon a Time, so I unsubscribed from that sub for the last two weeks.

greysanatomy,36rpsy,SQLwitch,2,Fri May 22 09:50:14 2015 UTC,"I am more curious if anyone knows why she wasn't in the last two episodes of this season? Given the progression of events, it seems natural she would have showed up. Was she too busy, or did Sandra not reach out? She has stated before she would love to return for a guest role periodically, she was just done being a regular. Same thoughts regarding Kate Walsh.."
greysanatomy,36rpsy,soswinglifeaway,3,Fri May 22 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"Sandra seems to be quite busy these days, but at Derek's funeral they did have a stand-in actress that showed the back of her head, to imply Cristina was at the funeral. With the rushed exit of Patrick Dempsey, I'm guessing there just wasn't enough time in terms of scheduling conflicts for Sandra to actually make an appearance. I'm guessing that's the case with Kate Walsh as well, especially since she came earlier this season for April/Jackson's baby. She probably didn't have enough lead time to make it work with her schedule.  edit: thinking back to season 9 when Addison came back for Sophia's complicated birth"

I still stand by the scheduling theory though since this year Kate Walsh has sad she would absolutely come back and Shonda Rhimes has always spoken highly of her.

The end of Season 8 really shapes up potential exits for most of the cast in case they choose not to return, but I feel like Cristina's potential exit story had the most attention of anyones. I've wondered before if that's because they had genuine concerns that Sandra was leaving, and then when she ended up staying, they wrote her S9 Mayo arc to give her a big storyline and to get themselves out of the corner they were stuck in story wise.  I'm assuming the show would have kept Sandra on forever if she were willing, so I guess if she did decide to give them one last contract, they might have been more grateful than if she'd just said ""thanks bye"" and left."

I think eventually they will go there but I hope they at least wait until after next season. A romantic storyline for her the season immediately following her husband dying is just too soon. From what we know about her character I think it would make more sense for her to focus on her children and her career though.

I think this past season they've really been trying to show the parallels between Ellis and Meredith - very similar circumstances in their lives have arisen and I think the writers have been trying to demonstrate that even though Ellis was considered to be incredibly tough by those around her, when it came to her personal life she very clearly made huge mistakes that led to her perpetual misery. Meredith comes to those same crossroads and makes the better choices time and time again (i.e. to embrace motherhood instead of running from it, to return home after the loss of the love of her life, etc.). I'd like to think that they'll keep her single and show that her life is still full and meaningful even if Derek is gone"
greysanatomy,36rl9u,fruitjerky,20,Thu May 21 16:57:04 2015 UTC,I want McVet back.
greysanatomy,36rl9u,novalys,15,Thu May 21 18:58:10 2015 UTC,He knew from the very beginning: -He's going to hurt you and I'm not going to be here when you come back :(
greysanatomy,36rl9u,drift_would,14,Thu May 21 20:39:39 2015 UTC,"Both their spouses died suddenly in car accidents! As he said, that's why you don't make plans.  I think Finn would be a good match for her. He's a little dark and twisty himself, and they'd both be each other's second choice, but that's okay, there'd still be room for affection and respect."
greysanatomy,36rl9u,fruitjerky,7,Thu May 21 20:50:53 2015 UTC,They would make awkward death jokes together and it would be so romantic.
greysanatomy,36rl9u,Sraniale,6,Fri May 22 00:35:00 2015 UTC,The only person I can really see with her. Bring that man back to greys! Would be weird for him wouldn't it be though with the three kids and two of them is with the guy Mer chose over him.
greysanatomy,36rl9u,TantCe,1 point,Fri May 22 02:23:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, McVet! Great idea. I want him back too!"
greysanatomy,36rl9u,AmandoCommando,6,Fri May 22 11:43:34 2015 UTC,"I think over the last season they set her up so well for being a single mom who kicks ass at work. That whole time Derek was gone and she didn't lose any patients kind of showed that she's her best self on her own. I don't think they'll give her a romantic interest. I think it would be kind of cool to have her become someone's mentor. She's shown she can be a good teacher but hasn't had one person in particular that's focused on her the way Cristina did Burke (or Teddy or whoever her cardio god was at the time), or Edwards did with Amelia, etc."
greysanatomy,36rl9u,1434life,3,Thu May 21 23:27:00 2015 UTC,So she is gonna be the new Ellis Grey. I think that is better for her because Derek made her average.
greysanatomy,36rl9u,CaptaineAli,2,Fri May 22 07:34:38 2015 UTC,"Good, until they give her early onset like Ellis :("
greysanatomy,36rl9u,ceqarht,3,Fri May 22 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think there will be anyone one who she starts a relationship with in the next season. My guess is that season 12 will focus on Meredith being the rock for her two sisters, Amelia and Maggie. And she may even need to lean on them at times (but it doesn't look like that atm). I don't mind her eventually finding someone, but I think she needs some time (a season or two)."
greysanatomy,36rl9u,MaevynBunny,3,Fri May 22 00:21:51 2015 UTC,Maybe the new intern they all confused for an attending? Would be an interesting role reversal with how she met Derek. Plus he is nice to look at...
greysanatomy,36rl9u,eggs_benedict,3,Fri May 22 03:59:35 2015 UTC,I almost think he's there for Edwards.
greysanatomy,36rl9u,NatalieMarie33,3,Sun May 24 05:47:05 2015 UTC,I just don't think that they can. It's been 11 years of  mer/der romance. They only other person she 'dated' (not including one night stands) was the vet. Meredith and love is so caught up in Derek I just can't see it being believable to have her move on romantically.
greysanatomy,36rl9u,hpquest,2,Wed May 27 09:20:57 2015 UTC,I don't think she will end up with anyone else. If she does I'll be very upset. Her and Derek were way to perfect together.

If she does get in a new relationship, I think they will wait a long time. Even Arizona hasn't been in a relationship since Callie."
greysanatomy,36r4eg,meapet,28,Thu May 21 13:35:28 2015 UTC,I'm just excited to see what Jo and Karev do to their loft! So much potential. I should probably stop watching HGTV

greysanatomy,36r4eg,Sraniale,55,Fri May 22 02:26:07 2015 UTC,"season 12 will feature Meredith attempting to re-animate Derek's corpse with electricity. Owen will oppose the idea, but amelia will help with her brain science. Eventually they will succeed. Derek will be back, but unfortunately not quite fully back. Slowly derek becomes evil.  Meanwhile Torres, Baily & Jo will start performing witchcraft. They will form a coven and recruit other doctors. Combining medical science and witchcraft they use their powers for good, while also helping injured paranormal creatures in seattle.  Karev is revealed to be the descendant of a long line of slayers and he will be tasked at putting Derek down for good & he will enlist the witches of grey/sloan memorial to help."

greysanatomy,36r4eg,JessicaMcStevens,3,Fri May 22 02:44:08 2015 UTC,Seems completely in the realm of possibility
greysanatomy,36r4eg,grumblepup,9,Thu May 21 15:23:53 2015 UTC,I think Jo and Alex will get married sometime in season 12. There may or may not be a pregnancy/adoption.  Callie and Arizona will be friendly with each other but find other people to date and have semi-serious relationships with.  Maggie will move into the house with Meredith and the kids.  Amelia will buy the McMansion and live there.
greysanatomy,36r4eg,grumblepup,2,Fri May 22 17:10:58 2015 UTC,I don't think Amelia is going to buy the McMansion.  I could see her buying someplace in town.

greysanatomy,36r4eg,nanacloverskin,2,Wed Jun 3 18:34:23 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Owen isn't that kind of guy, I don't think.  Its not ""homey"" enough for him.  He appreciates older homes- he was the one who really loved the firehouse, remember.  So I could totally see him buying Meredith's house if she ever moved away, or some place like Meredith's house."
greysanatomy,36r4eg,carlyerj10,2,Wed Jun 3 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, good point. You're right, it doesn't suit him, and if I think about it some more, Amelia probably wouldn't want to live in her dead brother's custom-built dream house. (I wouldn't!)  But I would love for their place to go to someone meaningful..."

Not sure about the April/Jackson storyline, though I love them together so I'd prefer for them to work things out.  I think Amelia and Owen should get together too.  And I absolutely think Shonda will try to break ER's record, as she has said all along. I mean, if she didn't decide to end the show when Patrick Dempsey wanted out, then what would be the point in stopping now?  I'm pretty sure Ellen Pompeo has indicated that she's on board for as long as it runs, because it's good, stable work and has provided for her and her family."
greysanatomy,36r4eg,ShuShuBee,3,Wed Jun 3 18:36:49 2015 UTC,"i want to know what's going to happen to meredith, especially her love life. i'm well aware derek was the love of her life, but i don't want her to never love anyone else. obviously, she'll never love anyone else as much as she loved derek. meredith is very strong and needs no man and i love the message they're sending by making her an incredible mother and a surgeon who went through hell. but i really don't want them to go through that route where she will never find love or have sex with anyone else because she lost derek.  strong, working mothers have needs too and they deserve a shot at love always. i mean, i don't like the idea of thinking that meredith only gets one love in her life. :/  i also want more scenes with her and the kids, zola way more grown up and thinking how awesome her mommy is and bing a great big sister to bailey and ellis. and oh, it would be amazing if they could mention cristina more."
greysanatomy,36r4eg,emalouise91,1 point,Fri May 22 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"I agree! I'm not an epic surgeon but I do have (nearly) 2 children and as much as I hate even thinking about it, if I lost my husband, I'd eventually want to find someone again. He wouldn't be near any replacement for my husband, because dude is the man of my dreams. BUT as you pointed out, what about companionship and affection? It'd take awhile but I think we'd all reach that point again, to one extent or another."
greysanatomy,36r4eg,TantCe,12,Sat May 23 03:35:40 2015 UTC,Some people have mentally stopped at season 11.  I'll keep watching until its over.  Its just one of those things.
greysanatomy,36rjtt,TheAquaticMoose,12,Thu May 21 15:40:05 2015 UTC,"I hope not. I need this show. It's my release, my music source, my inspiration & my family. I have trouble with things ending so i'm dreading the day."
greysanatomy,36rjtt,ImaCheeseMonkey,11,Thu May 21 16:35:26 2015 UTC,"my music source,   Ain't that the truth. Grey's never disappoints with music. Well... except for the constant ""How to Save a Life"" remixes."
greysanatomy,36rjtt,TheAquaticMoose,7,Thu May 21 18:34:18 2015 UTC,lol I can see how they'd get overwhelming but i personally think of Grey's & Scrubs when i hear it now. The Nilu version used in the recent season 11 finale is my favorite version of it right now. So somber and haunting
greysanatomy,36rjtt,ImaCheeseMonkey,2,Thu May 21 22:39:31 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to end after next season anyway, isn't it?"
greysanatomy,36rjtt,willawillawilla,6,Thu May 21 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"Nope. A few contracts are expiring (including Ellen Pompeo and Justin Chambers', both of whom have said they're in it for the long haul) but Shonda and ABC's president both intend for the show to progress past S12."
greysanatomy,36rjtt,ImaCheeseMonkey,3,Thu May 21 16:13:00 2015 UTC,"My mistake. I really don't want it to go on too much longer. ER got to a point where all of the major characters were gone and people slowly stopped watching. That seems to be the way that GA has headed.  I mean, we had 10 great years! Wouldn't it be nice to end the series when it's still flying a bit high rather than being a has-been? Just my two cents."
greysanatomy,36rjtt,willawillawilla,3,Thu May 21 16:20:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally. I bailed on ER around when Abby was becoming a doctor and not even John Stamos could bring me back. Grey's hasn't reached a point anywhere near that for me yet so I'm happy to see it continue, but who knows how much longer that will last. :("
greysanatomy,36rjtt,ImaCheeseMonkey,3,Thu May 21 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest- it rattled me when Lexie and Mark died a lot... but when they just killed Derek, I was borderline done. For some reason, Derek's death bothered me WAY more than it probably should have. I'm not sure if I will make time for Grey's on Thursday evenings come fall."
greysanatomy,36rjtt,willawillawilla,3,Thu May 21 16:44:51 2015 UTC,I get that. I'm mostly here for the drama (raised on soaps so I'm used to the crazy over-the-topness of it all) but Shonda is kinda terrible at writing characters out in satisfying ways. She did well with Cristina and. I think that's it?
greysanatomy,36rjtt,ImaCheeseMonkey,4,Thu May 21 17:04:35 2015 UTC,"I think they handled Mark's death really well.  He was one of my favorite characters, and I did NOT want him to die... however, the episode where they all reminisced about their time with him before they unhooked him was perfectly done. <3"
greysanatomy,36rjtt,willawillawilla,5,Thu May 21 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah true, Mark's was good! I just wish he and Lexie had a Shane/Cristina kind of exit, where one got an awesome job offer and the other went ""whoa wait I really don't want to lose you"" and they flew off into the sunset together nice and safe. :("
greysanatomy,36rjtt,Dilseacht,3,Thu May 21 19:26:19 2015 UTC,"For some reason it took awhile for me to realize that Lexie was actually dead.   And I just finished the last episode, and I was seriously tearing up when Amy was listening to his last voicemail."
greysanatomy,36rjtt,KateSix,3,Thu May 21 16:49:35 2015 UTC,"Personally I was a lot more bothered by Mark and Lexie's deaths than Derek's.  Lexie was one of my favorite characters, and they spent such a long time building up the sexual tension between them and making us hope for a reunion...  Then they both die.  Derek they did the opposite with.  They gave us a whole season of ""softening the blow.""  Of having him be a selfish jerk, of having Meredith figure out that she can be okay without him, of hinting that he was going to be leaving the show and showing us things could work without him..."
greysanatomy,36rjtt,Firecrotch2014,0,Thu May 21 21:01:18 2015 UTC,"I never warmed up to Lexie.  She was an annoying as fuck from day one.  I was rooting and cheering for her to die.  I didn't like how they handled Marks death though. Getting him all the way back to the hospital only to have him die days later.  I mean I know it reflects reality in a way but they were in a major airplane accident, none of them in reality should be alive."
greysanatomy,36rjtt,meapet,1 point,Thu May 21 23:55:18 2015 UTC,"I skipped season 14 because I wanted Abby to have her happy ending... but came back for the final season.  Losing most of the core cast killed it for me, and bringing back Carter brought me back."
greysanatomy,36rjtt,CaptaineAli,3,Fri Jun 5 23:11:38 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. Unless Meredith dies off or half the cast wants to leave because of something major, I don't think we have any reason to worry yet. I give Grey's another 3 seasons, probably more imo. I personally prefer going down a new story line with Meredith and Amelia living together (possibly Maggie too) which is something new and can refresh the show. We all know that the writers for Grey's know what they are doing after all.."
greysanatomy,36rjtt,NatalieMarie33,1 point,Fri May 22 00:50:09 2015 UTC,I think it will stick around for a little bit longer but not sure how much longer. Where is she going to take the characters from this point?

Early Greys was much more upbeat and almost a romcom, when the big thing was whose sleeping with who and the big syph outbreak. Now it is a lot more dramatic and dark, people die and there's children and heartbreak."
greysanatomy,36fpqq,BlueSquirl,12,Tue May 19 01:00:22 2015 UTC,"I think my favourite season would be season 2-- the original cast is done getting their footing and comfortable with their characters, but there is still so much great development and a great mix of humour and sadness."
greysanatomy,36fpqq,magic-school-bus,7,Tue May 19 04:44:27 2015 UTC,"I loved season 7. I don't want to spoil it for you or anyone else who hasn't gotten there yet, but I loved the mix of characters and it seemed to have a mix of both good and bad things happening to them. The characters went through situations that were relatable and while there were some huge crises there was enough time for character development, too."
greysanatomy,36fpqq,followthepost-its,2,Tue May 19 03:21:45 2015 UTC,I second this 7 & 8 are my favorites so far

Season 1-3 are one year, season 4-5 are a second year, after that every season is about a year in real-time, which makes season 8 their final year of residency and I really liked that about it.  But 4 is my favorite, into 5, then 7 and 8 are tied, then 6.  But they're all really close."
greysanatomy,36fpqq,growling_puppy,4,Tue May 19 20:54:17 2015 UTC,"Probably unpopular for most, but I like season 9 best. 9.14 is my favorite episode.

greysanatomy,365xgb,DarcyFinch,24,Sat May 16 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"I want Amy to find some gosh darn happiness for once! She's my favourite character, though I don't really like the whole ""I'm such a genius"" thing she's been doing recently. With the amount of shit she's been put through, I wanna see her find love. Hopefully with Owen. They both deserve some kind of happiness."
greysanatomy,365xgb,mistlet03,25,Sat May 16 14:12:35 2015 UTC,"Goddamnit, Shonda, just let those two crazy kids get together and have kids. Then kill Owen, 'cos you're a monster."
greysanatomy,365xgb,Knight117,15,Sat May 16 15:02:00 2015 UTC,I really want Owen or Amelia to buy Meredith's house and then they can move in there and fill it with babies and live happily ever after (or as happily as one can in Shondaland).
greysanatomy,365xgb,hiddenstar13,2,Sat May 16 15:29:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think the dream house needs to stay in the family. And they do need to live happily ever after"
greysanatomy,365xgb,Risaga54,5,Wed May 20 09:21:39 2015 UTC,I was a huge fan of her on Private Practice and I'd love her to have happiness after everything she's been through. Owen deserves it too.
greysanatomy,365xgb,specificbarista,2,Sat May 16 23:44:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I think she shouldn't be modest about her skills. She operated on the inoperable, she deserves to act like the genius she is in my opinion.  And I hope so too, I always hated Owen, hopefully he doesn't ruin her though."
greysanatomy,365xgb,LosIslenos,1 point,Sat May 16 15:34:12 2015 UTC,Amy?
greysanatomy,365xgb,mistlet03,3,Sat May 16 22:22:00 2015 UTC,Amelia Shephard. Derek always called her Amy.
greysanatomy,365xgb,lnh92,23,Sat May 16 22:30:55 2015 UTC,I'd love Meredith to make a break through in some Alzheimer's research. That would be awesome.   I also want Bailey to become totally badass!
greysanatomy,365xgb,growling_puppy,7,Sat May 16 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm not so sure. Maybe being involved in a clinical trial set by Amelia, but not having Mer conduct the research; she is a general surgeon after all. I'd rather have her continue the research on diabetes or go on with printing the portal vein. What happened to that?"
greysanatomy,365xgb,followthepost-its,6,Sat May 16 15:37:01 2015 UTC,"She failed to meet her objectives/goals in a set time and the grant money dried up.  Her research into printing portal veins failed.  I'd like to see her return to the diabetes trial though. Continue her mother's work.  And I want her to stay in the dream house!  I don't want to go back to the frat house where Alex lives now.  I love the dream house it's so pretty.  Mer should fill it with people.  Mer, her three kids, Amelia, and have Owen move in too.  Bring Maggie in.  Make it the new frat house.  It's sooooo much prettier."
greysanatomy,365xgb,glaceauglaceau,8,Sat May 16 15:58:19 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel it's disrespectful to Derek to just give away/sell their house; he took 5 seasons to build it! Then again, nothing says Grey's Anatomy to me like Meredith's old home, it's just so nostalgic!"
greysanatomy,365xgb,Risaga54,5,Sat May 16 16:04:28 2015 UTC,I'd be okay with it if Amy bought it. Or Owen. Or the 2 of them together.
greysanatomy,365xgb,carlyerj10,1 point,Sat May 16 17:43:02 2015 UTC,If Amy bought it it'd stay in the family at least.
greysanatomy,365xgb,lnh92,3,Sat May 16 20:08:20 2015 UTC,That'd be great to see. I always find it weird that these surgeons with great salaries live in trailers or with a million roommates. Like...why don't you have your own place?
greysanatomy,365xgb,hpquest,1 point,Sun May 17 00:47:54 2015 UTC,"They're all very good friends and with the long hours its easier to share the cooking/cleaning etc. that they don't hire out. Also, a lot of them are single with kids so it's built in help there."
greysanatomy,365xgb,hiddenstar13,1 point,Wed May 20 09:23:15 2015 UTC,I think it's more like a friendship thing than a financial one.

greysanatomy,365xgb,turkeysrule,2,Sun May 17 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"That was what I was thinking.  Like Meredith is involved in the research, maybe she helps with the I initial idea or something."
greysanatomy,365xgb,followthepost-its,2,Sat May 16 16:59:44 2015 UTC,I can't stand Meredith anymore - I know she's been through a lot but I think she is selfish and childish. I would like if they gave her a professional storyline to work on her character from a different view.
greysanatomy,365xgb,hpquest,14,Tue May 19 13:36:46 2015 UTC,Did you watch Private Practice? I was pretty happy with how they wrapped up Addison's story so I wouldn't want to see her show up again.   I'm mad at April. I know she's found her passion or whatever but surely she knew that she'd have to put some work into her marriage at some point. You're surprised when Jackson doesn't want to stay all alone while you go off to dangerous places to live a crazy trauma surgeon life without him? Please.   I want Owen & Amelia to be happy together and make lots of perfect babies. They deserve a break. They're good for each other. Amelia is my favourite.   Totally agree about Meredith. She's done some awesome work so hopefully we'll see her keep researching and get some recognition for it!  Alex & Jo make me so happy. I was scared for them in that finale but then they smooched in a dirty warehouse (or whatever that place is where Jo wants to live) and now the future looks bright <3
greysanatomy,365xgb,turkeysrule,3,Sat May 16 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did, and I agree, but having her come back for an episode or two requiring her surgical skills would not disrupt her story so that's what I'd be looking forward to.  I never liked April, but I did these past two episodes. I know she's really unfair, but for the first time she found out what really makes her happy. I'd rather they break up and both become awesome surgeons than staying in an unhappy marriage. But again, never really been a fan of Japril :P  And about Jo and Alex, I didn't think they were gonna break up for a second. It just seemed absurd plot-wise. I'm a hardcore Grey's fan, like seriously hardcore, but I wouldn't keep on watching had they broken up. The amount of physical/emotional trauma these characters can take has a limit!"
greysanatomy,365xgb,turkeysrule,12,Sat May 16 15:53:28 2015 UTC,"Sarah Drew is signed on for s12, and assuming she doesn't break contract, one of these three things may happen:  April either leaves and comes back, OR she changes her mind, OR something happens between the last episode of s11 and the first of s12, so she can't leave."
greysanatomy,365xgb,No_Day_But_Today93,8,Sat May 16 14:08:54 2015 UTC,I smell baby!
greysanatomy,365xgb,JumpyBlueberry,4,Sat May 16 15:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was going to suggest a baby too.. But Shonda hates pregnant women :/"
greysanatomy,365xgb,mistlet03,10,Sat May 16 15:38:44 2015 UTC,"Not even Shonda would kill her second baby, right?   And Meredith gave birth twice despite her hostile uterus so she's not all that bad haha"
greysanatomy,365xgb,No_Day_But_Today93,7,Sat May 16 15:49:18 2015 UTC,Sarah Drew was the one who came up with the idea of her baby being terminal.
greysanatomy,365xgb,hippiesinthewind,3,Sat May 16 17:44:20 2015 UTC,I wonder if they had planned on the Jackson-April baby storyline at any time in the future or just thought of it to cover up her real life pregnancy? The second option would kind of explain killing the baby - they needed her pregnant but didn't want another kid on the scene. (Like in Friends when they made Phoebe a surrogate so she could be pregnant but not become a mother.)
greysanatomy,365xgb,No_Day_But_Today93,0,Sat May 16 23:59:38 2015 UTC,"I know, all I'm saying is that it seems highly unlikely that the same would happen to a second baby."
greysanatomy,365xgb,hippiesinthewind,3,Sat May 16 20:12:01 2015 UTC,I hope not.. That would be awful.
greysanatomy,365xgb,GallbladderGone,11,Sat May 16 15:53:48 2015 UTC,"And then we get an April voice-over: ""The carousel never stops turning"" with Shonda laughing in the background."

greysanatomy,365xgb,Risaga54,7,Sat May 16 16:01:26 2015 UTC,Izzie is never coming back. Shonda will not have her on set.
greysanatomy,365xgb,Ttucrabtree,3,Sat May 16 17:44:02 2015 UTC,I would hate to see Izzie come back. They ruined her character by the time she departed and having her show up after this long for a quick wrap up would be terrible. I hope Shonda sticks to her guns and never brings her back.
greysanatomy,365xgb,mistlet03,4,Sun May 17 22:52:03 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, Shonda uses her as an insult; 'to pull a Heigl' whenever anyone's being a diva. But still, I'd like to believe that Shonda values her characters more than real life drama and brings her back for one final episode."
greysanatomy,365xgb,tinnie75,2,Sat May 16 20:10:59 2015 UTC,"Do you know what even happened to her? Why won't she have her on set? I'd heard that Burke originally left because Washington said something homophobic to George's actor, but I never heard anything about Izzy's departure."
greysanatomy,365xgb,litspark,6,Sat May 16 18:39:01 2015 UTC,She refused an Emmy (or some other award) because she didn't think the writing she got deserved it.
greysanatomy,365xgb,randomwords2014,3,Sat May 16 18:52:44 2015 UTC,I think the official reason she gave of why she left was because she wanted to spend more time with her family   Edit: she adopted a daughter in September 2009 and her last episode aired January 10th 2010
greysanatomy,365xgb,litspark,2,Sat May 16 22:13:15 2015 UTC,I thought she said she wanted to go make movies.
greysanatomy,365xgb,hpquest,2,Sat May 16 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"I've been reading some articles, and it kinda seems like it was both, after she left she continued to star in movies but she also said she was missing out on her daughters life.

greysanatomy,365xgb,HSTeacher4293,13,Sun May 17 05:12:10 2015 UTC,"Baily will lose chief to the person she's competing with.  Meredith will get a new love interest, (probably that new McDreamy intern everyone thought was an attending.) Richard will die sometime during the season. Kepner & Avery will have a child. Her giving birth will be the midseason finale, during a catastrophe hitting Seattle. Amelia will take over a secret project of dereks he was working on to make breakthroughs with Alzheimer disease. Christina will cameo to give a lecture about her bionic hearts. Owen will see a ghost. Karev and Jo's wedding will be the season 12 final ep."
greysanatomy,365xgb,BakerKadda,4,Sat May 16 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"Either that, or prefereably, she goes back to being the Nazi and kicks the crap outta them. Too soon in my opinion, plus, her love interest should be a much more seasoned character. I know this would parallel what happened between her and Derek, but Mer's been through so much. I do think that's a major probability. *Would be awesome! *Again,  awesome. Ghost sex again, yay. Definitely!"
greysanatomy,365xgb,manalig,6,Sat May 16 17:04:24 2015 UTC,mama Avery LOVES April. maybe she'll be her candidate? we know she loves to meddle and this would give her a chance to save her son's marriage.
greysanatomy,365xgb,beccaonice,2,Sat May 16 18:43:57 2015 UTC,Isn't she supposed to pick an outside contender?
greysanatomy,365xgb,manalig,1 point,Sun May 17 00:19:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but maybe, JUST maybe, I thought it could be Meredith since she managed to talk down two of the most powerful people in the hospital. With Cristina owning her own hospital it doesn't seem too far-fetched."
greysanatomy,365xgb,charliemilana,1 point,Sun May 17 09:34:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but raising 3 kids on her own it's unlikely she'd try for more work."

greysanatomy,365xgb,Sraniale,5,Sat May 16 20:15:43 2015 UTC,That episode should have been the finale. Maybe it'll actually be that way.
greysanatomy,365xgb,Peevesie,5,Sat May 16 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it gives enough closure to be the finale. We don't know what's going to happen to Jackson and April, we don't know what's going to happen with Amelia and Owen, there's no closure for Callie and Arizona moving on with their lives, the new interns just got introduced etc etc. I think they left too many loose strings to have been able to leave it there."
greysanatomy,362gwu,flakyred,4,Fri May 15 15:17:44 2015 UTC,I don't even have to watch the clip to know what you're referring to because I immediately thought the same thing.

greysanatomy,362gwu,Im_not_weird,7,Fri May 15 16:57:38 2015 UTC,It is. But I think OP is referring to how Mer's dance moves were similar to Derek's from an old scene.
greysanatomy,362gwu,loginyousay,2,Fri May 15 17:04:05 2015 UTC,That makes sense :-)
greysanatomy,362gwu,loginyousay,2,Fri May 15 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"Yes that is exactly what I meant. thank you /u/loginyousay. I have seen Mer and Christina dance it out so many times, but that particular shoulder shake of hers immediately made me think of Derek, so I searched for Derek's move and it did seem very similar. I really dont think she did it on purpose but it was a fun thing to observe for me."
greysanatomy,362gwu,hpquest,2,Sat May 16 20:13:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't remember that and the video didn't work at the time, so that's why I got it wrong :-) I can totally see what you mean! All thanks should go to /u/Im_not_weird for clearing it up^"
greysanatomy,362gwu,kellerella131,2,Sat May 16 21:16:22 2015 UTC,I can't stand the dance it out thing in general. It would be cute/funny if it just happened now and then but Meredith and Cristina having a name for it and the show pushing it down our throats ruined it for me.
greysanatomy,362gwu,eltytan,3,Tue May 19 12:45:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice that, but I absolutely LOVE that you did!  It made me happy."

greysanatomy,360gfj,NoBlueKoolAid,15,Sun May 17 00:10:14 2015 UTC,"Yes they took vows, but April is being really selfish. Jackson lost his son too and she can't just expect him to grieve the loss of Samuel alone while she jets off into a combat zone. He let her go once and has the right to now ask her to see his side."
greysanatomy,360gfj,dennydoo15,14,Mon May 18 02:55:13 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  The parting happened when she opted out and went off to the 3-month trip that turned into a year, then wanted to go back without regard to her spouse's feelings in the matter.  He's not ending it if he makes it clear that a second trip would be fatal to the marriage.  Just as with time of death and to use her own words from the scene, he's ""calling it."""
greysanatomy,360gfj,NoBlueKoolAid,5,Mon May 18 09:00:16 2015 UTC,I have never been a fan of Avery at all but I totally felt for him in this episode. I understand April is dealing with a horrible tragedy but so is she! If they were truly right for each other I don't know that she would want to leave him.

greysanatomy,360gfj,dennydoo15,5,Mon May 18 02:57:24 2015 UTC,Season 4 ended on a really awesome uptick too.

greysanatomy,360gfj,ITS-A-JACKAL,12,Tue May 19 08:16:15 2015 UTC,"There are a number of things that I don't really want to go into but the best example for me is the episode where they killed off Derek.   First, the crash happens and there is no cell signal and no traffic--to the point where they wait for the fire to indicate to emergency services that they may be needed.  Derek treats the victims, then hands off their care to EMTs and Paramedics--something that would never happen. You don't pass someone off in the field to someone ""lower in the hierarchy"", so to speak. He should have taken his own car and followed them to the hospital, at a minimum.  Then, Derek starts to leave and apparently all the emergency services (police, firefighters, etc.) are all gone--when in fact they would all be last at the scene. This is important in a sec.  Derek starts to leave and consciously pulls into the lane of oncoming traffic on the road, and simultaneously his phone starts ringing--even though they were supposedly in a dead zone, as mentioned previously.  Our brilliant neurosurgeon Derek, after being involved in an accident that resulted in grievous injury, decides to look at his cell phone and see why it's ringing even though he's in the middle of pulling out into traffic. When he fumbles his phone, he keeps looking for it.  A truck appears out of nowhere. There has been literally 0 traffic on this road from the start (except for the cars with Derek, the victims, and eventually emergency services) and suddenly a truck appears going ridiculously fast.  He doesn't slow approaching a sharp turn (where his truck could conceivably ""slip out""), even despite seeing smoke (presumably) from the wreckage. Nor does he slow down for the emergency services that are there controlling traffic to the area, as they should, because the emergency services are not there. This also delays indefinitely their response to Derek's accident.  Suddenly, the ambulance decides to take several people who are clearly trauma victims to a hospital that is not a trauma center. They still force the victims onto the hospital instead of going to one of the many nearby trauma centers previously mentioned in the series.  At the hospital, the boy (who arrived much earlier than Derek) has clear brain and neurological trauma--yet their neurosurgeon is at a dinner? And despite being on call, he takes over three hours to respond?  Oh, and the kicker is that earlier in the episode, on the phone, Amelia (I believe?) was talking about how much traffic Derek was going to have on his way.  Get the picture?"
greysanatomy,360gfj,TheSuperSax,4,Tue May 19 14:58:37 2015 UTC,"I do. I just marathoned the whole series, I haven't been watching for years.

greysanatomy,360gfj,ITS-A-JACKAL,3,Tue May 19 19:35:32 2015 UTC,Well that's exactly why I'm thinking of just saying enough is enough and quitting.  I took a break after the whole ghost sex fiasco for the same reason.

greysanatomy,360gfj,ITS-A-JACKAL,2,Tue May 19 19:51:16 2015 UTC,Hey me to I started in early mid -late March finished all  seasons the other day
greysanatomy,360gfj,suicidaljoker7,1 point,Sun May 24 00:47:08 2015 UTC,Same! I'm so lost what to watch now. I'm doing scrubs to stay with the hospital theme but it's not on Netflix so it's annoying!
greysanatomy,360gfj,ITS-A-JACKAL,2,Mon May 25 03:37:47 2015 UTC,"yeah i dont think id like scrubs, was gonna try and watch a show called Emergency Room, but im gonna finish off watching the mentalist as the storyline continutes with the main characters, also for scrubs  have you tried watching it on a website?"
greysanatomy,360gfj,suicidaljoker7,10,Mon May 25 03:53:17 2015 UTC,"As somebody who will not be a returning viewer next season, I thought and felt the same thing. So this was basically the series finale for me, and the more I thought about that the more I cried because I grew up watching this show (literally, I was 14 when Grey's first started)"
greysanatomy,360gfj,ReverieSoul,2,Sun May 17 21:34:04 2015 UTC,Also strongly considering getting off the Grey's train. It's been a long time coming and that episode was a good enough series finale for me.
greysanatomy,360gfj,TheSuperSax,5,Tue May 19 00:59:46 2015 UTC,That's exactly how I felt too ... I hope Shonda doesn't screw things up royally next season!
greysanatomy,360gfj,dennydoo15,4,Mon May 18 02:59:48 2015 UTC,You and I both know she will.
greysanatomy,360gfj,20greenshades,3,Mon May 18 07:27:05 2015 UTC,"you're so perfectly right. I loved the endsentences with the sun, because Cristina told Mer that she was the sun :) This made me really happy."
greysanatomy,360gfj,BakerKadda,1 point,Mon May 18 18:41:08 2015 UTC,Guess we won't be seeing Cristina for one last time :'( BUT SHE WAS THE BEST!!!!!!
greysanatomy,360gfj,asumakitschy,47,Wed May 20 12:54:42 2015 UTC,Remember at the beginning of the season when Mer lost her shit when Maggie told her she was her sister? Fast forward to the season finale and Mer is really sweet to Maggie and telling her that she can always confide in her. I hope Maggie and Amelia move in with Meredith and the kids in Ellis' house. They can lean on each other.
greysanatomy,360gfj,sports_and_wine,64,Fri May 15 12:33:48 2015 UTC,3 kids grow up with a single parent and two live in aunts...sounds like Full House.
greysanatomy,360gfj,JessicaMcStevens,28,Fri May 15 14:59:30 2015 UTC,Huh I just realized that the plot of Fuller House (new spin-off coming to Netflix) is the same plot as the end to this season.  DJ's husband dies while she is pregnant with the third child.  Her sister (Stephanie) and friend (Kimmie) move in to help raise her kids.  Weird parallel if Maggie and Amelia move in with Meredith.
greysanatomy,360gfj,EngineerBabe,15,Fri May 15 15:38:12 2015 UTC,Wait what. Is this real? Really real?
greysanatomy,360gfj,willawillawilla,6,Fri May 15 16:33:12 2015 UTC,The new Full House? Yeah. It's real.
greysanatomy,360gfj,EngineerBabe,9,Fri May 15 17:04:15 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, Stephanie's even an aspiring musician like Uncle Jesse was! I mean if the format worked before, stick with it I guess?"
greysanatomy,360gfj,willawillawilla,10,Fri May 15 17:18:50 2015 UTC,I always envisioned Stephanie taking over for Danny on Wake Up San Francisco.
greysanatomy,360gfj,sports_and_wine,4,Fri May 15 22:51:03 2015 UTC,Or following after Dave Coulier's character in some way. She was so silly.

greysanatomy,360gfj,inspctrgdgt,7,Sun Jun 7 23:00:04 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda hoping for a season 1 type thing. Meredith moves into her old house with the kids, and lets Amelia stay in the woods house then Maggie moves in with her and so does Callie or Arizona or someone..the new house of doctors!"
greysanatomy,360gfj,kalijean4913,6,Fri May 15 18:35:50 2015 UTC,And they can teach Zola how to dance it out.
greysanatomy,360gfj,sports_and_wine,25,Fri May 15 22:51:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm watching Veep in an attempt to stop tearing up. I thought it was as good as it could have been. And we actually got to SEE Derek leaving the message. Meredith is so strong. Is it weird that I'm proud of a TV character?  I mean, I've been watching the past 10 years, ya know?  But she's gone through so much and is doing so well, considering. I have had a lot of bad things happen to me as well, so maybe it's just that I relate to her.  I mean, she's kind of my hero...a little bit. (I sound like an idiot, I'm sure)  I didn't know if I should come read the sub or not because I haven't been here in a few weeks and didn't know what the general consensus was regarding Grey's post-Derek. I didn't know if it was just a bunch of angry, bored (with the show) people haha.  I wanted to talk to other people who could at least see a silver lining after Derek.  Initially, I was like ""NEVER WATCHING AGAIN"".  Then I watched the episode.  Then I watched the next one, and the next one, and the next one (this one).  How is it that it's still good without a Derek & Meredith dynamic?  I don't know, but from the last few episodes, it really is still an amazing show.  ""The sun will rise again...""   Edit: word"
greysanatomy,360gfj,greenconverse11,8,Fri May 15 04:10:54 2015 UTC,"I will definitely keep watching (never said I would stop anyway but :D), I liked the last few episodes and I'm excited about another season. The only thing I am not looking forward to at all is a new love interest for Mer, which will probably happen at some point.."
greysanatomy,360gfj,itcametothis,6,Fri May 15 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"I'm still unsure as to whether it would happen or not.  In TV world, it usually does.  In real life, if I lost my husband, that would be it for me.  If they do it, I just hope they do it right."
greysanatomy,360gfj,greenconverse11,4,Fri May 15 15:38:23 2015 UTC,Yeah... It might also depend on how many more seasons they want to do/are hoping to get because it might be too soon to bring in a potential love interest next season already.
greysanatomy,360gfj,itcametothis,9,Fri May 15 15:52:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe the whole show will end with her sitting in the bar after a good day at work (in other words, she's happy) and having a stranger sit down next to her and offer to buy her a drink.  She looks at him, smiles, fade to black."
greysanatomy,360gfj,greenconverse11,4,Fri May 15 15:58:11 2015 UTC,That would be kind of perfect!
greysanatomy,360gfj,itcametothis,7,Fri May 15 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"I think there's still a bit of the dynamic there, in finding out how his death is effecting her. I was a big fan of this episode, found myself wondering how they'd rebound from Derek's death and they've done a really good job with it. It keeps me wondering what's going to happen next.  Still trying to find out what kind of voodoo world we're living in where nothing bad happens during the season finale, but frankly, it's a nice change of pace."
greysanatomy,360gfj,Blues574,5,Fri May 15 15:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was so glad for a happy finale. Maybe they realized we NEEDED one and gave us a break from the tears. haha"
greysanatomy,360gfj,greenconverse11,3,Fri May 15 15:39:19 2015 UTC,Well they probably figured people were still reeling in derek's death.  Im sure they wanted to do something feel good to bring people back from the brink.
greysanatomy,360gfj,Firecrotch2014,2,Sun May 17 11:22:33 2015 UTC,Haha I'm just catching up now and had Veep lined up afterwards for the same reason!
greysanatomy,360gfj,roflmoar,1 point,Mon May 18 06:22:25 2015 UTC,Honestly i havent liked Derek since he tried to claim Meredith kept him from taking the DC job in the first place.  Thats when he became McDouchebag.  If you love and care for your wife and family thats what you stay for.  You dont blame them for holding you back.  Theyre not a weight tied to your ankle meant to sink you to the bottom of the ocean.  He never redeemed himself in my eyes either.  I feel like the only reason he rushed home and quit his job in DC was cause he and that other doctor shared a kiss.  I hope they will revisit this next season.  Im thinking she will try to track him down in Seattle.  Meredith will recognize her voice from the phone when she picked it up.
greysanatomy,360gfj,Firecrotch2014,22,Sun May 17 11:20:02 2015 UTC,That was an amazing episode. The dance it out part made me make a really big smile =D Jo and Alex having their own home was the perfect decision!
greysanatomy,360gfj,DragonDDark,18,Fri May 15 13:48:25 2015 UTC,"I noticed that they played How to Save a Life (for about the 5th time this season alone) and Running on Sunshine, both of which were sung in the musical episode. Actually was How to Save a Life sung by the cast? I guess I better start at episode 1 and watch through to that episode to find out."
greysanatomy,360gfj,oneshorts,6,Sat May 16 02:31:45 2015 UTC,They've been playing a lot of Chasing Cars too (they played that when Meredith pulled the plug on Derek).
greysanatomy,360gfj,asumakitschy,12,Wed May 20 12:57:24 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ. I watched the episode in a library around other people and Derek's voicemail fucking made me cry.   This was a truly wonderful episode with a wonderful theme. Tomorrow the sun will rise. Shonda's put us through some shit this season, and there are legitimate criticisms for some of the things she did, but this episode gives me great hope for next season. I for one do not want the show to finally start winding down. If they can keep serving up good stuff like this, I'll keep eating it up."
greysanatomy,360gfj,joethetipper,6,Fri May 15 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"I also really enjoyed this season finale, in that it's pushing me to keep watching since dealing with Derek's death. I love how it ended with the black-and-white still shot of Meredith smiling with the ""Grey's Anatomy"" overlay instead of just cutting to the normal black with it. All in all, this episode really sparked it back up for me & ended it with a desire to keep watching. From addressing a lot of concerns for me (building off of Amelia's anger from not getting called to how upset I was for Jackson not getting focused on his grief for losing his and Kepner's child to Jo & Alex and Mama Avery & Webber--all of it getting addressed in such a good way helped keep me hooked for sure."
greysanatomy,360gfj,anothersoapbox,9,Sat May 16 02:50:55 2015 UTC,"I wonder what'll happen to Sarah Drew and her character. By the looks of it, April is leaving to head to Jordan, so are they cutting her out completely or are they making a de-tour in the storyline as it looks right now? Hmm.."
greysanatomy,360gfj,turkeysrule,19,Fri May 15 14:30:59 2015 UTC,She is signed on for next season.  I imagine either something comes up and she doesn't go OR they do a time jump and she's already done her X months and is back at Seattle Grace Mercy Death.
greysanatomy,360gfj,JessicaMcStevens,37,Fri May 15 15:00:17 2015 UTC,Yeah but... Patrick Dempsey is signed on for next season.
greysanatomy,360gfj,nonnymouse,7,Fri May 15 16:16:24 2015 UTC,touche.
greysanatomy,360gfj,JessicaMcStevens,13,Sat May 16 20:30:43 2015 UTC,I can see something coming up or she changes her mind. She seemed pretty heartbroken that Jackson wouldn't wait for her. I hope they don't do another ridiculous time jump.. That would be silly.
greysanatomy,360gfj,turkeysrule,12,Fri May 15 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"My prediction: April commits to go, finds out she is pregnant, and comes back."
greysanatomy,360gfj,hyppolita,12,Sat May 16 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"April is going to ""Africa"".  That really worked out well in season 7.  (Arizona reference in case anyone misses it.)"
greysanatomy,360gfj,Mortehl,6,Sat May 16 03:31:26 2015 UTC,Betcha she doesn't go ... her Christian morals will make her stay and try to fix her marriage which will cause all sorts of drama with Jackson. Life can't be all peachy and wonderful all season for everyone!

greysanatomy,360gfj,winkhun,6,Sun May 17 19:18:50 2015 UTC,"In a way I kind of want this show to last forever. Like, even Meredith can leave eventually. We'll just see a continuation of rotating interns, residents, attendings, and chiefs, forever."

greysanatomy,360gfj,ProlapsePotato,3,Fri May 15 23:45:35 2015 UTC,"Of course it is a bit of bullshit, but it made me happy on the inside. With Bailey becoming (most likely) Head of Surgery (finally!) and with everything she went on about last season (when she was in her Lab and Cristana and Meredith both were doing amazing stuff (with the printer) she was saying speaking about how she raised & trained them). I kinda liked the scene, but you are right for sure, those interns were stupid af."
greysanatomy,360gfj,CaptaineAli,3,Sat May 16 13:25:23 2015 UTC,I also thought it was very reminiscent of how Baily took responsibility for Denny after her interns essentially killed him.

I was so tired of seeing Richard get run rough-shod through all the seasons these two have been together.(i love the character otherwise...you can tell she cares about everyone she is connected to in the hospital.  Also Debbie Allen is a dynamite actress.  I hope she becomes a regular.)

greysanatomy,360kax,frostpudding,22,Fri May 15 02:00:46 2015 UTC,Why watch the whole series and just quit because one person dies? Did you quit watching when George died? Or when Cristina left? Stick with it. It gets better.

I kept watching because I had like 100 more episodes left. That's my explanation for George.  Cristina LEFT the show, she didn't die. Didn't hit home too hard for me.  I don't care too much for the rest of the characters. Everyone seems so grown up, and at the beginning it was a learning experience - all of the medical terms and procedures.

I felt like I'd just wasted 10 years (because I started watching from the beginning). I was angry. It was like real grief.  I swore I'd never watch again.  I hadn't even seen the episode in which he died. It was spoiled for me and I was pretty adamant about NEVER watching again.  I told everyone.  But then (in the whole ""grieving"" process thing), I felt like I needed closure.  So I watched it right before the next episode aired.  The next episode really was amazing.  They handle Meredith's grief so well.  I thought it was perfect the way they did it. Then I was like ""Well, maybe I'll keep watching...""  so then I watched the last two episodes and it is still a really really amazing show, and I find that it's OKAY to watch it without Derek and that it can work without them together, although it still makes me sad.  So I would say YES.  At least finish out the season and give yourself a chance to make an informed opinion.  Cause at first I was just like you and now I'm definitely going to continue to watch for as long as the show runs."

greysanatomy,360kax,No_Day_But_Today93,5,Fri May 15 12:51:04 2015 UTC,I think the writing/plot has been absolutely terrible. Save yourself a few hours and don't bother watching.
greysanatomy,360kax,DragonDDark,3,Fri May 15 03:58:12 2015 UTC,I disagree ... I thought the last few episodes have been really good. The scenes between Mer and Amelia are so spot on for them.
greysanatomy,35xw37,charliemilana,6,Thu May 14 12:56:07 2015 UTC,I just finishing binging PP so I could get Amelia's back story (I didn't watch it while it was airing). I felt like it was an easter egg hunt when trying to pick out who I remembered from GA
greysanatomy,35xw37,mini381,2,Fri May 15 12:24:58 2015 UTC,I'm so glad I'm not the only one to have noticed these

greysanatomy,35yf3t,Sorkijan,7,Thu May 14 15:38:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen much discussion on it and maybe I missed something  during the episode, but what's up with Maggie and that phone call with her mom? Her parents divorce maybe?"
greysanatomy,35yf3t,Theclaaw,3,Thu May 14 18:42:51 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking divorce, too. Or maybe something happened that might not have happened if Maggie was still in Boston? A health thing, or a money thing, or a family thing."
greysanatomy,35yf3t,willawillawilla,2,Thu May 14 18:58:52 2015 UTC,Maybe something which helps her get closer to Richard?
greysanatomy,35yf3t,Happy_Bee,2,Thu May 14 21:49:52 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that too. Something that will keep her ""home"" in Seattle with Mer and Richard since home seems to be the theme for the night."
greysanatomy,35yf3t,Theclaaw,1 point,Thu May 14 22:55:16 2015 UTC,My guess is some sort of health issue with her dad.
greysanatomy,35yf3t,ChaoticCrayon,6,Thu May 14 21:46:08 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest here, I'm having a tough time deciding between watching this finale and watching The Vampire Diaries' finale. Usually it's no contest with Grey's winning but part of me expects this finale to be tame after the shit we just went through with Derek. Plus TVD had a crazy cliffhanger last episode and a major star is leaving with this finale. I wish both shows were still at different times, it was nice one year being able to watch both finales back-to-back.  Anyone know of anything juicy for the Grey's finale to sway me over?"
greysanatomy,35yf3t,jedispyder,5,Thu May 14 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. I'm leaning towards TVD since there is bound to be some good twists. With Grey's I feel like tonight's episode is a bit predictable. April and Jackson will most likely break up (given preview clip) and the Chief and Catherine will break off their engagement. Since they already killed off Derek, I feel like what more can they do to shock us?"
greysanatomy,35yf3t,veganalamode,4,Thu May 14 16:19:35 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for Grey's finale tonight, but TVD has a character actually leaving the series. I'll likely watch Grey's  tomorrow on Hulu. though I do realize I'd risk missing out on some crazy drama c/o Shonda..."
greysanatomy,35yf3t,carlyerj10,3,Thu May 14 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly. They're not going to kill off anyone else. I do predict something is going to happen with Karev and Jo after the big discussion last episode, maybe she leaves to go on duty?"
greysanatomy,35yf3t,jedispyder,3,Thu May 14 16:34:29 2015 UTC,I think you might be right about that! I love Jo though so I hope not but that is a good possibility. Seems like tonight will mostly be revolving around couples and the guy trapped in the car.
greysanatomy,35yf3t,veganalamode,2,Thu May 14 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"That's what it sounds like. If so, I can wait until it's streaming to watch it then. Or....maybe I can tape it on VHS. I haven't thought of ""taping"" a show in so long. I'll have to give it a try when I get home, I'm pretty sure I have an old antennae that should work on that ancient behemoth of a CRT tv, lol."
greysanatomy,35yf3t,jedispyder,3,Thu May 14 16:46:52 2015 UTC,And then maybe something happens to her and Karev leans on Meredith to help him with his guilty conscience of 'letting her go'.  Then Meredith and the kids move back into Meredith's old house with Karev - and they both dwell together in sadness and regret true Shonda style.  Then maybe something beautiful and heart warming happens with Karev being a father figure to the kids but I just can't bring myself to ship Meredith/Karev - maybe he'll just be a really good friend instead (not that he isn't already but I feel it's been kind of forced since Yang left).
greysanatomy,35yf3t,Happy_Bee,2,Thu May 14 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like that'd be a good way to leave this season , and a good foundation so they're both in a good place for next season. I'm getting excited to see now! I hope you're right!"
greysanatomy,35yf3t,carlyerj10,2,Thu May 14 23:28:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be so sure about the not killing anyone off bit. Not saying you are wrong but I do think Shonda would be that mean.
greysanatomy,35yf3t,MrsDowey,2,Thu May 14 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"Shonda is most definitely that mean but I'm hoping not. We'll have to see. And if she does kill someone off, who would it be? Not one of the core cast, maybe some of the newbies? Or maybe the whole discussion of living will that Bailey had with Ben was a warning sign?"
greysanatomy,35yf3t,jedispyder,2,Thu May 14 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"Well....She cannot kill Bailey, ( DO YOU HEAR ME SHONDA ) , but maybe Ben. I wouldn't really be sad if he died, I would be sad for Bailey but I am pretty indifferent towards Ben. I can't think of who else it would/could be. Maybe someone totally unexpected, like April or Jo goes off to enlist and they time jump and someone gets the military chaplain visit. (please don't do this, ok Greys?)"
greysanatomy,35yf3t,MrsDowey,2,Thu May 14 19:14:08 2015 UTC,"I really don't want another time jump, we already lost a year :("
greysanatomy,35yf3t,jedispyder,1 point,Thu May 14 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"You know, the idea that all the will discussion between Bailey & Ben never made me think it was foreshadowing. But you REALLY could be on to something!"

greysanatomy,35yf3t,MrsDowey,6,Thu May 14 19:01:38 2015 UTC,"True THAT. Remember when Arizona comes back to Callie from Malawi and Callie says ""I am 100% certain you will hurt me if I let you back in my life"". DON'T DO IT CALLIE"

I feel like this season has had some majors shockers. What else does Shonda have up her sleeve?? My prediction; April DOESN'T leave, Weber and Dr. Avery break up once and for all and Mer moves back into her mom's old house with her kids."
greysanatomy,35yf3t,shakespearesister319,3,Thu May 14 21:59:55 2015 UTC,i would love to see mer living in the old house with alex. justin chambers is such a natural with kids (he's got 5 of his own!)

I keep reading about how lovable she is, but no matter how many times I rewatch, I just can't bring myself to like her. I spend a lot of time wondering if it's April I dont like, or Sarah Drew's mannerisms that just annoy the crap out of me."
greysanatomy,35x7z2,sunflowerstorm,2,Tue May 19 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"I have disliked her from day one. I know she's supposed to have grown from the squeaky-voiced whiny virgin, but I still see her as pretty much the same. I just dislike everything about her character, she's so damn self-righteous. And twice she was ""gone"" and then got brought back."
greysanatomy,35x7z2,beccaonice,3,Wed May 20 12:07:49 2015 UTC,"It seems very weird to me that in Grey's pretty much everyone is either black or white, and the racial breakdown is super different from Seattle. In real-world Seattle there would be more Asian and at least as many Hispanic people as black people, but in Grey's it's the exact opposite."
greysanatomy,35x7z2,poliscicomputersci,7,Sat May 16 19:27:11 2015 UTC,"My biggest pet peeve: Amelia. That's it.  Amelia in general.  I DON'T know why her character - and the fact that she appears to be a full time cast member at this point - annoys me so much.  I guess it just seems like they're reeeeeally reaching at this point.  Also, there's this facial expression April makes that I can't quite describe, but it looks like an expression that would occur in the PROCESS of changing expressions, or going from one moment to another, but has become its own expression that is becoming a convenient one-size-fits-all as far as reactions go.  Sad? Happy? Surprised?  Horrified? Giddy? Impossible to tell, but it's there at least once in every scene."
greysanatomy,35x7z2,HelloEvie,3,Fri May 15 02:21:19 2015 UTC,"I feel you on the Amelia bit. I don't know what it is either but she feels like Hahn to me, I can't really connect with her. Maybe since she came in so late to the show?"
greysanatomy,35x7z2,HelloEvie,3,Fri May 15 02:26:54 2015 UTC,"i think it's that and the fact she came in so late and became so prominent so fast.  At least Hahn's character was seen once or twice before she came to Seattle Grace, and even after that, her role never seemed to trump another storlyine except for the couple of episodes where something significant happened between her and Callie.  And even then, it was the right amount of hype.  She wasn't really shoved in the viewer's faces as a character that has meant to be in existence for the past 11 seasons and we're suddenly supposed to play mental connect-the-dots with her lines and 10+ years of Derek's remarks, in order to understand something she references.   IF that makes any sense at all...?"
greysanatomy,35x7z2,ProlapsePotato,0,Fri May 15 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"Soon after the Derek got shot she came to visit him, and on the plane there, she met a guy that had a huge brain tumor that they took out together. So she was seen at least once before she started working at the hospital. Not that I'm disagreeing! I don't know why I dislike her, I just do. :)"
greysanatomy,35x7z2,HelloEvie,1 point,Sat May 16 02:37:02 2015 UTC,"That's true, I forgot about that!  IIRC, she was in several consecutive episodes following, right?  Then at some point she disappeared.   I guess they thought that maybe her time spent on the show seasons prior would make for a smooth segue into her becoming a regular again all of the sudden.  Which may make since if they knew a year ago that they were going to kill Derek off, even though I personally still don't like it, but this whole killing him off thing doesn't strike me as something that's been in the works... So I guess she was expected to replace the dynamic personality of Cristina's character.  (Again, obviously just another half-assed personal theory. :)  )  EIther way, I don't like it!   Take her away, dead Derek or no dead Derek, and bring Cristina back.  Actually, just make the past 2 seasons vanish altogether and let's go back to BEFORE it jumped the shark."

I'm sure she is a perfectly likable person, I bet she plays another character at some time in the future on something else that I appreciate, her acting is fine, it's just the character of Amelia that annoys the hell out of me."
