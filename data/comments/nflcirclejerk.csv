nflcirclejerk,36efiw,mikerhoa,1 point,Mon May 18 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"Tebow was good enough for college but not enough for the NFL. His throwing motion takes too long and is very readable for opposing defenses. People could tell you this before he was even drafted, however he had an inordinate amount of undeserved hype because he was on a popular successful college football team.  His NFL career consists of being drafted by the Broncos, playing two years with them and getting carried by their defense but somehow winning a playoff game. After being unseated from the Broncos' QB job by Peyton Manning he went to the New York Jets in 2012 and didn't start a single game but was involved in trick plays there. The New England Patriots picked him up in 2013 for an unknown reason and then let him go. No team has touched him since.  Tebow has a 75.3 career QB rating, which is just slightly lower than Chad Henne and Ryan Fitzpatrick's career rating. Those would be bottom of the barrel starting QBs (although both have made a living being quality back-ups or starting for desperate teams)."

It does not matter one iota whether the Patriots did or did not let air out of their balls. (Although we both know the answer to that question.)   The simple, single fact of using the Wells Report asserted values for T1, P1, T2 & P2 PROVES that it is wrong. Incompetent. It is wrong because it produces a Pressure Lapse Rate (∆P / ∆T) of 0.028 psi / °F. And the entire scientific & engineering world knows that this value is simply wrong.   FULL STOP.
