geek,3dykoo,dsmV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:19 2015 UTC,"No, prescription numbers are issued by the pharmacy, not the physician. There are state-level prescription monitoring programs in most states, but they have their issues. Prescribers don't log onto them and enter the prescription. Pharmacies upload the information of prescriptions they filled into the database. This way other pharmacies and prescribers can see if the person is filling medications at other locations. The best way to avoid fake prescriptions is to use electronic prescriptions. These are extremely difficult to fake because of the IT security technologies used.   Thankfully my state is making it a requirement for all prescriptions (except in rare circumstances) to be sent electronically directly from the doctor's computer with multiple verifications in place to ensure that it is the doctor him/herself sending it."

Divide the last octet by the number of hosts you intend to have and if it comes out to a clean whole number it's a valid subnet.  Example.  10.10.10.120/30 - a /30 has 4 hosts  - 120/4 = 30 = VALID subnet 10.10.10.120/27 - a /27 has 32 hosts - 120/32 = 3.75 = INVALID subnet

That's why it's there.  I don't know why in the fuck they want you to include it in the final calculations, but you shouldn't.  So for 441712345678911 (First 15 minus check digit) the algorithm is correct.  1 * 2 = 2  1 * 1 = 1  9 * 2 = 18 - 9 = 9  8 * 1 = 8  7 * 2 = 14 - 9 = 5  6 * 1 = 6  5 * 2 = 10 - 9 = 1  4 * 1 = 4  3 * 2 = 6  2 * 1 = 2  1 * 2 = 2  7 * 1 = 7  1 * 2 = 2  4 * 1 = 4  4 * 2 = 8  Add those up (2 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 7 + 2 + 4 + 8) =  67  Now.. you take 10 - (67 % 10) = 3, which is the final number  that's 10 minus (The remainder of 67 divided by 10) = the Luhn Checkdigit.

Even if you somehow convinced yourself the website was really secure, you're still bringing a third party into a situation that you intend to keep secret.  Actually, this whole story just seems a little off to me and I'm having a difficult time pinning down why. Maybe it's because the threats don't seem to match up with the goals, as far as I understand them. Could be my poor imagination or simply my misreading of the article.  My first impression was this group is upset that alm was selling a service they weren't actually performing.  Punishing such by publishing the data which was supposed to be deleted seems like a weird thing to me.  Then I thought perhaps they just don't like the sketchy nature of the service and want to punish anybody that participated. If they're simply mad about the service though they probably would have went ahead and published the data, so I'm thinking it has to be something else. Besides, other than their explicitness, is Ashley Madison really the only website to facilitate cheating?   Then there's the demand for shut down itself. If they really just want them shut down, why go through this whole ultimatum? Go ahead and publish the data.  I'm guessing alm will shut down soon enough after publication. It's obvious they don't care about the people who's data they have, so why bother? Besides, if this is a credible threat, shouldn't this already be enough to get them to shut down? Knowing that they were hacked inn the past seems like it would discourage people from signing up.  Maybe the truth is there's nothing really here. iirc, Ashley Madison has gone through similar threats before.

Not one mention of all the women on these sites who seek the same like the men.  So, to me this post conveys the impression of some disgruntled feminists, who do what they do best: Extort people until they cave to their will.  Edit: At first, they write neutrally about ""customers"" and ""people"", they then refer to ""rich men paying for prostitutes"" and then to the women on Cougar Life only as ""cougars"". Because only ""they"" are cougars, ""we"" aren't.    Also the whole ""technical"" side seems a bit ""yadda yadda"" to me:   ""customer information databases, source code repositories, financial records, emails"" Someone learnt a little tech jargon... ""We have hacked them completely..."" Really? ""Completely""? Nothing left to ""hack""? ""... taking over their entire office..."" WTF? Did you march in and conquer the eintire office floor? ""... production domains..."" again with the newly learnt jargon... As long as they only have the domains and not the servers that serve under these domains... Also: How about some proof?

But because they are targeting ""cheaters"" everyone is just sitting on the sidelines going 'ooooooo'.  These people are dangerous assholes that hold the future of 40 million people in their hands.    Sure, cheating sucks, but you don't know these people.  This will end marriages, kids will suffer, suicides will result.    I think the reason why their motive is so vague is because they didn't really have one.  They found they COULD steal the data and so they did, and came up with lame reason later.  Now they are on a power trip and want to shut down a major company or destroy the lives of 80 million people (if you count everyone's SO) for shits and giggles.  People may not have sympathy for the 'cheaters' but I think the hackers are way worse people, when you get down to it."

geek,3dx986,neuromonkey,0,Mon Jul 20 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"You've missed the point. Given that people have very different ideas of ""morality"" (this is easily demonstrated,) as well as very different ideas of how and when morality should govern behavior, no one entity can claim to be an objective ""moral authority.""  If anyone is allowed to judge others on their morals, and mete out punishment based on their whims, the result isn't peaceful, orderly society, it is absolute chaos. Subjugation, tribal warfare, and manipulation of the masses based on ideological law.  If you don't want to cheat on your spouse, then don't do it. I don't, but that's my choice, and nobody else's business. If someone else does it, I might think that they're an asshole, but that's their life to live, not mine. If you think that vigilantism based on moral outrage is an acceptable practice, you have no basis to complain when someone comes to your door and drags you into the street for violating their moral code.  Are there people who find cheating acceptable? Sure. Plenty of them. There isn't an objective morality or ethics. If you assume that what's obviously morally correct/incorrect to you is also true to others, you're gonna have a bad time."

And you may hate cheaters, I don't like them either, but these people who are getting off on holding the fate of people whose information they stole are worse, in my opinion.  And their 'reason' was because Ashley Madison didn't follow through on it's delete account clause.  So, yeah, pretty vague reason.   And seriously?   Releasing peoples CC numbers on the deep web?  That could hurt the victims of these cheating people too, the successful scumbag lawyer could skip town and the wife and kids are saddled with tens of thousands of dollars of JOINT cc debt because you thought the cheaters ""deserved it?!"""

USB ports are supposed to have the solid part at the top, anything you plug in will have the solid part on the bottom. This is never the fucking case though because manufacturers just don't give a fuck and they'll put the ports in your laptop upside-down because fuck you. Then when you think you've figured it out, they'll flip the port in your USB device as well so they're both upside down. Then if you manage to figure that out, they'll just start flipping coins to decide whether to make a port or device right-side-up or upside-down."

The fridge does not have a motor or other traditional technology like most refrigerators, — the gel does all the work — so, 90% of the appliance is actual usable space. To use the fridge you basically shove food into it’s biopolymer gel — which has no odor and is not sticky — and it is suspended and cooled until you need it again.   ...   Dmitriev notes that the cooling agents are the “bio robots” inherent in the gel that use luminescence — light generated in cold temperatures — to preserve food.   Source  Let's ignore the luminescence bit, as it doesn't matter.  The second law of thermodynamics states that heat only flows from a hotter object to a colder object, never the other way, without work being done or something similar.  It also states that entropy cannot go down. Heating something increases its entropy and cooling it decreases its entropy.  So, how would this gel possibly work? You put something hot in it, and it gets cold. That heat has to go somewhere--really it has to go into the gel, as that's what's surrounding it. How can the gel possibly stay cool? This heat would then have to flow out, into the room, but there's no mechanism for that. There's nothing to do anything to make this happen.  There is no way for heat to flow from the cold gel to the warm room. Assuming the gel started cool, it would end up the same temperature as the room after not too long.    For fun, let's ignore everything the creator has said about this device, and consider how it could work. You could have a condensor on the back so that it uses energy to stay cool and heats your house in the process, like real refridgerators.  It still makes no sense. The gel needs to be a good conductor so it actually cools food, but it also needs to be a good insulator so it stays cool and doesn't take a crapload of energy to do so.  But, hey, at least it doesn't violate physical laws."
geek,3dqoel,paholg,6,Sun Jul 19 01:35:19 2015 UTC,Also the gel would get filthy.
geek,3dqoel,Sybs,2,Sun Jul 19 09:59:34 2015 UTC,That's what I thought too. There is a freakin fish in there.
geek,3dqoel,the_last_fartbender,3,Sun Jul 19 14:20:53 2015 UTC,Plus it would have to clean itself somehow. Think of all the accidental milk leakages and crap that gets stuck in a normal fridge. The little bits of dead leaves and stems from your fruits and vegetables in the crisper. The gel would look fuckin gross pretty damn quick.
geek,3dqoel,guyver_dio,19,Sun Jul 19 13:15:10 2015 UTC,"I was wondering how the hell you keep the gel clean. It would have to have some kind of filter, thus moving parts. Or you'd eventually have to change the gel. Even if it really weren't sticky, particulates and liquids from your food as well as debris and oil from your hands would get all in that shit.   Not to mention the bacterial growth that could probably happen in the gel with all the above mentioned in it. God that's just gross."
geek,3dqoel,binauralshitsound,3,Sat Jul 18 21:19:22 2015 UTC,"id imagine the gel has antibacterial properties and since the food isn't exposed to air it would last a lot longer. like preserving food in honey.  still though, i dont think that tech exists and there are certainly plenty of logistics to overcoming in regards to cleaning."
geek,3dqoel,ducttape36,12,Sat Jul 18 22:04:16 2015 UTC,"Even if nothing could grow in it, it would still get disgusting.

geek,3dqoel,devo00,2,Sun Jul 19 05:23:21 2015 UTC,"So, the idea would be to scan the limb then print two halves and glue them together, providing a perfect fit and breathability.  But... it would be damn hard to get a good idea of what the ""correct"" shape would be for an arm or leg once the bone has been broken, mostly because of swelling, but also because the limb will be a bit distorted from the break, of course.  The other problem is that while you could print with a stronger and stiffer material than normal ""plaster"" cast material, allowing for less material and a thinner overall cast (plus the holes), I'm pretty sure that what you see there would not be strong enough or stiff enough short of something like titanium.  (In which case it would have to be milled out of a solid block of material, not 3d printed, and would thus be really, really expensive, not to mention pretty heavy.)   So, if you could scan people ahead of their injuries (might make sense for professional athletes and stunt people) and you beefed up the profile of the ""cast"", and it made sense to spend a ton more on these ""casts"" than a normal ""plaster"" cast, then this could work... maybe."

geek,3dqoel,Hobbycoder,2,Sat Jul 18 22:50:43 2015 UTC,"Ahh I see. Good point. Because I've never had broken bones, do they usually adjust the cast to make up for the extra room when the swelling goes down?"

I would not feel safe if there is a web like stucture on top of a fresh scar where all the things can poke through from the outside.     The cast shown is tiny.

Still doesn't explain how they were able to quarry, cut, transport, lift, and place these massive stones within the span of a pharaohs lifetime. To have been built in a 20 year period it would require more than 3 stones (each is extremely large and heavy) be placed per hour 24/7/365 for over 20 years straight and all with such perfect alignment. There are literally millions of stones. Not to mention it offers no explanation of how they moved to Sphinx (which is all one piece of stone) into place. Even with the most ingenious rollers or sleds and the most massive army of slaves and ingenious ramp system, it still doesn't add up to being realistically built for the purpose of being a tomb within the lifetime of a human. Besides, no bodies were ever found entombed within them.  That part was simply assumed as other lame duck (in comparison) pyramids outside of Giza were found to be tombs - thus we are taught they all must be for this purpose. Also note that Egyptians have never even claimed responsibility for building the great pyramids despite the fact that they loved to document everything. We associate them as the builders because that's who was around. Call me crazy for not believing what I was taught in grade school, but it seems obvious to me these were not built to be a tomb and not built within one persons lifetime and probably not even built by the traditional ancient Egyptians. I think they were built before the Egyptians and they chose to settle near them and incorporate them before they ever had a written language to document it."

Even more technically speaking OP is violating this rule by adding the extra layer of depth to the original image.   Taking a screenshot on your phone to show something about the phone would really just be an image since you're only adding a single layer of depth.

Unlimited plans, when they were available, sat around the $30 mark (talking about Verizon and AT&T mostly). That's a gross underpricing compared to current rates. I'm pretty sure most carriers wouldn't mind you having unlimited data if you actually wanted to pay for it, as per current market rates."

Now I'm the only person still on the account (parents divorced, siblings all married). My mom's name is still the one attached to the overall account as the primary account holder. I can't change it to mine, because to do so would mean creating a new account in AT&T's messed up system, and if I create a new account I cannot keep ""unlimited"" data.  Basically, I'm just going to keep my mom's name on it even after she dies probably (if I'm still kicking) to have ""unlimited"" data."

geek,3di7vx,LUMiNARY_ATL,8,Thu Jul 16 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for everywhere, but in the US, cellular sales reps have quotas they have to meet and they get paid commission on those sales. Depending on where the biggest payout is and what your current sales goals are, reps most definitely do care what plan they get customers to sign up for.

On average, U.S. subscribers consumed 1.8GB of cellular data every month in Q3 2014.[Source]   His 68 gb of data usage is equivalent to an average usage of 37 users.  They know he isn't going to pay 37 times their average rate, so they'd rather him not be a customer and get 37 other people signed up to Verizon that will use average data that they can also charge all their other fees to and keep data related costs down to maximize their profit."

To sum it up, circles don't play well with math so you end up having to ""make"" a circle using other shapes. For example the ""pi"" of a square is just 4, you just follow this same logic until you get a polygon that is close enough to a circle to use in equations. Since a polygon can have an infinite amount of sides you can keep going as far as you want but there is really no point for practical purposes."
geek,3de1gy,dwntwn_dine_ent_dist,2,Wed Jul 15 23:48:08 2015 UTC,"Because it simply doesn't fit nicely.  Just like imaginary numbers don't fit nicely.  There's an abstraction to it so it's just a fucky number to mess with you.  Fuck all of these ""visualizations"".  They are just graphics that show what everyone has already been told.  It doesn't show you any WHY.  One way to understand the why is to know a way to calculate an estimation of Pi all on your lonesome, just like Archimedes.  What is Pi?  It's a ratio, much like Sin, Cos, and Tan.  It's one part of a shape related against another part of that same shape to get a ratio value that will hold true for that same shape regardless of how much that shape is enlarged or shrunk.  The individual numbers within the shape may change, but the ratio's between the individual numbers remain constant.  That's what a ratio is.  Pi is the circumference of a circle measured against it's diameter.  It's a ratio. Measuring the diameter of a circle is easy... or rather, it's easy to make a circle with some specific diameter.  But how do you measure the circumference?  You don't.  You estimate a value of a certain precision, and this in turn gives you a value of Pi to a certain precision.  By slicing the circle into smaller and smaller pieces you are able to fit right-angled triangles into the circle and then calculate the length of the outer sides of that slice of the circle using trigonometry on the triangles.  Then you multiply that outer side length value by the number of how many slices you can fit within the circle and now you have a sum value that badly represents a rough value for what the length of the circumference might be.  Divide that number by the diameter and you get an estimation of the value of Pi.  The more you slice the circle into smaller and smaller values to get a rough circumference value and divide by the diameter to get a rough value for Pi the more the estimated Pi value approaches a specific number, and the further you go the more decimal places stop changing and the more precise the value becomes... and this is your estimation for Pi.  You can keep making more and more slices in the circle to get more and more precise with your final estimation of Pi.  And just as you can infinitely cut the circle into smaller pieces you can similarly infinitely get values for Pi that get more and more precise (more known decimal values).  http://noahveltman.com/pi/  This shows a slightly more interesting take on what I just said.  Instead of a shape that fits within the circle they also calculate a shape that encloses the circle... and this gives you a min value and max value, so you know the range that the circumference, and thus Pi, must fall into.  The min and max forever approach some number that sits between them the closer the smaller and larger shapes get to representing the circumference."

geek,3de1gy,SouthTampon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:07:16 2015 UTC,Go down to the hardware store. Purchase a steel rod. Slice it in half. Measure the displacement from the cut face to the tangent of the circumference. Or Go down to the hardware store. Purchase a steel rod. Measure the distance between to flats tangent to the surface.  Tau is not all that practical.  Its great theory though.

Make sure it has all the pieces though because if there's one missing it's such a huge bummer.   If there's one missing though maybe you can make a replacement piece with some cardboard, an Exacto blade, and some acrylic paint?  But if there's more than one missing I feel like it's not worth the effort. I mean, maybe it is though. Especially if we're talking about a couple solid color pieces. It could be worth it. He's your BF and all.   I think you'll know if it's worth the effort.   If not, you can give the puzzle to a retirement home or something, because they have so many puzzles there, I bet they have an extra piece that will fit, and that could be a fun challenge for them!  It can be really boring in a retirement home.   Sometimes it's nice to have a puzzle with a sort of puzzle baked into it like that.  Or if the replacement pieces don't come out well, you could also get rid of a bunch of other pieces and fill them in with cute quotes or little stickers and make it more of a collage.  Collages are fun."

geek,3d957m,thecrazyD,-5,Wed Jul 15 01:28:47 2015 UTC,"Until Shaft is redone with a white lead, we can stop with the ""blacks for the sake of blacks"" in Hollywood."
geek,3d957m,Kruug,5,Wed Jul 15 04:10:46 2015 UTC,"That's stupid. Shaft was made to be a black hero of his time, his entire character is based on his race. Bond, however, has been reinvented many times from a comic buffoon to a suave superspy, to a brutal killer. How does it hurt the character to get an excellent black actor to portray him? It's not like there are a ridiculous number huge movies with black leads, and it's hard for white men to get leading roles."
geek,3d957m,thecrazyD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:35:48 2015 UTC,"http://www.ianfleming.com/james-bond-2/  And James Bond was made to be white from the get-go.  I mean, if we're going to demand that we strictly stick to source material."
geek,3d957m,Kruug,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:28:02 2015 UTC,"Right, but there's nothing about the character that demands he be white. You can't describe the character Shaft without using the word ""black"", because it's a huge part of who the character is. ""He's the black private dick that's a love machine to all the chicks."" He's the black guy that fights back against The Man that tries to keep black men down. James Bond, on the other hand, is an adaptable property that has been many different things over the years. There's no reason (besides latent racism) why he couldn't be black.  AND AGAIN. There's a ton of white leading men roles. See: Just about all movies ever made ever. The best example you can come up with for a black leading role that you want to take away is a blaxploitation film from the 70's that would clearly be nothing but a racist parody if you swap the race.  Idris Elba is suave as fuck, British, and a hell of an actor. He would crush it and be an amazing Bond, and they wouldn't even have to change a single line of dialog in the script, because the character of Bond has nothing to do with race."

geek,3d48q4,Shagomir,8,Mon Jul 13 15:19:01 2015 UTC,"Right you are. Thanks.  So that means that there is no point in getting up early at 7:49 AM EDT (5:49 AM for my time zone) for the closest approach. There will be absolutely nothing to see - not even an ""I'm still alive"" signal - until ~4 or 5 hours later."
geek,3d48q4,matt-s-perrin,9,Mon Jul 13 15:26:43 2015 UTC,Yep!  And the really high res pictures won't be here for months
geek,3d48q4,marco262,3,Mon Jul 13 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"Well, there will be the 4 km/pixel image mosaics that will be sent just before closest approach as part of the fail-safe, in case New Horizons encounters any unknown moons or rings when zipping through the system. Those should be pretty cool."
geek,3d48q4,randomtask,2,Mon Jul 13 19:08:51 2015 UTC,"It's a convention when talking about space that things which are said to be happening ""now"" are happening now in the same time scope as on earth. When it comes to light, we say things appear to be that way. When photographs of space come out of course, lots of things are different to the way they appear."
geek,3d48q4,DubBucket,5,Tue Jul 14 10:46:02 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting answer, because relativity tells us that judging the exact time that an event happens is always going to be a dicey proposition, that relies heavily on the observer's inertial reference frame.  Information cannot travel faster than the speed of light, so depending on your semantics, it would be reasonable to say that New Horizon's ""current"" position is whatever we are currently observe it to be (with the 4 hour light speed delay). So one could argue that we will receive images from Pluto exactly at its closest approach. However, considering that we need to take into account the delay when sending a message BACK to New Horizons, I can't imagine this being a useful definition for ""current position"" for anyone.  However, what is even more interesting is picking out how the ""current position"" of New Horizons for an observer outside of Earth's sphere of influence will differ from what we would judge it to be here on Earth, due to how our observations of the universe change from within a gravitational well.  Isn't that cool??  Source: Vaguely remembered wikipedia browsing"
geek,3d48q4,jasonrubik,2,Mon Jul 13 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought this too, there is no universal time frame between us and Pluto and it's incorrect to say it happens before we see it, things happen whenever we see them happen.  However, I imagine it's quite useful for NASA to think of these things with a fixed time, since they've got to send out all the signals and get them back etc."

You are very correct about the patriarchal. I know that she wants to impress me, but i want to make her feel like talking to a friend and to not enforce my ideas on her. From my experience i had learned that speaking geeky things to a non-geeky people will make them respect you at best but they are very cautious to not look stupid and do not speak about their interests. That is the reason i don't want to speak any thing about much geeky stuff till i knew her interests. To get to that point there must have some conversation on some other more general topic.   ""If that's the case then her concerns right now are probably that you won't like her or that she will say something to offend you. Focus on getting her to relax. ""       Very true. I just want to have conversation in a relaxed state.    ""Tell a (tasteful) joke or a funny story that happened to you.""     This is where i need the help.

""Ask her what she enjoys doing with her spare time.""        She says watching television and regional movies. Sadly(only in this context) i had stopped watching television few years ago and do not even watch most of the regional movies(usually watch holly wood science fiction and adventure movies).

geek,3czual,groo667,3,Sun Jul 12 15:40:37 2015 UTC,Wait. What?
geek,3czual,Ragas,6,Sun Jul 12 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"Well more recently than not I've seen posts about highly commercial things. Mostly movies and some stuff in r/buyitforlife (edit: it was a post about darn socks being 20% off with a direct link to the store website) that show products and where to get them directly. A lot of the comments on these have been talking about how good they are, or making a stereotypical internet joke about them, but without any sarcasm or malice. It seems like posts that are made to bring something into the popular view. Maybe it's just because star wars and jurrasic park are very popular, so I'm looking at it backwards, but i know there's a better example that I'm forgetting. The posts seem like ads to get people talking and posting about a certain topic, since they are usually followed by a lot more posts on the same topic."
geek,3czual,groo667,6,Sun Jul 12 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"Ok. Sure this site is riddled with advertisers trying to get their product on the front-page. But hiw did this post get 600 upboats then??  It would be pretty shitty if reddit would rig the system, without putting an ad notice somewhere."
geek,3czual,Ragas,6,Sun Jul 12 16:23:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think Reddit is doing it, I think it's being done on Reddit. This link is to a blog with a guide on how to market on Reddit. Basically it says to post in the right subreddit, and to keep things as viral/homemade as possible. Don't be obvious and push people towards your product indirectly. It says to do that since obvious advertising would be downvoted. It has comments from 2011 so the idea might have become more refined since then.  Also  There could be a group of people that have a couple accounts and upvote the submissions early, getting it to rising or hot, and then since it's an image people would just upvote it and move on. There doesn't need to be 600 fake accounts, just enough accounts to get the ball rolling. It could also be the right timing, something could be submitted ten times, and only one of those times it becomes big because it was put in the right place at the right time."

geek,3cxqp1,palindromic,8,Sun Jul 12 08:35:39 2015 UTC,It is.  But the upwards acceleration of the bottom towards the middle of the slinky appears to be the exact opposite of gravity.  So it looks like it's floating on the bottom part of the slinky.

geek,3cxqp1,powercow,3,Sun Jul 12 09:56:00 2015 UTC,"Put it this way: The bottom of the spring simply doesn't know it's been dropped at the top.

Here's what it means to be a leader: You get people to follow you, and You set the direction that those people should go.  Reddit has been getting shittier* over the past year. Either she failed to set the direction (Go that shitty way!) or she failed to get people to follow her (Let's all not go that shitty way!). Either failure is inexcusable for a CEO of a company.   If the board was looking for a puppet to direct the company in a shitty direction, she failed by not resigning sooner and telling us that was why she was resigning.  TL:DR: She either a) lead people in a shitty direction b) failed to get people to follow her in a non-shitty direction or c) failed to bow out when it was clear she was being pushed to go in a shitty direction.  TL:DR; TL:DR; She failed as a leader  EDIT: *So I'm not referring to the general decline in quality and I don't care about FPH or the most recent set of subreddit bannings. From a reply below:   So I don't have a problem with what subreddits were banned, but what I do have problems with are things like banning subreddits according to vague and inconsistently applied criteria. Or buying alienblue, adding ads and then not updating for months and months. Or expanding the use of shadowbans when nobody knows what the criteria is. Or adding new monetization features at the expense of functionality. Or adding new UI features that are 90% disliked in beta as-is without making any effort to incorporate what little constructive feedback there is.  Those are problems that you can lay on poor management and which ultimately belong to the CEO.   I know that the decision to buy alien blue happened before Pao came in, but if only there was someone in a position of authority to ensure that the maintenance didn't fall to the wayside..."
geek,3cueiw,Roez,7,Sat Jul 11 00:57:22 2015 UTC,"I do think some of the changes were potentially made for better PR before they brought the new CEO in.  They didn't hire him suddenly because of a petition.    That said, the way the company brought about the few changes recently--the poor communication and general disconnect--is not a corollary issue.  It signals bad management.  There's no good PR coming from screwing up the way they did and it was completely unnecessary.  There was nothing gained by doing it.    Whether this change will matter and make noticeable differences, only time will tell.  If it wasn't initiated by the board, maybe they don't see the same problems others do."
geek,3cueiw,noratat,26,Sat Jul 11 03:13:51 2015 UTC,"Shittier how?  FPH deserved to be banned, and the moderator-admin communication problems have been a problem for many years, long before she became CEO. Don't get me wrong, it's good that they're finally looking to address it, but placing the blame entirely on Pao for that is a bit strange since the worst that could be said is that she didn't fix a pre-existing problem.  We don't actually know why Victoria was fired or that Ellen was the one who did it. All we do know is that it was very poorly communicated, but again that's not actually a new problem.  Honestly I'm pretty ambivalent towards Ellen Pao, but what really pisses me off is the immature and downright childish way reddit's reacted on the matter.

And instead of reaching out to the mods of FPH and saying that's not okay either, they banned the sub without warning, and then posted the new policies.  Furthermore, how responsible are mods for user behavior? If mods follow reddit-wide rules, which is all they can do, just how culpable are they for the actions of subs?"
geek,3cueiw,ShadowPuppetGov,0,Sat Jul 11 07:21:57 2015 UTC,"Edit: 3 days after this post: vindication!  FPH mods put the imgur staff photos in the subreddit sidebar.  What you need to know about imgur is it is a website designed to host content from Reddit specifically (though not exclusively: Reddit was only the original reason for it's creation). This makes it a major part of the infrastructure of this website.   Do you understand? This wasn't FPH making fun of a few random Reddit or Facebook users. FPH went after their staff. The people keeping Reddit running. It is up to the staff of Reddit what subreddits get banned and what subbreddits stay, and it was probably a bad idea to piss those people off. FPH was already morally nebulous area of the internet when it came to the issue of the rights of the users vs the rights of the people they were harassing, and then they did something really, really stupid.   I see this whole argument of ""well technically it was public information so technically blah blah blah""...No. If you think for one second Reddit is going to choose a bunch of assholes who use this website as a means to harass and degrade people over the people who keep their website running you are delusional on a level that cannot be described in words."

All those members are still members of other subreddits. Should those be banned as well?  I just don't see the point. The general notion in society is banning behavior, and penalizing the perpetrators of behavior. Not removing locations where the perpetrators hang out."
geek,3cueiw,AnOnlineHandle,11,Sat Jul 11 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"It wasn't just the members, it was the mods/creators. Reddit admins don't mod any subs, if the creators of a sub are abusing it then it is shut down. There were a lot of other subs like it which remain (but that sub itself can't be recreated because ban evasion nullifies a ban)."

geek,3cueiw,wizgrao,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:58:27 2015 UTC,But banning those locations seems to work on Reddit. Banning users wouldn't have an effect at all considering making a new account is painless compared to making one subreddit and populating it with all the original people.

geek,3cueiw,noratat,-4,Sat Jul 11 04:33:43 2015 UTC,"Besides the obvious harassment issue that was cited and linked by the other poster, there was a serious leakage problem with that sub and the rest of the site. I don't subscribe to any of the defaults anymore for a good reason, but seeing FPH's childish bile start leaking into subs I actually care about (even small niche subs) was getting pretty aggravating.  FPH is proof if any was needed that the idea of ""containment"" subsections on community sites like reddit don't work - in fact, they make the problem worse by acting as an echo chamber that reinforces and amplifies the problem because the users don't stay contained.  And quite frankly, of all of the truly awful subreddits that actually have subscribers, FPH was by far one of the most childish and immature about it."

geek,3cueiw,only_your_enemy,2,Sat Jul 11 03:42:03 2015 UTC,"Yet the article doesn't list any instances of actual harassment. Did you read the article you posted?   There is no logic behind saying that they banned the subreddit because of your edgy reasoning. Not everyone is some shady character sitting in the corner counting the cash in their accounts.   There's absolutely justification for debating the lack of transparency with banning FPH. Meeting ""this decision was not transparent, both in why exactly FPH was banned and what direction the site is heading in"" with ""you're so edgy, it's not a conspiracy bro"" is retarded."
geek,3cueiw,ParanoiaComplex,2,Sat Jul 11 07:34:17 2015 UTC,"First of all, I didn't link the article because it's a good piece of journalism. I linked it because I didn't feel like digging up the actual reddit thread with the admin response. It was literally the first thing in google when I searched.   I have heard absolutely no defensive statement from anyone that was ""part"" of that subreddit. In fact, people are just quicker to crucify SRS and ask why they haven't been banned too. All I hear is ""wtf reddit mah free speech!""   The lack of* transparency could be there to protect those who were harassed from being harassed again. It could be there to keep the harassment from becoming a meme. It could be there because of any other fucking reason. No one knows.  But what I do know is that there was an official statement from the admins of this website that those subreddits were banned because of those reasons. Why would they dredge this shit up for themselves when they've always said that they welcome free speach?  Well they could be lying. If they didn't want free speech and just wanted to ban the offensive reddits, then why the fuck would they just ban a few? Why not get rid of the countless other more offensive ones? It doesn't make logical sense at all.  So I'm inclined to think what the admins announced is the truth. I find it upsetting that bunch of random assholes claiming they know the truth™ that le reddit is literally hitler because it spreads like wildfire and people get so upset and up in arms about it that it creates madness, more harassment, and brings forth the putrid scum that exists in the deep internet. So many people here refuse to take stuff at face value in belief that there is something more sinister and evil beneath every admin announcement."

It could be there because of any other fucking reason. No one knows.   What? Do you know what the word transparency means? Are you serious lol. Here: ""Transparency, as used in science, engineering, business, the humanities and in other social contexts, implies openness, communication, and accountability.""   But what I do know is that there was an official statement from the admins of this website that those subreddits were banned because of those reasons. Why would they dredge this shit up for themselves when they've always said that they welcome free speach?   What reasons? They say because of harassment. What harassment? That's important for all mods to know because the mods of FPH were not breaking current reddit rules. Their sub was banned and then new rules were added. If you can't see the shadiness there then I can't help you.   Well they could be lying. If they didn't want free speech and just wanted to ban the offensive reddits, then why the fuck would they just ban a few? Why not get rid of the countless other more offensive ones? It doesn't make logical sense at all.   We'll see if they'll maintain free speech. As it stands they banned a sub without warning, without contact, for not clearly breaking reddit's rules, obviously because they wanted it gone.    So I'm inclined to think what the admins announced is the truth. I find it upsetting that bunch of random assholes claiming they know the truth™ that le reddit is literally hitler   Oh fuck off.

geek,3cueiw,only_your_enemy,3,Sat Jul 11 02:44:57 2015 UTC,"Because of its popularity and user engagement reddit is at the forefront of a question the internet desperately needs to answer: how do we encourage goodness and compassion, and how do we discourage hated. I personally see the less than fairly explained banning of FPH as a bad answer, especially when that answer still allows CoonTown. This is a psychological war and banning these communities at the very least is not solving anything, at worst encouraging these people by making them feel assaulted for their beliefs. There has to be a better way."

If you were fat and tried talking smack or posting there, yes, you are going to be shunned. The same way a misogynist will be harassed, chased out and even doxxed on SRS or a black person posting to coon town.  FPH even stated, side bar and in announcement post, that they hated FAT, not people. They openly welcomed people, of course limited welcoming, people who had got rid of that fat.  They hated fat and sloth. They welcomed those who had the will to want to lose it, and did so.  I am fat. I wouldn't have posted there. But then again, I have a higher brain function to not be bothered by text or parodied images on the web. You hold the ultimate power to turn away if you don't want to see it, because only you choose what subs you want to sub to.  btw, I never went there.

geek,3cxko5,Radaghast38,2,Sat Jul 11 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on your power supply and the amount of current your PC is consuming.  The PSU will have some energy left in its capacitors, possibly enough to feed the computer at most for a few hundred milliseconds. Enough to survive very short power outages. Power supply of the yore managed even longer periods, a few seconds.  Typically there is no faster signal available to tell the computer that the power has been shut down, so it's not really able to do any last-subsecond shutdown operations. Some devices, such as (some?) Crucial SSDs have a capacitor bank of their own to ensure their write-behind cache is flushed; maybe such devices would benefit from a pre-emptive 'power going down' signal, even if it eventually turns out the power didn't go down."

Find out if the CD key is written on the bottom (it usually is).  You don't need to know what it is right now, only that it's there.  If you ever need to reinstall due to a crashed drive or whatever, take it to a computer place and have him reuse the key.  It'll save you from having to buy another license.

geek,3cnnyy,DeathByPetrichor,44,Thu Jul 9 09:42:34 2015 UTC,"You say that, but it is true. I live in Flagstaff AZ and a few months back we had a major data cable cut or torn or something that runs up from Phoenix. The entire town lost cell and internet data for about 8 hours. You don't realize how big of a deal data is until your entire town loses it.   To give you an example, the Police department had to go to maps of the town because the computers didn't receive the location data, that was a nightmare. The ATM machines wouldn't work, nor the debit card terminals in stores, so nobody could buy things, and you couldn't pull out cash because the bank had no way of knowing how much you had in your bank account. My university essentially shut down because everything is run through internet. Surprisingly my only classes that stayed in session were the computer science ones because the teachers knew how to operate without internet.   Some more if anybody is interested. On campus we have a service called Blackboard Learn. We use this for course material online, but it also is a system that ties all student data together on campus. It runs our meal plans, laundry, access to the buildings, and other small things. When this shut down, we couldn't get into buildings, and people couldn't even do laundry. It was a nightmare. (Of course, we opened the doors so people could get in.) And the campus essentially had to start giving out free meals, because you can't refuse food to anyone.   So yeah, you want to destroy a city? Cut the data cables. Luckily for the big places, there are more than one. As a result of this, another cable is being built in a secret location haha.

People living in my apartment signed for it (despite it being addressed to me) and took it when they moved. Figured I'd use my own equipment in the meantime. Nope! Completely unsupported on their network. Tech decides he can't connect me to the main switch in the apartment because I don't have the necessary equipment. Fucks off without doing shit.   Week 2:    After ripping Canada post a new asshole for fucking up, ISP rush sends me a new modem. Rad! Except I'm still not wired up.  Earliest time I can book a new tech is at the end of the week in the middle of the day necessitating that I miss another day of work.  New tech comes in 'wires me up' to the main apartment switch and fucks off before I have a chance to test anything. Of course nothing works.

We finally determine that the problem is either with the equipment or I'm not properly connected to the mainline for the building itself. Send out a new tech, again, for the end of the week. Another vacation day is taken on my part.  New tech discovers that, of the 3 lines in my apartment, 1 is usable. Is genuinely shocked that tech 2 could have fucked up THIS badly. spends the next 2 hours removing what he did and re-doing it properly. Actually sticks around while I test everything to make sure.   Total time offline: 3 weeks, 3 days of which were my vacation days.  Luckily nothing major has gone wrong since."
geek,3cnnyy,CuriousBlueAbra,22,Thu Jul 9 12:20:19 2015 UTC,"When I bought my house, good internet outside the city meant ADSL.  Before I bought it, I called the company that owns the phone lines to make sure there would be usable internet. Because I planned to work from home, and live there until I get too old to live in a house. They said the cables could handle 4 mbit, and they would be able to deliver such an internet connection. I remember thinking ""4 mbit now? Fine. 4 mbit until new technology arrives in the area? A bit of a stretch. I want the house, I'll take the chance.""  I'll skip the story about getting hooked up, it's only half as bad as your story. But it turns out I can only get 1mbit, and that's only if I downgrade from ISDN to POTS. That was a bit slow at that time, and unlikely to be acceptable untill new technology was available. I question if the house was a good idea, but it was too late. Because they kinda fucked up, they let me downgrade for free. They're nice people.  While I waited for the big news, the line just got unstable. To get a more stable connection, we limited it to 0.5 mbit. Then 0.25 mbit, which was the minimum. Every time it rained, for the next couple of days, the modem would reset about every 5 minutes. That means a few seconds offline, which isn't bad. It also means all downloads stopped, often not resumable. But worst, it meant disconnecting the VPN to work. And that took more than 5 minutes to reconnect, so working from home was impossible.  Finally the big news came: The neighborhood got fiber. When the fiber worked, I had like 7 month prepaid left on the ADSL. I cancelled the ADSL anyway, just to show them I didn't even want it if it was free.  Fiber is really something else. The slowest speed I can get is 75/75 mbit, the fastest is 500/500 mbit. The company that owns the copper lines still think fiber to the consumer is a bad idea, since the entire country already have their copper lines. Bleh."
geek,3cnnyy,michaelda9971,2,Thu Jul 9 13:46:30 2015 UTC,"I live in a rural area where the only available broadband is DSL. I'm paying for their fastest service, which is billed as 3 Mbps. On a very good day my actual speed is 1 Mbps. Unfortunately for me, this is rural New Mexico, where ""new technology"" always arrives 10 or 20 years after the rest of the country. It's still Hammertime out here.  ETA: And also, you wrote:   Before I bought it, I called the company that owns the phone lines to make sure there would be usable internet.

geek,3cnnyy,Unforsaken92,2,Thu Jul 9 16:36:23 2015 UTC,Of its anything like the marine ones you can get for your boat it's like $13.95 per MB for the first 15 then it drops to $11.00 for the next 15 MB. It gets less from there but to use 6 gigs costs about $3k a month. But the good news is you probably won't get anywhere near that much because your speed are up to 134 Kbps. But at least you can send an email from anywhere in the world. Unless it's near the poles then you might be S.O.L depending on which provider you go with.

I have a feeling the better way to do is probably using local wireless or WiFi while in port and using a modem through a shortwave radio just for the random email when doing crossings. To do that you have to have someone at home run the other side of the modem through their shortwave but I've heard it's doable.

So you ended up paying for a DSL or cable subscription to have access to the internet, then an additional fee to get/keep your @aol.com address and access into their walled garden, via their software of course.  So you still were able to use AOL chatrooms and Keywords.    Well, I don't know when (or if) they phased out keywords.  But I'm sure they probably stuck around for a while."

Many of them would change you for touch tone service even though it was more expensive you have you as dial customer.     I dealt with Pac Bell where I couldn't get a listing of everything my company was paying for.   At that time another long distance company could get more access to your account.   I remember being in a meeting with I think MCI and seeing a listing of all our numbers and asking them for it.  I discovered we were paying for lines I couldn't even physically find.
geek,3cgwc8,punkwalrus,64,Tue Jul 7 21:55:19 2015 UTC,"My company (a non profit) had an audit of all their physical phone lines and just matching what we were billed for vs lines still in use was a complete and total clusterfuck. For instance, Verizon couldn't send us just one bill. Nope. ""Impossible,"" they said. Some  bills had one number, some had more. Many of the bills didn't actually have the phone number they were connected to listed, and their billing department seem to be unable to match an account to an actual phone number, or a phone line.  The audit became a forced issue when a building flood knocked out our main data center, and all the connections had to be rerouted, and when we moved to a more virtual platform, eliminated. Previous management, when they wanted to order a phone line, just ordered it as a new order. Somebody wants a fax machine in their office? Order a phone line. The alarm system needs a new phone line, order a phone line. And so on. There was no central management of all the phone lines going in and out of our two buildings, so when somebody didn't need that fax line anymore, we were still paying for it… Who knows for how long.  Our telecom manager eventually, and it took her over a year, was able to match phone numbers to accounts to actual land lines. She has a massive spreadsheet matching them all, and eventually she was able to save our company hundreds of dollars a month by eliminating phone lines that we had either never used, or had stopped using long ago."

geek,3cgwc8,wickedcold,32,Wed Jul 8 04:34:05 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of something I haven't thought about in a long time...  In the 90s/early 2000s I worked at a hardware store that was an authorized AT&T lease agent. A TON of people STILL lease their telephone, or at least did up until 10 years ago. Not cell phones - but plain Jane touch tone landline phones like this Trimline model.  Apparently people with accounts dating back to the 60s and 70s had been leasing their phones all along, as used to be standard, and didn't ever think to just buy a phone that retailed for $9.99. A lot of these folks were paying between $4 and $10 every month for these things. They'd bring them in when they stopped working to exchange them for a new one. We got a small fee for this. We had a ton of phones in stock to choose from. Some were as expensive as $20 or so per month, for a simple dumbphone.  The store had been doing it since the 60s... and by this point even the owner used to think the practice was totally ridiculous and would try and steer the customers away from continuing. I too used to ask them if they were sure they wanted to continue the lease (I'm sure AT&T would appreciate that), and explain that you could just buy a new phone, but you know how stubborn some old folks can be. The lease ones were better somehow, of course. Or they liked the convenience of being able to just come swap it out if it wasn't working. It used to drive me nuts to see people wasting money like that.  Some of the phones that were returned had been in their home so long that they had their old five digit phone number written on that little bar underneath the buttons. I cringe thinking how much they spent to borrow that fucking thing.  :edit:  Apparently it's still a thing, but AT&T is no longer involved: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QLT_Consumer_Lease_Services"

The argument they will use is ""You didn't look at your bank statement and notice a strange monthly payment once in ten years? We can't be held responsible for you not staying on top of your finances"".  It's likely the original contract she signed said that after the contract period expired the service would continue and payments would be taken until cancelled. It may be deceitful if they're not communicating to people you have to cancel it, but their backs will be covered.

It's not really AOL's fault that she hasn't cancelled that service or has failed to use it. From the companies point of view the onus isn't on them to ensure she uses the service she'd paid for.  In terms of bank charges it was because the banks were giving people ridiculous charges which weren't in proportion to the mistake. For example I was charged £30 because my balance was -£2.00 for a day or so. The charge wasn't in proportion to my error, so it wasn't a lawful charge. Similarly shit like being charged £20 for a bounced cheque and such. They were basically charging customers for minor infractions that didn't cost the banks anything to fix..."

geek,3cg5d6,Aegn0r,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"Tesla had 2 modes of ""wireless power"" that I am aware of.  One is a sort of particle stream similar to a CRT electron beam.  The other that we all are most familiar with but don't use is actually a single wire transmission using the earth for the conductor.  This is not the same as a ground return system.  The top load with sparks being projected should not be doing so, it should increase in voltage greatly but NOT spark, this voltage pushes current into the earth where it's picked up by an equivalent transformer at the receiving side.  This mode of operating an electrical transformer can also be used to detect earthquakes.  By transforming voltage generated from the piezoelectric effect of the cracking bedrock before the full earthquake event.  You can have several hours and even days to prepare."
geek,3cg5d6,codeboundfuture,2,Tue Jul 7 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"Did I get this right? The second thing you talked about is like in the scene from ""Prestige"" where Andy Serkis pushes Lightbulbs in the ground for David Bowie?"
geek,3cg5d6,Aegn0r,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:28:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, you got it.  The first type I mentioned is rather unrelated but it's the only entirely ""wireless"" system (as far as I know) without just pumping lossy electromagnetic waves all over the place.  Those waves have no reflection and if they are not received somewhere they are entirely lost, only to be found in distant galaxies as they travel away from earth.  Tesla's single wire system allows for the energy to be reflected back to the transmitter if it's not used, the particle beam concept would not have this feature, and normal radio transmitters also are unable to do this.  Just to be clear, lighting the bulbs off the earth may not be an entirely simple matter, it would probably require some capacity separate from the earth like a metal plate setting on an insulated table, connect one terminal of the bulb to the earth, the other to that plate.  The size of the plate determines how much power will be able to go through the bulb, the bigger the plate, the more power. Otherwise close to the transmitter you would be in the near field which is what is shown lighting the bulb in the article image.  In ""The Prestige"" those bulbs were probably at least somewhat in the near field, and attaching one terminal to the earth the filament may light, otherwise if you connect both terminals of the bulb it would not light the filament but would actually light the gas."
geek,3cg5d6,codeboundfuture,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:57:53 2015 UTC,"One extra detail because I feel I made it confusing.  Being in the near field and connected to ground would put more power into the bulb, but while in the near field a ground connection is not required for power transfer.  The near field is not a long range transmission just as the name suggests."

Essentially if you have one user who constantly reports that their computer keeps losing network connectivity and you have gone through the normal software stuff you can plug one of these into the Ethernet port at their desk.  This will create a loop back to the switch and it's just hardware all the way around, now if you log into the switch you can see if the port is up/down/dropping packets.  Now you plug this loopback adapter in at a couple points along the way and hopefully you can spot if there is a bad cable somewhere or if it's a physically bad switchport.

geek,3cbpgs,BeepBoopFuckTheTower,2,Mon Jul 6 21:34:45 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you my experience with a network of about 70 users.  I work at an apartment complex and our network is run in house.  We have our signal come from comcast, go through our gateway, and into four switches (the gateway has four outputs).  We then run ethernet cables from the switches, through the walls, to the ports in everyone's room.  We cannot stress enough to new tenants how important it is to hook their router up properly.  We explicitly tell them to make sure the ethernet cable from the wall goes into the ""uplink"" port on their router instead of one of the numbered ports.  Here's where it gets fun.  If somebody does plug the ethernet cord from the wall to their router into a numbered port, their network works flawlessly, but nobody else gets internet access in the building because their router is trying to send IP addresses back into the system.  For whatever reason, their router is better at assigning IP addresses than ours, but whatever.  The only way to figure out who is causing the problem (and eventually fix the problem) is to, one by one, unplug everyone's internet access and reboot the network to see if it's working again.  It took two of us several hours to find the one router that was plugged in wrong."

Yeah... didn't work that way, of course.  But pressing that little chip in to the the socket on the board (they were just like any other eeprom, not a stick like modern memory) made me feel like the man.  When I could finally load TSRs in to Extended Memory... it felt good.  The same machine later got a 20MB hard drive....

I remember when I purchased my first machine that had a 1GB drive. I said to my family that I would NEVER fill that thing up. It wasn't possible. At the time, it was ridiculously large. 6 months later, full and archiving to Zip disk...  I also remember building these machines for folks and they were convinced I should be able to stick their SIMMs from their 486 boxes into the DIMM slots to add another 8MB to the new 64MB. They couldn't fathom how that was not possible. My boss at the time, responding to customer demand, starting buying mobos with both SIMM and DIMM slots just for this reason and charging a huge markup. The sheep couldn't buy them fast enough. When in reality they could have bought another 64MB DIMM much cheaper. I don't regret what I learned at that job as it was my intro to the industry but, I still hated it with a passion.

However, some capacitors will still be charged, depending on the design. For this you need a resistor which is rated to discharge them, attached to an insulating stick. You then put each leg of the cap onto the leg of the resistor and wait for it to discharge, checking with a proper multimeter.   Once that's done it's safe. The final step probably isnt nessesary but with high voltage caps it's always better to be safe."

geek,3c7hwn,MatteAce,2,Mon Jul 6 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"isn't the circuit breaker supposed to switch off, since you're short-circuiting the transformer?"
geek,3c7hwn,cecilkorik,22,Mon Jul 6 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"You're not short circuiting it, the wood actually presents a significant amount of load. It's all about the amount of resistance in the circuit. Properly-sized wires alone create almost zero resistance in the circuit (that is the point of why we use them as wires). However, you only need a little bit of resistance to prevent a short circuit.  Think about a incandescent light bulb. The only thing separating the hot from the neutral in that bulb is a tiny little tungsten filament, with a resistance of only a few hundred ohms. That alone is MORE than enough to prevent a short circuit. Depends on a lot of factors, but wet wood is going to be at LEAST 1,000 ohms, could be more like 10,000 or even higher. Dry wood, for comparison, is generally well into the millions of ohms and would be too effective at preventing current flow to the point of stopping it entirely. You need SOME significant amount of current to flow, otherwise you won't get the burning of those beautiful patterns, that's why the wood has to be wet."
geek,3c7hwn,MatteAce,2,Mon Jul 6 03:43:46 2015 UTC,"thank you for the explanation! so, what would prevent an accident if a human was to touch it? is the human body much more conductive than wet wood?"
geek,3c7hwn,cecilkorik,10,Mon Jul 6 04:21:39 2015 UTC,"In that scenario, absolutely nothing would prevent an accident. Circuit breakers protect your wiring from catching fire and burning your house down, possibly with you inside. They do NOT protect a human being from current directly. It doesn't care where that current is going or what it's doing, the only role of a circuit breaker is to limit the current to a particular maximum. Even the smallest residential circuit breakers will usually allow 15 amps sustained, or brief spikes much higher current. It only takes as little as 50 to 100 milliamps to put a human heart into fibrillation leading to death.  To prevent that, you need a GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) which is a highly sensitive device that detects even slight differences between the current going out on the hot vs returning on the neutral, which would indicate that the missing current is going ... somewhere else, which could be a human. It shuts off the circuit within milliseconds, preventing injury. GFCIs are usually required by code on any circuit with water potentially nearby. Bathrooms, kitchens, outdoors."
geek,3c7hwn,MatteAce,0,Sun Jul 5 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"huh! I guess then there's a cultural difference here... :) In Italy (I don't know about other EU countries though) we have a mandatory device known (erroneusly) as ""life-saver""... its technical name should be something like magnetothermic-differential switch, which is a device that contains BOTH a circuit-breaker (to prevent overloads to the home circuit) and a GFCI to prevent human current shocks.  I must say I've learned something new today!  Anyway theoretically in an italian household you cannot by any chance burn wood like in the video, because the switch device (with the GFCI inside) would snap off all the time... right?"

Best I got was a 240vac short which tripped the power board and arced the power input leaving nice char marks and melted metal on the plug. Tried with and without ground, used rain water with a bunch of salt added. Nothing. 2KV at upto 2200w should be able to make a litchenberg figure, but nothing :(  Edit: just tried again, and it kinda worked, there is now a couple of inch litchenberg figure on my box, I had more fun with making plasma arcs though."

My output (according to specs on the transformer, I don't have a multimeter that will test that high) is 2240v (input 110v, Canada). My biggest problem was that it's 31 degrees outside, and the sparking was drying out the wood very quickly, so I could never get it to reach fully across. I did get some smaller nice fractals though."

(Some reasonably badass elves managed it long ago but they were pretty dead after...and Durin's Bane—the one Gandalf fought—is the biggest and baddest.) Gandalf could easily smite the shit out of anything in Middle Earth if he wanted, except for the creatures of Morgoth, and by extension Sauron. (Also, Morgoth is the real Dark Lord. Sauron is just his shitty apprentice.)  Meanwhile, everyone in HP is working on a decidedly human scale. They can pull off some fancy tricks, like animating statues to Poké-battle, and throw flashy spells ineffectively at each other. But there's nothing so inhumanly powerful or bad. They're fighting to stop Wizard Hitler, who doesn't portray a terribly competent image. While in LOTR, Sauron's motives are inscrutable, as he's no more human than Gandalf, Voldemort is very human. He's a Hitleresque megalomaniac, but he's still human, and the scope of his power is still very limited."

Problem solved. (And not purely hypothetical -- I've done exactly this in a new apartment, though that was solving the yes-power-no-internet problem.)  I'd like to see this eventually go away, though. More and more things are able to be powered via USB. There's no technical reason a broadband modem couldn't be powered over a USB-C cable, or that you couldn't then get a cable that'd let you power said modem (or just about any other bit of electronics in your house) off of your laptop. You couldn't run a TV or a proper monitor that way, but again, more than enough to get the power company's website."

Internet is useless without power for the modem, and using my phone to tether with is also useless when it's batteries die.  Without power for more than 6-8 hours or so, internet would go away and I'd be back to square one.    Power and water (and gas, if you have a gas water heater or stove) are what turns a space from a glorified storage unit into a space fit for human habitation.

I mean, my laptop lasts some 8-12 hours on batteries, but that's still only a day or so. The fanciest setup would be phone charging from sleeping laptop while I use the tablet till its batteries run out, I might be able to get two days out of that. I can stretch it longer if I only use it to solve these five problems, and otherwise let my gadgets sleep and conserve power while I walk around and explore the neighborhood.  That's why the first priority is to get Internet so that I can then look up who the power company is, maybe even sign up through their website. With any luck, I can solve at least problems 1-4 without having to go anywhere or talk to anyone."

geek,3bzec3,IronMew,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:20:07 2015 UTC,"If it's truly without Internet, then there's no accessible neighbor's WiFi, and my phone's mobile network isn't working for whatever reason. Fixing that requires taking a trip to an ISP, which requires knowing where they are, which requires either checking the literal yellow pages, or wandering around asking for directions like it's the 90's. This is made worse by the fact that I don't have a car -- calling a Lyft or Uber requires Internet, so I'll be taking public transit or digging up those yellow pages to call a cab. (If I had a car, then I'd have power in the car, so does that really count?) And so on, and so on -- it's kind of shocking how much harder every aspect of your life becomes without Internet.  Even a few hours of Internet until I have nothing is more than enough time to, say, relocate to the nearest coffee shop that has wifi and power, and start working on all of these problems. It's even enough time to check the power company's website, get their phone number and call them if I have to, find out how to get them to hook up power (and how long it'll take), maybe relax for a couple hours listening to podcasts (a very low-power activity that lets most of my devices sleep) while I wait to see if they'll hook it up, and still have plenty of time to relocate to said coffee shop.  If it's power versus actual wired Internet, then sure -- first I need any Internet at all, then power, then I can take care of better Internet and all the other things."

Alternatively, put gas at #1 with internet -- give me a gas generator and I'll make my own power.  ...which, actually, is a thing I did once at a small-town LAN party. We had some 20 people over at a nice house in the country, and the power went out. We drove back into town to pick up someone's generator, then brought it back, hooked everything up, and got just enough power to run a few computers, an Ethernet switch, and whatever it was that was giving us DHCP. (I think a dedicated server, but maybe it was just a cheap router?)

geek,3bue7a,PacoBedejo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"Prosopagnosia:       Prosopagnosia /ˌprɒsəpæɡˈnoʊʒə/ (Greek: ""prosopon"" = ""face"", ""agnosia"" = ""not knowing""), also called face blindness,  is a cognitive disorder of face perception where the ability to recognize faces is impaired, while other aspects of visual processing (e.g., object discrimination) and intellectual functioning (e.g., decision making) remain intact. The term originally referred to a condition following acute brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia), but a congenital or developmental form of the disorder also exists, which may affect up to 2.5% of the population.  The specific brain area usually associated with prosopagnosia is the fusiform gyrus,  which activates specifically in response to faces. The functionality of the fusiform gyrus allows most people to recognize faces in more detail than they do similarly complex inanimate objects. For those with prosopagnosia, the new method for recognizing faces depends on the less-sensitive object recognition system. The right hemisphere fusiform gyrus is more often involved in familiar face recognition than the left. It remains unclear whether the fusiform gyrus is only specific for the recognition of human faces or if it is also involved in highly trained visual stimuli.

Do I have face-not-knowing, or am I just an inattentive jerk-ass?"

Without people with diverse backgrounds a team is going to have blind spots. A dark skinned programmer would have asked about this. Plenty of light skinned programmers would too, but it would have definitely been covered if the team was more diverse.  Just like Apple Watch's health tracking app. It was supposed to be all encompassing, every thing that has to do with your body and what not, and it launched without tracking periods. Rumor has it they had one woman on the team and when she recommended it they shot her down.

These people chose to be offended in a racial context based on their experience with other people. I'm pretty sure AI doesn't know nor care about race. Actually, the fact that it didn't recognize objects on a picture as people proves that racial context is not involved.  Facial recognition software has a history of confusing people's faces with something else. Hey, my friend is not a car wheel! How racist is that!

And it's not a big deal considering it's only one photo set that it's done this to- they were probably posing exactly like one of the control pictures used for gorillas.    Take a picture of a yellow Post-it note and get it tagged as cheese, no one bats an eye. A person gets tagged as a gorilla and everyone looses their minds."

Unfortunately the only other access I could have for internet (also wireless but much better company) is right through a stand of 150 year old trees and I can't afford the money to build a 80+ foot tower to reach over them. They have these wireless internet towers because the local phone and cable companies are assholes and won't replace shit lines or expand them despite people literally paying them money they came around to ask for to have it built years ago.  They actually collector money down this road years ago to put in cable, never happened. There is a DSL box down the road, it is empty because they don't want to replace the 50 year old phone lines.

If you talk to the Associates, they'll explain that the sections are just compressed because they have too many books for the 6 shelves of computer books they have.

GIFs on the other hand, at the highest quality, have a ""palette"" of 256 colors, indexed from 0 to 255. So the gif only has a single channel, with the value of the pixel being one of those 256 colors in the palette.  You can actually set it to even lower qualities too (128 colors, 64, 32, etc)."

geek,3b576u,VXeonix,2,Fri Jun 26 22:00:25 2015 UTC,"It is. One bit holds a 1 or a 0. A byte is a combination of 8 bits, so that's 8 possible 1s and 0s, or 28 combinations (i.e., number of points of data it can represent) which is 256!  Other examples are a 32 bit Integer is a whole number represented by 32 bits, so its 232 large, or 4294967296 (if it's positive only) but that's  less well known because it's not a limitation that is hit often (unless you write code), though Youtube had to change the way it recorded hits due to running out of integer space."

geek,3b576u,childofprophecy,3,Sat Jun 27 09:53:14 2015 UTC,"No, each pixel has 3 bytes each. One byte represents the number of red (0-256) one green, one blue.  Open paint, and go on the color picker. You can choose a colour and see what ratio of these colours there are in what you pick.  If each pixel was a single byte there would only be 256 colours available. That's not many (some compression images like gif use a color lookup chart and 256 colours. It looks very janky.)  ""RAW"" images use 16 million colours, i. e. 256x256x256. Often called a bitmap or bmp."

geek,3b576u,bonaqo,3,Sat Jun 27 01:09:55 2015 UTC,"Sound is almost insignificant next to video here, especially as such a resolution.  A 9 minute audio, even at 5 channels (which this probably isn't) and uncompressed, would still hardly be 200mb. Actually, we can do the math for that to if you'd like.  They usually use 16bit (2byte) per sample, 44100 samples per second. So 533s * 2 bytes * 44100 Hz = 44.8mb per channel. So at 5 channel, it'd be roughly 224mb as I predicted up there. Realistically, it was probably two channels so 100mb, which is nothing next to 370gb.  EDIT: It's worth noting that there are even higher audio settings, such as 24bit/96KHz. In which case, you have twice as many samples per second, is each sample is 1.5x bigger, so in total you end up with 3x the size. Even with that, it'd still be 300mb versus 370gb."
geek,3b576u,Ph0X,2,Sat Jun 27 01:59:03 2015 UTC,the sound would probably only add on a few Mbs

geek,3b576u,Logiteck77,4,Sat Jun 27 05:39:21 2015 UTC,"There are different ways to represent a color, but the most popular that is used by computers / monitors is RGB.  That is, each color has 3 values, for example (255, 100, 255) is a pink looking color. Here, the first value represent how much red we have, the second represents how much green, and the last one represents how much blue we have.  Here, each value is from 0 to 255, so 0 means there's no blue at all, and 255 means there's maximum amount of blue. (0, 255, 0) would be a pure green color.  Now imagine a 100x100 photo. Each channel here is a 100 x 100 ""table"", with each cell containing a value from 0 to 255. There's a table for red, one for green and one for blue.  So if you want to know the color of the pixel in the top right, you go to top right of each table, get the R, the G and the B value, put them together and get the color.  Here are two pictures which showcase what channels kinda look like:  http://i.imgur.com/szIxhH4.png  http://i.imgur.com/c0C1FzR.png  So the image is basically stored in 3 different ""layers"" and then merged together to give you the full color range. There are other color systems, for example, printers used CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) since that's the color of their inks. Therefore images in CMYK would be stored in 4 channels.  Another thing that's worth knowing is that you can have an extra channel for transparency, which tells you how see through each pixel is. So if the value is 255, the pixel is completely invisible."

geek,3b576u,autowikibot,2,Fri Jun 26 05:43:48 2015 UTC,"Uncompressed video:       Uncompressed video is digital video that either has never been compressed or was generated by decompressing video encoded in a lossless compression format. It is commonly employed by video cameras, which may convey it over various interfaces such as CamaraLink, DVI, HDMI, and SDI. It provides video of higher quality than is possible from decompressing lossy compression formats.   Although HD video capable cameras often include an HDMI interface for playback or live preview, most cameras compress the signal substantially, using a lossy compression method such as MPEG or H.264. In the compression process, a substantial amount of the captured data is removed, which reduces visual quality. Editing video which has never been compressed allows a final result with better quality, and compression is then applied after all editing has been performed. In a true ""Clean HDMI"" implementation, the camera will either transmit the signal as it is captured ""live,"" without the intermediate use of lossy compression, or the camera will capture, store, and transmit video in a RAW uncompressed format.  This article focuses on HDMI, because it is the dominant digital video interface used in cameras today. However, uncompressed video can be transmitted over other types of baseband video interfaces, such as DVI, DisplayPort and SDI. Uncompressed video can also be copied from a storage card, if the video is captured in a RAW format. It is important to note that all video modes used in the HDMI transmit uncompressed digital video. The distinction here is that the video content is ""clean,"" and has never been subjected to quality loss from compression.

This means 0.7gb per second.  Yours is 2.5gb for 10s, which is 0.25gb per second.  It's not quite 6x, but there could be other factors at play here, such as exact frame rate (can be anywhere between 23 to 30, or even up to 60).

Very bright, but if something alerted midday, the first question NOC asked was if he'd been working on it. One day, Klutz was on one of my web servers and ran a grep outputting to a file, in the folder where he was saving the results of the grep... Naturally, this became a self-fulfilling loop and in about half an hour, the server alerted for high drive capacity. It was 100% by the time I logged in to start looking. Looking at our monitoring graphs, you could see a stable ~40% utilization for days, and in the last three hours, it was a solid incremental growth followed by a solid line at the top.   I logged in, remembered he'd asked me some questions about that server earlier that day, and did a ""who.""

He was pretty broke so I knew he could pay to have it fixed but if I could help him out for free it'd be a huge help.   He had bought a used laptop and his issue was that he couldn't connect via ethernet, only wifi. Not a huge problem and I figured it was driver issues or some preinstalled HP bloatware messing with things. I start asking him questions and I quickly realize he's pretty knowledgeable. He's already tried reinstalling the drivers as well as checking his firewall and a few other common fixes for connectivity issues. I wondered why he hadn't just reinstalled Windows when he got it but he said it had the full version of some DAW program installed on it or something like that.  It took me a while to figure it out and he honestly was the one who helped me finally find the issue when he said, ""Why don't you check the settings for the ethernet adapter"" and sure enough in the IPV4 properties it was set to a static IP address and DNS server. He had actually checked a lot of the settings himself but didn't really know what a lot of them meant or were supposed to be set to.

geek,3axysb,y0shman,46,Thu Jun 25 00:31:42 2015 UTC,"The cause is either the clock getting out of sync from the DC or the computer be off for a long while.

Occasionally, the DC will change this ""password"" and if it doesn't get a hold of the client, the client will keep the old ""password"".  You may want to check all your ports and that none are being blocked by your firewall.  90% of the time, it's the clocks being out of sync."
geek,3axysb,topgun966,5,Wed Jun 24 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"Another main cause of this when it falls off the domain is after reimages. For example, when I would get a computer that would need to be wiped, they would already replace it in the field but when I would power it on and forget to boot to the PXE it would go back online and kick the other one off the domain. (Same hostname different GUID's). Easiest solution was just take it off the domain and rejoin. And more coffee to hit F12 on boot to go to the imaging server."
geek,3axysb,impediment,11,Wed Jun 24 15:00:09 2015 UTC,I've found it easier to have the image not joined to the domain. It only takes a minute to join it up. Having the image already joined to the domain means it won't request a new sid from the DC and eventually causes issues.

geek,3axysb,Xibby,7,Wed Jun 24 23:51:07 2015 UTC,"Always verify DNS and Time first. It will save you so many headaches. Remember, it's alway DNS or Time Sync, except when it's not. 90% or more of domain trust issues between a domain controller and domain joined computer are DNS or Time issues. Always check DNS and Time first.   Clear? ;)    For the other issue, just like user objects in AD, computer objects have a ""password"" as well.  Occasionally, the DC will change this ""password"" and if it doesn't get a hold of the client, the client will keep the old ""password"".     Almost correct there. The Domain Policy sets when the computer object's password expires, but the computer not the domain controller is responsible for changing the password. If the computer can't connect to a domain controller before it's password expires, the computer's password will be expired, trust breaks, etc. This happens so infrequently that you should check that DNS and Time Sync are working correctly before going down this route, but it's easy to query the pwdLastSet attribute out of Active Directory to check for this problem.   If PowerShell is on the system, use Rejoin-Computer on the troubled computer to quickly fix."

geek,3axysb,sewebster87,3,Wed Jun 24 14:52:35 2015 UTC,"A neat trick to doing this when the user can't get into the VPN (which would be the situation) is to use Lync if you have it to do desktop sharing.  Lync does some neat P2P things when you're on the same network which is one of the reasons it's so popular, but it also routes externally as long as your lync server is externally available.    Teamviewer is good, but if you're not paying for it then you're the customer (eg. If you work in an industry with sensitive data, you probably shouldn't use Teamviewer Free)"

When the computer loses eth it defaults to cached credentials, which will allow it to log in even though the domain has no trust relationship.  Once they log in, have them plug the eth back in and then you can remote in using your remote tool of choice to disjoin/rejoin for them.  I will accept beer as thanks."

geek,3axysb,solmakou,2,Wed Jun 24 17:27:28 2015 UTC,It's due to machine password expiring on the workstation while not communicating with the DC.
geek,3axysb,hectavex,3,Wed Jun 24 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"The only time that workstation is not communicating with the DC is when it is turned off each day. I can't imagine what would cause a perfect storm such that 1) the workstation loses its connection to the DC, and 2) the workstation's password suddenly expires. This computer is hard-wired to the LAN/domain and gets used every day; there is no period of time when the user is gone more than 7 days for vacation. Furthermore, the problem tends to occur when the user is present (half way through their work day), but sometimes it was first thing in the morning.  Every article I have read says to rejoin the computer to the domain, or reset the secure channel using NETDOM. Both of these work to re-establish the domain trust relationship, but neither one is a permanent fix.  You said in another comment that the fix is to change the machine password expiration to 60+ days. I'm curious how that would work as a fix, and why our other workstations do not require this fix? If the problem was indeed an expiring machine password, wouldn't setting the expiration to 60 days instead of 30 just prolong the time it takes for the issue to happen again?"
geek,3axysb,solmakou,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"That's very strange it's happening while a user is logged in, I've never seen that before.  My assumption is that there might be an issue with DC replication/DNS/NTP if it happens to multiple computers, but only happening to one machine, that's weird.  Wonder if there is a SID issue.  My only other thought is you might not be deleting the object in AD (across all DCs) before rejoining it to the domain?    Correct on your second paragraph, the recommendations for resolving the issue are not solutions and are only bandaids til the problem comes back.  I'm not positive on how the machine password reset works, but I assume there is a time frame in which it will reset the password starting at 21 days or so and then lasting until the value you set in Group Policy.  In both environments I put this change into place (60 days) there was never a single instance of losing the trust relationship again.  First environment was ~100 remote sites and a a few dozen laptops ~1200 workstations ~120 servers, spent maybe 5 months dealing with the issue trying to figure it out, left a year later after implementation.  Second environment I still work at, as soon as I got here 10 months ago made the change and there has not been another instance of the issue."

For us, the problem is rather harmless since it takes about 5 minutes to fix and the user profile always gets restored.  We have 2 DCs so it's a possibility the computer was only removed from one of them when I attempted ""delete all the things and start over"" for that computer a while back... I'll make sure to hit both DCs next time to see if that was the problem and if not, I'll try the 60 day expiration.  Last thing, if I disjoin/rejoin the computer with a new NetBIOS name, doesn't that create a whole new computer object, SID, SC and trust relationship which is totally unrelated to the old computer remnants? Tried that too."

geek,3axysb,rinyre,4,Wed Jun 24 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"Probably won't get to the top, but unjoining and rejoining isn't the only fix. If you have PowerShell 3.0 (Windows Management Framework) or newer  installed, there's a simple command you can run as a local admin to fix it:  Reset-ComputerMachinePassword -Server <yourdomaincontroller> -Credential <domain>\<DomainAdminUser>   Once the command is run, it'll prompt for your password, then allow you to reboot and it'll be fixed. You can find out the installed Powershell version with this command:  $PSVersionTable.PSVersion   Hopes this helps people. We now proactively install Windows Management Framework 3.0 on our Windows 7 devices to simplify this process."

Some organizations prebuild computers and then store them for later use or ship them to remote locations. If the computer's account has expired, it will no longer be able to authenticate with the domain. Computers that cannot authenticate with the domain must be removed from the domain and rejoined to it. For this reason, some organizations might want to create a special organizational unit (OU) for computers that are prebuilt, and configure the value for this policy setting to a larger number of days."

The 555 can be used to provide time delays, as an oscillator, and as a flip-flop element. Derivatives provide up to four timing circuits in one package.  Introduced in 1971 by American company Signetics, the 555 is still in widespread use due to its ease of use, low price, and stability. It is now made by many companies in the original bipolar and also in low-power CMOS types. As of 2003 [update], it was estimated that 1 billion units are manufactured every year.

He puts in a lot of work mining various sources for new interesting content to submit here. You should be thankful instead of bitching about it.

I haven't seen a story that deals directly with it, but they reference their kinship in some myths. They were either raised together, or were close friends who bound themselves together as brothers at a young age.  Edit: also, predating is not necessarily accurate. Odin's folks, Borr and Bestla, belong to the whole mess of giants that came from Ymir, as do Loki's parents. This graphic is compressed and concise.  Edit 2: edit one may be wrong. The versions of the creation myth that I have read state that Audumla licked Ymir from the ice--I thought that buri was a descendant of Ymir."

I cant remember any specific myth that ties loki to Odin as anything more than a once close friend, but they werent raised together.

In Norse Mythology, the terms elf and dwarf are often used interchangably, and sometimes as two distinct people. Ithun is described as being descended from elves, and being the youngest of the oldest set of children of a dwarf named Ivaldi.

Magnetic force is used to counteract the effects of the gravitational acceleration and any other accelerations.  The two primary issues involved in magnetic levitation are lifting force: providing an upward force sufficient to counteract gravity, and stability: ensuring that the system does not spontaneously slide or flip into a configuration where the lift is neutralized.  Magnetic levitation is used for maglev trains, contactless melting, magnetic bearings and for product display purposes.

A telescope that would be looking at the sun often enough to catch this flare would have to be a solar telescope and only capture a narrow band of wavelengths. Only way it can capture so many different wavelengths of the same event is if it's an array of ground based telescopes. That's to the best of my understanding at least.
geek,3am0yv,achshar,20,Sun Jun 21 20:06:53 2015 UTC,This can be from a telescope but it seems unlikely to me.   The 4th image in the GIF has a stamp on it that says it's from the STEREO mission. Every one of these images is probably from a space telescope.

The telescope is designed for observations in the microwave, millimeter-wave, and submillimeter-wave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, with the particular design goal of measuring the faint, diffuse emission from the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  The first major survey with the SPT–designed to find distant, massive, clusters of galaxies through their interaction with the CMB, with the goal of constraining the dark energy equation of state–was completed in October, 2011. In early 2012, a new camera was installed on the SPT with even greater sensitivity and the capability to measure the polarization of incoming light. This camera is designed to measure the so-called ""B-mode"" or ""curl"" component of the polarized CMB, leading to constraints on the mass of the neutrino and the energy scale of inflation.

A solar coronal mass ejection hit Earth's magnetosphere and induced one of the largest geomagnetic storms on record. The associated ""white light flare"" in the solar photosphere was observed and recorded by English astronomers Richard C. Carrington and Richard Hodgson.

T-Mo has an online-only 5 GB/mo plan for $30. With Project Fi, the calculator says I'd be paying $70/mo  if I used all 5 GB, or $45/mo if I used the ~2.5 GB I typically use in a month.  The only major advantage Fi offers over T-Mo is the inclusion of the Sprint network, which largely overlaps T-Mo, and the automatic switch to hotspot usage for data and calls (which already happens on many higher-end T-Mo phones).  It's cool and all, and it's a great choice if you're coming from a carrier like Verizon, but sadly it's not for everyone."
geek,3al05n,the_old_sock,5,Sun Jun 21 12:44:42 2015 UTC,that plan only has 100 minutes of talk time on it  Edit: Found out if you buy a sim card at Walmart you can hop onto this plan which I am doing next month

geek,3al05n,rnawky,7,Sun Jun 21 15:54:03 2015 UTC,It's actually a pretty simple statement. T-Mobile offers a mostly data only plan for less that Google offers Fi. It has the benefit of not charging the customer for time on the cellular network they say they're not going to use and also not surprisingly it has the exact same negative most mobile plans have... limited data or high cost data.  Rather than use your phone you have to watch your bandwidth usage. We should use our voice (our wallets) to discourage companies from once again charging us by the minute (or in this case Mebibyte).

geek,3aidbb,suoicsnoc,7,Sat Jun 20 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"The kangaroo's placement sets X and Y, according to the row and column. Then the graph shows Y's multiplication table, modulo X. That is to say, a line starts at point Z=0, 1, 2, etc, and goes to the point that is ZY. So on the twos table, there's a line from 0 to 0, because 02=0. Then, a line from 1 to 2 because 12=2. Let's say X=10, so it's modulo X, so because 52=10 and 10%10=0, there's a line from 5 to 0. And so on. The number of points around is equal to X, so I found it easiest to understand at X=10 (the top middle dot is 0, then it proceeds clockwise). You can use the arrow keys to move the kangaroo around.

For Germany, if you are over 18 and have a valid driver's license from your home state, you are allowed to drive a car. Though only people 21 and over will be able to rent a car.  As long as the license is in English you don't need an international driver's permit in Germany.  However, it would be smart to obtain an International Driver's Permit, which you can obtain at the AAA in the US, if you plan on visiting other countries. It's just $15, so, why not get it? :) http://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html  You must obtain this IDP in the US. But there is no need to take classes in Germany.

At least during the day, I'd guess a good part of it does have a limit. The stretch I drive every day is about 20kms of nothing but fields: maize, potatoes, soybeans, etc., but there's a speed limit for all but the final couple (which are around the largest city in the region).   There are still plenty of areas where there are still only two lanes per direction and daytime speed limits. 130km is close to some of the highway speedlimits in the US (north-central and northwest) and parts of Texas are higher.

Around big cities or other dangerous areas you do have speed limits. And of course if there is construction work there is always a speed limit. And they always work on the Autobahns so its not possible to drive hundres of miles without speed limit.

geek,3aiyvx,RUoffended,2,Sun Jun 21 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, its illegal to own a gun in germany. Rules are very strict. Only security forces or people with a dangerous job profile are allowed to carry guns (for example a judge). Feds dont fuck around with illegal guns. They come and kick your door in with SWAT team if they are suspicious you have illegal firearms. And btw: you are not allowed to carry (many) knives either. If the blade is longer then 12 cm (4,7 inches) or if you can open it with only one hand, its illegal too. You can own it, but you can not carry it with you. Of course there are exceptions, for example when you buy a kitchen knife and you have to drive it home.     I'm pretty sure you are allowed to own firearms in Germany, if you have a gun license off course."

Halt and Catch Fire is a show set at a computer company in the 80s. It's accessible to non-tech people, and has a sort of Mad Men feel, but focused on engineers and programmers instead of an ad agency.  What you're trying to do here is really good, and respectful.

There is an absolutely massive range of geek/Sci-fi/fantasy media ranging from very serious to comedic to completely ridiculous.  There is literally something for everyone and I can tell you that there are some mainstays in terms of tv and movies that I absolutely cannot stand.  I would take a look at what you like already and then try to transition into it using that as a starting point.

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdbLu_x0g) it doesn't have musch to do with the plot, so it is I think the best episode to get the ""taste of the show"", and it is a really really nice one."

Conceived by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, it was initially intended as a one-shot, but due to its popularity it became an ongoing series. The comic inspired the franchise, four television series, five feature films, numerous video games, and a wide range of toys and merchandise.  Over the years, the Turtles have appeared in numerous cross-overs with other independent comics characters such as Dave Sim's Cerebus, Erik Larsen's Savage Dragon, Bob Burden's Flaming Carrot and Stan Sakai's Usagi Yojimbo.  In 2009 Peter Laird sold the Turtles franchise to Viacom, the parent company of Nickelodeon, and as a result Mirage Studios had to shut down. At WonderCon 2011, it was announced that IDW Publishing had secured the rights to publish a new series and reprint the older comics.

The term ""caber"" derives from the Gaelic word ""cabar"" or ""kaber"" which refers to a wooden beam.  The person tossing the caber is called a ""tosser"" or a ""thrower"".

geek,3a5t4h,harebrane,34,Wed Jun 17 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"Starcraft is an excellent example of where the book's lessons can be applied.  The main points I take away:   Gain as much intel as possible When you are weak, show strength When you are strong, show weakness Flexibility is critical Pick your battles If your enemy is secure, prepare for him. If he is taking a rest, give him none If you base a decision on instinct, you may be setting yourself up for failure Attack unguarded spots (drops! harass!)

geek,3a5t4h,arcrinsis,10,Wed Jun 17 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"The issue is that there are a lot of things that make logical sense, but you still wouldn't think of them in the moment.   I recently started doing jiu jitsu, and it's a great example of this idea - there's nothing that I've learned in jiu jitsu so far that doesn't make complete, logical sense to do. I imagine it's the same in other martial arts. The issue is that, in the moment, in the middle of combat, you would not think to do those things, because you do not have the time to come up with those things logically. Even if you did have the time to come up with those ideas, you may not - simply because, without having been exposed to them previously, they would not occur to you.  Reading or practicing lessons, even lessons that seem perfectly logical, enough to have completely internalized them - such that they don't need logical thought to occur to you - makes you more capable of applying those lessons, in short."

geek,3a5t4h,chicklette,2,Thu Jun 18 02:01:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of those could be applied to poker as well.  First one is basically, learn to read people.  Second one, bluff.  Third one, don't over-play your hand and scare everyone out of the hand so that you don't win any money.  Fourth one, try to mix it up every once and a while to make it harder for people to guess what you're holding.  Fifth one, know when it's time to fold even if you've already put a lot of money into the hand.  Tenth one, know when it's time to bet in a way to try to just end it--maybe you could make more money off of dragging things out more, but if it's a situation where the other person is likely enough to be holding a hand that beats yours, try to just push them out before they can get a lucky turn or a river that steals the hand from you."

A couple other thoughts *why the Bible and no other religious text? *is that really a synopsis for Wealth of Nations. If so, I should read it for debate points with corporatist conservatives. Yes, that should be a political descriptor. *I like how The Prince and Art of War are near the bottom. It ends on a very strong conflict manipulation for personal gain/social theory swing. This is in sharp contrast with the beginning of the list which has more basic metaphysical questions - ones of faith and  natural laws. *and then, the order. Intentional or not? Is there a better order to read them?"

He should stick to what he knows.  As far as the Art of War goes, I doubt he has actually read it. I say this because I have read four different translations and it advises against killing far more often than it advises killing, or ways of killing. It is about statesmanship, not battles. It is about building alliances and forging lasting peace. Tyson is BS'ing about something he doesn't really know anything about. It makes you wonder how often he does it."

He should be inspiring people to reach beyond their current level of thought. This is different than just plain dumbing things down.   It is possible to make complex theory's and concepts approachable, without going straight to ELI5. ELI5 is how you tell people ""this is the way it is"" which is no different than a priest telling someone ""this is the way it is"". The whole point of the scientific thought and understanding is to foster a thought pattern in people that has them ask why, to look for answers, and practice critical thinking in their lives.  Granted his ELI5 is much more practical to people than many traditional religious teachings, but if his ""followers/fans"" just take his words for granted, then it is still falling short of the goal in my opinion."

The number one rule it preaches is to win without a single battle, but through diplomacy, statecraft, and intelligence.  Any type of fighting, in Sun Tsu's opinion, is the inferior solution.  The remainder of the book describe the violent alternatives and how to make those last as short as possible.  It's also a highly abstract book, the doctrines it teaches can be applied to any type of conflicts, not just limited to war.     Conflicts are inevitable part of nature.  The book is about how to achieve peace when it happens."

geek,3a5t4h,kaldrazidrim,4,Thu Jun 18 01:42:47 2015 UTC,"Not an academic book but Neil Gaimon's American gods is pretty interesting. It's a narrative that interwines traditional gods and beings in a modern setting, a lot of interesting thoughts into the nature of belief and the historical basis for religions and superstitions.  Also QED by Feynman is a good introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics (a lot more applicable than you may think!), he did a great job of simplifying the science to a point where a layman can work to understand it. It's by no means and easy read but easier than pure textbook on the subject.   The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a ""self help book"" but is often referenced and can be a good thing to bear in mind if nothing else.   The Republic by Plato, is a very common thing to see in entry level philosophy courses (along with Descartes) but I think that it's all the same a very important thing to read, it's where the Allegory of the Cave comes from and the introduction of the philosopher king.  The Banality of Evil by Hannah Arendt is about the trial of former Nazi post World War II, the main message tends to be the evil isn't something forthright and obvious but a lot of times evil just comes from people following orders.  I'm sure more will come to me but these are some pretty great books. I don't think that intelligence necessarily comes from reading certain books but rather learning how to take value from all books and situations. The political subtext in A Song of Ice and Fire, and Wicked, can be just as interesting as older philosophical texts, if only because they wrap themselves in a tasty narrative that still gives us room to think."

geek,3a5t4h,Fsoprokon,7,Thu Jun 18 01:10:50 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I don't think he's ever really sold himself as much more than that, people just got really attached to him.  From everything I can remember reading about him, including him talking about himself, he was pretty good but most definitely not great at astronomy or physics or anything. I'm pretty sure that's precisely why he went the science populizer route--he knew he wasn't going to make any particularly significant direct contributions to astronomy or physics, but felt pretty confident that he could get other people excited about astronomy and physics. If nothing else that's kind of important for fields that are so government-dominated and thus need voter/taxpayer buy-in for funding (particularly physics, where the issue isn't just the money involved but the fact that the government has basically just forcibly taken control of it by classifying a lot of it/deeming it crucial to national security/etc).  Also--I mean sure, people like Sagan took a great interest in him, but from what I recall you really can't discount the fact that it's because it was the 1970s and he was a black guy from the inner-city who showed a pretty good interest in and aptitude for astronomy and physics. I'm not trying to say that he isn't legitimately an above-par scientist (even if above-par isn't good enough to keep you from deciding you can't make a big contribution), but only that I'm sure there were plenty of people with equal ability that people like Sagan would have considered a dime a dozen if not for NDT's life circumstances."

One, our language has a lot of words that are very close to having the same meaning, but are slightly different or have different connotations.  Using these different words allows for a better understanding of a given thought, even if it's very slight.  Second, we are more inclined to use new, more sophisticated words, simply because they are more complex.

geek,3a5t4h,GeeJo,50,Wed Jun 17 18:28:12 2015 UTC,"That recommendation was clearly going for the ""classiness"" of reading the older, historically important book. If you're just going for understanding, you'll have to acknowledge that Darwin was, from a modern perspective, a neophyte in the realm of evolution. Much of what he said was correct, and certainly it got the ball rolling, but it's certainly less correct that something more modern. Obviously it's going to be totally devoid of any discussion of DNA, for example."

Edit: Regardless of your beliefs, shitting on someone else's just because you don't agree with them is as bigoted and juvenile as the worst conservative religious-nuts (e.g. Westboro Baptist). I have no problem with atheists or religious folks who remain peaceful but antitheists can go eat a dick. It's just as bad as any hate group out there.  Edit: Because people think they're one and the same- Atheism is belief there is no God. Antitheism is the active opposition of theism. Theism isn't hurting anyone the same way that Atheism isn't hurting anyone. It's people that take their twisted versions of those two beliefs that lead to suffering."

For the New Testament, I'd go with:  Matthew or Luke (cover similar ground) and John (which was written a bit later, and is more about the theology and identity of Jesus, rather than a being more primarily a history), and Acts. These 3 will give you the historic context.  You'd definitely be missing out on a lot of the theology of the church without reading any epistles. I'd recommend Romans and Ephesians, which are a bit more general than the others. Revelation is solid, but honestly, it takes a lot of analysis to make headway through. I would recommend a commentary to help you through it. It can be made sense of, but a cursory reading won't get you there."

The Origin of Species is a seminal work, but like most seminal works it has been eclipsed and there is lots of great evolutionary biology accessible at an entry level. You wouldn't require a philosophy amateur to read the Meditations of Descartes, after all. The same goes for Wealth of Nations.   As for The Prince, there is a great deal to be said about that book; suffice to say that it doesn't teach Neil's assumed lesson, but rather it assumes that lesson already learnt, and then talks about the mechanics of how that takes place.   The biggest travesty is probably his flippancy regarding the Bible: looking at it you can pretty much understand the basis for a lot of human thought and morals, and a fair bit of history among others.

At the time it was groundbreaking because it was carefully crafted with stories that spanned not just episodes, but whole seasons and the entire run.  It wasn't the first to move away from the episodic formula but it was successful at bringing larger arcs to the small screen. And yeah, I would regularly tear into the show for all the stupid stuff it did, especially in the first two seasons."

I think they're talking about changing your master password, not the passwords that are encrypted by your master password. From what I understand from initial reports earlier today, the hashes of the master passwords were in fact stolen.  I'm not sure it's a grave threat, especially since this guy has a 20+ character master password, but for others with shorter and easier to guess master passwords it would be highly recommended that you change your master password immediately to ensure you beat any attempts of brute force/rainbow table attacks from the stolen hashes.  Now, since they're doing email verification on new devices, it's very unlikely they'll generate your password and be able to compromise your email. But, keep in mind that email is not secure, it's not encrypted and it can be captured by any party between you and the sender/recipient. So, it's also not too far fetched to intercept email... and if they've generated your password they only need one attempt to get in.  As it was noted, two factor authentication (2FA) is your best friend for sensitive accounts. On that note, I wish more banks offered it!"

You might not be able to break a specific account password, but you can create a list of common passwords, hash those, then search for any accounts that have a password hash in the set you just created. That gives you the password for that account, and then all the plaintext passwords for the accounts stored in that account.

That said, an easy password will still be easy to guess, especially if you don't have two-factor."

The first thing they're going to do is compare the stolen hash table against existing rainbow tables (pre-generated hash tables based on common passwords). If your master password is a person's name, a dictionary word, a brand name, a sequential set of numbers or any other common password, they're going to find a matching hash very quickly... within minutes.  Now, lets hope that lastpass has a proper salting mechanism in place (and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they do)... then that obfuscation is really your best shot at security when you're using a short master password, not the hash length itself. If the salts and salting mechanism were also stolen, then a short master password is going to be cracked very quickly."

geek,39zjsa,_lost_,8,Tue Jun 16 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they would have a massive lawsuit on their hands if they lied like that. Lastpass has always been pretty open about any potential breaches.   They're a fairly transparent company, and even if hackers made away with everything, by using strong encryption the only real danger is brute force attacks, which are slow enough to let all users know to change their passwords before they're compromised.  There's no perfect way to deal with password security. By keeping everything local, you're likely using weaker encryption and making it easier to crack should your computer be compromised. By using the cloud, you can use stronger encryption but you make it a more tempting target for hackers to steal in bulk."
geek,39zjsa,roscocoltrane,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:03:08 2015 UTC,That's an unwarranted assumption about encryption strength; Keepass is plenty secure with AES-256. What I do give up is a little bit of convenience.

geek,39zjsa,noratat,3,Tue Jun 16 08:22:32 2015 UTC,"No, we do not know exactly what the hackers stole. But being a security developer, I can pretty much guarantee that LastPass does not leave everything in clear text, it will be encrypted with the password hash. If they didn't at least do this, this security company would have gone out of business a long time ago.  So, assuming that they at least done the basic security stuff, the most that the hackers should have been able to get was the blob of encrypted data which is encrypted with your password hash. So, to get to the encrypted data they need to figure out the encryption algorithm and your password from the hash. A hash by the way cannot be decrypted, you have to figure out the hash algorithm and key and brute force it until your brute force value equals the hashed value, then you can assume that you have discovered the user's password to be able to figure out the decryption algorithm. Each user should have their own hash, so even if a single user's hash/encryption algorithm is discovered, they still have to redo the same for the next user. It's just simple basic security 101. They are a security firm so I'm betting that they have implemented something more complex."

geek,39zjsa,tooterfish_popkin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:59:33 2015 UTC,"Which means that the only way they will be able to validate the assumed passwords is to try to log in. So they practically have to brute force logins which isn't a problem if you have 2-factor security. If you don't, a brute force attack on a user's login will definitely raise a red flag and the account should get locked. The only way they should be able to get your data is that they successfully discovered your password in very little tries (password hint?) and the user hasn't set up multi-factor security."

geek,39w2yh,MatteAce,0,Tue Jun 16 01:43:57 2015 UTC,really... do you think I'm a random kid? in the last 4-5 years I've learned this trick I've never had a broken cable more than the average of not doing it. what kills the cable is not the knot but the torque. xlr cables are quite sturdy when taken care of properly.   I've actually broken more cables when I was a kid and I was wrapping them using my forearm as the center. but if you give them a very slight torque in the natural direction of the cable they'll wrap by themselves and they'll never ever break.
geek,39w2yh,IcarusForde,2,Tue Jun 16 02:04:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not disputing the wrapping of the cables-  if you want to go there, that's a whole different story. I'm disputing the entirely un-necessary need to put a knot in a cable - not just XLR.  You go do it with 3G-SDI or tri-ax and let me know how it goes, regardless of whether you put it in the direction of the cabling twist or not - you're gonna kill that cable. Just because XLR might be more flexible than coaxial based cables doesn't mean you should treat them any different - same as feeder cable, multicores, speaker cabling, the lot. It's just not necessary."

geek,39w2yh,Mexicorn,3,Mon Jun 15 16:40:35 2015 UTC,Seriously! A/V drawer. Power drawer. Networking drawer. Internal connection drawer. External connection drawer.
geek,39w2yh,beefmeats,2,Mon Jun 15 23:18:38 2015 UTC,www.amazon.com/Mini-Micro-Adapter-Charger-Converter/dp/B00M3Z8OY4  Problem solved.
geek,39w2yh,Undertoad,14,Mon Jun 15 13:17:12 2015 UTC,where did I put that fucking adapter
geek,39w2yh,KungFuHamster,2,Mon Jun 15 14:20:19 2015 UTC,"Check the shipping date on that before you order it. Not exactly Amazon Prime - mine came up ""FREE Standard — get it July 10-28"" And you thought the days of 4-6 weeks for shipping and handling were gone!"
geek,39w2yh,DeFex,3,Mon Jun 15 14:24:32 2015 UTC,China is where everything cheap on eBay and Amazon comes from.
geek,39w2yh,basotl,2,Mon Jun 15 14:47:02 2015 UTC,dryer sock imps are branching out.
geek,39w2yh,anothergaijin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:44:18 2015 UTC,I have four bins like this. They were all neatly organized until my three year old son thought it would be great to reorganize the cables. I'll get around to organizing them again sometime.
geek,39w2yh,explodingmonk,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:00:01 2015 UTC,This is why I have a few cheap mini<>micro adapters kicking around
geek,39w2yh,ItWorkedLastTime,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:09:28 2015 UTC,I went through this just the other day... it was horrifying.
geek,39w2yh,KungFuHamster,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:19:06 2015 UTC,What is the storage unit you are using?
geek,39w2yh,SlaughterMeister,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:27:03 2015 UTC,I have several similar. I think they're from Walmart.
geek,39w2yh,Horsepipe,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"Just a standard 3 drawer plastic container, don't know where it was bought."
geek,39w2yh,rocketwidget,2,Mon Jun 15 15:30:38 2015 UTC,Walmart. I bet you anything.
geek,39w2yh,yumenohikari,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:28:50 2015 UTC,So you labeled your box but didn't cable tie your cables?
geek,39w2yh,rocketwidget,0,Mon Jun 15 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"Well it happens in cycles. This is the worst it'll get. I'll tie them all up and it'll be nice for a few months, then this again."
geek,39w2yh,yumenohikari,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, manufacturers will replace everything with USB C, and this problem will go away."
geek,39w2yh,rocketwidget,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:06:28 2015 UTC,Hopefully.
geek,39w2yh,xkcd_transcriber,2,Mon Jun 15 16:38:39 2015 UTC,"LOL agreed, but it's not like it's impossible for tech standards to become dominant: Blu Ray & Bluetooth come to mind.  Heck, you could make an argument that USB A is the dominant standard for computers, because basically, you can't buy a computer without a USB size A port (but A is too big for smaller devices).  Is it crazy to imagine C taking over that role, and also being small enough to become the dominant standard for small devices too?"
geek,39w2yh,njbair,2,Mon Jun 15 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, I welcome it, for any number of reasons (not least the bandwidth), I'm just worried that it'll take us a while to get there, and it'll suck if there's not at least some consideration to future-proofing (like cable specs that can handle well over the specified 10Gbps)."
geek,39w2yh,Purp,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:01:14 2015 UTC,"Bam, already future proofed :-) Thunderbolt 3 has just been announced, it has USB C ends and does 20 Gbit/s on a normal USB C passive cable!  It additionally does 40 Gbit/s with an active cable (USB C ends, but more expensive). Here's a cool article:  http://www.anandtech.com/show/9331/intel-announces-thunderbolt-3"

geek,39w2yh,ekdaemon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:29:15 2015 UTC,ALL I CAN FIND IS USB-C CABLES.  I DON'T EVEN HAVE ANYTHING THAT USES USB-C YET.
geek,39w2yh,Shadax,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:00:13 2015 UTC,"At least 3 or 4 times a year, I need a mini USB. I trudge through this box of cables for a minute or 10 before I remember that I literally just have to unplug one of my keyboards and use that cable. I don't even need to plug in the normal port side as it's already plugged in, obviously.   It's like such a relief, but a ""goddamnit"" at the same time."
