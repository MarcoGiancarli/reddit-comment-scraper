TheWeeknd,3e4h5n,sousoupie,4,Tue Jul 21 22:36:35 2015 UTC,God damn wow. This sounds like a pretty dope intro track imo
TheWeeknd,3e4h5n,Tonypacheco_10,3,Tue Jul 21 22:47:50 2015 UTC,"I hope when he releases this one officially, it'll come with another track around the same time. Kinda like what he did with 'The Hills' and CFMF"
TheWeeknd,3e4h5n,ComeHomeTrueLove,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:07:14 2015 UTC,Do you think he'd actually release it officially with only about a month until the album drops?

TheWeeknd,3e6231,professionalXO,3,Wed Jul 22 06:03:03 2015 UTC,"If I'm being honest, it depends on my mood. All of his songs off Trilogy are flawless to me, unlike any other artist, so I cannot rank them definitely. If I'm feeling down, my top songs might be Next, Echoes of Silence, The Birds Pt. 2 or Wicked Games; if I'm feeling happy I'll go listen to some Kanye because Abel doesn't know what joy is."
TheWeeknd,3e6231,builderoftheark,0,Wed Jul 22 07:10:51 2015 UTC,if I'm feeling happy I'll go listen to some Kanye because Abel doesn't know what joy is   umm.. Can't Feel My Face?  people asking why he's doing poppy sounds like CFMF and this is exactly why. you can't reach new heights as an artist if you're pigeon-holed as that guy who does depressed druggy music. if fans say this imagine how brutal critics would be. fly fly Weeks.
TheWeeknd,3e6231,-Me_NotSure,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:12:21 2015 UTC,1) Wicked games  2) Often  3) The birds pt 2  4) The zone  5) The hills  6) The knowing  7) Loft music  8) House of balloons  9) king of the fall  10) lonely star.  All excellent songs

TheWeeknd,3dt10o,Gotie,3,Sun Jul 19 06:13:12 2015 UTC,"Nah i didn't man. I bought it in June this year randomly, as i was traveling around New York. It was $1050 Australian. So i think about 700USD?"
TheWeeknd,3dt10o,Gotie,3,Sun Jul 19 06:18:25 2015 UTC,Damn that's actually not a bad price compared to some of the listings I've seen. The frame looks dope by the way! You've got me looking all over for the vinyl now lol
TheWeeknd,3dt10o,Gotie,3,Sun Jul 19 06:22:19 2015 UTC,"Haha i know right dude, I looked earlier in the year and there were some going for like 3000$? Like its ridiculous.

TheWeeknd,3drk0k,builderoftheark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:01:47 2015 UTC,here is where I came across it. Under the track listing.
TheWeeknd,3drk0k,-Me_NotSure,6,Sat Jul 18 21:47:39 2015 UTC,"look closer. Weeknd did write it all himself. his name is on every song. guess who else's name is on the song? the producer(s) of each song, not some other third party. it's fair to guess that whatever work the producers do entitled them to writing credits, or maybe he willingly share credit, which is good for royalty payments and stuff. the point is I'm pretty sure the lyrics themselves are all him. Jeremy Rose said in that interview if his that Weeknd had tons of stuff written in his phone before he met him, that he carried the phone everywhere and was constantly writing on it. he probably still does that too.  oh and the names that do look random on some of those songs are because of the samples. check which songs have more than Weeknd and the producer(s) listed as writers, and you'll find that they're the same songs with samples listed at the bottom. so it's the writers of those original songs that the samples were taken from."
TheWeeknd,3drk0k,secretladyboner,2,Sat Jul 18 22:07:37 2015 UTC,"No, most songs are made by multiple talented people to make the best song possible. Would you rather have a half-good song than a amazing song?"

TheWeeknd,3dd3qa,willwill919,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:46:30 2015 UTC,what difference would it make if you got a digital signature that is exactly identical that of the weeknd's ? even the digital one is technically hand signed since he would need to sign it then they copy it and so on  or probably first 500 are hand signed and the rest is digital
TheWeeknd,3dd3qa,Eorlas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:18:18 2015 UTC,"You conveniently skipped adding ""first 500 copies are hand signed"" to your quotations.  The title of this post is click bait and its content is weak at best.  It's not going to run out because after 500 copies have sold out the print is going to be copies of one signature. Theoretically the first 500 get a unique sig.  Not really much difference to note here. The quality still stands."

TheWeeknd,3dbuna,Bestbeforetomorrow,0,Fri Jul 17 11:59:21 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Often & King Of The Fall will not be released on the album. Also. In the night is most likely a track he will sell.

TheWeeknd,3daen8,Despicable_life,8,Fri Jul 17 02:39:40 2015 UTC,"I think we will have an album that will make both old and new fans happy. Judging from the songs we have heard so far, it feels like it will be an album with two styles. A combination of a more funky Michael Jackson-esque sound and tracks reminiscent of the old The Weeknd, but with slightly more catchy choruses. It will most likely be a great album, and no matter what it is amazing how far he has come."
TheWeeknd,3daen8,k0ntrast,7,Tue Jul 14 21:21:06 2015 UTC,"Probably going to get down voted for this because people in this sub get angered if you say that the weeknd has changed or the you don't like his new style for some reason   Expectation- an album that doesn't have much of his old style. An album with ""poppy"" (idk if that's a word lol) tracks such as ""Can't feel my face"" with a style similar to ""earned it"" because well as we've seen that's the stuff that makes it to the radio and makes money. You'd never hear ""glass table girls"" on the radio, but the amount of times I've heard ""earned it"" is insane. I don't expect to hear anything like the old weeknd, songs like ""Gone"" or ""Montreal"" or ""Til dawn."" And to me that blows. That's the weeknd that I liked and supported. But I doubt we will ever see again.  Hopes- an album like trilogy, or something like echoes of silence.  Of course I could be wrong and he could drop some fire, but this is just what I think will happen."
TheWeeknd,3daen8,waleedwale1,3,Wed Jul 15 08:59:54 2015 UTC,"I hope he finds the balance between mainstream and underground. I fear the album might be a little ""pop-y"" for my taste, but its the Weeknd so it's still probably much better than what we hear on the radio."

TheWeeknd,3daen8,SkyPumpkins,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:51:37 2015 UTC,I think:  It's going to touch a bit on the house of balloons sound with more of his pop skills and pop writers input like Max Martin helping out.  It will have unexpected feature.  It will battle between the message of being in love and sleeping around.  It will not fail to disappoint.
TheWeeknd,3daen8,xgozax,0,Sat Jul 18 19:40:07 2015 UTC,To sound like Kiss Land more than Trilogy.

TheWeeknd,3daen8,SkyPumpkins,3,Wed Jul 15 01:51:20 2015 UTC,I know. I don't want him to stay the same. Kiss Land was a welcome change and my favorite release by him.

TheWeeknd,3daen8,23_vibrators,3,Wed Jul 15 06:34:11 2015 UTC,"Hey I understand where your coming from. However, I've mentioned it before in another thread that sometimes putting out a hit single like ""I Can't Feel My Face"" is necessary, I don't like the song as much as ""The Hills"" but  it's part of the industry. Yeah there are some songs that he puts out that would appeal to a MUCH younger audience (Earned it and Love Me Harder[to an extent]) but there is no way he's gonna turn into Bruno Mars.   Have you ever heard ""Let Nas Down"" by J. Cole? Listen to it if you haven't he explains how he felt horrible that his idol (Nas) didn't like the fact that J. Cole put out a hit single (I think it was ""Who Dat"" or ""Cant Get Enough"")which in fact wasn't true. Nas ends up remixing the song into ""Made Nas Proud"" in which he says to Jermain Cole that he's not letting him down in fact he's made him proud and that it's ok to put out some singles because sometimes it needs to be done. Nas even had to put out a single look for ""You Owe Me"" with Ginuwine.   Sorry for ranting out its not towards you directly but people need to just get a grip. They don't know how the industry works and if you plain don't like it don't listen to it."
TheWeeknd,3daen8,Itiemyshoe,2,Wed Jul 15 08:04:16 2015 UTC,"I like can't feel my face, but it is utterly disposable compared to his depth on Trilogy. Kiss Land lacked depth, and didn't have any hit material either. It felt like he had to find his rhythm again, but tears in the rain was alright.  I'm glad he's doing well, but I could do with at least 3 memorable tracks written from a darker place on each album."
TheWeeknd,3daen8,23_vibrators,6,Wed Jul 15 11:14:51 2015 UTC,I hope it sounds more like Kiss Land the song which sounded like the natural evolution of Trilogy. Half of the Kiss Land album is filler to me.   I'm hoping more King of the Fall and Often sounding material which sounds like Trilogy but also new enough to keep it fresh and sound like a progression rather than regression like most of the Kiss Land album.

TheWeeknd,3crkev,uhDark,7,Fri Jul 10 07:32:45 2015 UTC,This description has been there for fucking ages. Don't hate. Notice how every song bar CFMF is explicit. This aint gonna be pop.
TheWeeknd,3crkev,andyfuuu,5,Fri Jul 10 12:34:29 2015 UTC,"Damn. Been listening to Abel since one week after HoB dropped and I'm really glad where he has reached. Although I do miss the mystery around him, but it was bound to happen anyway with Take Care features and such. But I don't feel his music has become money oriented, his lyrics and themes just evolve like his lifestyle, music and his daily life evolves. For example many didn't like Kiss Land, but for me KL was definitely a more mature HoB/Thursday."
TheWeeknd,3crkev,Jorgeen,32,Fri Jul 10 21:15:33 2015 UTC,"He just wanna make some money like the rest of the fucking world, now support the dude and enjoy his talent and music and don't worry whether he is popular, mainstream or underground.  Enjoy the talent people ! ✘'Ø"
TheWeeknd,3crkev,willwill919,15,Fri Jul 10 05:15:17 2015 UTC,"You don't get it...its not about mainstream or underground. It's about losing the original style and feel of the Weeknd that we all first fell in love with. It's ignorant to assume we don't appreciate his talent and music, we do. It's just that he strayed from the brilliance that gave made him the Weeknd we fell in love with when his first mixtape dropped. If you listened to a weeknd song back then, you knew it was him. Now you can literally replace him with any r&b dude and make him sing the same lyrics and you wouldn't know the difference. When you read his lyrics now, its so ""general purpose"" and without the passion he used to have that it's a bit stale to me. If you don't believe me, listen to rolling stone and listen to any of his new songs. I love the dude, but nowadays he's losing that feel that I sought after when I listened to the Weeknd. And this is my opinion, so I don't mean to sound like I'm hating on you bro."
TheWeeknd,3crkev,WhencanItasteyou,3,Sat Jul 11 07:48:55 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean and I might agree with most of what you said, but not   Now you can literally replace him with any r&b dude and make him sing the same lyrics and you wouldn't know the difference.    There's three things that differentiate the dude: 1. His voice. it's unlike anyone else's (except MJ maybe) 2. His creativity. I doubt any other R&B singer could come up with any of his songs, from old stuff like Wicked Games to new shit like The Hills. 3. His versatility. this is tied to being creative, he can change his style from one end of the spectrum to the other, like how CFMF and The Hills are nothing alike.  And another thing, if he had stayed with that Trilogy sound exclusively, people would be complaining dude always sounds the same, that it's getting repetitive. Just look at the reaction to Miguel's latest album. He pretty much kept the same sound as before and consensus seems to be that it's a bit boring. And no one wants that."
TheWeeknd,3crkev,-Me_NotSure,2,Sat Jul 11 10:36:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you that my statement was off a little. But I'm not saying stick to the same sound, I mean stick to the same style and feel. It's not what you say, but how you say it.."
TheWeeknd,3crkev,WhencanItasteyou,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"The Hills doesn't sound like anything else other R&B singers are putting out right now.

If anything, other artists have started to take inspiration from his dark electronic stylings."

TheWeeknd,3cblc0,AnotherRyan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:57:03 2015 UTC,Ya it was confirmed the exact moment it came out of Ed's mouth say week
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,chemtaalib,8,Sun Jul 5 16:19:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, Ed Sheeran and The Weeknd sounds like a really interesting combination.  I really hope we get to hear this song soon."
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,AnotherRyan,-20,Sun Jul 5 20:14:49 2015 UTC,Really? If Ed Sheeran is on this album I'm off The Weeknd bandwagon.
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,apomares23,7,Sun Jul 5 21:42:03 2015 UTC,That sounds odd to me.  What do you mean by that?  You'd stop listening to an artist because they released one song with another artist you don't like?
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,AnotherRyan,-13,Sun Jul 5 22:12:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I just want to listen to The Weeknd not some other shitty singer. I like Kanye but I hope it' just a beat and not a vocal feature. Ed Sheeran is like a boy band type artist that has zero artistic merit in my opinion. Just seems like he'd feature him because he happens to be kind of popular at the moment.
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,apomares23,4,Sun Jul 5 22:19:06 2015 UTC,Give it a chance dude. I was skeptical about Ariana and Abel and that song was cool.
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,Chowzoid,-7,Sun Jul 5 22:26:19 2015 UTC,Oh... well I didn't think that was cool either. He has an opportunity to become the artist of this generation. He's very talented and unique. But if he has an album full of wack artists he'll just become another generic pop star.
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,apomares23,2,Sun Jul 5 22:37:10 2015 UTC,"OR, when the album gets to that song you can press ""Next"". Works like magic."
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,blahblahwhateverblah,-9,Mon Jul 6 00:35:13 2015 UTC,Call me old school but I still judge artists by their entire album. I don't really listen to a bunch of singles. Plus it's the principle... There is no other reason to feature ed sheeran on his album than to sale more albums.
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,apomares23,4,Mon Jul 6 02:11:03 2015 UTC,Ed Sheeran is very similar to the Weeknd. Singer and songwriter. I wouldn't be so closedminded to this collaboration...
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,Yomo710,-9,Sun Jul 5 23:17:03 2015 UTC,Other than both being singer/songwriters how are they similar?
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,apomares23,6,Sun Jul 5 23:20:06 2015 UTC,They're both incredibly talented and carved their own success.
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,Yomo710,0,Sun Jul 5 23:22:06 2015 UTC,I mean... Abel did have Drake to help him out.
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,JoeWim,0,Mon Jul 6 04:20:20 2015 UTC,"Sooo anyone that is talented and successful are similar?  They are two different artists, in two different genres. Very different"
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,HousefullofBalloons,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:15:56 2015 UTC,"First of all, he makes all the songs he collaborates on good regardless of how bad the other artist is (Nomads comes to mind). Also ed sheeran is good, just a very different style."
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,chkethley,2,Tue Jul 7 20:08:43 2015 UTC,I am so ready for this album to drop.
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,Yomo710,2,Sun Jul 5 21:22:28 2015 UTC,That sounds amazing!! Cant wait!
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,secretladyboner,2,Sun Jul 5 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"lol /u/apomares23 you sacrificed yourself and got gunned down for no reason, cause Sheeran never said he'll be on the album. This just happened a couple weeks ago during the MMVAs, and they don't even have a song just the lyrics. Since Weeknd's album is already done, and Sheeran had an album recently, my guess is they'll sit on this song for the right time, which if Republic/Universal have their way will probably be for a soundtrack to an upcoming movie. Hit songs are a great way to promote a film. So fear not, as far as we know right now the only feature on this album is Mr West.  and btw OP: you're welcome ;)"
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,-Me_NotSure,-1,Mon Jul 6 07:19:40 2015 UTC,"I'll be complete;y honest... I thought the chances of ed sheeran actually being in the weeknd's next album are slim as hell. Like I said, they're pretty different. But my point still stands...  I would be disappointed if the weeknd let ed sheeran feature on his next album. I wouldn't be able to take the album seriously artistically."
TheWeeknd,3c7fdq,apomares23,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:48:04 2015 UTC,"well in that stickied post we had a few months back where the discussion was what do we want on the next album, I mentioned I wanted no or very few features, so looks like I'm getting my wish. but tbh if there had to be any features I'd much prefer to have other singers like Sheeran or Alicia Keys, etc rather than low rate rappers that could come in and bludgeon a song."

TheWeeknd,3bu7u3,phyllop23,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:26:15 2015 UTC,"This isn't that good, IMO tho.   The hills could of had backup vocals/singers on chorus. Alicia Keys wasn't hitting the notes that well.   He was singing great and all but it didn't feel that good of a live performance. Though while I'm disappointed a little, he can sing much better than before... Like there's no mistake he's been training his voice... Kudos. I'm proud to be a fan."

Last Flight To Kiss Land  OP I commend you on your collection it's probably more complete than 99.9% of fans. Abel would be impressed himself.   I'd really like to know the origins of some of these songs / mixtapes to confirm they're 100% real. Like Last Flight To The Kiss Land, it's not uploaded by the same account that the 3 original mixtapes came from. How do we know it's official and not just remixed by a fan?

TheWeeknd,3boy68,djblur,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:28:56 2015 UTC,Who knows..most likely Weeknd already had the song or nearly finished and played it for Drake and he's like yeah let me jump on that..He's known for making songs extra long anyway tho like the party and after party so maybe that was his plan all along...and it's nice when Drake comes in after you would expect the song to be almost over... It would be easy to edit out Drakes verse tho..most likely not a rough early demo version that sounds much different of it tho and if there was it wouldn't ever be released

TheWeeknd,3b3aa0,moody31,3,Fri Jun 26 01:22:01 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the only reason they couldn't put Aliyah on the Trilogy version was cause they weren't able to obtain the rights to it. His voice just sounds flat on the remastered versions, especially when comparing Wicked Games."

TheWeeknd,3b3aa0,pinchymcloaf,3,Fri Jun 26 00:38:18 2015 UTC,I only listen to the originals..I feel like mixes were totally ruined for the most part in the remasters...it's ok to 'clean things up' a bit but these are completely different mixes all together. The ambience/mood/character of the songs is changed considerably. If it ain't broke don't fix it...
TheWeeknd,3b3aa0,pinchymcloaf,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:53:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I definitely agree man. I haven't found a remastered track that sounds even close to being better than the originals. His singing even sounds different. I think I've just grown such a huge attachment to every bit of tone to the mix-tapes. None of the Trilogy release was re-recorded was it?
TheWeeknd,3b3aa0,rabanad,2,Fri Jun 26 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"nope, just remixed...this whole experiment made me realize how important tone/mix levels etc are to the overall track...it's a shame :("
TheWeeknd,3b3aa0,Itiemyshoe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:17:20 2015 UTC,But I don't really understand how it sounds so clean when he wasn't even labeled. Then he gets a label and most of the tracks lose clarity. Shouldn't a remaster sound better?

TheWeeknd,3azsx5,adamsandleryabish,12,Wed Jun 24 20:43:37 2015 UTC,"His grandma raised him for the most part, which is why he's fluent in Aramaic. I don't think his parents had a ton of time for him, or they neglected him. The depression stems from relationships he had when he was older and he was living in 'The House of Balloons"" which is an actual place in Toronto. He lived in the attic of this house which was owned by drug dealers, and it's probably where he started most of his addictions and poor habits. Someone broke his heart there, or something but that should answer your question lol. Read his AMA, it says a lot."

French Montana... l wish he'd stayed home or was stuck in traffic the day of the shoot and they decided to do the shoot anyway. the YouTube comments say it all. cause the video is nice too, pretty good cinematography and lighting, directing.. like I like the way Weeknd looks up when he says ""I'm an XO nigga comin up"""

The parties those nights would lead to me drunk and high, with some random girl... Sex or no see, depending how lonely I get, we wake up and they (she) would always need a ride home, and I'm the guy to do so.   They (she) walk in shame while I shamelessly stumble out, into the summer heat to my car, where it's even more hotter and more humid. Start up the cavalier, pop in a cd that I burned the original HOD onto and play the morning... Not too noisey but loud enough that it sounds like background music and they (she) would always ask and say ""who is this?... I like this..."" I would say ""The Weeknd.""   Drop them off, I would drive home while playing it once again with a cigarette burning, buzzing my post-high while making me a little nauseated from the hangover, lipsync along and I'm home.  Get in my house, no one's awake, so into my cool bed and sleep to only wake up to another party and do it all over again.... Until I can finally let go of  her, because this cycle would be my only way to her... By them."

TheWeeknd,39t9gw,Despicable_life,2,Mon Jun 15 01:16:29 2015 UTC,How did you hear about this song man? Do you know any other's that The Weeknd has remixed?
TheWeeknd,39t9gw,ComeHomeTrueLove,2,Mon Jun 15 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure how I heard this track, I was riding around on a cloud goku style when I discovered it, I just got done bunning 2 fat blunts, so my memory is kinda hazy aha  But, im a big Florence fan so im sure it would've popped up in my ""recommended"" section on YT... actually thats how I think I found out about it shakes head  Edit: Actually I just remembered that he did remix drakes ""Trust Issues"" not the beat, just the vocals if you havent heard it yet. Can't believe I forgot about Trust Issues, was the first song I heard from him :S"
TheWeeknd,39t9gw,Kid_Bronson,3,Mon Jun 15 03:19:00 2015 UTC,"Haha straight up. Yeah man, I've definitely heard Trust Issues. Just wondering if there was any other songs that he's remixed as good as Shake It Out.   I was able to find Lorde's - Royals, that he remixed and Marry the Night by Lady Gaga."
TheWeeknd,39t9gw,ComeHomeTrueLove,2,Mon Jun 15 07:03:29 2015 UTC,I was confused when this song came out. Does Abel do production?? Did someone else produce the remix and he just added vocals? Has Abel produced anything else?

TheWeeknd,39t9gw,RichieFinn,9,Sun Jun 14 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"Adaptation or Tears In The Rain from Kiss Land. Both songs feature Abel at his best lyrically, and the production on both songs is perfect for night driving. It's ambient and cinematic, with frequent flourishes of 80's New Wave and Cyber-Punk elements appearing throughout both songs (or kiss land in general).   Abel's vocal solo at the end of TITR is amazing, period.   Also, the transition from Adaptation to LITS is GOAT."
TheWeeknd,39t9gw,VR53KS,5,Sun Jun 14 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"Enemy  This was one of his songs that sort of flew under the radar for most but really shouldn't have. It's a beautiful song in which Abel explains to a woman that he's too tired from touring or spending long nights in the studio to have a conversation with her. He'd rather drink and communicate through their bodies. And in the end, he expresses that he wants nothing more from their ""relationship"", only to use it as a muse for his art. To think that this was Abel's plan the whole time is twisted but not too far fetched. The Weeknd commonly draws on pain and tensions with women for his music. Sorry if this was too much lol I love exploring stories that The Weeknd tells in his art."
TheWeeknd,39t9gw,jrivs13,5,Tue Jun 16 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"Lonely Star. Has to be. Never gets the recognition it deserves, the transition from the upbeat, mellow soundtrack of HOB ( obviously the knowing is somewhat the beginning of the transition into Thursday) into the dark and damaged sounds of Thursday is just fucking amazing man.   or as it was put....    the soundtrack to walking slow motion through a nightclub with designer shades shielding your bloodshot eyeballs, a Molotov cocktail of mind-altering substances and natural swagger coursing through your bloodstream.  - http://bcgavel.com/2012/04/26/top-10-weeknd-songs/"

TheWeeknd,39d1da,ItsDannyFields,13,Wed Jun 10 23:07:54 2015 UTC,"The thing to me is that Trilogy and Kissland represent the two big phases on the dudes life.  Trilogy is about city life, specifically in Toronto. House of Balloons to me encapsulates the drug and city life of Toronto during that time, being a teenager during the 2000s, better than an album ever. Cities are cramped, the city is big but the sounds and vibes are claustrophobic. It feels 4:3, VHS, over dubbed. Its blurred. Its faces in the alley way. Its meant to be played in a club.  Kissland is life on the road. Its being famous. Its seeing the world (Japan being a huge influence). Its fucking horror movies (the beat switch in Kiss Land sounds like a horror movie). Its widescreen, cinematic. Its almost orchestral in a way. Its wider, more expansive. The lyrics though sound more heartbroken than HOB. HOB its very nihilistic where as the lyrics on Kissland sound bitter even. Lyrically Kissland is disappointing. The lyrics didn't really get any better or different. Its almost like he travelled the world and just missed the after hours parties in Toronto when he was poor and unknown, which is kinda sad in its own way."
TheWeeknd,39d1da,ClockDeveloper,22,Thu Jun 11 05:09:00 2015 UTC,"I really liked Kissland, I don't know why all the hate. I love the lyrics and all the cinematic vibe"

It was because I had a preconceived idea of  what a weeknd album should sound like after drilling HOB, Thurs, and ES into my head. Theres alot more in kissland sonically and if you listen to the lyrics he stays true to character but also gives us another side of himself. Plus if you listen closely to some of the sonics the lyrics are as or even more fucked up then that of echoes of silence. Took me a while but now im viben to it. Not saying its better than HOB cuz that tape is just raw as shit and nostalgic, but deffinatly a really solid album."

TheWeeknd,397bke,TooneyTop5,3,Tue Jun 9 19:49:48 2015 UTC,"It still feels odd that he calls The Weeknd a ""project"". Yeah, Abel works with others but he is The Weeknd.  I agree with him on saying he ""hopes the album will be more light-hearted"". The Weeknd has been using the same style for the past albums/mixtapes. I'm super excited to know he can make a pop track because he can now get to that level where he can change his genre in multiple songs. Mixing it up on the new album would be awesome."
TheWeeknd,397bke,phyllop23,2,Wed Jun 10 07:21:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with Anthony's points as always, but what I'm really worried about is this new record. Hopefully Abel finds a balance between upbeat songs and depressing shit, albums tend to be really messy and bad when an artist can't decide what sound he wants. (i.e. Kissland imo)"

TheWeeknd,38r7j2,jrivs13,9,Sat Jun 6 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"This album dictates how he performs in the future. All depends on whether he manages to capture the interest from his trilogy fans as well as the newer fans. Or he could just appeal to his newer fans which would definitely hype him up, but hopefully he won't become a trend that ends in a year. But, 2015 is his year, as he said himself."

TheWeeknd,38r7j2,herdingcats61,5,Sun Jun 7 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"I think he has TONS of space to grow a fan base. So many people barely discovered him from Earned It and Love Me Harder, but those songs are nothing compared to Trilogy. What made me love his music was how dark it is. Songs like Coming Down and The Birds Part 2 blew my mind. I think that the people who barely found him will have the same reaction to the new album as earlier fans had when we first listened to the mixtapes, just because they're not used to his type of music."
TheWeeknd,38r7j2,askredant,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:54:13 2015 UTC,"If he has a sole single from his album that's his song that gets huge, he will be a super star in the next two years"
TheWeeknd,38r7j2,BigG123,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:12:01 2015 UTC,The direction he has gone post kiss land is pop appeal. He's gunning to compete with every top 40 artist and he's already doing it pretty well. With earned it and can't feel my face I feel like he's already cemented two hits for the summer. I welcome the new fans but I feel like if they go back and download house of balloons they'll be very confused..
TheWeeknd,38r7j2,Glowcat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:35:55 2015 UTC,By the rate he is going...possibly the biggest RnB pop star in the industry!
TheWeeknd,38r7j2,yungshrimptempura,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:30:44 2015 UTC,I wish him all the success in the world but I hope he doesn't completely sell out. That he did a song with Ariana Grande is already pretty bad. If he sells out he could be huge for a few years and then disappear but I think his song writing is strong enough that he could be a legendary artist of his generation.

TheWeeknd,3862xq,EgyptionFreshPrince,6,Tue Jun 2 07:55:31 2015 UTC,her twitter says she works for Universal but her LinkedIn says Atlantic/Warner. what I'm getting at is maybe she has the same disavowed August 28 date we did but she didn't update her info.   The way things are stepping up on Weeknd's twitter I'd have thought it was coming with or soon after a single (probably icfmf) later this month. He needs to stop playin and give us a release date.
TheWeeknd,3862xq,Despicable_life,3,Tue Jun 2 09:17:15 2015 UTC,August...damn feels so far.  On another note it's really interesting to hear him sit down and talk with someone because he's notorious for NOT doing interviews.   Anyone got a transcript or information on the conversation?
TheWeeknd,3862xq,qbyte,3,Tue Jun 2 07:48:40 2015 UTC,I think it would be late August. It would go great with the whole 'King of the Fall' thing
TheWeeknd,3862xq,roseyjill,2,Tue Jun 2 13:07:16 2015 UTC,"though i was hoping it would be sooner, it would be cool if it came out in august bc of the whole KOTF thing."

TheWeeknd,381338,teenagelabotomy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"To me, anything could happen in his life. Since he writes about his experiences, this may be a little side story that's there to help build the full picture of whatever chapter 3 is. All in all this is a cool theory imo, and ik there's probably a bunch of loopholes but hey... that's just a theory... A WEEK- well you get the point."
TheWeeknd,381338,Carlitosj17,4,Mon Jun 1 22:08:01 2015 UTC,"Your Game Theory reference is strong. I can hear the theme song in my head.  Besides that, I do like your theory. It makes a lot of sense but we don't have much more til the Chapter III comes out. I would like to hear from Valerie again."

From what I've heard in his new music, I'm hoping his next album/project comes out on vinyl so I can be satisfied with a good Weeknd vinyl. (I didn't like Kiss Land enough to get it on wax)."
TheWeeknd,38161z,phyllop23,2,Mon Jun 1 08:22:26 2015 UTC,"Straight up man, it sucks as well because I'll be losing like $300 just from the shitty conversion rate. But , it's Trilogy dude. I think I'll be kicking myself if I miss out on the vinyl. If I can get the price down to $1000 I will probably get it.   But yeah I definitely know what you mean. Kiss land was good. But it's not something id get on vinyl, like I've seen the vinyl for Kiss Land going for $50.   From the sounds of his new music though I'd definitely get a vinyl of that."
TheWeeknd,38161z,phyllop23,2,Mon Jun 1 08:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm hoping sometime in the future I can find a decent priced Trilogy on vinyl or maybe a re-release. It's the one record I need to check off my list to give me full satisfaction. Lol."
TheWeeknd,38161z,runswithsquirrels,2,Mon Jun 1 08:33:21 2015 UTC,Haha I feel the same way dude. It's bothering me that I don't have it on vinyl.
TheWeeknd,38161z,runswithsquirrels,3,Mon Jun 1 08:35:53 2015 UTC,I don't think you'll be able to find it cheaper than that to be honest. I got lucky and bought it when he first released it. I was looking to buy a second one and the cheapest I found it for was like $750.
TheWeeknd,38161z,Gotie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:48:30 2015 UTC,You don't happen to have a link or know what site you saw it for 750$? I'd pay that much straight up.

TheWeeknd,37y4h3,upright619,4,Sun May 31 11:13:17 2015 UTC,I think that his lyrics are still based on his experience and surroundings. But after all these years its possible that he has a formula how to write his lyrics and not everything has to be 100% honest and based on a real events.
TheWeeknd,37y4h3,alus992,2,Sun May 31 11:36:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that I think it's ""based"" on personal experiences. He sees himself as an entertainer, so I assume a lot of his lyrics are fiction (see the letter posted a few days back about Rolling Stone). However, more often than not his lyrics seem to be like ""metaphors"" to his actual experiences (such as Rolling Stone, The Town). Another example is that the music video for The Knowing seems to add some sort of political connotation to the song. I think this is the true ""life experiences"" and ""thoughts"" of The Weeknd."
TheWeeknd,37y4h3,sousoupie,1 point,Sun May 31 15:39:45 2015 UTC,Yeah his music is just his processed and reinforced experiences.

TheWeeknd,37s6iq,whoaakiki,2,Fri May 29 23:51:41 2015 UTC,"Accurate while not necessarily true. His first album was based upon his life in Toronto, and he says so in his audio interview with MTV. He spent 21 yrs of his life in Toronto, and encountered a lot of bad things. So the music is gloomy, bc that's just what life was for him there. The music is a reflection of his life before he went on his tour in Japan.  Just as well, his Kiss Land album was created under the influence of Japan, which he chose to tour and get a feel for in order to create something that contrasts from his first album. He says that the reason it was so foreign to his original sound is because the land he was in as well as everything in it was foreign to himself. There's honestly no way of telling what this new album will hold. it could be upbeat and pop punk, or it could be ""sad and slow"" or it could be anything. It depends on how his life is going as of now."

TheWeeknd,37s5c8,OohKillEm,26,Fri May 29 23:16:18 2015 UTC,"To me, the two women in the car represent Trilogy and Kissland, two of his darker, more sophisticated projects that came from a part of his life that had no light. Him walking away from the crash is him trying to get away from the darkness and move towards the light, to more toned-down mainstream audiences (Earned It, Love Me Harder, etc.). But in the end, it seems like he can't leave that darkness, that sort of music and lifestyle, when he meets the three individuals in the house. The weird-looking one holding the apple symbolizes the devil and the apple represents this darkness, sin, temptation, just like it does in the biblical Adam & Eve story. It goes to show that wherever there is light, there is darkness, and that Abel just can't leave his signature sound and is coming back to the dark, chill, atmospheric music we all know and love.  Here's to a more HOB/Thursday/EOS–esque album from The Weeknd!"
TheWeeknd,37s5c8,builderoftheark,5,Sat May 30 02:34:07 2015 UTC,"Great analysis. I've always wondered though, why doesn't he just relax on the vices and settle for true love? it seems like his life would be a lot easier and that continuing this lifestyle is just unnecessarily making it harder for himself."
TheWeeknd,37s5c8,qbyte,3,Sat May 30 04:16:19 2015 UTC,"He is in his mid-twenties, so I can see why he still takes part in those type of activities. Making music about it only encourages the people around him to encourage him to do more. But, for his own sake, I'm hoping he matures in time and doesn't end up a broke crackhead."

But I doubt that it will be something big - labels often dont like long albums because there is no point of selling more tracks at the same price as the short album and listeners nowadays also seem to like albums with 10-12 tracks, because they are getting bored.   I am a big fan of long albums and I still prefer ones with at least 15 songs  And as my bet I would go with 12 songs on standard album plus 2/3 on possible deluxe"

TheWeeknd,37geug,csorndog,12,Wed May 27 18:06:19 2015 UTC,I'm so happy he didn't release the songs that leaked first. I was listening to the live version a little too much of this song.
TheWeeknd,37geug,Blueskymoon,8,Wed May 27 15:43:35 2015 UTC,Am I the only one seeing the clean version of the song only on iTunes?
TheWeeknd,37geug,Eyevannn,2,Wed May 27 14:12:58 2015 UTC,yeah I only see clean so far

TheWeeknd,37geug,PubesInMyQuiche,5,Wed May 27 13:17:06 2015 UTC,"I think it was more of a hype thing. Release all these songs, get people wondering like ""WTF"" is the album going to sound like. Then release this. Think about it, if you have access to 3 songs, you'd just release the whole album. Waiting for each song is a hype scheme."

TheWeeknd,37hm7p,AlphaPack,3,Wed May 27 22:52:48 2015 UTC,"Shameless isn't leaking. Earl said that, then a day later came out and tweeted ""I'm done with that shit."" This comes right after he promised to leak two songs then didn't deliver on those, and in addition to those he was supposed to leak another song in the place of in the 90s if that leaked before he could leak it."
TheWeeknd,37hm7p,JoeWim,1 point,Wed May 27 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"I'm glad, things were getting a bit out of his control. He became really agitated with the people responding to him on Twitter.

TheWeeknd,37d3bx,TheOldestProfession,1 point,Tue May 26 20:52:43 2015 UTC,This. This is why I love The Weeknd. He just puts out some show stoppers.
TheWeeknd,37d22g,Yomo710,8,Tue May 26 19:08:30 2015 UTC,I'm sure he'll throw a couple tracks in there for the old fans.
TheWeeknd,37d22g,Waruin,3,Tue May 26 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"I still listen to those albums all the time. Look at it this way multiple artist have released classics the first go round and then made some equally if not better albums the next few times. He is just evolving as an artist and doing different styles of music, I think it's a smart idea and that's the type of stuff that gets you remembered forever. I'll always be a fan."
TheWeeknd,37d22g,Imthaschmidt,3,Wed May 27 00:23:23 2015 UTC,"Artists evolve. His music can only reflect the environment and the zone that he's in when he makes it. He tells you that himself. His first three mixtapes, particularly HoB, sound like music made by a guy who's stared at the same four walls for 21 years, done that whole drug fueled dirty grind that got a lot of us hooked in the first place. Meanwhile, Kiss Land sounds like that same guy suddenly seeing the whole world in a year, being totally overwhelmed and experiencing the system shock that's associated with it.   The newer tracks and leaks sound like a guy who has made a lot of mistakes during that span and learned from some, and has embraced this new life. At the same time he knows he's hot shit now, and realizes life won't ever be the same again.   This same thing is why a lot of artists lose their luster over time; instead of evolving and creating music based on where they're at, they continue to try to craft to the sound that made them big. Listening to 50 year old rappers and fathers continue to rap about cooking crack breaks the immersion. This is why artists like Drake, Kanye, Weeknd thrive over others."
TheWeeknd,37d22g,mtmv2,6,Wed May 27 14:43:36 2015 UTC,I don't. He gave us three full records of that sound. I love Trilogy but I don't want more music from him that sounds like it. Kiss Land was a step in the right direction.
TheWeeknd,37d22g,MortalJazz,2,Tue May 26 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"We all have different opinions of the new leaks.  I don't think that just because we've heard a few new songs we should be hitting the panic button.  Personally I only really like one of the three.    It'd be stupid to think with all his recent mainstream success and spotlight that he'd not cater to that audience too and capitalize on it.  I feel like all these new posts seem to forget about ""The Hills"" and the kind of song that is, which is nothing like these leaks.    I really think he's just diversifying... and there's gonna be some for every kind of Abel fan."
TheWeeknd,37d22g,NotYourDude,1 point,Wed May 27 04:50:01 2015 UTC,"Out of the 3 the only one that I was liking was ""In the 90's"" and even that took a while to grow on me, it just wasn't like when I first listened to Trilogy."
TheWeeknd,37d22g,waleedwale1,2,Wed May 27 05:16:11 2015 UTC,"Is Trilogy meant as 3 seperate mixtapes and talking about 2011 or the compilation? I've always wondered that, because for me Trilogy itself made some songs worse because of the production. Been listening to Weeknd since HoB dropped and I remember when Thursday and EoS dropped it made the world a better place."
TheWeeknd,37d22g,Jorgeen,1 point,Wed May 27 10:08:20 2015 UTC,"I think Abel was not sure if people would like his dark style, Have you heard of anyone else doing the same dark genre as the weeknd? I have not. He put out the 3 free mixtapes to test the waters in my opinion, people loved it. So he re-released everything as an album.  But I agree with you, I love the mixtape songs much much better. I was so sad to hear Wicked Games's intro being replaced with something else, broke my heart."
TheWeeknd,37d22g,upright619,2,Thu May 28 16:09:26 2015 UTC,"I hate when people say shit like this honestly. Artists evolve and honestly this new sound is amazing, it's vocally stunning and the production is top notch. Yes Trilogy was an amazing piece of work, but enjoy this new music it's amazing in its own right."
TheWeeknd,37d22g,KingsCrossings,1 point,Wed May 27 02:19:41 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with new sounds, I just want him to remember his roots.   In the 90's the song that just came out is good. But it's not his roots.  Or maybe it is before the other guy that made the beats for him and then some beef happened.   I don't remember the story."
TheWeeknd,37d22g,ArguablyHappy,1 point,Wed May 27 02:05:56 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to be throwing out the 'artists evolve' argument and of course music is subjective but if The Weeknd went from his current stuff TO the sound of the original 3 mixtapes then THAT would be considered a huge evolution in his sound.    If anything, since his record deal/Kiss Land and on he's catered to a more mainstream sound. A lot of these recent tracks follow pretty standard pop rap/RnB conventions along with beats that are yes, well produced (but that's expected when you've got a deal and can work with almost anyone), but pretty generic. The tracks I have heard lately, including the one released today ""The Hills"", all just have that bass-heavy trap/808 drum kit sound to them and his flow is pretty similar to a hybrid between RnB/Rap where he tries to ""rap"" as many of his typical RnB lyrics in as quick."

TheWeeknd,37bgx2,TwinkieRUgly,5,Tue May 26 16:49:36 2015 UTC,:^(  I guess this is The Weeknd now.
TheWeeknd,37bgx2,thetruthhurts34,3,Tue May 26 12:49:25 2015 UTC,I'd say it's too early for that considering these are leaks and we don't have official news on the album.
TheWeeknd,37bgx2,ImmatureIntellect,3,Tue May 26 14:26:11 2015 UTC,Ugh it's so pop-y and unlike him.  Noooooooooo

TheWeeknd,37b6kn,-Me_NotSure,2,Tue May 26 09:52:08 2015 UTC,What is happening with all these snippets?  Are we getting a full album leak soon?
TheWeeknd,37b6kn,oatzandsquats,2,Tue May 26 13:56:04 2015 UTC,"Looking forward to hearing the rest of this one, but as with the other leaks something just sounds off. It kinda sounds like our King of Fall trying to drop some summer tracks and this new territory is alien to our ears."
TheWeeknd,37b6kn,ImmatureIntellect,0,Tue May 26 13:59:43 2015 UTC,I agree. These tracks are not like trilogy or kissland at all
TheWeeknd,37b6kn,manjot97,3,Tue May 26 14:41:24 2015 UTC,"And people are freaking out because change is new and strange, lol"
TheWeeknd,37b6kn,ImmatureIntellect,2,Tue May 26 14:43:39 2015 UTC,"To be fair, 'in the night' is something i do not like at all. It's probably the most alien song to us right now. Pls tell me the rest of the album is not going to be like that."
TheWeeknd,37b6kn,manjot97,3,Tue May 26 14:48:23 2015 UTC,"To be devil's advocate, the song is growing on me the more I listen to it like most of Kiss Land actually. I do hope the entire album won't be like this though. I don't want an album of radio songs!"

TheWeeknd,37b6kn,saritz,1 point,Tue May 26 15:19:09 2015 UTC,This song is dope as fuck...Just like Kissland you have to listen twice.. Once to listen to the song and once to hear the song.
TheWeeknd,379ety,emd2013,8,Mon May 25 23:13:38 2015 UTC,Im so surprised that many people on /r/hiphopheads/ likes this track.  It's not bad at all just way different than his previous work.
TheWeeknd,379ety,alus992,5,Tue May 26 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"I love it, but basically he can do no wrong to me."
TheWeeknd,379ety,TheOldestProfession,11,Tue May 26 05:02:44 2015 UTC,"Man surprising how some of you don't fuck with it. His voice is still cherry as fuck, the production is pure The Weeknd quality, and it's Abel doing Abel. I dig it a ton."
TheWeeknd,379ety,EgyptionFreshPrince,2,Tue May 26 05:51:57 2015 UTC,"the production is pure The Weeknd    What makes you think that?  ""Charlie Walk got a hold of this dudes ear after the first album ""Kiss Land"" didn't do well.. And is ruining him, this is all Charlie Walk's doing.   It started with the Ariana Grande feature, this executive Charlie Walker is notorious for ruining artists and pushing shit to radio and he has been around Abel A LOT these past 9 months, his IG proves it."""

TheWeeknd,379ety,swaggypump,5,Wed May 27 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"hate is real, but if an upcoming brand new artist just sang this same song word for  word, same beat...people would eat this up"
TheWeeknd,379ety,NothinButFett,8,Tue May 26 04:27:14 2015 UTC,"Ok so IMO the worst thing an artist can do is put out the same album twice. So, I applaud him for stepping outside his sound and doing something different, very different. This song is musically and vocally quite good, could be a hit for sure. That being said, it's not what I really want from The Weeknd, I don't like that the lyrics are lacking in depth and substance. I also don't like that this song is SO reminiscent of old school Michael Jackson. ""On some young Quincy Jones dark skinned Michael Jackson"" for real. I mean if he wants to appeal to a larger audience or whatever thats fine, I just wish it was more HIS own unique sound and not...this 70s 80s MJ throwback. Like he even does the little Michael Jackson vocal quirks in the background. I still dig the song, I just wish it was like a long lost track from the king of pop and not an indicator of The Weeknd's next album."
TheWeeknd,379ety,So_Many_Dicks,1 point,Tue May 26 02:41:08 2015 UTC,I miss his old lyrics as well. The seem so uninspired now.

TheWeeknd,379ety,dan991,4,Mon May 25 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"Not really my jam, but thanks for posting OP, I'll take any new shit the Weeknd puts out.  Not really a fan of the whole repetitive lyrics thing (Live For was absolute boo-boo), so this one's a pass for me. Here's hoping the album drops soon though!"
TheWeeknd,379ety,yoshi105,2,Tue May 26 00:59:35 2015 UTC,"wow, sounds like prince- so versatile he is."
TheWeeknd,379ety,Glowcat,2,Tue May 26 05:47:14 2015 UTC,"If you understand the Weeknd as a person you can accept this. He is way past being broke and taking dodgy drugs to get his high therefore expressing his strong emotions in his music (Trilogy). This is a relaxed Weeknd now, getting paid so the upbeat happy radio song is fair game.  Either that or the record labels is pushing him to do this meaning more money for him and them but at the expense of him being able to control his creativity."
TheWeeknd,379ety,JLanticena,4,Tue May 26 15:04:05 2015 UTC,"Apparently saying you don't like it makes you not xotyod, but this is more of the same. I wonder if Michael Jackson fans felt the same way about thriller?"

TheWeeknd,379ety,ImmatureIntellect,3,Tue May 26 03:28:49 2015 UTC,"Its an alright song, have a feeling its going to be all over the radio, I wish he doesn't keep following with this direction on the upcoming album.."
TheWeeknd,379ety,manjot97,2,Tue May 26 02:24:57 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad song, it's not a weeknd level song but shit I ain't gonna overreact and downvote opinions that I don't agree with."
TheWeeknd,379ety,OohKillEm,2,Tue May 26 04:50:51 2015 UTC,"This is the weeknd that we're going to be listening to everyday on radio stations, not the weeknd that we listened to before."
TheWeeknd,379ety,RichieFinn,3,Tue May 26 14:52:37 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that actually really likes this song?  Sure it's not your regular XO, but it still has a great sound to it.   You can't expect Abel to always be making the same kind of music."
TheWeeknd,379ety,wynnz,2,Tue May 26 03:00:58 2015 UTC,"listen, he gotta put some radio hits on there, be patient, that being said, i actually kinda like it, dont know why, i can see myself sippin some gin and gettin funky to this hahahaha."
TheWeeknd,379ety,MrWestx,2,Tue May 26 08:53:03 2015 UTC,Its different. He's trying to appeal to a wider audience. But I fux wit it
TheWeeknd,379ety,JoeWim,2,Tue May 26 00:34:46 2015 UTC,Fire!
TheWeeknd,379ety,Ch13fK33f,2,Tue May 26 00:15:29 2015 UTC,"This is some grade A bullshit. Nothing unique about this at all, it just has a quick line about ""I know she'll be the death of me..."" Then pops into the chorus... Then repeats 10 more times. Seems like he spent 2 minutes recording and writing the lyrics then gave up and turned those two lines into a ""song"". Disgusting and pathetic coming from him."
TheWeeknd,37abj8,JoeWim,3,Tue May 26 03:42:48 2015 UTC,Does this mean that the full song is out there on the internet somewhere?

TheWeeknd,379oab,_Ollie,-5,Tue May 26 00:29:54 2015 UTC,Back from when the weeknd made decent music I think
TheWeeknd,379mb3,davidwave4,2,Tue May 26 00:11:54 2015 UTC,"some big time dudes produced in the night, icfmf, and shameless  doubt they wouldn't be on the album"
TheWeeknd,379mb3,xBLUExBLUEx,2,Tue May 26 05:27:20 2015 UTC,Yeah they are huge hit makers. you don't pay these guys to write and produce to say they are throwaways.
TheWeeknd,379mb3,RMZE,0,Tue May 26 06:24:00 2015 UTC,"Well, we now know that ICFMF will be on the album, but those other tracks might not. These kinds of things happen all the time. For example, A$AP Rocky has a track produced by Arca and features FKA twigs (arguably heavyweights in their own rights) that he finished but didn't put on the album. Kiss Land had a Pharrell production (Pharrell being on the BIGGEST producers of all time) that was relegated to bonus track, non-single status. Drake had a track with James Blake from NWTS that got put into the trash (only for James to drop it later). These kinds of studio experiments happen."
TheWeeknd,379mb3,MrWestx,3,Sat Jun 13 16:05:34 2015 UTC,"""I can't feel my face"" is the first single from the new album, not too sure what ASCAP is but at least ""In the 90s"" is in a kind of registry, check KTT, in that registry it was listed who helped to produce and so on so I doubt that's a demo track. I just think the new album will have a more mainstream-pop vibe to it."
TheWeeknd,379mb3,alus992,2,Tue May 26 00:15:23 2015 UTC,I think that all of them will make it on the album there will be more tracks with other vibe also so it won't be a 100% pop album as we assume now after hearing all these snippets.
TheWeeknd,379mb3,JoeWim,1 point,Tue May 26 00:32:21 2015 UTC,Glad he's at last making one song out of his 15 for long time fans.
TheWeeknd,379mb3,RichieFinn,1 point,Tue May 26 03:36:19 2015 UTC,The Hills (which is pretty much guaranteed to be the single from the album.)    Whys that guaranteed tho?
TheWeeknd,379l21,alus992,3,Tue May 26 00:01:51 2015 UTC,"Well I bet it will be a more mainstream album. Not too sure about the mixtape thing, but I'm sure we'll get more tracks with a dark vibe, but not the amount as before."
TheWeeknd,379l21,MrWestx,2,Tue May 26 00:13:47 2015 UTC,"Im curious how many tracks will be on this album. If it has at least 12-15 tracks, half pop, radio friendly tracks and half more dark songs I don't mind it at all. But if it is like 10:2 ratio I will be disappointed."
TheWeeknd,379l21,davidwave4,3,Tue May 26 00:20:19 2015 UTC,"I personally think that these leaks may be bonus tracks or throwaway singles, not only are most not registered with the ASCAP, but they're not sonically in line with confirmed album tracks like Often and The Hills.   I'm holding out hope that Abel releases another classic. The Hills sounds pretty sick, and even if Can't Feel My Face makes it on there, it's not the worst track he's put out."
TheWeeknd,379l21,davidwave4,2,Tue May 26 00:17:27 2015 UTC,"I thought that Often is only a promo tour (KOTF Tour) single, not the album one?"
TheWeeknd,379l21,JoeWim,1 point,Tue May 26 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it is or isn't, but unlike KOTF Often was released to the radio and got an official label-backed digital release. He's also been playing it at all his shows, which he didn't with KOTF."
TheWeeknd,379l21,roseyjill,1 point,Tue May 26 01:58:09 2015 UTC,"No way he isn't selling out for a full pop album. You're thinking he's the same personality that seemed to be unique 3 years ago, but now he's just going for billboard 100 hits and doesn't really care about his small/old fan base. Don't see a reason he would waste time on a mixtape for us. Surprised he even has an old sounding track tbh."
