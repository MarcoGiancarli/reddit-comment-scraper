battlefield3,3daorc,Shnabdabber,2,Tue Jul 14 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"Not a sniper, but I would suggest not using the .44 on any class.  The whole strength of a .44 is it's ability to hit hard and accurately at distance. Basically... You're picking a pistol that does roughly the same job as your primary.   You should pick something that's better up close and more spam able like the G18(17? Whichever one is auto, I've not played in a while) or 93r.   This way you have a good long range option and a decent close range option at all times. It's a much more well rounded load out."
battlefield3,3daorc,FullDerpHD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:20:13 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, and to be honest the more I use the 1911 when going ""aggressive"" the more I like it.  I guess I liked the .44 because... well it has balls.  The machine pistols are great and effective up close but I find if I'm close enough to use them to their full effect I get mowed down by m16 variants.  Aiming down sights with the 1911 has given me some pretty decent headshots at distance.  Although I feel the damage model for the 1911 could use a little more pop.  230gr hardball should hit a hell of a lot harder than 9mm."
battlefield3,3daorc,Pronato,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:56:01 2015 UTC,"Weapons:  I mostly use either the L96 (8x, SPB) or the M417 (ACOG, grip, laser), depending on the situation.  For more specified situations I use:   CQB BA: M40 (ACOG, SPB, silencer) Semi auto stealth: QBU-88 (PKA 3.4x, silencer, grip) CQB in general: UMP-45 (Kobra, flash hider/silencer) or Spas-12 (PKA-S, flechette, mag extension)   M1911 silenced as secundary   Gadgets:  My first choice is always the Xbow with explosive bolt. The other gadgets get used at will and by necessity."
battlefield3,3daorc,lashazior,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:22:11 2015 UTC,"Personal preference should just be what your are comfortable with for bolt actions and semi automatics. Any CQ you should change accordingly if your goal is to abuse TUGs/Beacon support. Generally I play with M98b for only longer range sniping and everything else is mostly based on what I am feeling good with at that moment. It really depends what you want to be doing at what point on a map that reflects the best weapons. Small cornering skills with some medium ranges (aka Talah Market Flag C)? Use a PDW. Anything closer use a shotgun. Anything longer use semi automatics. Are you getting suppressed a lot? Don't use a semi-auto in those situations, the bullet spread is awful for single fire and you're better off using a laser'd PDW."
battlefield3,3daorc,jastermareel17,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:51:26 2015 UTC,"Seems like whatever I do its L96 with a x12 scope, G18 supp. and mav.  I'll use the tugs on closer maps, it is easier to stash in corners and such.  I've had an attachment to the M14/ M39 rifles in any game they appear, but after playing around with the M417, it blows it out of the water.  If I'm playing rush, I'll set up a soflam and sit back, or if they're getting close I will go up with the UMP and R93.  The M98B can also be annoying good with and ACOG running around canals deathmatch."

Which is one thing that bothers me, I know Sage shipped some of their EBR/EMR's (the mod 0 I believe) off with 10 round mags, but the standard is a 20 rnd box mag.  Seen plenty of pics of them being used in the M.E. and they all have 20 rnd mags.  Also, the EMR should have the slowest muzzle velocity of all the rifles chambered in 7.62x51 nato, although it works in my favor so I'm not complaining.  Don't know how you guys run bolts with low powered scopes or reflex sights, I tried it and just got hammered.

battlefield3,3daorc,backporch4lyfe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:57:16 2015 UTC,"My kit is M98 for large maps or an UMP-45 or P90 on small maps.  The greater contribution I feel that I make is always advancing first with my MAV and placing it safely above but covering areas of contention.  Almost every map has a building or window above an M-COM or Flag where you can hide a MAV giving your team extra info on your enemies.  Second, I flank behind or at least in the least obvious direction of the enemy and place my beacon.  Make sure you do this with a suppressed weapon and you can really mess up any forward momentum that the enemies were trying to make."

Xbow to give you an anti-tank/helicopter weapon and motion sensor capability. Bolt actions primarily for over watch spotting and counter sniping second. Place a beacon forward and whip out M5K for getting all up in there but really any PDW works well for that. Auto-shotty with 12G frags for AA capability, blast pilot's right out of helos and steal them."

KPM's are in line with a skilled TDM or metro player.   Accuracy is actually not that special at all.. low 30's are easy if you simply mind your over spray. It takes 5 to kill, so don't let off 15 rounds. 7 is sufficient for the vast majority of fights if you're a decent player."
battlefield3,3d5b81,crankybadger,-2,Mon Jul 13 20:22:24 2015 UTC,Unless you're holding back to only get shots that count it's still damned near impossible to maintain that high a rate.  It also means you're a dick because you're giving up opportunities to apply suppressing fire.
battlefield3,3d5b81,FullDerpHD,3,Tue Jul 14 00:26:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry friend, But just because you can't doesn't mean others can't either.   25+ is actually quite easy to maintain in a regular play style. I would know, After all I've done it for over 1000 hours of playtime. I damn sure haven't spent that much time restraining my shots lol.  http://gyazo.com/3238c36a27dc2482c2bdf74804a5eb82  As you can see I had no trouble shooting 27% even after having rarely played the game since battlefield 4's release. (I moved on to counterstike after that massive flop which was bf4)  Basically what I'm trying to say is If you take a high level player and tell him to hold back and only go for shots that count you're going to see 40+% accuracy. I personally could break 50% while accuracy whoring back when I was actively playing.  That said, this guy is just a skilled player either coming from another game or simply playing on a new account.    It also means you're a dick because you're giving up opportunities to apply suppressing fire.   While you waste time doing that. The player in the OP and myself will just send them back to the spawn menu for you;-)"
battlefield3,3d5b81,crankybadger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:06:43 2015 UTC,"I'm usually on LMG which means high hit rates aren't really going to happen. It's got enough bullets you don't have to care about each one counting. Maybe that's biased me.  27% is good. I'm just suspicious when it gets up into the 30s. If that's talent, then sure enough, respect, but most of the time I suspect some degree of gaming is involved. Accuracy whoring if you want to call it that.  The only thing I have a really good hit rate with is the RPG type weapons. I make those shots count, even at ridiculous ranges."
battlefield3,3d5b81,FullDerpHD,2,Tue Jul 14 05:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is just you being biased. You're trying to make it out to be significantly more complicated than it is. It's muscle memory. Absolutely 0 thought process required after the initial learning process. You don't have to count each bullet, you don't have picture the spread and recoil pattern in your mind every time you shoot.. Do these things for 5 minutes against a wall and learn how it FEELS to shoot your gun accurately. 1. Learn recoil direction and speed. 2. Learn spread growth to figure out optimal burst number 3. Combine both and pay attention to what it feels like to shoot a good grouping. After that it's literally point and click.   Even LMG's are perfectly capable of being fired accurately. They require a different shooting technique(tap firing) but never the less, you can make most shots count just as easily as you can with an assault rifle. Quit over thinking it and stop being scared of actually learning how to shoot and taa daaa it's shockingly easy. http://gyazo.com/f538d17ade625fe49ace4b6748cc6dc6    27% is good. I'm just suspicious when it gets up into the 30s   You shouldn't be. Anyone who can shoot over 23% is likely going to be killing you with their first 6 rounds anyways. Getting shot by someone who can average 23% and someone who can shoot 35% is going to feel exactly the same because they in essentially equally accurate. The end of the round average is entirely play style dependent.   Are you aggressive, passive? Are you going to waste time on chance shots? and so on. These all drastically change your performance in game."
battlefield3,3d5b81,crankybadger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:42:44 2015 UTC,"The roles I play don't demand accuracy except when tanking or dealing with tanks. The rest of the time ""close enough"" counts. Have LMG, will travel, or else I'm busy with paddles.  I'm quite proficient with the various LMGs, usually outfit them with a nice scope to make them more versatile at medium range engagements, and a few, tap-fired, are actually super handy at displacing weak snipers. Normally I work with two, three round bursts unless things get crazy, and then it's full auto time. You can get a fair amount of control even then if you know how it's going to buck and pull. How else do you clear a hall in Metro when you get a good flank, right?  As for aggressive vs. passive, depends on the role. Support, I'm more sweep and clear, working flanks. Medic is always scrambling to keep the wave rolling, so just behind the front. If there's an objective to be had I'll push hard, but otherwise, find a spot to apply pressure.  Maybe I haven't been on the right servers to see veterans with consistent 40% percent hit rates on weapons other than scoped rifles. Personally I've never cared that much about stats in that capacity, I've only ever used it to compare weapon vs. weapon."

battlefield3,3d35gt,cobrareaper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:57:07 2015 UTC,"well i'm on 360, i would play on pc but my computer cannot run it. and from what i've seen back to karkand seems to be the most popular there is usually a server running gulf of Oman(which wont do much cause i already have second assault bf4) one server running other back to karkand maps one ziba tower server and the occasional Epicentre, Nebandan  and armored shield. i also find it surprising that not a lot of people play the DLC any more since most player i see still playing the game are premium members. also my region is North America."
battlefield3,3d35gt,lashazior,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:28:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what happens when a game reaches the end of its life cycle. The map rotations stop and servers just run the most popular maps 24/7. It's already starting to happen with BF4 and Hardline, and I've seen it happen to other games, too."
battlefield3,3d35gt,cobrareaper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:55:16 2015 UTC,that explains why there are like 20 Noshahr canals TDM servers.
battlefield3,3d35gt,Degru,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:44:52 2015 UTC,"United Noobs runs an Aftermath/Armored kill server that is populated during the day. They used to be split up but they combined them back in April/May I believe. The only problem is they are heavily favored maps with every Armored Kill and only one Aftermath (Markaz, arguably the worst of the AM) and the abhorrent amounts of bad players accusing people of hacking (Elricco9000 is a great example of this). Other than that the best server I have found that runs all the maps in an alright rotation is WBKS 2 albeit it is in Germany but the ping is not a major issue unless you live on the West Coast.  I really miss when BF3 was in the hayday and PURE was the place to be for PTFO :(."
battlefield3,3d35gt,TukkaSi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:40:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the UN server was the one I found. I've been on it a few times and every time one team was getting spawn trapped. I live on the West Coast so European servers aren't really an option. I just really miss all of the good TDM servers. There used to be ones with great map rotations (I'm not a Rush fan and CQ is boring now without friends so I mainly play TDM). I loved the AM maps like Talah Market for that gamemode. Only servers I've found now that don't run just Canals 24/7 run a rotation between Canals and Kharg Island. It's pretty boring and I wish some of those servers would add at least 2 more maps to the rotation."

How the fuck is balancing the teams out with only 7 tickets left when we have no tank going to give the attacking team any chance of winning?"
battlefield3,3cvl45,crawlerz2468,8,Sat Jul 11 03:31:38 2015 UTC,For your consideration. I realize some people might hate my voice so i'll tl;dr here. I am not a troll I'm just a Verne Troyer sized Russian trying to have fun with YouTube.   Our clan server is sitting empty most of the time right now and I was given the job of reviving it and thus the admin. I will set whatever map/gamemode people want if enough people show up.

Even if hardline was crap bf4 is still a thing.  If you are really willing to spent cash like that then yeah CQ is the only worthwhile one :D

The first 100-150 hours are filled with hours of frustration but once you get past that, it's pure bliss. You'll get a hang of all the different guns, different classes and choose your favourites. I myself used m16 for an enormous time and it got monotonous. Trying out new weapons and classes was great.

battlefield3,3cdfd6,TukkaSi,2,Tue Jul 7 14:58:11 2015 UTC,Wait whaaaat? Youre switching from pc to ps4? Just use the money you would have spent on the ps4 games and live to build a decent pc. You can get an i5 and a 750ti and be set for years.. youll also have cheaper games higher resolutions and framrates
battlefield3,3cdfd6,snowfalltranquility,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice but I just don't like the gameplay itself on PC (except in BF3). There's just too many thing I don't like on this platform (especially in BF4):  Try-hards using only OP weapons, You get killed really fast, vehicles are too good, higher RPM weapons are also too good, FPS drops, screen tearing, maps are too open for KB + mouse gameplay and more.   On the console, however, most of these problems go away. I used to play on Xbox 360 but I've switched to PC because it only had 24 men servers. That was the only reason. Also, on PS4 Single - Player games become way more interesting. I just miss that casual gameplay...  The resolution thing isn't a plus to me as well - I lower my resolution to 900p anyway (it just feels smoother and better to me)."
battlefield3,3cdfd6,TukkaSi,3,Tue Jul 7 18:11:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly there is tryhards in every game on any platform, screen tearing can be fixed by adjusting the graphic settings, frame drops are caused by a shitty pc which can be fixed forever by building a good one which takes about 2 hours to build and 2 hours of research. you can use any controller you like, getting ""killed to easy"" is based on skill, they have the same level of hitpoints on each platform. It might be due to the fact that its really easy to use a m+kb (hence no aim assist) the pc has single player games... it has the same titles as ps4 and more exclusives, you can lower or raise your resolution to whatever you like. Now take these all into account and add the fact that its cheaper by a long shot and that you have mod support, are not limited to low graphic settings, you know your machine inside out, youll never need to upgrade to the next console and you get a better overall experience.  Think about it a little bit. You may just like it when you get the actual pc experience."
battlefield3,3cdfd6,snowfalltranquility,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:42:20 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I've thought about this more than enough. A lot of Your PC pros doesn't affect me but a lot of cons do. I've never been a true PC gamer because I've always enjoyed more playing on a console. Like I've said, I've only switched to PC just to be able to play on a 64 players servers.  I'm getting PS4 even just for the Uncharted and Last of Us and it has even more great exclusive games. PC has more titles but none of them interest me. PC for me is just for BF3 because other games for me are way more fun on the console.  Like You enjoy staying on PC, I like to do so on a console. Thanks for the info but I'm getting back to my roots - console gaming. Oh, and I'm not leaving PC side completely 'cuz I'll also build a Mid - range PC for BF3."
battlefield3,3cdfd6,TukkaSi,3,Wed Jul 8 09:35:05 2015 UTC,"I'm neither one of those pcmasterrace elitists, nor a console fanboy. Just a casual gamer from time to time and pretty much in the same situation as you right now.   I own a ps3 and a decent enough laptop (gives me around 45 fps on bf3 low settings) and I'm looking to upgrade. I gave it some thought myself and landed on buying a pc. Here's my two cents:  Do you research first. I'm sure you've done enough of that, but some of your arguments just don't make sense, to me atleast. Again, I'm not criticizing, just want to know what you're getting at. Like when you said something along the lines of ""I play on low resolution anyway, feels smoother"". That's actually because low settings provide better framerates on your current pc. I've played bf4 on my friend's pc on ultra settings at around 80 fps and it was the definition of smooth. Also, the free online multiplayer is a plus, along with hundreds of others.   I'm not bashing consoles, I just don't see why they're worth my money if I can get much better out of a pc. I just don't see it. Fair enough, the exclusives are something to think about. But for me personally, they aren't as important so as to shift my decision completely.   In the end, it's your choice and your money. Just make sure to buy something you won't regret, be it pc or console. And yeah, have fun gaming!"
battlefield3,3cdfd6,SexyPotahto,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:13:27 2015 UTC,"About the resolution: I get 60+ FPS even on 1080p, so it's not the framerate issue (I have 60 Hz monitor). I don't know why, but I don't like playing on a native resolution. I wouldn't play on it even if I'd get 120+ FPS. It just doesn't feel smooth enough for me.  About the price: I could get two and a half PS4s for the price of a decent gaming rig. I'm not going to Pre-order new games and I will resell the ones that I have so I doubt I'll spend more than I would if I'd go with a PC.   I'm still going to play BF3 on PC. However, other games will be played on a console, because, in my opinion, it's more balanced and way more fun there. Also, player base is way bigger.  Even if I won't like to play on a PS4, I'll just sell it and buy a decent gaming rig. However, PC gaming became boring to me (except for the BF3).  Thanks for the comment!"

Then the person actually calls in and EA says they can't do it.  Talk about frustrating.  I'm at my wits end working with these guys.  I really apologize it didn't work out.

battlefield3,3bzq69,SexyPotahto,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:10:39 2015 UTC,"1) Yup.  2) If there's a reasonable deal on premium, definitely. There's plenty of fun with the vanilla maps, but there are some great maps in the expansions. Plus the new weapons and vehicles can be fun.  3) Vanilla is the most popular, but there are always Gulf of Omen from Karkand and some Armored Kill and/or CloseQuarters maps that are rather popular. And you'll find servers with Endgame or Aftermath  4) Yeah. The one problem with the game is it doesn't have built in voice support, so you have to use team speak if you want voice (people do, but probably not as many as there would be if it was built in). Even without voice, txt chat and quick dialogue give you enough to get by ""Need ammo"" ""I'm a medic, let me patch you up"". But you're set in squads. Some people just do their own thing, but remember you can switch squads so if you find people who work together you can dominate. Even if you don't find a group that's working great together. Play support (ammo guy) or assault (medic guy) and pick a player on your squad and follow them and cover their ass and keep them supplied... The game is designed so that kind of teamwork wins games.  5) I'm a little tied up this weekend, but if you want some help next week during weeknights, I'd be happy to help you out a bit."

At some point they changed it so that when you pick a game mode like rush, it will find you a rush match but the server can be anything after that. You'll join a rush match but after that has ended it can be anything depending on the server's playlist. Use the server browser is you want a server that's a certain game mode all the time.

battlefield3,3bbxi1,gunnerpad,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"Not a bad rig btw. Very similar to a build i was thinking of doing recently but i decided to go intel in the end after piching up a cheap i7 3770k  600w should be plenty with no overclocking...  Amd cpus often have a feature called cool 'n' quiet. This can cause throttling if its getting hot (and AMD 8core cpus can get supprisingly hot) I think it can be overidden if you download ""amd catalyst control centre"" and switch to a gaming power plan (should disable the feature).  If not it should be easy to disable in the bios, it'll be called cool n quiet or CnQ.   Cool and quiet basically reduces the power to the processor to keep it running at low temps without using too many fans and reducing noise. Its been a little while since ive looked into amd cpus and features but thats the general idea of CnQ.  Google cool n quiet for more info on what it actually does and on disabling it as it varies from bios to bios.   Also, please make sure you update to windows 8.1, if you haven't already.

If this is a global problem, i would start by doin a clean gfx driver install (meaning with drivercleaner in preperation).   Unistall nv driver and physx via windows prgramm controlls. Go into safe mode and run driver cleaner, wipe every nv or amd file thats found. Another boot into safe mode, with network capability.

Alt+Tab Start Public Matchmaking of Co-Op. Alt+Tab into Battlefield again   This works in ~ 6/10 tries.  But when we tried that together, nothing. Seems like it is possible to get randomly matched but no Co-Op with friends (which is really shitty, because there is no way of communicating with the randoms)."

battlefield3,3azoyd,pavlik_enemy,4,Wed Jun 24 23:18:21 2015 UTC,They did it with Titanfall.
battlefield3,3azoyd,Alikont,12,Thu Jun 25 01:29:53 2015 UTC,"I have no proof to this, but my gut feeling tells me that was more of a push on Respawn's side. Respawn is a truly independent studio, with Titanfall being a one-game deal with EA (though it's very likely it'll be extended for 2). Of course that's still require EA vetting, but they have a bit more flexibility to pull a stunt like that than DICE would.  Aside from that, it's a much safer gamble. Titanfall is a new franchise who's looking to establish itself, I imagine the DLC's sales were low, and they surely won't incur any significant loss with taht move. BF's case is different. As a much more established series, a move like that could be seen as cheap by some. Compare with CoD, who tries to avoid product depreciation at any cost, maintaining high prices for legacy titles because they still sell marginally and for image purpose. Of course people love a freebie, but seeing a CoD case in a discount bin would harm their image in the long term. BF, with its rising popularity, isn't quite there yet, but I imagine they share the same concerns."
battlefield3,3azoyd,jma1024,5,Thu Jun 25 05:03:33 2015 UTC,"You seem spot on about different approaches to discounts. BO2 is still at $60, ten bucks more than BF4 Premium Ed."

battlefield3,3azoyd,backporch4lyfe,11,Thu Jun 25 13:19:26 2015 UTC,More likely it's EA keeping the cost up. It always takes them the longest time to reduce the price on old games and DLC.
battlefield3,3azoyd,nikniuq,9,Wed Jun 24 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"Probably because if they make it cheaper, people without a lot of disposable cash will likely spend less on the older game, rather than spending the same amount on a newer game"

In my server, there was one team of 6-7 guys and then 2 squads of 4. I was in one of the smaller squads and was trying to be sneaky because the bigger squad was camping like crazy. I heard firing and peeked out from behind this crate, and saw a muzzle flash erupting from one of the destructable buildings in the center of the map. I didn't have a clear shot, so I launched a grenade through the doorway near the report and got a kill. I fired another just to be safe. Got another kill, on the same guy. So I fired another. Same guy. I guess some squadmate was continuously reviving the guy, so I tried launching a grenade through the opening but a little to the left. I got a double kill. Well, I must have damaged one of the support beams too much because a couple of seconds later, the building collapsed, and I got 5 kills. Still my favorite BF3 moment."

Rush wasn't balanced to let a few extra defenders keep trying to sneak around far away off-bomb trying to get kills...that's an exploitable weakness that any good rush attacker will take advantage of (via beacons, or spawning on their squad that's already left the spawn...personally, I leave spawn camping defenders alive when I know of them and just cleverly evade towards the bomb, since that's one less defender I know won't be helping with the objective). If you're playing on a mixed mode server which is probably mostly people who can stomach conquest, then both teams are probably full of folks who aren't contributing either way...so feel free to mess around. If you're on an actual rush only server with regulars who are plying rush correctly, pleeeease don't leave the bomb...you shouldn't be more than 50m from them on defense (the HUd has numbers to help!), and when one is planted everybody needs to fall back and move to defuse or cover the disarmer.   People who try to rationalize their wasting of a good rush server slot by constantly abandoning the bomb to chase kills in the attacker spawn as an effective way to run down attacker tickets for the win: guess what, killing those same tickets when they're near the bomb counts the same, and has the added benefit of keeping an even team in range to disarm instead of leaving a skeleton crew that is easily overwhelmed.   Again, serious rush discussion only...if you find yourself playing TDM ever or a lot of conquest, and thus don't frequent the good rush servers, then carry on."

battlefield3,3apz6w,Coneyo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:50:25 2015 UTC,"This isn't as impressive as using a chopper to attack the fourth set (tunnel) from behind. There's always some guy trying to find a creative way to hang out at the old set, where nothing can threaten them."
battlefield3,3apz6w,Superunknown_7,0,Mon Jun 22 20:57:29 2015 UTC,"Wait what.  Once you've lost both mcoms 2nd stage and theres short time you have to run down to the next set, this is just a method of getting behind their lines.  Nobody gets steamrolled on tunnels-stage damavand rush as thats a chokepoint of all eternity. Furthermore the only people getting steamrolled in the end was the attackers as they had no tank. Theres no way to flank at tunnel-stage mcoms as defenders anyway."
battlefield3,3apz6w,El_Diablito,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:17:14 2015 UTC,Good work.  Its advantageous on any RUSH map to rear flank the attackers but putting the spawn beacon on the jump pad behind them is a great idea.  It's pretty hit or miss at the last MCOM depending upon how coordinated the defending team is with taking out the tank which can blow through the tunnel like a battering ram.  Since you not only took it out of the equation but instead used it against the attackers there was no way they could win.
battlefield3,3apz6w,AlutaShade,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:44:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah this wasn't that impressive. I mean stealing the tank was very advantageous, but while you were dicking around up top, your team lost the 3rd set and moved back in to the tunnels. Alternatively, you could just wait and hide after losing the 3rd set and steal the tank as soon as it spawns."

battlefield3,39tkow,spiralout154,2,Mon Jun 15 13:07:45 2015 UTC,"No. Kills are important, but so is giving out ammo, healing and reviving, and placing a spawn beacon. Kills are the objective, but that doesn't necessarily mean you can't help others either.  The great thing about Battlefield is that everyone can contribute. In TDM, if you aren't the best in infantry combat, you can still help others that are great at it.  EDIT: Suddenly being downvoted because people don't know how to play the game. Okay."
battlefield3,39tkow,Infirnex,2,Mon Jun 15 13:57:01 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with healing and reviving, and occasionally handing out ammo. From my experience, unless your team is heavily medic focused or you're camping with an lmg, you're unlikely to run out of ammo in tdm. Spawn beacons aren't super useful as the primary advantage of them is to get your team closer to the objective. In this case, the objective is everywhere, and a lot of beacons get camped or place you in an enemy's line of fire. Tdm is a mode entirely focused on kills first, revives second. The other objective-based gamemodes are a lot better suited for team play.   My favorite thing about tdm is how much chaotic shenanigans happens, and how fast paced the gameplay is."

My point is that in a game mode where KDR decides the winner, kills really are all that matter. Sure ammo and health helps, but if you can't get kills, nothing else maters.   I just think it's weird how so many people seem to criticize those who get a lot of kills as if you can't ptfo and get kills at the same time."

The absolute count metrics are obviously pretty skewed at this point due to the game's age, but I'm partial to the per minute score (i.e. objective per minute or SPM by class).  Same thing with ribbons: it's more interesting to me to compare MVP1s or Ace Squad ribbons per total games played than to just look at totals that depend on if someone's played since beta or last year.    *Everyone keep in mind that there's been an enormous wipe of stats where a significant portion of people were wiped (I'm guessing two thirds or so, based on watching my grenade ranking climb as I meticulously watched my stats like a nerd since launch and the assumption that it counted nearly everyone on the site because grenades).  I don't know if it was all EA stats or just on the third party stats site.  Count of things wasn't lost, but a lot of granularity was.

It's something that BF4 almost completely did away with; everything is much easier to get in that game and the feeling of accomplishment is nowhere near as great.  If little noob pre-colonel me could see myself now he'd have an absolute nerdgasm at my 26k jet kills and 200 stars, but for some reason I just don't care much anymore.

The only mastery tags I'm missing are the Mortar, Laser Designator, Javelin, Stinger, and IGLA. Other than that, I have over 500 kills with every weapon in the game. I even went as far as to get at least 500 kills with all the pistols, even the ones that you don't actually earn mastery dogtags for (mostly a lot of the suppressed and tactical versions). This is definitely the stat I pride myself most on. It was a hell of a grind!  I even decided to challenge myself further and master over half the weapons TWICE. I now have 48/87 weapons at 1,000 kills or more. This includes all the Assault weapons (including M320 and M26), all my Engineer primaries, and all my PDWs. I'm still working on my Support weapons, and have four left. I'm probably not going to bother with the bolt actions or semi-autos because I very rarely play recon, and I suck with Shotguns so fuck those too haha.  My current personal goal is getting my top 5 weapons at 100 service stars or more. So far I have (in order from first to fourth) my ACW, AsVal, M16A3, and AEK at 100+ stars. Number five is the G53 and it's at 91 stars right now.

battlefield3,39t3zb,baddada77,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm pretty obsessed with it haha. I'm always checking my stats to see how many more kills I need to get a weapon up to the next service star.  There was definitely plenty of weapons that I absolutely hated getting 500 kills for. I raged quite a bit with a lot of the weapons, especially shotguns since I'm horrible with them. Most all the PDWs, Assault Rifles, and Carbines are all good. But some of the LMGs and semi-autos are terrible. But really, I think the pistols were the hardest out of all of them. I don't normally go around running pistol as my primary, so getting all of them to 500+ kills was just a matter of time.  I would probably have significantly more knife kills than I do currently (only 28 stars), but when I was grinding through all the pistols and encountered an enemy with his back to me, or some lone sniper on a mountain, I would just headshot kill them with my pistol instead of knifing them. It helped get those pistols up to 500 kills a lot quicker.  I just really believe in variety in this game. There's more to BF3 than just one gun and one class. Getting use to a new gun takes some adjustment time, but it challenges you as a player for sure. You gotta retrain your muscle memory depending on which gun you're using next.

battlefield3,39t3zb,lashazior,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:22:42 2015 UTC,"MCOM defender medal most definitely! If you're good at Rush, you'll rarely allow the enemy even the chance to arm an MCOM, and since they have to be within like 3ft of the bomb or something for you to get that defender bonus, it's really tough. I'm usually always pushed up with my defending team spawn trapping the attackers, so obtaining a defense bonus is rare.  I did just get my defense medal the other night though. I went bananas over the mic haha. I was so happy I got the medal, that I equipped the MCOM defense dogtag right away. It looks badass pretty cool, so I'm satisfued with it :D"

They later reversed the PB ban, with only a small announcement containing 3 lines on an outdated Evenbalance site telling people to give me the benefit of the doubt. EA didn't announce shit, DICE didn't announce shit. Nobody ended up giving me the benefit of the doubt. Got kicked out of a high ranking clan. My stats were never fixed to its original state, just a 4 star general rank with 0 points and all unlocks. Admins thought I was hacking because of the weird stats. EA support could never help me further.  So I thought, fuck it. If I already look the part, why don't act like it too.  And thus HaruhiAA was born."

I'll show you a cheater""...  I prefer the simple method of not giving them my money and being done with them because that's ALL they care about = $$$$  What pissed me off the most wasn't EB or PBBans rather the stiff middle finger EA gave me.

I have 1400hrs played... if it wasn't for this and the fact I worked hard on achievements/dogtags, becoming better, etc I wouldn't give two shits.  In fact, false positives like this just encourage people to say f**k it and go out and cheat and be a douchebag. I mean, why not? Because that's what they are despite facts to the contrary...  This is job security for PB... keeping themselves in business.  Also, did you include bans from GGC? They are far bigger than PBBans."

battlefield3,38yu6s,dudenell,-4,Mon Jun 8 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"Fairfight is stats based, so it's on a completely different level than punkbuster. VAC isn't any better and requires STEAM. EA hasn't sold a Battlefield game on steam in years. Try again."
battlefield3,38yu6s,fzombie,0,Mon Jun 8 13:18:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but fairfight does way more than look at your stats, e.g. kda, spm, hs/k% etc. If it did it would be no more effective than cheatometer and we both know how bad that can be.   Here is how Fairfight's is described.   FairFight® is a non-invasive, customizable, server side anti-cheat engine using agnostic technology that operates in real time. It does not reside on the player`s computer or the game server, and does not examine the players' devices or perpetually look for the latest hacks. FairFight uses GameBlocks' proprietary GameChanger™ rule engine and database structures to evaluate players' gameplay actions and Make it a FairFight® for everyone. Players' actions are tested against multiple statistical markers to identify cheating as it occurs. FairFight crosschecks these indicators using objective server-side reporting tools and takes action when both approaches correlate to cheating. FairFight's graduated penalty system (warning/restriction/suspension) has been shown to effectively suppress and deter 'cheaters' by imposing prompt and appropriate penalties automatically, while simultaneously notifying them that continued misbehavior will result in harsher penalties.   It has no presence on a player's computer so it can't look for overlays, memory hacks, or suspicious processes like punkbuster does. That's also why they state that they don't have to bother with hacks being updated because those bypasses have no effect on what fairfight analyzes. The only thing left for them to be looking it is data passed between the server and player. Among other things that data would include: All player positions, where they are looking, whether or not they can see each other, etc.  With just those three things you can detect hacks like ESP and aimbot with incredible ease by performing one simple calculation and analyzing the results.  All you have to do is calculate the shortest distance(d) between a line projected out from your crosshairs(black line passing through Q) and the position of an enemy player(P). That distance d is effectively the quality of your aim at an enemy player.  To detect ESP alone(which would be impossible with purely stats), you just look for players who manage consistently low d values on players they can't see.   For aimbots you can just look for abnormally long stretches of low d values that indicate locking on. No matter how well programmed your aimbot is to look like natural input it has to be better than what humans are capable of as it would otherwise be a worthless cheat. If the the aimbot just snaps between targets all the time you would have a d value near zero the whole time you used it.   If your aimbot tracked through walls you'd stand out like a sore thumb because normal players tend to lose track of a player when they go out of vision. I'd bet the d value at transitions between players going in and out of cover is something they look at really closely.  All you have to is quantify these events and you can set a statistical threshold that calls bullshit after a certain point.    So in summary, that's why I think PunkBuster is basically garbage compared to the approach fairfight takes."
battlefield3,38yu6s,justaguy101,4,Mon Jun 8 18:04:07 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, your whole write up is basically outlining what I said, fairfight is STATS BASED. They look at STATS reported from the player onto the server.   gameplay actions   AKA Server stats. How fast the user is aiming at another user, etc. Yes, it's not stats based in the sense of kd/r, but it's still based upon a large number of players and their general gaming habits in comparison to those using a hack.  It's not client side like you said, which punkbuster is.  Punkbuster uses a completely different approach, it's client based and server based. It's constantly scanning the users computer while the user is playing for active cheats and overlays that have been injected into the software and memory. It also takes screenshots of the player client side  Punkbuster is easily compared to an antivirus software, when a detection happens, a set of processes from there kicks the client from the server.  Fairfight could be compared to a financial software, going over numbers and pointing out those which it thinks is wrong or incorrect. Nothing clientside.  You're basically comparing apples to oranges. I know what punkbuster does, I know what fairfight does. They are completely different software in the way they handle and detect cheaters.   The only other client side detection software that I know of besides VAC and Punkbuster is Battle eye.   Yes, I agree, fairfight is MORE effective because it's instant and doesn't rely on having the cheat files on hand, in which punkbuster needs in most cases.   Does that mean you should get rid of punkbuster? IMO No. You still need that client side detection otherwise fairfights work will always come into question."
battlefield3,38yu6s,justaguy101,0,Mon Jun 8 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"Well I apologize for repeating what you said. It's just when most people refer to stats without any clarification, it means they are think of the kind of stats you see on battlelog and not the deeper level stats we were both thinking of."

battlefield3,38yu6s,Thotaz,3,Mon Jun 8 02:49:53 2015 UTC,"It's technically up to each server owner who sees the violation to decide what action their server takes. This particular violation is one that nets a permanent ban from all the servers on my favorites list, which are essentially all the remaining active servers in the US. I don't play out of country for ping reasons and most of them stream punkbuster bans as well, meaning it's not even an option for me if I did."
battlefield3,38yu6s,RussK14,3,Mon Jun 8 04:22:34 2015 UTC,"This is nothing new.   There have been at least two other similar banwaves that i can recall. Its difficult to say what causes it but people have assumed its because of overlays.  Evenbalance will prob only just answer with their standard copy paste "" we did not find this violation to be triggered in error yada yada..."". If this is a legit error and enough noise is made, the bans will be lifted in a month or two. It could be that if its easy to reproduce the error it could be sooner too."
battlefield3,38yu6s,HaruhiAA,2,Mon Jun 8 07:41:38 2015 UTC,Yeah they gave me that spiel. I found instances where violations had been negated but I'm really concerned this time around because with the game being old and played a lot less than in the past the number of false violations might not be significant enough for them to give a shit.

And the only other reference to it by anyone is the guy who's videos I've been posting. My posts about it here and on the evga forums come right to the top of google search results when you search precision x and 51048 together so hopefully others will find my posts and complain if they got caught up too.
battlefield3,38yu6s,TheBiggestWig,3,Mon Jun 8 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"If you are getting a perm ban from Punkbuster, you can't join ANY servers. If you can join servers that don't use PBBans, then it's a PBBan ban you have, not a Punkbuster ban. Take it up with PBBans."
battlefield3,38yu6s,TheBiggestWig,3,Mon Jun 8 08:55:26 2015 UTC,"You are correct, Punkbuster only kicks you for two minutes, but if they happen to stream to PBBans it's severe enough that your game will be seriously fucked as you'll never get on one of those servers again.   And as for appealing at PBBans, they simply defer to EB's decision and that's all they are willing to do. As is apparently typical and somewhat understandably, EB won't even acknowledge any evidence in your appeal and will simply refer you to the email address I posted.  I know this because I found the video I linked above here to and he tried appealing with both of them and was summarily denied. The only thing worth having is a reversed violation from EB and that was denied for me as well."
battlefield3,38yu6s,RussK14,3,Mon Jun 8 11:17:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what's worse, the fact that it kicked you for an aimbot you didn't have, or the fact that the only punishment for playing with an aimbot is a 2 minute kick.

Well, they lifted the ban after my lawyer got into action. Long story short, pb and evenbalance are just incapable in fullfilling their objective, the only thing they are good at, is the violation of numerious international, european and amercian laws (thats the reason they have to lift a false ban the moment they get charged, cause they exactly know what kind of shit they are doin').

battlefield3,392w28,twentyafterfour,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:08:10 2015 UTC,"KD Spread is more important than KDR in a deathmatch round and is more or less the net number of tickets you personally took from the enemy team just from kills alone in a conquest round.

I'm a newbie and rarely play cept when I'm bored of COD. The point, I'm no stranger to FPS and I can hold my own with anyone. The problem kiddies who rent servers and are allowed to do as they wish even if it makes the game look bad. I have experienced it many times, I go in and start hunting down rank up camping dudes. As soon as you wipe the floor with them they pop a blood vessel and boot you out for no reason. Its worse on BF4 which is why I rarely play it. I won't be buying the next release thats for sure. This game could be great if they had official dedicated servers or at least allow users to report admins who ruin the game and ban them from hosting any games on the official server list. Also 3 strikes and it a life time ban.  That would be so awesome."
battlefield3,38uu74,deepfunkysoul,3,Sun Jun 7 02:08:04 2015 UTC,"They never enforce real rules either. I always see servers that state ""no doing x or y"" but never kick people for it, but if you do some benign thing like kill an admin, instant permaban"
battlefield3,38uu74,Phase--2,3,Sun Jun 7 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"Come on over to PC! While we have our fair share of ""badmins"" overall we're a much more reasonable group.  On a more realistic note (since buying a PC might not be a possibility for you) I would suggest trying to find a clan of like-minded people. Are you also open to all game types? BF3 has become very TDM heavy but by keeping yourself open to all game modes you'll find better servers."
battlefield3,38uu74,the_Robin-cM,2,Sun Jun 7 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"You guessed it, PC's not an option for me. I've come to find that there are two kinds of clans on bf3, at least in the 360 community. There are clans that ONLY ever play together, in a group chat, all with mics, and exclusively on their server, usually against a bunch of random players with varying ranks and no mics, making for a slaughterhouse of a game. Then there are also clans with players who essentially lose communication with other members, play whatever they want, whenever they want, and might as well not be in a clan for those reasons."
battlefield3,38uu74,TGSureal,2,Sun Jun 7 20:57:21 2015 UTC,"That is the ""problem"" with BF.  When you give people the ability to own and run their own servers, you also give them the opportunity to abuse that teeny tiny bit of authority.    I was a server admin for a good while on a ps3 server but quit after the owner of the server started being a real dick.  In my experience, you probably got kicked because they don't like the way you play.  They probably think that if you are using a M320 to kill, then you are a scrub and should be kicked.  Once you came back and did it again, or killed the wrong admin, he mentioned it, and you got banned.  The ban list on ps3 only went up to 100 so they probably clear it a good bit. So the ban does not last long.  When you jump back into their server and kill the admin, they remember you and continue to hold a grudge.  I seen it, and I banned people myself for playing like asses.  For instance we had a no c4 trap rule, and there was a handful of people that would jump into the server, start the c4 traps, and once noticed would get kicked, along with a message to stop with the c4.  Later on I'd see them back in the server doing the same thing.  So we would ""perma-ban"" them on sight, as it was apparent they were not their to play fair.    It may also come down to connection.  Maybe you are lagging out and you should find a closer server.  My suggestion would be to find a different server.  If no one visits their shit hole server, it will die. It is no fun to play against colonel 100's anyway.  But on the other hand, if you can't beat them, join them.  Maybe try joining in on their team and jumping in their squad if there is room.  Get to know them and maybe you could make a few new friends.  If you can't join their squad, at least put team chat on so you can hear them.   There used to be an option in battlelog were you can report players and their servers, but good luck trying that.  I doubt the reports are investigated anymore. In fact, I am pretty sure our server would have been shut down the way the owner and a couple of the other admins were abusing their authority.  It never was."
battlefield3,38uu74,TheBiggestWig,2,Sun Jun 7 03:50:30 2015 UTC,I understand the frustration of being kicked and banned from severs. I have been banned from around 10 severs due to admins being mad about something. It sucks. They pay for the server so it's their right to run it anyway they want to. Your best bet would be to go find another sever that you enjoy playing on.
battlefield3,38uu74,deepfunkysoul,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"Then they should not be on the official server list. They need to have separate list. Most new players don't know they are playing on non-official servers. Its like sending lambs into slaughter. This kills the game and pushes away new players.

Nor does it say ""Official Server List"" anywhere in the game. So why would a new player think that it was a Official Server List?   Its like sending lambs into slaughter.   Not sure how playing on a 3rd party server is equivalent to this.    You know very well if this was implemented there would be no 3rd party servers, problem solved.   Every game that has official servers also has a very large percentage of players playing on 3rd party run server. So to say that if EA/DICE ran official servers that 3rd party server would disappear is silly.  Once again if you don't like the way a sever is ran, leave and play somewhere else. Problem solved.

There is a TDM Nosh Canals server that normally gets full (48 players). Sometimes an Operation Metro server that gets up to maybe 20-40 players. A Damavand Peak Rush server that very occasionally gets 20-32 people in it. And finally a Firestorm/Caspian/Kharg Conquest server that gets full (48) most nights.  There is still a fairly good sized community that plays given how small our country's population is. Jump on and play! The more people that play the longer we can keep this game alive."
battlefield3,38hvox,ColossalPhallus,2,Thu Jun 4 16:02:27 2015 UTC,"Oh sweet, any idea if BF3 will go back on sale?"
battlefield3,38hvox,ColossalPhallus,2,Thu Jun 4 21:45:52 2015 UTC,I'm sure it will go back on sale. When or for how much I'm not sure. A while ago the base game was just $5 but it sometimes also goes on sale for $10 if I remember correctly.   You could always use a CD-Key reseller. They are sites that purchase copies of the game when they are on sale and later sell the keys for slightly more than they bought them for. You can find the base game for around $7.50. I've used some of them before and can vouch for their validity. If you decide to go with a reseller I'll link you to the ones I've used and had no problems with.  There isn't a whole lot of point buying premium or any of the DLC unless you just want the weapons as there is rarely ever an Australian server running that has DLC maps on rotation. There are dozens of servers in America though if you feel like playing with a 200-250 ping and some Singaporean/Asian servers that will have 150-200 ping.
battlefield3,38hvox,ColossalPhallus,2,Fri Jun 5 05:42:52 2015 UTC,"Do I need to play on DLC maps to get the DLC weapons?   Say I have the DLC, and to unlock the M5K, do I need to be on the DLC the M5k came with?"
battlefield3,38hvox,markMarkington,2,Fri Jun 5 05:51:44 2015 UTC,"Normally no. But for the M5K you will need to finish in the top 5 in Gun Master so yes, you'll need to play some Close Quarters DLC maps (since Gun Master is not in the original game). It shouldn't be too hard though. Just play on an American server for a few games until you unlock it."
battlefield3,38hvox,HDZombieSlayerTV,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yep lots of Australian and New Zealand players still.   There's not many playing on the expansion maps (perhaps one or two will start up in the weekends from time-to-time. There's conquest (jets & no jets) plus a few TDM servers that are usually running hot. Usually Damavand rush is going and sometimes the multi-map rush one goes.   You'll get plenty of M5K action on those. Still worth the money, hopefully will see you on the battlefield."

Use the explosives perk, plant 3 mines in cluster at certain areas, and boom. AT Launchers = Any map with high amount of air/ground vehicles, plenty of servers that have insta-spawn for vehicles. You can either camp around their base, or simply run around shooting. If its the assignment I think it is, you don't have to only get vehicle kills, so run around and be a dick and shoot people with rpg. SOFLAM = if you play with friends, have them use Javelin. If not, it may take a while. Try and join squads with lower level players in engineer mode, as they most often prefer the easy lock-on ability."
battlefield3,3844l0,Cr33py_Uncl3,2,Mon Jun 1 19:03:12 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's the SCAR-H Specialist assignment. 100 kills with the SCAR-H, 20 M15 AT Mine kills, and 5 air vehicles destroyed with AT launchers. I guess I'll just try and get lucky with the SMAW."
battlefield3,3844l0,Fedcab,2,Mon Jun 1 19:59:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, use the RPG or SMAW and wait for them to swoop low. It may take a while, but eventually you'll run into some.

battlefield3,3844l0,ThisIsMyFifthAccount,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:23:40 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, yes that one! You do have a much better chance at killing them with SMAW/RPG than you do with stingers, as everyone has that smoke thingy. Play Rush on Kharg Island, wait for the heli to get close and bam! Or any of the CQ maps I mentioned before with air vehicles. It takes practice, but once you get it down, it will be fun as hell."
battlefield3,3844l0,twentyafterfour,3,Mon Jun 1 20:59:03 2015 UTC,"I get most of my AT mine kills on the smaller conquest maps like Damavand Peak, Seine Crossing, Tehran Highway, and Grand Bazaar. Tehran Highway is such a dark map that unless the enemy is running thermals or spotting constantly, they'll be difficult to see. I rarely ever run AT Mines on larger maps since I'm usually repping my own tank or a squadmates tank, but I see people lay them out all the time so it might work.  For AT kills against air vehicles just RPG or SMAW some low flying choppers/jets. I can't remember if IGLAs and Stingers can be used for that assignment, but maybe they would work for you if you're not yet comfortable with the RPG/SMAW.  Laser Designation assists I think can also be obtained by getting in the third seat of a tank? If that's true, get a friend to run guided on his tank and laser designate vehicles. If SOFLAM is the only way to get laser designation assists then just keep planting SOFLAMS and hope to get lucky? I dunno, I really only ever run SOFLAM on Kharg Island Rush Defense. You get one squad with a sniper running SOFLAM and the other three running engineer with Javelins and it's over for the enemy team. My squad is so dedicated to this tactic that one of my buddies will spawn in as support to throw down an ammo pack in a safe spot, suicide, then come back as an Engi with a Javelin. That way they can continuously resupply their Javelin rockets. I get tons of laser designation assists this way, provided someone else on my team isn't also running SOFLAM."
battlefield3,3844l0,ThisIsMyFifthAccount,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"For mines most of the linear rush maps are good...just be sure you're putting down 3 piles of 2 mines to kill most tanks, or if it's an LAV map make it 2 pils of 3 mines. Whatever you do, don't put a wide net of sparse single mines...you'll get a disable at best and usually just do some damage and alert the enemy to spot for more mines.   CTF camping is probably your best bet though, if you can find any servers"
battlefield3,3844l0,baddada77,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:12:04 2015 UTC,Widely spaced single mines are useful for keeping vehicles off objectives since they have individually shoot each one before they can move forward and are easier targets for everyone else while they're doing so. But at the same time they make life really difficult for friendly vehicles since any explosion will set them off. I often find myself having to blow up friendly mines so I can safely defend an objective while in a vehicle. In general I think it's best to mine the routes approaching objectives rather than the objective itself.
battlefield3,3844l0,planetmatt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:58:28 2015 UTC,"If a tank is smart enough to spot for mines, he's presumably smart enough to only shoot the one needed to make a space in the wide net for him to proceed onwards rather than standing still to shoot all 6 just to get the 20 points each. If you're playing competent tankers, wide single mines are useless and a waste...doubled up at choke points for the unexpected kill as they drive over are the only way. I have a lot of mine kills and am particularly good at defending rush.  In conquest, mines might make sense to set and forget during one spawn as engineer before switching to torch for all the conquest vehicles...generally mines seem significantly less useful in conquest other than for one-off annoyance kills versus actually funneling or abating attacker progress."

For RPG v air kills I have had most success on Damavand or Canals vs the slow moving Little Birds and Hueys. Very easy to hit in time.  For Soflam designations you'd be best playing with friends. I helped a dude do it last year by running guided in the jet on Kharg, Caspian, Firestorm, etc.  Claymore kills always gave me issues. They never seemed to work for me.

battlefield3,3844l0,backporch4lyfe,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"I had 15 AT kills after some time of dedicated CQ and Rush. CTF is also not bad. Just put three mines in exactly the same spot to ensure a direct kill.In rush and CTF I advise to place them in a defending positions, while in CQ I would just look out for routes where vehicles usually rush trough or well hidden places on roads.  Air vehicle AT kills are the easiest against scout choppers so I would advise playing such maps. This assignement didn't really need any dedication of me, as I love Damavand rush anyway. Btw, you can there very well try to get the AT or SOFLAM kills as attacker, while mines and claymores are good for defeding.  Speaking of claymores, I just farmed a bit in DOM with them. Place them behind an entrance, with the angle ~30-45 degrees away from the door, so when the victim comes trough, it gets a full blow. Also a nice tactic is the turned claymore, where the way of the victim should be from the back of the claymore, running over it and getting blasted in the back. And yes, if it's hard to get kills put down two claymores. The most important thing is just, that you deploy them in a suitable location right after spawn and then just concentrate on your game, it then just starts to happen automatically. Also make sure it isn't against the rules.  I think the thing with the SOFLAM is, is that the shooter of the guided missile actually has to kill the target, to get the designation assist. I only remember successfully doing this on Kharg, since I didn't already bother with on PC."

That selection shows me getting 8 down clicks in .794 seconds for 10.08 clicks per second which is right at the max fire rate for the AN-94.

I don't think having the grip has as negative of an effect as sympthic might make it seem, or at least it's counterable like recoil."
battlefield3,37qx2d,ThisIsMyFifthAccount,1 point,Fri May 29 20:41:03 2015 UTC,"Interpretations of Symthic stats can be misleading - we need to see a comparison of groups of players using the foregrip and using no foregrip over a set number of matches without knowing which they're using ideally.  Just because something appears to behave a certain way doesn't mean it has a negative influence on performance or can't be corrected for or helpful.  I have no idea really, I just like the grip and do well so why switch.  Edit: Nevermind, I'm an idiot and realize I've always used underslung smoke for it's obvious massive benefits for PTFO.  Really the gun is just about rhythm and preference though; on any platform it's the most enjoyable to use."
battlefield3,37qx2d,_Soopa_,1 point,Sat May 30 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"I've been in the same situation as you describe. I still maintain the gun is more accurate in general without the foregrip (players accuracy is something that can obviously change that, but still...)."

battlefield3,37qx2d,lashazior,3,Sat May 30 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"As an AN-94-only player i suggest you just use the underslung rail.  The reason why the an-94 is so good is the two-bullet burst accuracy, which is like lazerbeam accurate. Makes it easy to take out anyone who is sitting still from any range. Also, controlling the recoil and ability to tap the shit out of your mouse is essential!  Now, foregrip reduces the accuracy to a point where the an-94 no better from other weapons, and bipod you simply dont need. Snipers you can easily kill without a bipod and generally you should pretty much never lie down to shoot, since you will be an easy target.  The secret to using AN-94 is tapping fast and learning to control recoil. The better you get the farther you can keep your aim on the enemies and still retain a big rate of fire. When you learn that you can kill people really far of with a combo of crazy accuracy and rate of fire. Macros you most definitely dont need, just practice."
battlefield3,37qx2d,twentyafterfour,1 point,Sat May 30 07:17:16 2015 UTC,and underslung lets you use gp-30 which is often an underrated tool
battlefield3,37qx2d,VitaFrench,1 point,Sat May 30 13:34:49 2015 UTC,"The AN-94 isn't just good because of the burst accuracy. It shoots 20 bullets a second if you can hit the max burst rate, which you will after you get used to it. That's 33% and 50% faster than the AEK and M16A3, respectively.   I personally have never used the foregrip on it but if you aren't running into a lot of well covered players the accuracy penalty might be worth the horizontal recoil reduction."
battlefield3,37qx2d,Wubbaz0rg,2,Sun May 31 12:54:48 2015 UTC,I use the bipod. As ridiculous as it sounds it makes setting up post to snipe those pesky snipers or people from long range with ease. I don't use Foregrip on any of my weapons so I may be biased.  Edit: It's not really set up for TDM. I play a lot of Rush so I tend to defend more often.
battlefield3,37qx2d,VitaFrench,1 point,Sat May 30 06:06:34 2015 UTC,Bipods are for suckers. Unless you are using a machine gun there is no reason to use a bipod. It makes you an easy and obvious target.
battlefield3,37qx2d,Wubbaz0rg,1 point,Sat May 30 06:12:07 2015 UTC,Give it a try. I'm not camped out bipoding with an assault rifle all the time. Like I said. It's good for picking off targets at long range.
battlefield3,37qx2d,VitaFrench,1 point,Sat May 30 06:20:23 2015 UTC,"I have, the problem is that it makes you stand still for too long. The extra accuracy does not make up for the loss of mobility imo.  For å sniper worth his salt someone using a bipod is basically a free kill. Might be different on console though."

battlefield3,37qx2d,twentyafterfour,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:09:36 2015 UTC,That's the same thought process I had. I don't use the underslung launchers either so a bipod can help and it doesn't hurt the stats either.
battlefield3,37qx2d,Jonas_Dralle,2,Wed Jun 3 19:15:41 2015 UTC,"I run heavy barrel only with a kobra. I don't ever use the foregrip. That setup is strong across the entire useful range of the gun. It outperforms all other assault rifles against well covered and head glitching targets. I just love the fact that I can tap some idiot sniper to death 100m away and then waste someone point-blank at full burst without having to switch fire modes.  Here's some shadowplay clips of hardcore tdm using that setup to do just that.    I like silencing it when I'm in a situation where I have to capture/defend all the goddamn objectives by myself. That lone red marker on the minimap can be a death sentence. The lack of muzzle flash with it is nice too but you'll be significantly weaker against the well covered/long range targets because you lose the perfect burst accuracy. At close to mid range you aren't really sacrificing anything by having it silenced.  Those are the only two ""serious"" setups I use on it.  The Holosight is nice on it too but the ADS sensitivity is much lower than with the red dots which can screw you over a lot at close range.   It's also fun to use the rifle scope too as you can really pop heads at pretty long range with that bad boy."

Whoever has the worst shot probably wins simply because their opponent has a really hard time hitting them."
battlefield3,37mps8,jakejw93,3,Fri May 29 07:47:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not hitting is the whole point of suppression. Suppression is so that people under cover don't come out under heavy fire. Doing so is stupid.   What is also stupid is that all changes to where bullets go isn't represented accurately on screen since it's all visual."
battlefield3,37mps8,Fortune188,19,Sat May 30 18:01:14 2015 UTC,Can reward bad players and take away the point of skill.    Can be 1vs1 and be totally suppressed and it'll be all about luck who gets the kill.    The idea could have worked but my goodness it was such overkill.
battlefield3,37mps8,Superunknown_7,3,Thu May 28 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thanks for convincing me, Operation Metro would probably be better without the random spread"
battlefield3,37mps8,fUCKzAr,8,Thu May 28 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"I love suppression, but I wish bullets would downscale their suppression ability exponentially at distance, with sniper rifles having the best long range suppression ability. Then LMG's, AR's, Carbines then PDW's and Shotguns. I dont think its right that a sniper cant hit his mark because of a carbine shooting at him from 80-120 yards away due to the suppression effect. I think this is in part due to how every other weapon except shotguns outclass snipers in terms of RoF, which is why I argue that suppression scaling should be inverse to distance."
battlefield3,37mps8,FullDerpHD,7,Thu May 28 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"I dont think its right that a sniper cant hit his mark because of a carbine shooting at him from 80-120 yards away due to the suppression effect.   It sure seems like the idea is to discourage snipers from getting into gun battles, which makes sense to me."
battlefield3,37mps8,plarm,3,Thu May 28 23:39:01 2015 UTC,"That just worsens CQB, suppression should work mid to long range, with long range suppression being the weakest, and no suppression at CQB distances. That's kind of what the new BF4 patch did, if only BF4 had 3s TTK."

battlefield3,37mps8,baddada77,12,Thu May 28 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with screen blur and higher recoil. I could have learned to compensate for that. But making my bullets come out of my barrel at a 45 degree angle is purely a attempt to make the games skill ceiling as low as possible   I was a pretty high level infantry player(http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/soldier/eXs-FD/stats/346036095/pc/) so it's especially frustrating to me that some clown who may not even know there is an ads button can potentially beat me in a fight when he does not deserve to win.   Say you flank/spawn behind me, Start spraying and because you either choked or are a very bad player you couldn't hit me if your life depended on it. I on the other hand despite not even knowing where you are when the encounter starts swing a 180, spot you through the blur, put my cross hair on target and deliver what should be a perfectly controlled burst of 10 rounds center mass into your chest. Except.... Because you suck, And dice likes to cater to people who suck. None of my bullets come out straight.  No players inability to aim should ever be able to nerf another player who can properly aim. No exceptions."
battlefield3,37mps8,LacidOnex,1 point,Thu May 28 21:03:50 2015 UTC,It's nice to see someone here who calls themselves a high level player when they actually are a high level player :p
battlefield3,37mps8,savage24x,5,Sun Jun 14 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"DICE told us at the beginning that only LMGs and SRs can suppress people but instead every goddamn thing does. ARs, carbines, shotguns, even the damn PDWs and pistols does suppression. I'm kinda iffy about the new suppression since it nerfs short range weapons' ability to suppress but it also punishes long-range combat."
battlefield3,37mps8,Pronato,5,Thu May 28 23:20:09 2015 UTC,It was a good concept but they ruined it with the random spread deviation. Such a shame.
battlefield3,37mps8,epsdude,3,Fri May 29 07:04:55 2015 UTC,"So, I agree unlike everyone else it seems.  Suppression works well as a mechanic with GOOD comms. You need two plans. Anti-recon suppression and anti-soldier. Recon is hardest with the engineer, as you will be more likely to chase the kill than bother moving into position around him. The play style of a recon requires you to force aggro onto you to counter, and then HOPEFULLY not get hit in what will be an easy range for him. Pressure wise, I'd rather kill him or send someone better equipped to do it.  Everyone else, shotguns smgs LMGs and rifles, you can beat. You just need decent cover and someone to pull a wide arc for a flank. If your medic is around, get him behind you and use his range to snipe a bit. If they're dug into a building, you'll want him to kill runners while your other crew sweeps the building (recons with suppressors work well as they can use a TUGS to quickly pinpoint everyone for the team and the guns won't be as noticeable amidst the suppressive fire).  I notice the advantage to an LMG is that you actually CAN get kills when the sweepers are discovered, so even a full squad will be SOL. Repositioning with an LMG wastes time, and suppressive distance with an engineer is close enough that numerous loadouts can be used to get kills at 50+ meters. You don't need a bipod for that, unlike most LMGs :)"
battlefield3,37mps8,Pronato,3,Thu May 28 21:05:41 2015 UTC,"I play at 640x480 on my laptop to get a stable Framerate, so I can't see shit when I'm suppressed."
battlefield3,37mps8,AlutaShade,3,Fri May 29 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't understand the problems players are having with in BF3 and 4.  But I guess it's just because I react correctly to it and go into cover."
battlefield3,37mps8,LacidOnex,3,Fri May 29 13:30:26 2015 UTC,"The problem is that being surpressed causes insane weapon spread and even if your sights are dead on the guy you still miss. It's really annoying to be killed by some noob just spraying with an LMG and you absolutely can't do a thing.  People don't have a problem with BF4 supression because it causes your weapon to sway which you can counter with skill. In BF3, your weapon handling skills don't matter- supression is supression."
battlefield3,37mps8,alsdjkhf,3,Fri May 29 14:04:28 2015 UTC,"you absolutely can't do a thing   No you can.  Get to cover, wait for it to tone down and shoot again.  It's exactly how the supression mechanic is intended IMO.  The BF4 supression messes with your spread aswell BTW, at least the one we're currently testing in the CTE. Still the concept applies, if you're getting supressed, you're not meant to be firing back, you're meant to get to cover."
battlefield3,37mps8,TK459,3,Fri May 29 16:06:31 2015 UTC,"OH dear lord no.... the random bullet spread while suppressed is totally fucked. I've lost far too many gun fights I had the upper hand in just because the guy I'm shooting at misses his first couple of rounds, and completely fucks up my accuracy. It rewards bad players and sometimes takes away from skill. It's seriously sometimes more beneficial to make your first couple rounds miss, then go on target, then it is to be accurate in the first place. If you're up against a player with bad aim, your first couple shots might be dead on, but his aren't and then you become suppressed and your bullets start going every BUT where your crosshairs are pointing. It's infuriating. I could have done with JUST the screen blur and that's it, but having my bullets fly in totally unpredictable directions? No, no no no."

Here's how to fix it.  Download this program. It's called DDu, Display Driver Uninstaller, and it uninstalls all your video card drivers.   Download DDU in the internet. Run DDU in safemode. Run the process, and then restart computer. Run CC cleaner to clean files. Run CC cleaner to fix registry. Install latest Catalyst drivers.   And your stutter problems should be practically nonexistent. Hope this helps.  Remember to run DDu in SAFE MODE. Then restart your computer after finishing finalizing DDu, and then run CCleaner to clean up your files and registry.   And always get the latest drivers from AMD's official website."

battlefield3,375a3g,-Navajo-,1 point,Wed May 27 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"Practice.....feel it  Aside from that,  there are small ways of keeping a general idea of your speed in 3rd person.   For vertical loops, the general idea is you want to brake when going towards the ground, and accelerate when going towards the sky. People use different patterns to do this best, but I find its best to: hold throttle up when your nose comes above the horizon. Then tap afterburner on & off as you go up, and let off when your camera flips. Once the camera flips, apply the brake, and let off the brake about a half a second, to a full second before the camera flips again at the bottom of your loop. Then repeat.   One thing you can also look for to tell if you're hittin the right speed, is as you go up, if you're at the right speed, you shouldn't be able to see your afterburners. If you can see the back of your jet while going up, you're at the wrong speed.  In horizontal turns, the best advice I can give is that most people make the mistake of trying to balance throttle up and brake to achieve the perfect speed. Well in horizontal turns, you only should use brakes. The jet speeds up automatically, and it gets going fast enough that you actually need to hit the brakes to slow down for the best horizontal turns. You can practice by just doing horizontal turns, and tapping the brake till you get the feel for it. Also you will see your jet turn faster. Its extremely noticable.  Once you do it enough, you'll start to just feel it and you don't have to think about it. Muscle memory and all that."

battlefield3,36zq7j,ThatAngryGnome,1 point,Sat May 23 18:32:22 2015 UTC,"As a dogfighter, I wouldn't say that though I get what you're trying to tell him. Speed control is very important but maneuvering is equally important. You movements need to be calculated and extremely precise in dogfights."
battlefield3,36zq7j,epsdude,4,Sun May 24 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"Thing is if you can get that 313 speed down, you can control the skies in many pubs where novices play on. Once you get your speed down can you move on to maneuvers like the rolling scissors.     Edit autocorrect sucks"
battlefield3,36zq7j,ThatAngryGnome,7,Sun May 24 05:46:30 2015 UTC,"Get really comfortable with your brake, throttle, and after burners. Keep your speed at ~313 when cornering for the best turn radius. Spot the enemy plane as soon as possible or put on air radar when you unlock it. Don't forget that you can look around the cock pit too. Lead your target then firing the cannon, and trust me the cannon puts in more work than the missiles. Fire it in bursts to avoid a jam/overheat. Use ECM to get off enemy radar. Be very patient when it turns into a circle - royale monitor your speed and keep looking at the radar for any openings. Always jump on it when they peel off it can give you a quick shot on their tail.  Edit: 313 not 325 darn it"
battlefield3,36zq7j,Glitched_Winter,2,Sat May 23 19:46:22 2015 UTC,I don't know if someone is spreading misinformation but the best speed for turning is 313 exactly.
battlefield3,36zq7j,plarm,1 point,Wed May 27 03:35:41 2015 UTC,You are correct but it's very difficult to maintain that speed exactly for new players. I always say ~325 when players are trying to learn. It's close enough to be effective and they won't crash or lose sight on target because they're focusing completely on speed. 313 is the best though.
battlefield3,36zq7j,Glitched_Winter,2,Wed May 27 10:47:31 2015 UTC,Bind spacebar to 'pull up'  Keep speed at 215 for turns (speed is shown at the top left of the cockpit HUD)  Keep turning to get behind people  Learn to do the same thing in 3rd person
battlefield3,36zq7j,thugroid,6,Sat May 23 15:22:55 2015 UTC,Keep speed at 215...   313 is maximum cornering speed. Also use ECM to hide you from radar - useful in dogfights.

battlefield3,36zq7j,the_mojonaut,3,Sat May 23 18:39:39 2015 UTC,"If you use ECM at the proper time, the opponent will not be able to see it. And by the time they do, they probably missed the switch and are on defense. Using ECM correctly is all about timing, and visualising what the other jet is able to see. You can use audio cue's like the woosh when your jets cross each other as a time when both of you can't see each other.   If used poorly, yes it can be easy to follow. But in high level dogfights especially, it's very useful."
battlefield3,36zq7j,-Navajo-,1 point,Sat May 23 19:45:10 2015 UTC,Whenever I dog fight I'm mainly looking at the radar. If it turns into a round about using ecm and dipping out is a good strategy to throw off the enemy pilot. If you do it quick enough and move in a different direction they shouldn't see the trail.
battlefield3,36zq7j,Glitched_Winter,5,Sat May 23 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"And if someone is chasing you in a dogfight, the only way to evade is flying in circles at 300 speed until you bore the fuck out of him. I'm not even kidding."

I love thinking of ways to counter the defenders and make an approach, gaining ground and taking the mcom. I hardly ever play without my friends and when we defend we soflam/javalen constantly. I'm normally engineer or recon because eliminating vehicles is a priority for me or having a beacon down for a better starting position."
battlefield3,36yctu,Thexer0,2,Sat May 23 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"A good top shelf rush game with evenly matched good teams is tremendous...you gotta have 2x tickets, since a good defense that stays on the bombs and revives always has the advantage...you need the double tickets to try to get enough waves to overrun any close defenders, then lock down the planted bomb.   On offense of course you've got your beacons and sensors in each squad, and obviously the recon knows to put the beacon down about 100m away outdoors facing the bomb. He's probably using a holo and an aka or something and will try to get the bomb. And of course, most of the medics are running smoke and have the timing down for a good me strain into any door.   I love good rush...watching a good team of defenders bend and rotate I response to what they see around them or on the map. Plus it's always good to probe and try to find the weakspot, and it's such a thrill when you finally manage to get in and get a plant and then cover it with your dying shots and grenades, and have the other attackers rush in just in time.   Conquest is just significantly less fun and less consistently enjoyable for me."

Because you were so slow, unless you had cover, a single man with a stinger could fire enough missiles to take you down before you got out of range.  It's really hard to balance AA for both choppers and jets because of their vastly different speeds."
battlefield3,36wuxl,ChristophColombo,5,Sat May 23 00:47:40 2015 UTC,The gunner used to have flares and below radar used to work against stigla's. Choppers used to be much easier.
battlefield3,36wuxl,HelIoMeow,3,Sat May 23 06:04:25 2015 UTC,Nah initially they were useless against choppers since they wouldn't lock on if you had the right perk and were flying glow. Once they nerfed that it was a slaughter.
battlefield3,36wuxl,FR05TB1T3,1 point,Sat May 23 03:51:53 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all, anyone who consistently uses jets quickly learns how to avoid ground based aa and if they are unopposed in the air they can have their way with the game. The bottom line is that bf3 is not sophisticated enough to accurately represent modern air combat, you might as well be piloting X-Wings from star wars already."
battlefield3,36wuxl,backporch4lyfe,5,Thu May 28 04:35:55 2015 UTC,"I thought PC jets were balanced, and that was the reason on console jets were so OP.  There are regular matches I will play on Caspian Border and Operation Firestorm where 90% of the deaths are due to a jet.  Especially when a two jet pilots regularly bombard the spawn destroying any AA, tanks, jeeps, helis, or jets. There is nothing you can do, unless an entire squad switches to stingers and fixates on a single jet, but the jet can easily fly far enough away to avoid the lock on. Now these same engineers have no firepower vs enemy ground vehicles that are dominating the rush/conquest game.  With only 12 players on each team, its hard to coordinate with people and get an engineer team to focus on.   No single factor except a good jet pilot, as far as I can tell in Battlefield 3, can throw an entire game towards one team, on its own. A single good jet pilot can destroy another team with impunity and help his incompetent teammates win. This destroys the entire teammate dynamic of the game, I think the power of jets would have been more acceptable if the pilot and gunner were separate, like in a chopper."
battlefield3,36wuxl,BerserkLemur,3,Sat May 23 03:22:47 2015 UTC,"Maybee... Idk, I like and hate how they balanced vehicles in bf3. They made them incredibly powerful, and their only counter (lock-ons) will only ward them off, basically making them less effective. If you use teamwork though, you can usually take them out. But if one air team is better than the other air team, then there usually is almost nothing that you can do to stop them... I'm not sure if they meant it to be this way, but the air vehicles are a bit too effective at a range... Like the reason why you can't take them down, is because  a heli can sit outside the stinger/igla's range and take them out. Same with the jet, except the jet can make strafes usually without any damage, if he doesn't over commit to it and ram into the ground, get smawed, etc....   TL;DR: The vehicles were just a tad bit too effective, without an effective counter I guess :/ kinda restating what you said, lol"
battlefield3,36wuxl,FROGxDELIVER,2,Tue May 26 13:58:09 2015 UTC,I just stopped playing maps with jets in them. They usually turn into a one sided baserape half way through anyway. And if you're not in a vehicle you spend the game just hiding from vehicles and snipers. No fun.
battlefield3,36wuxl,alsdjkhf,3,Sat May 23 05:58:32 2015 UTC,"Something, something teamwork. Who need's balance when you need twelve guys to take something down?  Sad they never finished with the tweaks. Someone wanna tell me why the 30mm cannons on the RU MAA is like shooting paintballs at dudes when the 20mm cannon on the F/A 18 will actually kill guys? Silliness abounds."
battlefield3,36wuxl,Sophocles5,-1,Fri May 22 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"If you need teamwork to take down someone who's working alone, that's not balanced."
battlefield3,36wuxl,alsdjkhf,4,Sat May 23 06:00:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not a jet pilot at all, but I've been in some servers with really effective jet pilots on the enemy team and it can be frustrating. Like epsdude said, it's all about teamwork. One lone guy trying to Stinger an enemy jet without the assistance of his team's jets or helicopter is not going to be very effective at all. That's honestly why I never play this game alone. I always make sure I have at least two other friends with me to play, but a full squad of four is of course preferred.  As infantry, I try to position my character so that the jet doesn't have a good angle on me, and hope I can RPG it if it makes a low enough pass. If I'm in a tank, I pray I have a repair guy and move my tank around while getting shot to make myself a harder target. Then, if I'm lucky enough to stay alive after one pass I will rep or even hop out and try to go for the RPG.  I guess you could get a whole squad of Stinger guys, but I hate the stinger/IGLA in this game anyway. It's sad that a squad of four enemies all spamming stingers in the middle of a field not playing the objective or capping flags can completely shut down a helicopter or jet team. I've always hated fire-and-forget missiles in this game and refuse to use them. I have over 2,900 kills with the SMAW and over 3,400 with the RPG. But you look at my Stinger/IGLA kills, I have less than 50 kills COMBINED between the two of them. I think they're for scrubs."
battlefield3,36wuxl,AlutaShade,1 point,Sat May 23 00:37:43 2015 UTC,For me it's only Rush jets that are unbalanced because they kill armour so quickly. I once killed 3 full health MBT's in one strafe run. That is ridiculous. The CQ jets feel weak in comparison but are only OP in the right hands.   They can easily be stopped by a decent jet/heli team on comms.
battlefield3,36wuxl,baddada77,0,Sat May 23 09:23:33 2015 UTC,i think that the counter for jets is supposed to be other jets.
battlefield3,36wuxl,DisproveRainbowDash,-4,Sat May 23 04:52:42 2015 UTC,We're not unstoppable. You only can't take down jet pilots due to lack of knowledge. Why don't you take a week to only fly jets and see what takes you down?
battlefield3,36wuxl,epsdude,6,Fri May 22 21:50:14 2015 UTC,"Well that's the thing though, any other vehicle has a weakness to at the very least another vehicle besides itself. That's what I'm talking about: rock, paper scissors. I'm not talking about unstopability, I'm talking balance. Tanks dominate the ground but are super vulnerable to aircraft, helicopters can dominate ground targets but are vulnerable to jets and, outside of TV missile spam, AA too. AA can kill helicopters up close and hold them at bay until a TV comes in, but tanks will annihilate an AA if the AA isn't careful. Jets can easily kill all three, same level of expertise with all four types and the jet will win, every. single. time.  I'm not the greatest, but what generally takes me down when I'm in a jet is other jets, I'd say the lion share of the time it's another aircraft. Sometimes I'm not careful and something like the stationary AA or the mobile AA gets me, but really because you need to be somewhat close for them to really get you, I can avoid it so long as I know where it is. Once the mobile AA is spotted it's just a matter of enough time to take it down, with rockets it's one good pass, though you need to make sure you're either at a solid enough angle or far enough away. Everything else is pretty much negligible once you're got enough time in, I'm not good enough to where I'm taking down every jet in the air so as to reduce how much they take me down, but it doesn't take long in a jet to slam the afterburners and flare away from a missile launch.  The hard counter for the jet should be the AA, AA guns should shred a jet, but they do limited damage compared to what the jet can deal out, unless it's pretty close, mostly because the AA's gun has a decent amont more spread than the jet's and there is nothing comparable to rockets. If a jet starts a rocket salvo out far enough the AA, especially the Russian AA, will have a hard time firing back and dealing comparable damage. If a jet lines up the dive from almost vertical the AA can't even fire back, and not even the full rocket salvo will disable the AA which basically means the jet wins because the choice is stay in and try to continue to hit while you die or get out and repair as the jet comes in for another pass.  Explain to me how it's balanced, the thing that's supposed to counter it takes more damage than it gives in a one on one fight. Combine that with there being two jets on conquest large and it's really asking a lot, two strafes with rockets and the AA is completely gone.  I've always said they're unbalanced and explained as much, but I've never had anyone who said they weren't explain to me how they weren't, especially when don't compare them in the bubble of jets and look at how other vehicles are balanced."
battlefield3,36wuxl,epsdude,4,Fri May 22 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"Jets can easily kill all three, same level of expertise with all four types and the jet will win, every. single. time.   This is simply not true. As a 200 star jet pilot, there are some helicopter teams out there that I simply cannot touch. No matter what angle I come in, what methods I try, how accurate I am, they win every time. A heli team that knows what they're doing just as much as the jet pilot does is a formidable force.  The thing is though, this game isn't a rock, paper, scissors game. This game is based on hierarchy. Air vehicles > land vehicles > infantry. What this causes is a necessity for teamwork. It's what Battlefield 3 is about and it's what wins games. I don't care how excellent of a dogfighter you are. If you're getting triple teamed by two jets and a helicopter, you will lose every time with almost no exception. It doesn't even take a triple team, I very often lose to people 2v1ing me as well. Through teamwork, you can take down any lonewolfer- anyone. All it takes is two jets, or a jet and a heli, or a squad of stingers, or an AA with a repairer, or soflam and javelin, etc. Don't expect to be able to take down a jet pilot who knows what he's doing all by yourself unless you have equal skill as him in an air vehicle."
battlefield3,36wuxl,baddada77,5,Fri May 22 23:09:46 2015 UTC,"When you bring in teamwork that counterbalances individual balance, of course. A squad of medics using PP-19s will probably do pretty well against a team of guys using more more effective weapons. Chopper teams like that are ultra rare these days on PC, You might see a guy that knows what he's doing with a TV missile, but I don't run into a chopper team doing voice chat in most of my games and I pretty much exclusively play conquest large now.  It's not a game based on hierarchy, it's a game of roles, there are roles for everything in the map, something isn't supposed to be out and out better than everything else in every scenario outside of being outnumbered. Please tell me what exactly is the sense in the mobile AA being relatively ineffective against aircraft in a straight up fight? It's called the anti-air but it's the third best option to take out aircraft? The MAA is always outnumbered, it should be able to at least hold its own against aircraft because the role is anti-air, it can't really take on ground targets and infantry, it's more locked into its role than anything else, yet it's not a the most viable option in its main role.  Also, AA with a repairer usually wont work too well, first of all it's a lone vehicle so no one is there to jump out and repair, and usually the splash damage from the rockets will kill the guy in a pass. It's what happens in the majority of the scenarios I've witnessed. Squad with stingers also usually doesn't work too well against jets as the speed and flares or ECM generally make it a moot point so long as you don't loiter over an area. They work well as a squad against choppers though."
battlefield3,36wuxl,epsdude,0,Fri May 22 23:37:20 2015 UTC,"If you have 200 Jet SS and ""there are some helicopter teams out there that I simply cannot touch"" then you simply aren't very good. The jet is top of the foodchain for a reason. If you can't kill heli's with it you are doing it wrong.  I am probably the best heli pilot still left playing on 360 yet I know there are easily 10-12 jet pilots on here that I stand zero chance against with a lowly chopper unless I have a friendly jet on my side. Top down attacks can be juked but only for so long, eventually they will get you if they're good enough."

battlefield3,36ykj1,Brady_The,6,Sat May 23 06:00:45 2015 UTC,"I just got recently back into playing BF3 after a long break, and can, from my point of view, say that nothing really has changed. There has never really been any team play. Of course there are exceptions, and if you meet and play with them it is just awesome to see how everything works out, but those are pretty rare.  In my opinion it is partly the games fault. It doesn't promote team play, it doesn't reward team play. You can do perfectly fine (however the player defines 'fine') without considering or incorporating what your team needs.  On top of that DICE provides the player with game mechanics (suppression, spawn protection) and weapons (M320, M320 LVG, etc) that doesn't make the player want to become better, to learn how to play and master the game, and instead actively invites people to play as cheap and inconsiderate as possible, and rewards them for doing so. Just join a 64 player No rules Metro server and you will see what I am talking about.  Battlefield 4 is worse in that regard, it's even more watered down and casualized. It's kind of sad, but I think that Battlefield would probably not be as successful as it is right now, if it would cater to people who are a little more competitive than the average player. Of course there are a lot of players who complain about the game(s), but that is still the minority, compared to the majority of players who is satisfies with fast and easy results.  I am not sure if Battlefield has a future, at least a Battlefield game I would like to play, a game that is a challenging and demanding. One can just hope.

battlefield3,36ykj1,FROGxDELIVER,2,Sat May 23 08:11:26 2015 UTC,"I think that's usually how a competitive match goes... Likeee, it usually is based on skill, but if one team can out-think the other, and they are on the same skill level, then you can come out on top. There is a large skill gap though, and it takes awhile to really understand how it all works... But if you want strategy, then finding a random public game is usually not going to be strategic at all, lol. Maybe it's the way that matchmaking is? Like if they had a way to make a skill based matchmaking of some sort, then maybe you would have more teamwork :/ idk... But asking for strategy in a random game usually will rarely work.

battlefield3,35rtp2,Lag-Switch,1 point,Wed May 13 02:02:52 2015 UTC,Either way it is still nice to get higher tickrates in Battlefield.    There has been some 60hz and 120hz test servers on the BF4 CTE recently.  Apparently the results are pretty good so far.

battlefield3,35rtp2,self_arrested,3,Wed May 13 03:04:46 2015 UTC,To get the full advantage out of 120hz you need to be playing at above 120fps on your game. Little gift from /r/GlobalOffensive
battlefield3,35rtp2,powback,1 point,Wed May 13 06:28:02 2015 UTC,Over two years im playing BF3 on 120hz monitors and SLI GTX780 and nearly one year since enjoying gaming on ASUS ROG Swift 144hz so i think im getting full advantage out of 120hz ;)
battlefield3,35rtp2,self_arrested,-2,Wed May 13 09:01:50 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about your monitors refresh rate I'm talking about the in game fps realistically you want it above 200 fps to get a real difference from the 120hz servers trust me it's been tested a hell of a lot on CS.
battlefield3,35rtp2,the_Ex_Lurker,1 point,Wed May 13 09:22:06 2015 UTC,He's got well over 120fps if he's using the same setup as me.
battlefield3,35rtp2,self_arrested,-5,Wed May 13 09:32:22 2015 UTC,In the video it clearly shows it below 110 fps
battlefield3,35rtp2,powback,1 point,Wed May 13 10:06:11 2015 UTC,"Probably since he's recording. But even if he weren't, his FPS is well above 60 so there would be a meaningful difference."
battlefield3,35rtp2,self_arrested,1 point,Mon May 18 00:39:04 2015 UTC,depending on what recording software you're using a different amount of fps can be expected to be lost if he's using shadowplay it's likely to be less than 10.  This however is vaguely irrelevant as you want to be getting well above 120 fps for the tickrate to properly sync with what your pc shows you. I was going to find a good video that explains it but it seems to have been lost to time.
battlefield3,35rtp2,self_arrested,0,Mon May 18 06:46:40 2015 UTC,"He's also recording though.   In either case, he should have over 120fps to get the most out of 120 tick servers."
battlefield3,35rtp2,IndependentNorm,-2,Wed May 13 10:11:41 2015 UTC,still you're looking for fps well above 120 fps to get the full benefit most people don't seem to realise that you're only going to get the FULL benefit with double the servers tickrate.

You know how you sometimes die after you've gotten behind cover? It's the tickrate. Jets and helicopters that explode shortly after you've hit them with an RPG? tickrate. With 120 messages per second, everything happens close to instantly for all clients.   VU also provides additional tools for server hosters. They can now enable/disable suppression and the blue tint. They can mod any map, any weapon, any mechanic, anything really. Soon you'll be able to actually create new weapons, vehicles(?), maps, characters, gamemodes, and so on.

Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda took credit for the attack and most likely carried out the attack.  As it turns out they were mostly operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan.    Also, you speak of another attack, but there isn't any evidence to suggest that another attack was coming, nor was it even possible given the stringent security measures implemented thereafter.  Another attack is just an assumption you are jumping to."

battlefield3,35j6z5,aChileanDude,1 point,Fri May 15 19:56:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's actually no proof that Saddam gassed the Kurds, no proof that they killed school children, and no proof that he has WMDs. Only accusations by US & NATO, and this is the basis of why we went to war that in no way threatened our freedom. Of course it's possible he did, but the only evidence there is is personal accounts from Kurds seeking asylum in Turkey at the time. No bodies, no video, no nothing.   On top of this Al-Qaeda was not very active in Iraq at the time, but predominantly in Afghanistan and Pakistan.   Everything you've mentioned is speculation and accusation only, which is not a very good argument to go to war. We did the same in Libya recently. Before we bombed the shit out of Libya it was one of the most stable & economically profitable countries in Africa...and actually won an award for humanitarianism...but we bombed em anyway and removed the ""bad man"" Gadaffi. No proof he killed his people. However, he didn't want to buy oil anymore using the dollar. hmmmm, that's convenient. So the US isn't very honest on why it invades based on my research.  And to both of you: If you really think a dude on dialysis, in a cave, coordinated an attack on the World Trade Center buildings with the use of 19 extremely inexperienced pilot hijackers that flew 2 planes into the towers and 1 plane into the pentagon, I suggest you look at both sides. These guys flew unmolested for over an hour in hijacked planes above the most heavily guarded country on this entire planet. After the towers came down (almost in near freefall) an office fire caused WTC building 7 to near perfectly freefall in it's own footprint as well. No.Fucking.Way."

battlefield3,35et8x,CookieDoughCooter,34,Sat May 9 17:33:03 2015 UTC,"More memorable maps: After 300+ hours in BF4 I still cannot find a map that I like. In BF3, I can name at least 5 that I love playing on (Grand Bazaar, Canals, Markaz Monolith, Epicenter, Armored Shield) and haven't gotten tired of.  TTK is just right for me: Hardline's TTK is a little too fast for me and BF4's is way too slow. Feels like I'm putting entire magazines into people to down them. In BF3, it feels like I can kill people quickly but everyone still has a little bit of time to react.  More balanced weapons: Okay this is debatable but I don't really think any gun is REALLY overpowered. A few come close (M16 and AEK for example), but I still have a fighting chance when going up against them. There are also very few severely underpowered/useless weapons in BF3. The RPK and the SVD are the only guns that come to mind when I think about bad weapons (I've mastered all primaries so I have a considerable amount of time with every gun), whereas I can think of a bunch when looking at BF4's and Hardline's weapon lists. Better visuals: Also highly debatable, but I honestly prefer 3's visual style to 4's or Hardline's. For instance the gun models in BF3 look fantastic IMO while they look kind of low-quality in 4 and HL. The maps in BF4 are also way too washed out for my tastes."
battlefield3,35et8x,cobrareaper,6,Sat May 9 19:51:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed on everything except weapons. BF4 has actually been pretty stable with weapon balance. There are no OP guns like there were in 3 (M16A3, AEK-971, M5K, SPAS, etc). however BF3 weapons had more variety and class.  The BIG problem with BF4 is the maps. They are all crap except Golmud Railway and i think Dawnbreaker has a little going for it."
battlefield3,35et8x,powerslave118,3,Sun May 10 06:22:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, BF4's weapons are nowhere near as overpowered as BF3's but my problem with 4's weapon balance was that there were WAY too many useless/underpowered weapons. Like I said, in BF3 once I got a feel for my weapon, I was comfortable using it and nothing really felt unreliable or just plain bad. BF4 on the other hand has a lot of weapons that are either overshadowed by similar weapons with better stats or aren't good at all (Norinco family, UMP-9, U-100 for example) when compared to other guns. Sure, you could argue that with over 100 weapons in the game, some are bound to be crappier than others, but look at Hardline. It has ~50 weapons, less than HALF of BF4's weapon count, but 90% of the weapons are just awful. And that's why I prefer BF3's balance over that of the other Battlefields'."
battlefield3,35et8x,cobrareaper,1 point,Sun May 10 07:22:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. Most maps in 4 are poor and I can't see what's going on in half of them, the shadows are too much. Also hard to differentiate between friend and enemy. Vehicles are also awful compared to 3. Weapons just don't feel RIGHT. The recoil on the 7.62 assault weapon judders the vision too much. 5.56 rifles feel like air rifles."

battlefield3,35et8x,njdevilsfan24,4,Sun May 10 04:30:40 2015 UTC,Which AR would you consider OP in BF4? I agree with everything you said other than that. AEK and M16 from BF3 are way better than anything in BF4.
battlefield3,35et8x,ODA157,3,Sat May 9 20:37:26 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't played BF4 in months (since Final Stand came out) so some weapons may have been nerfed, but I distinctly remember hating the AEK, Bulldog, and the ACE 23. The AEK wasn't as OP as in 3, but it still was a monster in close quarters (killing very quickly and rivaling PDWs; Assault rifles should NOT compete with those guns in CQB in my opinion). The Bulldog was fucked up because it had high damage and a relatively high ROF, basically the SCAR-H but better at almost everything. Those two should not go together. I think that the G3A3 in BF3 was a perfect example of how to balance a high damage AR. The ACE 23 was just  good at everything (M416 comes close but it's not as good). In terms of OP ARs, Hardline definitely takes the cake, though. The M16A3 and M416 are really messed up at the moment. They are both VERY good (high damage, high ROF, and almost no recoil) at both close and medium range, rendering the ARM and carbines useless. Visceral also nerfed the AKM in the last patch for no reason so it can no longer do as well against the two other good ARs.   NOTE: I define overpowered weapons as any gun in a specific class with superior stats to others, making it the best option and rendering the other guns almost useless, OR any gun in one class that can fill a role meant for a different class (like the AEK vs PDWs).That's why I picked these ARs from BF4."

With the 60+hz testing in CTE which may come to retail, we can really be looking forward to a snappy game.

battlefield3,35et8x,pavlik_enemy,9,Sun May 17 16:03:28 2015 UTC,"Incoming rant.    Really bad maps, especially with things like: - Excessive roofcamping on most vanilla maps. - AA can take out half the map from uncap. - Weird vehicle choices in maps where they can't even play to their best. The IFVs in Flood Zone were not fun to work with, and later on you get a boat which has even less use. - STILL not balanced for both teams on so many levels. Even the little things matter. On Resort, the Artillery tank always spawns facing the same way, so that its easier for one team to grab it than for the other. On Dawn, the sun rises above the spawn of one of the teams, making it difficult to see anyone in that direction. It goes on and on (sun above spawns was a big issue in BF3 as well, how did they not fix this). - Lockers. As if Metro wasn't enough.    Not a big fan of the battlepacks. The best shit always seems to come in last.    Now I'm a tanker, so the next few points may not apply to everbody: - The MBT LAW was NIGHTMARE at launch. They may have fixed it, I don't know or care. It was incredibly cheap to give every engineer a dumb fire-and-forget autolock thing. - The overall enormous increase in launchers and antivehicle equipment made life as a ground vehicle driver a nightmare. The list of counters vs ground armor doubled compared to BF3. SLAMS, UCAV (wtf), Rush jets on CQ maps, AC-130, 20 different launchers,  C4 on two classes, 4 vehicles with TV or something silly. - Critical hit immobilizes a vehicle. Dumbest idea ever. It means that one shot wrecks a tank as you cannot rotate anymore. - Smoke has been nerfed to hell. It doesn't obscure sight anymore. - Anything but AP is not viable as CM. - Shell drops to the ground like nobody's bussiness. - Map degradation due to explosives can make vehicle driving a nightmare, especially if mines are being placed in all those crates. The two flags near the houses on that big map (with the train.. forgot name) comes to mind. - Somehow my gun sounds.. plastic. It doesn't sound like a .50 cal anymore. Not as powerful. Minor nitpick, not a big deal.    Ugh. Worst 60 bucks I've spend on a game so far. It was unplayable at launch, after that I just didn't enjoy it. There were some good things, I admit. The ability to pick optics without having to gimp your CM was nice, and the fact that air could actually be killed by the Godtier-AA gun."

battlefield3,35et8x,dnw,3,Sun May 10 15:39:21 2015 UTC,"Better maps with distinct lanes. BF4 maps are too open and overly complex, even on infantry centric maps there are too many angles of exposure which leads to more randomness. There's nothing like Grand Bazaar, Strike at Karkand or Epicenter in BF4. Better ""net code"". It takes a reasonable amount of time to kill people and when you're shot at you have time to react. When I'm shot at in BF3 I can tell if it's a good player shooting at me or not while in BF4 it's always an instadeath. BF4 still has a bug with weird health changes."
battlefield3,35et8x,Rickster570,3,Tue May 12 02:14:25 2015 UTC,For me it's the fact I have BF4 on PS4 and have over 300 hours on it but only play with my cousin.

battlefield3,35ctom,WithTheWintersMight,5,Sat May 9 01:59:35 2015 UTC,"Reactive, smoke, and lmg/hmg (I prefer lmg but I'm on console, with a mouse and good accuracy hmg is, in theory, better). Lots of lock on weapons from infantry/tank/air so smoke will keep you alive longer.  Reactive cause it keeps you alive longer. Lmg/hmg cause c4 and follow up on infantry if you get splash damage. Guided (although certain maps are better for it like the start of Kharg rush) and zoom are a crutch. Canister means you have to alternate with your regular shell which means you can't react to infantry and armor at the same time."
battlefield3,35ctom,vonCrickety,2,Sat May 9 03:54:08 2015 UTC,"Haha,  zoom is a bit of a crutch, as a tool to make aiming easier. I initially equipped it to use on snipers on hilltops (firestorm, kharg) and I guess I've grown accustomed to always having it. Im starting to think autoloader is a bad decision as well, it seems like people overwhelmingly use reactive armor for the first slot."
battlefield3,35ctom,AlutaShade,5,Sat May 9 04:08:34 2015 UTC,"Well as a tanker, your threats don't include snipers on a mountain. So equipping zoom for that reason is silly. You need to focus on the enemy armor and Engineers/Support players. I personally run reactive, smoke, and HMG. LMG works better on infantry, but is very weak against vehicles. HMG does significantly more damage and doesn't ever overheat like LMG does. You just gotta make sure to burst-fire the HMG, because it becomes inaccurate after a few consecutive shots. So although it doesn't overheat and you'll be tempted to just hold down the trigger, burst-firing will give you better accuracy, especially against infantry.  Just make sure that when you spot an enemy tank, stop ""sprinting"" if you're already doing so. As someone mentioned below, if you full sprint at a tank they can one-shot disable you. So I always stop sprinting and either pillar a structure or start rotating my tank so they keep knocking off my reactive.  For smaller maps you can swap out smoke for thermal. It's pretty difficult on maps like Bazaar or Seine to get a good lock and line of sight with a javelin, so you can usually avoid them if you DO get locked by driving around a building. I personally don't think thermal is necessary on larger maps. I know people who swear by it simply because they can spot mines/C4 easier. But I never run thermal and I very rarely die by running over mines. Just constantly spam that spot button on the ground before you charge in to an objective, and it'll usually spot them for you."
battlefield3,35ctom,ChristophColombo,2,Sat May 9 15:09:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, reactive is pretty important.  If you play it right, you can take 4 shots with zero damage, but even negating one or two more or less eliminates the advantage of autoloader assuming equal accuracy."

battlefield3,35ctom,baddada77,1 point,Sat May 9 05:58:52 2015 UTC,"For Caspian, Kharg, Firestorm I use Reactive, Smoke and usually HMG. With the wider open spaces it's easier to see C4 coming meaning there is little need for proxy scan. Smoke is essential to counter javs and jets guided missiles. HMG is better than LMG as it has no cooldown yet I find LMG does often kill quicker. I flip flop between the two.  For city maps like Bazaar and Seine I run Proxy scan, Thermal and HMG/LMG. Javs/Guided isn't a problem because of all the cover you can use to block their shots. Dropping smoke means I can use thermal which I find essential on these maps.   I prefer Proxy scan because of the amount of CQB play and potential C4 danger. These setups work great for me personally."
battlefield3,35ctom,Thedutchjelle,1 point,Sat May 9 09:03:53 2015 UTC,"Reactive Armor, HMG, Smoke. RA is basically a free life against rear shots that normally would wreck you. It's also a poor-man's proximity, as the destroyed panel will give away where you were shot from. It can also defeat poor C4s, landmines, and poorly aimed TVs. HMG for the 100% accuracy on the first shots and the no overheat. It can kill infantry across the map if your aim is good and you got used to it. It can also hurt light/no armor vehicles, which LMG cannot. Smoke to stop locks, but also to hide oneself from the map and to confuse enemy tanks in tank-vs-tank combat by hiding and driving in and out of smokescreens. Zoom optics is dangerous because you give away your smoke. I haven't used it in months for that reason."

Canister is my goto against little birds and infantry.  LMG/HMG will down infantry, but canister shots are almost always OHK.  Against birds, canister gives a better chance at hitting them and you can sometimes shoot the pilot out.  My play style goes well with canister as I usually have a gunner with me.  If you're a solo tanker and like to get close, avoid using the canister."

battlefield3,35ctom,Godhand_Phemto,1 point,Mon May 11 06:49:50 2015 UTC,"Depends on what your fighting and how many crew members you have running with you. There is no perfect setup, you will have to change according to the situation, that is unless you run a full 3 man tank with each seat sharing different perks, then your ready for anything. Have the two other crew members run proximity and thermal camo and you can pick whatever else you want as the main driver to fit your style or the situation. Zoom, Thermal vision, and smoke all have their advantages."
battlefield3,35ctom,xsideofcenterx,1 point,Mon May 11 22:01:53 2015 UTC,Depends on the map really.

And this setup is ready to take on vehicles, infantry and even aircrafts.

battlefield3,35ctom,Drosev,1 point,Sat May 9 11:30:25 2015 UTC,they aren't two separate loadouts. When you are being a gunner for someone else driving run smoke so both driver and gunner can hop in the driver seat and pop smoke.

I've always seen that rifle as a high-powered one for longer range sniping, not more aggressive recon style. With a low ammo count and high hip-fire spread, it seems you would be better off with the SV98 or M40A5 (which I know was featured in this vid, but not as often as the M98B). The only thing the M98B really has over the other rifles is bullet travel speed, but that's trivial with the closer quarter situations you encounter on Metro."
battlefield3,35bf1b,AlutaShade,3,Fri May 8 20:12:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, yeah you're completely right, I just like how the M98B looks haha. But probably won't be using it too much on metro again for the reasons you stated."
battlefield3,35bf1b,WhiskeyMcQueer,3,Fri May 8 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly its the sound.  M98B and JNG90 are loud and feels good when you get headshots with them.  Also, M40A5 or SV98 are much quicker and feel lighter on the hand but they lack the punching power of M98."
battlefield3,35bf1b,WhiskeyMcQueer,2,Fri May 8 20:22:29 2015 UTC,"There's actually another issue that I forgot to mention. The 8x scope is much larger in proportion to the M40 than it is to the M98, I feel like my vision is being really obstructed when using it on the M40, so much that I want to keep switching back and forth to my sidearm just to be able to see properly, it's not an issue on the M98 due to it being larger, so kind of an interesting negative people may not have heard before."
battlefield3,35bf1b,AlutaShade,2,Fri May 8 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"In we're strictly talking about METRO, switch to 3.5 or 4x scopes.  Takes a while to getting used to, but you'll get used to it. No distance in a straight line is that far in Metro.  PLUS you won't get detected by the scope glint :D"
battlefield3,35bf1b,WhiskeyMcQueer,2,Fri May 8 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, 8x scope is definitely a bit much for a map like Metro. I've used an american holo on my JNG on smaller maps like Seine and had a blast. So OP, you should take this suggestion and try it out!"

You know that real small tunnel on Rush down in the subway? It's on your far right if you're attacking playing Rush, and on your far left if you're spawn trapping the American team. I fly my MAV right up in there just a few feet in, and that way it makes it difficult for the enemy to destroy it. Plus the MAV has a wider motion sensor range and can help pickup guys trying to take the middle tunnel as well.  The left side of the metro when spawn trapping the Americans is my main spot. Right side always has too many snipers, so I don't even fuck with it. Wayyyy too many head glitch spots for the American snipers to hide behind. Left side is fun if you stand inside one of the metro trains. You have a slim peak through the windows in to the spawn that makes the enemy hard to see or shoot you."

In fact, any time you lose on Rush defense with generally evenly skilled teams and personally have a sparkling KDR, you were a liability to your team and actively contributed to the loss, since you were taking up a team slot and were busy staying alive and getting kills around the edges or spawn instead of covering the bomb or dying defending it. There's obviously exceptions if you're vastly better than the players in the server, because you can run up exceptional numbers of kills while still defending properly and simply be overrun by sheer numbers. As a general rule though, fucking stay within 50m of the bomb or just don't bother playing rush.   This comment isn't directed at anyone or their stats in particular, more a general comment on the utility of judging somebody's KDR in a vacuum in an objective-first team-oriented game. Nothing bothers me more than people not trying to defend in rush and just taking every defense round as a loss, equating to a 1.0 W/L.

battlefield3,3563w8,TehNut,5,Thu May 7 22:19:16 2015 UTC,"Incase you don't want to or can't go to the site, here's their about page.   Venice Unleashed provides a liberated environment for the original Battlefield 3 game.  ""Liberated"" means that you're granted access to features of the game that were previously disabled or completely missing.  Here are just a few of those features:  Spectator Mode The spectator mode allows you to join a server as a spectator instead of as a player. You can roam around the map freely or follow a player in 1st or 3rd person, which makes detecting cheaters and filming cinematics much easier than it was before. Read more about the spectator mode here.  Private Server Hosting As opposed to the original game, we don't limit hosting to only a few providers. All users will be allowed to privately host dedicated servers. You can find out more about hosting in this post.  Advanced Configuration Options Things like the blue tint and the the blinding sun were something that annoyed players since the release of BF3. Now server hosters can finally turn those, and countless other options, off (or leave them enabled, it's all up to you!).  Mods and User-Generated Content A major part of Venice Unleashed will be user-generated content in the form of mods. You will be able to write custom gamemodes and game logic in the form of script extensions, as well as create entirely new content with Rime, our custom Frostbite editor. Read more here and here.  Multiple Soldiers Last but not least, we won't restrict you to only one soldier like in the original game. You can create multiple soldiers. Plus, resetting your stats will no longer be a premium-exclusive feature. Don't like your soldier anymore? Simply delete it!  Even though you will need to own a valid license for BF3, Venice Unleashed itself functions completely without any connection to EA - there's no risk of getting banned.  The project is supported by an ever-growing community that is eager to contribute as much as possible.  For this reason, we also have a community forum where you can exchange views on project-related topics, request help or suggest your ideas!  In order to benefit from the advantages of Venice Unleashed, you only need to create an account and download our client.  Oh, and have we mentioned that all of this is completely free?   http://veniceunleashed.net/about"

battlefield3,34vx42,fade1r,4,Tue May 5 00:19:54 2015 UTC,"I think I know what your problem is, Cod and BF are totally different types of shooters. Cod is more a twitch arena style shooter while BF is a more open, team oriented tactical shooter. My guess is you play bf like you do cod IE running around in the open trying to get as many kills as possible as quick as possible. The gun mechanics in bf have recoil, bullet spread, and bullet drop which makes running and gunning not the best option for play style in this game. You got to play bf like you would in real life, stick to cover, rely on teammates while also being a team player, choose your objectives or enemies carefully.  Here are a few more tips that helped me.   Stick to cover and always be aware of all possible angles where you're exposed to the enemy and try to limit that to as few as possible. This will prevent you from being killed by the guy you never saw. If you have the drop on someone, take calm steady shots, that way your shots are more accurate, usually your enemy wont be able to react in time before being killed so taking that one extra second or two is worth it. I started doing this because I noticed that I would get excited and just spam the trigger which resulted in me hitting the guy once and missing the follow up shot a lot.  Dont be a lone wolf. Like 70% of the bf community is guilty of this. BF gameplay is based on teamwork and when a team actually works together they are deadly. You need to stop worrying about your own kill count and focus on ensuring your team wins, this means spotting the enemy (No one does it because they fear kill stealing) I do it all the time, I dont care if some else kills the enemy I spotted, I spotted them because I wanted them dead, now they are, its a win win.  Play your class role. If you are support be sure to give ammo to the front line and set up choke points with your gadgets and LMG. If you are engi focus on vehicles. If you are assault, provide health packs and revivals to the front line or provide cover with smoke or use the smoke to push forward. Sniper gets their own bullet list. If you plays a Sniper, DO NOT go out to mountains and set up camp a thousand miles away from any objective, you killing those 5 guys in a 30 minute game doesnt help your team whatsoever! And no one cares you went 5/0. If your going to be that selfish at the very least set up a Soflam to help designate enemy vehicles.  Always take out the biggest threat first. And as someone already mentioned, look at your minimap, ALWAYS look at your minimap. And finally, dont worry about your K/D ratio too much, there have been plenty of matches where I made MVP while having the lowest kill count on my team. Just play the Objective and provide as much team support you can, the point is to get your team to win.    Hope these help you."

These rockets will not track enemy infantry, only ground vehicles (including mortars) and Recon equipment.""  However, the wiki completely failed to mention that jets apparently have this automatically built into the jet's rocket pods. It only talked about helicopters.  I've always figured the jets had guided rockets but I finally had to figure out for sure for myself tonight.

battlefield3,34o1ge,WithTheWintersMight,3,Sun May 3 04:14:15 2015 UTC,17000 tags?! Jesus.
battlefield3,34o1ge,EthanT65,4,Sun May 3 06:24:45 2015 UTC,"It's my most played game ever. Look up   ""i YOMOMA i"" gt for xbox. Most of those tags were obtained through Squadrush, but those servers are all but dead and gone. I could usually get atleast 5+ per match and matches were 5-8 minutes long. It adds up and my main motivation is shitting on other guys with egos and their 100* AEKS. Since HardCore SquadRush even back in 12 was only around 150 regulars I wash pretty hated. Never gonna find a game like that again. Battlefield 4 is garbage with the counter baloney. Damn I just realized I typed a book. Sorry, passion. If anyone is on xbox feel free to add, I haven't played in a while."
battlefield3,34o1ge,WithTheWintersMight,2,Sun May 3 06:31:17 2015 UTC,Heh the post isnt that long... and were all here because of our passion for the game!  I think one reason I dont have that many tags is because it usually backfires for me. The enemy moves at the last second or I simply slash instead of executing them. I usually just pull out my pistol and try to head shot them

I've gone on multiple killing sprees after stealing a enemy vehicle because they have one less asset to take me on with. Plus I love sneaking up on a dude repairing his tank and stand right behind them and as soon as hes done I knife him and steal it, then I drive off into the sunset with a freshly repaired tank.

We probably had a combined 3000 hours playing together and our chemistry was so good.  We all moved together to PC gaming but we split the games we played.

This mean significantly better netcode for BF3, especially the dying after running around a corner should be improved with this update that has always been aggrevating me in BF3. This update was introduced a few months ago to BF4 and I know I shouldn't say this in this sub but the netcode in BF4 is better than in BF3. It has been since a long time and DICE LA is still working on improving it even more.   Who knows, maybe we will eventually get another netcode update for BF3!"
battlefield3,342ybi,yerekdoung,12,Mon Apr 27 22:04:20 2015 UTC,It's not a cumulative total of headshots totalling 350m like some are suggesting here which would be similar to the Xbow headshot assignment.  It is one single headshot of 350m or more.  It was a long time ago but I got mine on Kharg sniping the shore from the carrier. You can use your distance from the MCOMS as a guideline. It took me ages to get because I was foolishly going for the ridge/mountain snipers for ages first. They are probably 500-600m away.   Good luck.
battlefield3,342ybi,baddada77,4,Tue Apr 28 06:34:41 2015 UTC,"Adding to this, I actually find it easier counter sniping those on the carrier. The snipers on the carrier are usually lay down with no cover. On the island you have cover and can move, while sniping those easy targets."

battlefield3,342ybi,_WarShrike_,1 point,Fri May 1 17:49:20 2015 UTC,Yes you are probably right. Better cover for the snipers on the shore. The disadvantage is not knowing the exact distance to your foe.

battlefield3,342ybi,firesigntheater,5,Tue Apr 28 01:17:41 2015 UTC,"Except that you do need to get a 350m headshot.  The 350m is not cumulative, despite what it shows in the progress bar(which is the longest headshot you've gotten as of yet with the L96)."
battlefield3,342ybi,js2k6,-2,Tue Apr 28 02:13:08 2015 UTC,Have a friend on chat and have them join the other team in MP. Go to the map with the big red and white antenna that everyone loves to take down. On the opposite side of the map from the antenna have your friend stand on one side of the map while you cheese the achievement. Only way I could get that one done.
battlefield3,34348f,luuter,4,Mon Apr 27 22:49:12 2015 UTC,"In addition to what epsdude said, before the dogfight begins the hornet has the advantage because the flanker is a bigger target. Before looping begins it is easier to get the kill on the giant flying targetboard that is the flanker. Also, during a dogfight, if the player in the hornet gets an angle on the flanker, it will be easier to take advantage of that angle for this reason."
battlefield3,34348f,Muncho4,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:36:22 2015 UTC,"Turning in jets/tanks on console is hella bad, that + the hornets tight turning makes it the far superior jet. It would be better if both teams had identical vehicles except they just looked different. Bf4 was even worse with the russian stealth jet but I think they patched it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwWmel3_VlE"
battlefield3,34348f,epsdude,5,Wed Apr 29 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"The hornet has a tighter turning radius than the flanker. However, you have just a little bit more wiggle room with your speed range in it as it needs to be in the 305-318 range as opposed to the hornet's 308-318 range. Speed control alone will not win you the dogfight when in the flanker, but if you know how, when, and where to maneuver, you will win almost every time.   Type 'dogfight' in the server browser and practice a bunch. I had a friend that could barely control his speed and knew nothing about manuevering (i.e. he loop spammed). Basically I could shoot him down within 15 seconds every time. I told him to join the dogfight server and practice. I saw him in that server almost every day for a month or two and when we finally had another dogfight, he was dead even with my skill level. Just practice more :)  I would suggest watching dogfight videos from the top pilots out there. Here are some of the channels I watch to critique my own flying style:  https://www.youtube.com/user/XMASSACRE831X/videos?sort=da&view=0&flow=grid (he's retired but if you sort the videos by oldest to newest you'll see all his BF3 dogfights. He is the #1 dogfighter in the US for PS3)  https://www.youtube.com/user/haimelik12345/videos (this guy was the number one dogfighter on PS3 before he moved to PC)  https://www.youtube.com/user/xAceNCombat9283x (he is one of the top US dogfighters on PS3)  https://www.youtube.com/user/GoldenDarknezz/videos (he is a fantastic dogfighter from PC)  https://www.youtube.com/user/DaKuIBiT/videos (a great dogfighter on both PS3 and PC)"

Of course, a mouse and keyboard is always superior in aiming, but you were talking about maneuvers, which just takes practice if you use a keyboard or not.   Although, if you aren't used to doing circles for like 15 minutes straight (which against someone on par with you, it will happen somtimes where neither of you can get an kill shot) you will feel like you have arthritis in your hands if you haven't practiced often xD"

I'll be on on my TheNoobCloset100 account.  EDIT: You need to set the max player count to 24 and the amount of players needed to start to 4 if you want the server to fill up.

The ace was literally baseraping the spawn where everything was destroyed. No kills for me.   Of course the dev's would never patch a 4 year old game, but if they wanted to they could fix it by minimizing the amount of ammo a jet could hold (requiring a landing and 30 seconds for reload) and buffing the shit our of spawn's anti aircraft gun."

If anyone with any basic cognitive abillity gets in the AA, no one in a jet is going to touch your base without at least getting disabled. Jet pilots are not indestructable gods- most of the time the other team is just too dumb to do anything about someone annihilating them from the air. In my best games in the jet I went 127-3 and 134-6; there weren't any stingers out in the field untill the very last few minutes.

battlefield3,333nte,AlutaShade,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:12:43 2015 UTC,"BF3 AA has longer range, and with reactive armor is much tankier. The LAV-AD is an absolute laser gun, but is a bigger target and gets stuck on just about everything. The Tunguska has slower bullet velocity, slower acceleration, and first-person screen shake, but is smaller, turns more quickly, and never gets stuck.   BF4 MAAs are all identical. They feel more like glass cannons with shorter range, much higher damage per shot at close range, and much less spread. BF4 AAs are also much more fragile with only APS to protect against hull damage."

Then, the greatest moment in the history of the battlefield unfolded. My teammates had been shot out of their Havoc. I'm playing in the hills of Caspian in my VDV Buggy and I see this all go down. Then something snaps inside of me and yells ""AAAH HELL NO."" I floor my machine of Russian glory across the fields. The Americans are repairing my fallen comrades Death Angel. The glorious Russian national anthem plays in my head. This is the only moment. This is it. The Buggy rears up for the greatest moment of it's life. I fly off of the hill when the helicopter takes off. Time slows.   The almighty Buggy squashes the puny Americans. With the helicopter under my mighty wheels, gravity takes it's role perfectly. The Havoc topples, the Buggy survives the blast of a million angry propellers. I drive off into the sunset as the round comes to an end. With this my friends, is where this tale ends, and many more begin.  TL;DR: Used VDV as a projectile of Anti-Aircraft majesty."

battlefield3,32ygf9,AlutaShade,5,Sat Apr 18 11:09:08 2015 UTC,"I remember when I first started playing on PC. I was relearning everything I had been taught on console and was trying to do the L85A2 assignment. I was playing SQDM on Strike at Karkand, and heard some fire coming from one of the smaller buildings. I peeked out from behind a wall and saw some muzzle flashes erupting from the building. It would be stupid of me to just run in there at my skill level, so I pulled out my trusty M320 and lobbed a grenade inside. I got one kill. I shot another grenade in just to be safe...and  killed the same guy. I figured that some other squadmate was reviving him, so I shot another grenade inside a little to the left and sure enough, I got a double kill. I guess I had weakened a support beam enough, because the building collapsed, and killed SIX people. I'm guessing their entire squad (there was a bug in SQDM that allowed more than 4 people to be in the same squad) was camping inside that building reviving each other over and over. I was so damn proud of myself after that. Unfortunately I had stopped recording early on in the match so I wasn't able to catch it on film. I really wished I hadn't stopped now."

Great he's out of rockets. He starts reping the tank, the. Starts frantically placing mines. The tank catches on, doesn't move, and the gunner takes him out. Well we're screwed right? Not if my 320 has anything to say about it. The gunner hops out to dispose of the mines, as he pulls out his RPG to shoot the mines, my 320 hits the ground, blowing the mines, the enemy engineer, and the tank.

It's hilarious when it happens, because your one missed shell (from their POV) can then one-hit-kill a tank.    Less awesome - but still useful - are finding out the odd angles at which you can shell things with a tank. For instance - If you're RU on Seine, you can shell the US tank as it passes by B point through the doorways. It's a 90 angle sideshot that can deal massive damage."
battlefield3,32ygf9,Thedutchjelle,1 point,Sun Apr 19 12:25:28 2015 UTC,You need to draw a map of this trajectory line.
battlefield3,32ygf9,Thedutchjelle,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:35:53 2015 UTC,"Here : http://imgur.com/lnAyc8u It's one of those things that once you see it, you wonder why you didn't think of it yourself. It's a maneuver I call the Seine Shuffle, and it only works for RU: First, get your minimap on large and zoom out a bit. This way you can see enemies + enemy tank behind point B if you're on the canalside. This is vital for lining up the shot. Shuffle/sidestrafe around the area indicated by the black arrows. You're less likely to get RPG'ed/Mortared since you'll be moving. Once you see the enemy tank moving past B towards the south-east corner, line up on the doorways and shell him through the B-doorways once he drives by. It takes a bit of practice to get the timing down (hence the minimap is important as you can see him coming if properly spotted) but you can get a sideshot in that can deal some nice damage.  Another good tip is this: If you see the enemy tank moving towards the righternmost alley, don't sit on C and trade shots. Use the canalside again across the river, and sprint forward and backward. Shell when you see him. He'll have to lead the shot and only sees you for the split second when you are in view of the alley, and you can simply shell the alleyway since he'll be too fat to miss.    Sorry if it's too long winded. I love tanking on this map :P It's all about outplaying the other tank by odd angles that they don't expect."

On almost every map there are buildings around flags that infantry cannot get to which is where I plant my MAV.  The enemy usually go crazy looking for it which also takes a few guys out of the action as well.  Also, flanking is an underrated skill.  You can't believe how much damage a squad can do in rush behind the opposing spawn point running around with suppressed weapons.

As a result of this correct recon usage and my sparkling abilities as a medic with the G3A3 and AN94 I'm something like top 20 globally on my platform for objective per minute. Even before the bf3stats.com database wipes over the last couple years, I was top 0-1% for as long as I recall.   I really like to PTFO. In summary, to improve at PTFO you must PTFO."

I'm finally able to get into a tank and try and get out of the spawn and I'm instantly being circled by the two attack helis, I desperately fire off a shot on one as he strafes down raining rocket pods on me, and boom take that sonofa bitch out, but here's the other one right on top me of again and my tank is at like 20% so I just instinctively jump out, switch to RPG and throw up a prayer at the other incoming heli.  BOOM!  and just like that I took out 2 attack helis within a few seconds of each other.  Probably my greatest achievement in BF3."

I was playing with a buddy of mine and I decided to only go for kills with C4. We holed up in the building at Charlie on the second floor. First I blew the wall out to get a good view of incoming baddies. I then tossed out an ammo crate to begin my infinite supply of rage cakes. The next ten minutes of my life seemed like an eternity. One kill after another. I lobbed those little bastards out the hole in the wall as fast as I could. It was amazing. Double kills? Triple? Quads? No fuck that. I was getting 6-7 kills at a time at some points. This went on for about 10-15 minutes and for that short time, I was invincible.  ...then the screen went black.  What? No. It can't be?! BANNED!  The admin messaged me saying that I was camping(well, he wasn't wrong) and in very colourful language, that I was...a faggot.   My favorite bf3 moment. I think I got 30+ kills before they kicked me."

As for awesome moments, I have too many fucking hours, and I have had so much fun with this game it's hard to get just one moment, so I'll give you my best ""awesome when that happens"" moments. Because most of these have happened more than once.  Getting 100+ kills with <10 deaths in one game. ""Triple digit kills, single digit deaths.""  Clearing a room of 3 or more guys with the REX.  The adrenaline rush when you manage to sneak past the enemy team during a spawn kill on metro, and get a beacon on the far side of the map.  Hitting choppers with the TV missle.  Hitting jets with the TV missle.  Hitting players who try to bail from their jet with the nose of my jet.  2v2 attack heli pro fights  1v1 pro dogfight servers  RPGing jets and heli's  Winning gun master after joining late  Sniping C4 off an enemy Jihad Jeep.  Rubble drop multikills  Running up to a tank pretending to have c4, then hoping they get scared and jump out so I can jump in and drive away.  Dunno, I like this game."

battlefield3,32tpax,Dynomite333,5,Thu Apr 16 18:03:33 2015 UTC,That's extremely low for a tank shell

battlefield3,32tpax,highfiveanorphan,2,Sun Apr 19 12:28:38 2015 UTC,That's the only one I saw but I'm sure it's comparable... it's pretty good if you use the map and flags as points of reference to target things further away.
battlefield3,32tpax,AlutaShade,3,Sun Apr 19 15:29:07 2015 UTC,Both the SMAW and RPG shoot initially at 40 m/s and accelerate to 100 m/s after some short amount of time.  I'm unsure of any differences beyond that between the two.

I prefer 200% ticket count, but 300% is the most I'll do. I don't have too big of an issue with kicks, although like 5 of my favorite servers within the last couple months have started having badmins in it that kick/ban.

I go behind the lines and place a beacon in a building with a roof that is close to a target, but a little out of the way. (having a roof prevents the parachute drops)  Placing a TUGS near a contested point really helps my team out, then I go on a sniper hunt. All the while my squad is appearing on the enemies flank seemingly out of nowhere and they have a tugs sensor giving them an edge. I love it."

Ohh and it should go without saying but ALWAYS use the Cover perk when playing with boltactions."
battlefield3,32gvvd,Valhalla_I_Am_Coming,2,Tue Apr 14 19:09:26 2015 UTC,"It is a recon class, not a sniper class. Reconnaissance, which means gathering intel on the enemy's whereabouts, this is best done with mavs and tugs and not sitting back and sniping. If you are closer to the enemy a pdw is much more useful than a bolt action, so use it."

battlefield3,32gvvd,ThisIsMyFifthAccount,2,Mon Apr 13 18:43:53 2015 UTC,"Spawn beacons are criminally underrated...hide it near the most contested or furthest flag in CQ; parachute over all the defenders in rush to plant, or put it between the bombs to keep your whole squad near the bombs on D at all time. Sensors are handy if you play with a map, or easily replaced with Xbow to let you get around the level as you need by making jokes w c4 bolt. So flam can be handy but usually doesn't last long.   Just roll with iron sights, or pansy out and use the all-class guns. Arguably the best class for pure objective play when used correctly (mainly due to the beacon)"
battlefield3,32gvvd,ThisIsMyFifthAccount,0,Mon Apr 13 18:50:37 2015 UTC,Than its not really sniping
battlefield3,32gvvd,EstebanEscobar,2,Tue Apr 14 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"*then  You can't be aggressive recon AND snipe...its contradictory.   If you're recon and sniping the whole round from 100+ m away from the bomb, even if you're only trying to watch the bomb you aren't being aggressive or objective-focused, you're playing TDM (and wasting a slot in the server by playing the wrong game mode). If the sniper manages to kill a guy planting, he'll just come back and lay on the other side of the bomb or use smoke.   If you correctly play aggressive recon and focus on the objectives, you can use a high x scope, but you're just making it harder on yourself and making for a less effective recon by using a scope. There's no right way to play the class, but certain game modes suffer more relative to others when it comes to too many idiots sitting back with a scope. Take that shit to death match...even if you're getting awesome kills and k/d and claim you're only looking at the objective from your perch back in spawn, because it's an objective mode you would be incredibly more useful being closer to the bomb, keeping your squad there, sensor in the bomb, or just a different class on the bomb. The key to aggression and winning is the objective. I believe you were inquiring about how to play aggressive recon?"
battlefield3,32gvvd,EpicLives7,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:57:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what aggressive recon means. The tugs, beacon and mav can be useful for your team. Use them wisely.   When I go aggressive recon I go silent, P90 suppressed, cobra RDS. Or SKS suppressed. M9 suppressed as sidearm."
battlefield3,32gvvd,EpicLives7,2,Thu Apr 16 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"I have recently started playing aggressive recon more often. It works very well when you manage to get a spawn beacon where the enemy won't look for it. A good build I have found to perform reliably is an M98B with M145 scope (3.4x), a straight pull bolt and a silencer. It is often strong enough to 1-shot over about 75 metres. It is also often worth considering whether to run a T-UGS or a XBOW (Scan Bolt), depending on the map. It is a very entertaining way to play."
battlefield3,32gvvd,FROGxDELIVER,-1,Tue Apr 14 04:13:14 2015 UTC,"What is the point of so low scopes ? In bc2 i was doing pretty well with x12 scope, here I use more x7/8 but i dont see the point of going even lower."

Run with an semi auto sniper with low optics (I prefer the laser that is the SKS with a holo, very spammable accurate shots), smg (I prefer p90 for the mag size), or shotgun (I use spaz slugs as they can drop people at all ranges once you get the accuracy and drop down, great for linear cq maps like bazaar and metro)."

battlefield3,31xpiy,Onn-Sight,2,Fri Apr 10 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"Considering all the Recons weapons rely on accuracy and there is this notorious mechanic called suppression which adds random bullet deviation,i think it's fair to say that Recon kinda sucks.  And the gadgets surely don't help.I mean yeah the MAV and Tugs can be useful for certain situations and modes.(Rush comes to my mind)  But they are more designed for a defensive playstyle,which obv doesn't mean you can't try to use them offensively.  And that you as Recon have literally nothing to damage vehicles how little it may be is tremendous.  Back in previos Battlefields Recons had C4 and motion balls which encouraged a more agressive playstyle and in BF 3 Recons are more meant to be those camping annoyances.  Ohh and it is also a crying shame that they now longer have Ghillie suits since they looked absolutely badass. Again all just my opinion"
battlefield3,31xpiy,coldberserk,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:08:22 2015 UTC,i would agree with you in some way since i also liked the ghillie suits and the fact that you could have C4 with you and motion balls but you can still play bf3 and be agressive with Recon i do it all the time sometimes i get even better scores then i would had with Assault this is an exemple !(4KDR using M40A5) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thWT56RMHxI  but still i get your point for most players Recon is  a weak choice.

You really don't see much of this at all. Most players are happy just sticking with their one gun for each class and not trying out anything else. And for the amount of hours you have played, that makes it even more impressive to me. And you're keeping your KD at a solid 2.0! I could use more players like you on my friend's list. If you wanna add me on PS3, I have a buddy who runs a server and I'm an admin in there. He streams about 5x a week on Twitch as well and I'm always accompanying him. You can find his channel here.  I've definitely got you beat though, although I have over 1100hrs more play time haha. I've got 83/87 guns at 500+ kills and, as well as the C4, claymores, and AT Mines. I also have 41 weapons at 1000+ kills. After I mastered all my guns I got bored and decided to challenge myself to shoot for 10ss instead of just 5ss haha. The only mastery dogtags I know I'll never get are for the Javelin, IGLA, and Stinger. I don't even have either of those at 100 kills yet. Other than that I've got the laser designtaion mastery tag to achieve, and the Mortat mastery tag (which will take a long while since you need 750 kills instead of the usual 500 because DICE logic). You can check out my stats here. I also sent you a friend req on Battlelog because I respect players like you <3"

I've played BF3 ever since release, have over 2,000hrs played, am #36 in the world on PS3 for RPG kills at 31ss, and #40 with the SMAW at 27ss. I know how to use the rocket launchers in the game and am very good with leading and accounting for drop-off. But I cannot tell you how many times I lead a chopper or jet perfectly and don't get a kill. I just KNOW that if that same shot was to be performed on PC, I would have gotten the kill. I've heard the rockets travel faster on PC, and that it mostly all comes down to the difference in netcode between PC and console, but it's still so frustrating.  But regardless, definitely jizzed my pants watching this video and I thought the music selection was great. Nice sound, not too loud, and I liked the pace of it. So don't listen to the haters ;)"
battlefield3,31p1l5,AlutaShade,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:23:31 2015 UTC,"yeah having played a good bit on console i know exactly what you mean.  even on pc though, there is a lot of factors that go into it - namely ping. i play on the same server constantly with a fairly reliable internet connection. normally, i hate listening to people talking about ping advantages, but with rpg's and jets, you need to have a sub 50 ping otherwise it's just going to be luck. overtime i've found that, especially in these videos, the rpg's actually make contact with the jet visually if i have a lower ping. when you play on a server with a ping of 150+ you will miss on your end, but the server you are playing on will consider it a hit - giving you some very strange visuals (which is what i assume you are referring to in this video). so yeah, a lot of it comes down to luck in that scenario, and if i was playing on console the majority of these shots would never have happened, mostly because it's harder to make quick movements though."

battlefield3,31p1l5,BATTLE_TOADS_,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:08:04 2015 UTC,"well, low ping will always help - like i've previously said. other than that, line up your shots with the rocket trail and learn to predict their speed. in addition to that... take every shot. you might miss a lot, but its worth it when you hit the one you weren't ever supposed to hit."
battlefield3,31p1l5,BATTLE_TOADS_,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:42:34 2015 UTC,but how do you know where to predict where they are going to be when your rocket hits?
battlefield3,31p1l5,rocketrockets,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:44:08 2015 UTC,that's just going to come with experience. it's much easier on rush jets that are preoccupied with ground targets - you'll have a lot more shots and will be able to predict their strafes a lot better.

EA support couldn't resolve it. Fixed it by installing it back on C as well as fully reinstalling windows a few months later.

battlefield3,31ddt0,KRSFive,-1,Sat Apr 4 17:58:12 2015 UTC,Nope. I have seen that done with Support guys and LMGs though. I'd rather have 1 scrub with an average assault rifle and paddles than 3 level hundy Snipers.
battlefield3,31ddt0,derpmcderp82,2,Sat Apr 4 21:56:43 2015 UTC,"Rather than just downvote, Id like to open up a conversation with you. Recon players offer many positives, mainly due to their ability to detect enemies (MAV or the other one, Im kinda drink so I cant remember the other one- the three pronged one you place on the ground. While the function of a recon player doesnt usually contribute to CQ play, a good sniper can just repeatedly headshot people trying to arm the mcom. And as far as your comment about disarming, alot of times im equipped with something like the g13 which in good hands/luck can be a headshot machine, and take out at least 2-3 people which is a huge help in rush. Not sure if that makes sense cuz im hella intoxicated but whatever"
battlefield3,31ddt0,derpmcderp82,2,Sun Apr 5 09:06:00 2015 UTC,"Its a good conversation that should be had.   I agree, there is a place for the Recon, it's just not a guy up in the hills with a 12x rifle.   I have several Recon service stars, and here are my general thoughts:  A recon, in any game mode, contributes much more to PTFO with a shotty/SMG/DMR in that close to medium range than a sniper. Why? His unlock implacements (spawn beacon, TUGS, SOFLAM) will be of much more value. While he is actively attacking or defending, his kits are providing support to the team.   His beacon gets his team in the battle faster. His TUGS let's his team know where the baddies are at, and his SOFLAM keeps tanks and choppers ineffective.   It bugs me to no end having guys on my squad be bush wookies. If my team is down, I will literally spawn to a recon with an LMG, and start hosing him with unsuppressed fire. This does two thing's; it bugs the shit out of the sniper, and it puts us in the mini map for the opposing team to kill.   In summary, unless the recon is a level 100 shit bucket going 50 and 0, he contributes much more to the team as a newb assaulter with paddles."
battlefield3,31ddt0,LucaTheCat,2,Sun Apr 5 19:01:31 2015 UTC,I beg to differ. Recon is my top class and it's effective both with sniping and with running a carbine loadout. Just depends on the situation.
battlefield3,31ddt0,Phase--2,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:17:52 2015 UTC,"Its a statistical asterisk when a recon is combat effective in almost every game mode when trying to snipe.

battlefield3,31ddt0,CivEZ,11,Sat Apr 4 12:57:35 2015 UTC,"It's like when I'm guarding one MCOM, by myself for the most part, and everyone is basically killing the bottleneck.

It doesn't occur to them to effectively place claymore and motion sensor traps near both of them and place yourselves tactically.

I'm more infantry based, but I do know how to fly a chopper and I'm a decent gunner (but am awful at TVs). I guess with my style of flying, I'm a lot more aggressive. I usually fly solo, but when I have a gunner I still don't do much hovering. I also run thermal on my gunner perk and not zoom cause I'm use to being piloted by players who are more aggressive and up-close."

Rather than repair and get taken out I rolled up on a small hill to get some extra elevation and took out the heli with a main gun tank shot from the other side of the map.
