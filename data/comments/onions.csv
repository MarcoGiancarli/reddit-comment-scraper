onions,3drm7d,AccioMotherfucker,4,Sat Jul 18 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"By default, the Tor Browser disables the disk cache. However, there is still a risk that content in the memory cache may be flushed to on-disk swap. Unfortunately, I don't know how large the risk is.  As others said, Tails is strictly RAM-only; no information is saved to disk, and everything is lost after a reboot.  I don't judge you based on the content you read on Tor, but if you access some certain, particularly illegal content on Tor (e.g. CP), then you can be deanonymized by targeted attacks, especially if javascript/plugins are enabled."

However, there are countermeasures that you can use (e.g. full disk encryption, disk wiping, etc). It is also quite unlikely that you will ever be targeted by this kind of attack; no one cares if you look at images of drugs, dicks, etc. However, if you access some certain illegal content on Tor (e.g. CP), then you can be targeted."

onions,3dkvtq,amber102,2,Tue Jul 21 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"I guess these sites require java script lowered?   Not necessarily. Their goal might not be to de-anonymize users, but rather to get users to send them bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.

Are there easy ways to identify honeypot or scam sites?   Unfortunately, not reliably. For the type of ""money pit"" scam sites like I describe above, the best indicator would probably be that they don't use any kind of reputable, third-party escrow/arbiter (or Bitcoin multi-sig wallets) for payments to ensure product or service delivery and maintain the possibility of refunds.  Of course, there's always the adage, ""if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"" - and it's a very useful one, on the dark net or elsewhere.  Another option is to not try to identify which sites are fraudulent, but rather which sites are not - and there are some good resources for doing this, like /r/DarkNetMarkets and their market ""superlist"" (note that the superlist may include some sites that are not necessarily completely trustworthy), Deep Dot Web [that's an .onion link], https://gwern.net and others."

The federal government developed (or more honestly stole/copied/pirated) a tool.  This tool is like a gun, they point it at someone (anyone who logged into the site) and pull the trigger and then this tool identified the user.  Seems pretty simple and on it's face it seems ""ok they got a bunch of kiddie touchers everyone cheer!!""  The precedent here is that they are not calling this tool hacking, even though that definition would surely change in any trial of someone using an identical tool against someone else, a company, or the government.    The scariest part of the precident is this.  When LE applies for a search warrant they have to be very specific about exactly what they are looking for, where they believe it is, and why they believe it's there.  According to the article LE took control of this server and used this tool on every user that logged into the site over a 2 week period.  The type of investigation that the exploit does absolutely requires a search warrant and by the nature of the Tor network and how the exploit they utilize operates, there is no way for them to legally and honestly apply for a search warrant because they are looking for identifying information contained inside of the computer the user is operating, but they have no idea where that computer is located.  So this precedent allows LE to circumvent the ""where"" of a search warrant, but we're ok with that because they're only targeting child porn...at the moment that we know of/they're admitting to."

If you just look at the onions as a static arrangement of sites and data, the sites are all anonymous and the routing provides indirect access to everything.   2 big problems show up:   A. Content can expose the author or host or affiliates or admins. Use of specific words or phrases or references to news or world events from a consistent perspective can provide enough hints   B. As nodes come and go, the mesh routes will adjust. These adjustments can be monitored over time to expose which ISP is running the servers hosting a hidden service. Since law enforcement figured this out, they run lots of nodes that they can use to track and isolate services.   Good luck and be safe."
