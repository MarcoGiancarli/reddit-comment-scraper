LiverpoolFC,3e2791,ScoutingGod,15,Tue Jul 21 11:38:56 2015 UTC,I want less fans so I don't have to fight to the death for football tickets at home.
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,JimmyRust,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:51:02 2015 UTC,wouldn't be an issue if they just made a new stadium instead of adding on to anfield.
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,TravisKOP,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:45:30 2015 UTC,it's not that hard if you have a membership
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,redfurby,5,Tue Jul 21 13:18:04 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have to pay for the chance of maybe getting a ticket
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,willgeld,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:39:09 2015 UTC,well it's better than giving it all to general sale
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,redfurby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:14 2015 UTC,How so?
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,willgeld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"Because then it's so easy for any randomer to grab a ticket, I feel like membership helps keep it in the hands of fans much more than general sale does. The £25 for membership is a bit annoying but still it makes it somewhat easier to get tickets still"
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,redfurby,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"I have a membership and missed out on everything in this first round of tickets. Cup matches were pretty easy for me to get hold of last season, but league games are a pain in the arse."

LiverpoolFC,3e2791,smthompson,81,Tue Jul 21 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"Dunno find this makes us look bitter, sure MCFC might have no history but history has to be built from something."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,ejpayne,58,Tue Jul 21 12:03:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, City have a long history, they're an old club, arguably even older than us. They don't have a winning history though, in comparison to us."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,Ged_UK,21,Tue Jul 21 12:36:31 2015 UTC,"so it's pretty understandable that many many international fans (who only support winning clubs) wouldn't support City. Lfc has fans from the past 5 years, 35 years, and 50 years. You'd be hell bent to find an international fan who's supported City for more than 10 years. If Liverpool didn't have any success we wouldn't have any international fans either."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,Kingdariush,24,Tue Jul 21 12:47:39 2015 UTC,"I know, just pointing out its wrong to say they have no history. They have a long and proud history, just not a winning one."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,Ged_UK,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:34 2015 UTC,They had a long and depressing history of failure aside from a brief period in the 60's/70's until they got lucky with Arab oil money. I lived in Manchester for 30 years and had to hear all the woes from friends/colleagues. City had the most pessimistic and negative fans around....I stress had.

LiverpoolFC,3e2791,htb24,49,Tue Jul 21 18:16:32 2015 UTC,This is dumb and just perpetuates the stereotype that we are smug for no reason. I'd rather have two league titles in the past four years than a myriad of fans in Australia/Asia.
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,JayCartwright,21,Tue Jul 21 13:44:04 2015 UTC,Don't let other clubs fans brainwash you into thinking being proud of your history and fan base is dumb. Of course we'd all prefer titles but don't just act as if we are the same as Tottenham in terms of the size of the club
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,TheGazzed,6,Tue Jul 21 11:48:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not acting that way at all. I absolutely think history is important and should be remembered and revered. But I also think that Liverpool's romanticism about it has let it get the best of them at times, especially in recent years. The club exists to win trophies, right? Our history is full of them but we haven't won one in 4 years and a major one in 9."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,JayCartwright,5,Tue Jul 21 12:48:25 2015 UTC,So what's the alternative?  It's not like the club hasn't been desperate for a league title. They're playing financial catch up because of some bad decisions and notably incredibly bad owners that nearly sent the club into administration.
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,TyrannosuarezRex,2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"But I also think that Liverpool's romanticism about it has let it get the best of them at times, especially in recent years.   This is often repeated by opposing fans and pundits, but I cannot fathom how anyone can make a case that this has impacted the club negatively in any way at all in the past decade. Do people think decisions are made based on history that actually affect things? Fans don't run the club. You could maybe say that the redevelopment of Anfield is one such decision (appropriately so), but do people genuinely think that's the wrong decision? I'd say it's easily arguable that it's not only not wrong, but that it's definitely right."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,trasofsunnyvale,3,Tue Jul 21 14:51:51 2015 UTC,"The romanticism is part of the reason I like being a Liverpool fan. Winning is great, but it's not the only thing that sport is about."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,fieldsofanfieldroad,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, romanticism is what draws the right kind of fans who will support the club no matter what. Winning is also great for drawing fans, and many end up being devoted supporters. But if a person is drawn to Liverpool because of the culture, history and pedigree, they are more likely to stick around even when things are tough. And those are the type of supporters that every club would be proud to have."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,trasofsunnyvale,3,Tue Jul 21 18:42:15 2015 UTC,I'd rather have two titles in the past four years then fans anywhere if it's my club.

LiverpoolFC,3e2791,Longtime_lurker2,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:06 2015 UTC,"Titles come and go, reputation is much harder to build and thus much more valuable."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,siriusgrey,17,Tue Jul 21 14:03:41 2015 UTC,"A title hasn't ""come and gone"" for us in 25 years. History is great but at the end of the day, it's just that, history. We need to make some new history."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,JayCartwright,0,Tue Jul 21 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I really think the reason  LFC has waned somewhat is simply being massively unlucky with owners.   FSG and Brendan Rodgers have shown a real vision in getting back to winning ways, and I think we won't have long to wait before being a top 4 club"
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,siriusgrey,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:56:01 2015 UTC,"We already are a top 4 club as proved the season before last. Last year was just an aberration with all the new signings, injuries and unrest with Suarez leaving."

Not because of the players coming. But the comrades of kopites from all around Indonesia, all with the same love towards the club. I made a lot of friends and meet a lot of nice people.   One fans drove on a bike from Aceh to Jakarta! For those who don't know, Aceh is in a different island from Jakarta! And there was a bloke who broke his leg on the trip, when he come and the gate are still closed the fans pressured the management to open the gate just for him. As he's climbing the stairs, all the fans on that gate sung YNWA. Needless to say he bursts into tears. Moving stuff.  Having a fanbase like City is shit. No way I'm trading our fanbase for anything."

LiverpoolFC,3e2791,Saul93,-16,Tue Jul 21 19:31:08 2015 UTC,It's just a bit cringey. Think most English people would agree with me.
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,randomPH1L,6,Tue Jul 21 12:34:52 2015 UTC,"I think you'd be very wrong. Xenophobic comment at best to say it's cringe our club has foreign fans.  It helps the club financially to have a loyal following. If we only had Liverpool based or even England only based fans we'd not be where we are.  Foreign fans at times can be fickle and swap teams based on players, but nevertheless in the BUSINESS that is football they are an absolute necessity so yeah we can brag about if we choose to, it shows we still have appeal and that IS important."
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,POPAccount,3,Tue Jul 21 12:45:23 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with xenophobia. It is the fact that we are celebrating having more foreign fans over the fact that City is currently a more successful club than we are.  It makes us look bitter Little reported fact:  Sterling scored within three minutes in his City debut
LiverpoolFC,3e2791,RedRoss91,3,Tue Jul 21 12:48:29 2015 UTC,"Haha, thought the exact same thing. Are we better than them because more people in Australia support Liverpool than Man City?

LiverpoolFC,3e2qk4,AnotherPoshBrit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:50 2015 UTC,He is in a good moment.
LiverpoolFC,3e2qk4,DovreHeimen,11,Tue Jul 21 19:10:36 2015 UTC,I've actually played against him.
LiverpoolFC,3e2qk4,thebluediablo,27,Tue Jul 21 15:19:26 2015 UTC,What he smells like?
LiverpoolFC,3e2qk4,Rofl_Crab,6,Tue Jul 21 15:55:29 2015 UTC,Asking the important questions.
LiverpoolFC,3e2qk4,DovreHeimen,5,Tue Jul 21 17:16:06 2015 UTC,"Can't remember, It was 3 years ago."
LiverpoolFC,3e2qk4,DovreHeimen,5,Tue Jul 21 15:58:55 2015 UTC,"On a scale of 1-Can, how was his hair?"
LiverpoolFC,3e2qk4,TweetPoster,3,Tue Jul 21 18:45:29 2015 UTC,What level do you play at?
LiverpoolFC,3e2qk4,DatJazz,3,Tue Jul 21 16:05:37 2015 UTC,I was 16 when i played against him so it was youth teams
LiverpoolFC,3e2qk4,szlafarski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:52 2015 UTC,But he is 16 now. You played against him when he was 13 years old?
LiverpoolFC,3e2qk4,l_chayim_fatass,9,Tue Jul 21 16:21:56 2015 UTC,He is born 1998 and I am born 1996. I played against him in a tournament and he played with boys two years older than him. I also went to the same school as him so I knew who he was.  Edit: Ajer is 17 btw

LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,Lolkac,21,Tue Jul 21 14:43:30 2015 UTC,"Mental to see just how hard Suarez worked on improving his football all the time. Wonder who in the squad now carries that mentality as well. Henderson would be my guess, vastly improved over the last two years."
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,DeadorRed,12,Tue Jul 21 15:06:40 2015 UTC,Also surprising that Suarez had never worked on his fitness in a gym prior to joining LFC
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,rakehand,7,Tue Jul 21 15:09:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly, wonder what they're doing over in Ajax for fitness. Surely they have something in place."
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,DeadorRed,8,Tue Jul 21 15:11:16 2015 UTC,he said in his book they sometimes went on treasure hunts.
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,fluffyguffy,5,Tue Jul 21 15:15:58 2015 UTC,"Is this real? If so that's top, there must be a video somewhere of this."
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,DeadorRed,15,Tue Jul 21 15:24:12 2015 UTC,"hahaha, imagine it. Suarez shithousing his competitors for the treasure."
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,WarrenByrne,10,Tue Jul 21 15:42:20 2015 UTC,"Ibe as well! There's been quite a few recounts of him staying after practice for extra assistance, as well as cutting breaks short to come in and train."
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,EmreCanPuns,6,Tue Jul 21 15:39:46 2015 UTC,I remember in January when Countinho was taking after practice shooting drills. Look how that paid off!
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,DeadorRed,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:02 2015 UTC,Is the Countinho thing intentional at this point? Count-inho?  I don't get it but I've seen it lately both here and on /r/soccer
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,rakehand,6,Tue Jul 21 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"My wife and I can't believe how much better Henderson is playing right now. His long passing has improved and the speed in his close quarters decision making has gone up as his ability to make the passes has as well. We were thinking it was the confidence boost of being the captain, but now I suspect he has been working like a mad man.  Either way, I am so pleased with what I am seeing this pre-season."
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,Z0idberg_MD,3,Tue Jul 21 15:38:47 2015 UTC,He is the one player I always think that you can clearly see how much he wants not only himself to be successful but the club as well. I love it.
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,DeadorRed,14,Tue Jul 21 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"So basically, Suarez learned the benefits of working in the gym and then blossomed.   The part about Gerrard. I feel like whenever you hear about a truly great player, that is what you hear. Unbelievable talent paired with incredible attention to detail results in a legend."
LiverpoolFC,3e2r2h,pramirez184,10,Tue Jul 21 15:08:54 2015 UTC,Really cool article and awesome insight into Suarez training habits. Talent is one thing but working at it can take you to the next level. That ferocity he had is a big part of what makes him my favorite ever LFC player. Just look at the celebrations against Everton and Zenit after that free kick. That's the kind of player I want playing for my club.
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,ivc09,80,Tue Jul 21 14:20:46 2015 UTC,I see what he is getting at but the problem isn't him leaving but rather that the fans feel he severely disrespected the club in the manner he left.
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,DeadorRed,6,Tue Jul 21 14:27:15 2015 UTC,Personally I feel like the response to a player leaving who disrespected the club is just ignore them.  We don't care what Ivanovic does do we?  Well I don't care what Sterling does anymore either.  He has nothing to do with my club.
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,paulopallo,6,Tue Jul 21 17:49:55 2015 UTC,I care what Ivanovic does.

LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Sheyi_Ojo,10,Tue Jul 21 15:33:22 2015 UTC,could tell him to go easy steady.   FTFY
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,willgeld,4,Tue Jul 21 15:36:48 2015 UTC,His agent is employed by him though.
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Dandyintheunderworld,54,Tue Jul 21 15:45:28 2015 UTC,To be fair he's experienced what it's like to be known as Golden Boy and then see his career start to collapse. I doubt he would wish that on someone else
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,fluffyguffy,5,Tue Jul 21 16:03:54 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. If anyone knows how it feels it's Balo.
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Bambooshka,37,Tue Jul 21 14:23:39 2015 UTC,"I dont see what the big deal is?  From his perspective as a fellow professional he is just wishing another professional good luck. Don't see an issue with it.  Asking him for us as fans to support him though, fuck that."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,podpool3,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"""He gave everything for this club.""  Fuck no he didn't.  And the people he he thinks this is a great answer to is us. I have no problem with Balo sending him a text message, congratulating him, but I feel like this is just a stab at Liverpool fans, who have good reason to be pissed at Sterling for acting like a twat."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,fiskebollen,19,Tue Jul 21 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"Up till maybe the last two months I think he did, and even during that last period I don't think it was far off despite his drop in form. On the pitch Sterling was a professional and unfortunately off the field issues lead to his departure. Lets not blind ourselves to the reality that he was a fantastic player and idol to many of us for twoish years."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,ALExM2442,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:51 2015 UTC,"On the pitch Sterling was a professional and unfortunately off the field issues lead to his departure.   I really don't get where this division sits in your head were professionalism is only measured with on field play. How you conduct yourself during negotiations, abiding by the terms of your contract, negotiating fairly and in good faith, engaging in off field behaviour that avoids impugning your contractual partners and their reputation, etc. are all part of being a professional."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,The_Nameless_Mist,-9,Tue Jul 21 14:56:25 2015 UTC,"Ridiculous to say that Raheem Sterling ""gave everything"" for the club. It suggests doing something more than what you're paid so well to do. To sacrifice something."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,fiskebollen,6,Tue Jul 21 17:26:04 2015 UTC,So you're saying NO player gives everything for their club? Every player does what they're paid for.
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,StevenAlonso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:13 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he could say that Stevie and Agger sacrificed for the club, in that they put their relationship with Liverpool ahead of moves that would have benefited themselves immensely. But I'd agree that you are right that his standard of sacrifice is too high."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,trasofsunnyvale,9,Tue Jul 21 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"I mean he was a super work horse last season, played more minutes and games than anyone. He did play hard as shit and hustles these past 2 seasons. I think he did, what he did off the field shouldn't affect the great level of play he had on the field. Other than his last 5 games, Balo is right on this"
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Kingdariush,-6,Tue Jul 21 19:17:49 2015 UTC,Last five games? I sincerely believe he was shit in just about every game after christmas. But that's neither here or there. You cannot possible think that Raheem Sterling gave everything for Liverpool FC?
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,fiskebollen,11,Tue Jul 21 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"lol ok. What more in your eyes should he have done? Scored more? Has more asissts? Ran more? Played more games? I don't know what else at this stage in his career he could have done more on the field. Bring up what you want from off the field, but on the field he ran harder this season than Coutinho, Gerrard, and Henderson. Don't forget about the previous season too. What more did you want him to do ON THE FIELD? His job is not to score goals, he's a winger not a striker"
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Kingdariush,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:29 2015 UTC,He should of fucked his agent off and listened to Brendan Rodgers when him and his agent where leaking things about the club and his contract agreements .
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Scouse_biscuit_ynwa,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:33 2015 UTC,I specifically bolded on the field for this reason lol. Just read what I wrote
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Kingdariush,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the measure of professionalism isn't just your on field play, is it?"
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,The_Nameless_Mist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:46 2015 UTC,"No it's not, but nobody is talking about his professionalism. Myself and Balotelli were solely talking about him on the field. Lord! You guys have a serious problem admitting he played well"
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Kingdariush,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, he played well, definitely. Not 49M worth, by any stretch, but well.  My main point, though is that limiting your inquiry to just his on field play is a bit artificial, because success or failure at a club is so much more than simply on field play these days."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,The_Nameless_Mist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:48 2015 UTC,"I personally take it more as Balotelli speaking out against abusive fans in general. He has been a target of them constantly, even here, so I understand his cause. That being said, Raheem was treated very well by Liverpool fans, and didn't reciprocate at the end of his time here. YNWA is not a one-way street, and those that respect the club are respected by the club and its fans."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,trasofsunnyvale,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:00 2015 UTC,From his perspective as a fellow professional he is just wishing another professional good luck   They have cards for that.
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,hazybrigade,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:16:55 2015 UTC,"Tell me a  big figure who knows what are club is about that has wished him well and told us to keep supporting him ? Not 1 carragher said it made him sick to his stomach, Gerrard said Henderson is on a different scale to raheem , he's just put a pic up saying doing what I love to do best , why not do that his first day back to pre-season ? , ballotelli knows fuck all about the Liverpool family obviously with tweets like that ."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Scouse_biscuit_ynwa,10,Tue Jul 21 18:11:39 2015 UTC,Showing a bit of wisdom beyond his years
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,knockedstew204,19,Tue Jul 21 16:33:10 2015 UTC,"Overreactions everywhere. He was clearly friends with Sterling, he's expressing support. Just because he plays for us doesn't mean he has to have exactly the same opinion on everything as the fans do."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,TheMysteriousShadow,10,Tue Jul 21 15:43:27 2015 UTC,He's just looking out for him as a fellow pro and friend dunno why everyone's getting pissy at him.
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,willgeld,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:11 2015 UTC,A professional wouldn't ask his own fans to support a player from a different club

Cmon mate bury ur head will ye , staying off the subject would be professional he's making  a rod for his own back , as I said who else has told the fans to support sterling ??? He orcastrated his own move even worse than Torres did and if Suarez wouldn't of givin the club another season he would be seen in the same light so do me a favour mate and don't u be daft ."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Scouse_biscuit_ynwa,7,Tue Jul 21 17:00:55 2015 UTC,He blew him a kiss ;)

LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,scorgie,4,Tue Jul 21 14:36:09 2015 UTC,"Who doesn't like Mario Balotelli, doesn't like himself, the best guy ever! The guy has faced so much abuse throughout his career and if anyone knows how it feels like to be abused it's Mario. He probably feels sorry for Sterling and I understand his need to show his support and stand into his defence. And those fans who are directing abuse to them are just miserable human beings and should just hide under their rocks."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Noemi2222,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:59 2015 UTC,He's just looking out for him and wishing a former team-mate luck. You have to remember that Sterling is only 20 - to face so much criticism at such an early age must be having a tremendously negative effect on him mentally. I hate how Sterling left but it's a nice gesture from Balo IMO
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,haroshinka,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:17 2015 UTC,Ewwww that font!   KILL IT!

LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,ricardogce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:47 2015 UTC,Balotelli's online persona seems so harmless compared to his on field persona.

People who are disrespectful to the club and its fans will not be supported after they leave. Balo can't just me like ""YNWA tho, rite???"" when Raheem forces a move and his agent shits all over Liverpool publicly."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,trasofsunnyvale,0,Tue Jul 21 18:16:21 2015 UTC,I don't know why he has to get involved ...
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Sifan69,32,Tue Jul 21 19:13:30 2015 UTC,Maybe they formed a friendship?   They're people too. Balotelli also knows what it's like to be hounded by the media at every opportunity.
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,thrillerv,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"He's asking people to support a player for a different team , justify that please friend of no friend , what happened to being PROFESSIONAL."
LiverpoolFC,3e2o8a,Scouse_biscuit_ynwa,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:21 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't, or well I wouldn't. But justifying why he'd do that is quite simple with a little perspective. He's a friend, friends support each other, which is all he's doing. He's been a long time victim of the media & seeing a friend go through that probably brings strong feelings from him. That's all that's going on."

LiverpoolFC,3e3nvb,PureElitism,8,Tue Jul 21 18:39:02 2015 UTC,Throw in a ban as well. Would Evra ban count too? I'd also like to see Assists compared. Dude was a fucking beast
LiverpoolFC,3e3nvb,dennisoa,6,Tue Jul 21 18:45:40 2015 UTC,"Aguero hasn't had that big of time on the pitch neither really but I know what use r saying a whole season less is impressive, die like to see the goals per minutes on the pitch ."
LiverpoolFC,3e3nvb,Scouse_biscuit_ynwa,2,Tue Jul 21 18:49:12 2015 UTC,Suarez has had multiple bans as well. And during the end of the 13/14 season I remember he slowed down a bit. He went insane that season
LiverpoolFC,3e3nvb,braflis,3,Tue Jul 21 18:56:40 2015 UTC,Sturridge would be up there too if not for injuries.
LiverpoolFC,3e3nvb,wanson,10,Tue Jul 21 18:45:31 2015 UTC,"That's what really gets to me. Imagine this season we have Sturridge and Benteke both firing on all cylinders. And then you throw in Danny Ings, Origi, Couthinho and Firmino chipping in a few. Holy shit...just the possibilities. Honestly, if it all clicks, it's scary."
LiverpoolFC,3e3nvb,freelemons,3,Tue Jul 21 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"Depends on the formation we end up playing. Putting Benteke and Sturridge up front together means either playing the diamond or a 4-3-3 with Sturridge on the right. Either way it means one of Firmino or Coutinho can't play at the same time, unless you play Coutinho deeper as a central midfielder. Which means dropping Milner or Can.  Good problems to have :)"
LiverpoolFC,3e3nvb,wanson,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:55:43 2015 UTC,Milner/Can rotation at DM?

LiverpoolFC,3e3nvb,ianpanz,3,Tue Jul 21 19:21:42 2015 UTC,And on top of it all think about the quality of the clubs each other player plays for and the service they receive (all due respect to AVFC)

LiverpoolFC,3e2b9j,ctp95,4,Tue Jul 21 12:34:21 2015 UTC,He could offer a big boost if he comes back just after Christmas. There are so many games in December and early January that any solid addition to the squad would be really welcome. He's as good on the right as he is on the left so I think he could offer a welcome break to Clyne/Moreno/Gomez at a crucial part of the season.

While you are right that he will be a solid addition when he does get back, I don't think we should expect too much of him too soon."

Natural fullback, would love to see him get back to the top level. Him and Gomez would solidify our defense for years to come (Maybe Ilori/Wisdom/Lloyd Jones in the Center of the park too)."
LiverpoolFC,3e2b9j,yobroyobro,0,Tue Jul 21 14:51:29 2015 UTC,Anyone saying they don't know how he'll fit or that he won't get another chance or that he's even the new Kelly are just retarded. He was easily the biggest surprise player of the 13-14 season. He has loads of potential and can easily become a Kop legend. And it is worth mentioning he can probably displace Moreno when fully fit and can probably even slide into the middle of the park when Skrtel ends up leaving in the future. Even in the meantime I would take a healthy Flanno and Skrtel/Sakho combo over Lovren and I still think Lovren and come good. I just love the passion and energy Flanno brings to our team. We were sorely missing it last season.
LiverpoolFC,3e2b9j,oscarony,0,Tue Jul 21 14:57:37 2015 UTC,Best new so far this summer imo would be positive updates on Flanno and Studge's rehabilitation

He seems like a good prospect and could be of help as a squad player this year. He seems as a player who would do well if he forms a partnership with someone else, and this is something which could take time as he is honestly our fourth pick striker.   I am looking forward to seeing him play, but will reserve judgment till next season, don't expect too much of an impact this year, and honestly if his goals are what Liverpool lack, then we have much bigger problems staring us in the face."
LiverpoolFC,3e25r3,Unrealmach,3,Tue Jul 21 11:25:40 2015 UTC,Yeah he really got hyped up after the World Cup. I mean he did have a very good tournament. He'll definitely benefit here with less of a spot light and an impact sub role for the first couple of months.

LiverpoolFC,3e2ztj,DeadorRed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:25 2015 UTC,"I wonder, the way the fan base has been slating Sterling mildly reminds me of when Torres left, although not this bad. If Torres had gone to another non-EPL European top team I think most fans would have still supported him and loved to see his highlights. TBF though he didn't have many highlights after leaving ;)"
LiverpoolFC,3e2ztj,pnvpratik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:07 2015 UTC,"There is the other side to this as well..  The hate post.   I dont like all the hate posts of sterling / city as well.    He is gone,  we got good money for him..   Lets not be bitter.  Move on..  The  best way to do that is to do be the supportive and knowledgeable fans to our current crop of players."
LiverpoolFC,3e2ztj,willgeld,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"Don't mind Gerrard goals etc but we don't need Galaxy match threads, line ups, team news and highlights, nor do I want to see every pass and tackle he makes."
LiverpoolFC,3e2ztj,TheBlackSheepBoy,12,Tue Jul 21 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"I come to this sub for material regarding Liverpool Football Club. If I want to see how Sterling is doing, I'll go to a MCFC blog. I'll watch the occasional Gerrard highlight, sure, but by and large I want my /r/liverpoolfc content to be about Liverpool FC."
LiverpoolFC,3e2ztj,BroyRodgson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:36 2015 UTC,"Suarez dragged us through the mud many times though. So many times that it's weird how people choose to forget it. The club also dragged it self through the mud too like when the players had those Suarez T-shirts. It clearly took some time before he started to respect the club. He did contribute a hell of a lot and was outstanding on the pitch, but the things he did off it (and sometimes on it) were pretty damn disgusting at times.  To answer your question I think it's okay to post about former players as long as LFC is the content of the post."
LiverpoolFC,3e2ztj,BroyRodgson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"I agree suarez went through a dangerous period where he couldve been villainous to a degree worse than torres had he moved to aresenal, but what we've seen since that time and since he has moved on is nothing but love for the club and former players. That is why suarez is more accepted here i think. also because he scored a shite load of goals for us and basically dragged us back to the CL and damn near the title.   But i agree, if it doesnt have to do with LFC i would rather not see it. the hard part is distinguishing what actually has to do with LFC. Gerrard for exmaple, pretty much everything and anything he does will be posted here. If suarez scores a goal we will probably reminisce about him a bit. When it comes to sterling, for a player so young to take on the club when he has accomplished so little, asking for absorbent money.. It isn't hard to see why at least some of the sub would rather not see him at all."
LiverpoolFC,3e2ztj,hazybrigade,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:01 2015 UTC,"also because he scored a shite load of goals for us and basically dragged us back to the CL and damn near the title.   That's why and the fact that he became the third best player in the world. The Arsenal flirt, Ivanovic bite and Evra incident were things that harmed our reputation. I don't think I've ever seen our club handle a situation as bad as they did with the Evra case. It's not all on Suarez, but he was the instigator of the whole ordeal.  I will only read articles on their time here and things like that. Or community work, opinion on our current team and so on. Obviously I won't read about players who left in a storm of negativity, and I doubt anyone else who supports the club would."
LiverpoolFC,3e2ztj,SirDowns,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:14 2015 UTC,"I won't read about players who left in a storm of negativity, and I doubt anyone else who supports the club would   that is why I am struggling to comprehend why sterling articles and such keep being posted incessantly. Honestly I don't want to see anything thing about sterling unless it is him attempting to make an apology or make amends, but i know that is extremely unlikely, so i am more leaning towards seeing none of him on here."
LiverpoolFC,3e2ztj,wanson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"The players wore those shirts before anyone actually knew what happened. And still nobody knows as there's no audio evidence. And he was convicted on the ground of not having enough evidence to support the fact he didn't abuse him. Obviously the FA isn't the court so expecting any standard of decency is a bit much.  Other than that, he redeemed him self by having a semblance of humanity about him. Raheem is just a spoiled child with a chicken nugget for a head."

Leading to more ppl asking and posting about sterling  Just recently a thread posted where some guy asked if we were all just ignoring sterlings debut when there's been probably 10 or so threads about it in the last two hours.   I'm just trying to raise awareness that this sub does not want to see shit about sterling, good or bad."
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,apdanklol,7,Tue Jul 21 13:24:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for linking this. May not be about Liverpool but it is interesting and worth the read.
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,fotw8,5,Tue Jul 21 13:50:26 2015 UTC,Really interesting. I'll love to know what kind of data are key performance indicators and the bit about injury prevention is the future as well
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,baconstyle,3,Tue Jul 21 13:36:11 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely. I really liked the sports science bits in the article. Would be cool to have some more transparency into Liverpool's training regiment.
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,Crippled_Giraffe,3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much the different leagues and sports talk to each other about this stuff.   Chip Kelly has brought a new regiment with him to the Eagles and are among the best in the NFL now in terms of games lost due to injury. Each player gets his own personal regime from the trainer as in what stretches they do, how much rest, and nutrition. It's pretty interesting stuff."
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,baconstyle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, we implement some personal regimes as well. I remembered Brendan speaking about Gerrard's regime, saying that older players need more time to recover as well as Sturridge's regime ( can't remember the exact reason)"
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,Griffin_Lo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:57:24 2015 UTC,sturridge's regime is missing 3/4 of a season to recover
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,marlybarrow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:10 2015 UTC,"I believe sturridge gets extra rest days after matches because his fast twitch muscles need it to replenish their stores of energy and not get injured (lel).  Also it's regimen, not regiment."
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,lord_schadenfreude,3,Tue Jul 21 18:40:18 2015 UTC,Great article
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,chief_boom,4,Tue Jul 21 14:18:39 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't mind LFC doing the same, staying in UK to prepare for the new season rather than jetsetting throughout Asia. Cannot be that good training, playing then flying through many different timezones."
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,Sifan69,-23,Tue Jul 21 14:37:15 2015 UTC,"Shut, I thought I'd come into the Liverpool reddit forum"
LiverpoolFC,3e2hoy,koptimism,8,Tue Jul 21 13:27:10 2015 UTC,"Given how much Garry Monk will have been influenced by Rodgers' management, it's not a stretch to recognise that some of this is hugely relevant to Liverpool.  Monk's focus on the group and on accountability matches Rodgers' focus on the group and his 'CORE' acronym.   Monk working on teaching the team how to high press as a coordinated group, and then teaching lower levels of pressing? Same thing Rodgers is doing at Liverpool.  I imagine we've also got similar performance tracking equipment.."

LiverpoolFC,3e2lyy,LiverpoolMad,3,Tue Jul 21 14:02:02 2015 UTC,"This Is Anfield had Milner and Gomez flipped. I think Empire got this list (more) right. Gomez has been very good, don't get me wrong. However, I think that he has stood out more because of the surprise of how good he's actually been. There were very little expectations for him and he's smashed them over the course of pre-season thus far. That said, I'm very excited to see how he does this season and where/how he fits in.  With Milner, we knew exactly what we were getting and he's been every bit as advertised."
LiverpoolFC,3e2lyy,Prahaaa,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"I went to the game last night and I have to say for me Gomez performed better than Milner. Milner's first touch seemed to be off on a couple occasions which led to loss of possession and counterattacks. Also he was lucky to not get called offside for the goal. Gomez was just fantastic to watch though - fast, strong, skillful."
LiverpoolFC,3e2lyy,NikeGS,4,Tue Jul 21 18:08:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that's fair.
LiverpoolFC,3e2lyy,AnotherPoshBrit,4,Tue Jul 21 15:18:41 2015 UTC,We've played 3 games against mediocre opposition. Let's not get too carried away.
LiverpoolFC,3e2lyy,wanson,3,Tue Jul 21 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"Because we signed him on a Bosman, Manchester City essentially gave us £49m plus James Milner for Raheem Sterling this summer    That logic."
LiverpoolFC,3e2lyy,MrBald,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:01 2015 UTC,"Damn, I only just realised pretty much all of our best players in pre-season are English, Danny Ings has been decent as well."
LiverpoolFC,3e3n7v,j913r,5,Tue Jul 21 18:28:51 2015 UTC,I read this as Watford and was really impressed for a second.
LiverpoolFC,3e3n7v,Alfiedog100,5,Tue Jul 21 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"Goals from Jack Dunn, Ryan McLaughlin, Sergi Canos, Sam Hart, and two from Samed Yesil (Yesil also had a pen saved)"
LiverpoolFC,3e3n7v,rakehand,3,Tue Jul 21 18:38:07 2015 UTC,That defending was dire.  This seems like one of those matches when the keeper makes 20 saves and still allows 6 goals.
