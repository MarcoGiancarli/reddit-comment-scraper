letsplay,3e5wih,Kyotanaka,2,Wed Jul 22 05:03:11 2015 UTC,"My tip is to just practice. Whenever you're not recording, commentate the games in your head or outloud.  You could start streaming a smaller game and see if you can pull people in. Have chats with the people that talk to you and try to talk about anything when it comes to the game. Talk about life and how it relates (Or doesn't). The sky is really the limit there.  It also depends on the game, some games are much harder to commentate over than others.  If that's your only problem? Seriously, you'll get better if you just keep trying and practicing until it comes naturally.  As for everything else that comes with the Let's Playing, like SEO, techincal editing and audio capturing and all that jazz; there's a wiki in the side bar! :D"

letsplay,3e4yci,Zaradas,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:26:24 2015 UTC,"Rendering is basicly ""finishing"" the video. Saving it as a video file. Converting everything so you can play it.  The preview is basicly ""live"" rendering your video while it plays. Rendering puts a lot of stress on your computer, so if yours isn't the best, the preview will be laggy and the final rendering process can take a while.  For the preview, try turning down the quality of the preview window if possible. Or if you just want to watch a few second you can only render those, but that is not something you want to do very often."
letsplay,3e4yci,TheCamPlays,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:40:13 2015 UTC,"In your case, you can head into your sequence settings and change the preview resolution, and rendering won't take as much time. My pre-edit rendering usually takes around 30-40 minutes at a preview resolution of 640x360. That way you can edit at a smaller resolution for smoother playback, then export your final video at the quality you need."

letsplay,3e4yci,-amiibo-,0,Wed Jul 22 03:31:44 2015 UTC,"As a followup, everything I am finding on it is talking about the compression. Adobe Premiere uses compression as well unless you're keeping it in it's raw format. My videos are about 1 gigabyte per minute, and after I compress about 1 gigabyte per 5 minutes.   So yes, technically there would be quality loss in that, but I am not finding anything that supports that there is quality lost between premiere and media encoder.  My current suspicion is if you are having a noticeable quality loss with the media encoder then your settings are not fiddled with adequately based on the four articles I've read about Adobe Media encoder and lower video quality."

I use the noise gate in Sony Vegas for all of my videos; my microphone is very sensitive and will even pick up the fan noise from my PC if I don't use a gate. You'll have to experiment with the db limit to find out what is a good setting for you to block out the breathing noises while not also blocking the words that you're saying. The only way I see this not working is if the sound of you breathing is on the same level of volume that your normal speech is; in which case I can only recommend moving the microphone farther away from your mouth.

letsplay,3e3apy,Styxie,4,Tue Jul 21 17:04:42 2015 UTC,"It used to be that networks provided a bit of copyright relief, much like a union. I'm not saying that you could post copyright material without getting flagged/caught, but rather that your channel was under a managed system that helped you out. Due to some changes to how things worked, channels are now largely under a partnered status, which gives almost no added benefits copyright-wise. In fact, when I asked my network to help with an erroneous claim I got a reply back basically saying ""do it yourself."" It is those types of reactions, along with a loss of actual value, that have gotten most YouTubers to leave their networks and go solo.  My ""ideal"" network would look like this:   No contract, leave whenever you want. 80/20 or 90/10 profit sharing. 70/30 is alright at best, but borderline. Anything less is highway robbery. Higher CPM rates is a plus if you can prove that you get them. Most networks claim higher CPM but will not give you any proof. Managed status. Access to AudioMicro and/or other royalty-free audio sites. Support staff that will answer your emails and help you with any claims/issues you are having. Payment every month (or a smaller threshold. Right now I have a $50 threshold which isn't too bad). We have a nice earnings chart so you can track how you are doing as well. Paid sponsorship opportunities. Do not take a cut of our YouTube tip jar money (some networks do, some don't).   Some networks also have forums that help you engage with other YouTubers, but generally get flooded with spam.  You can add referral bonuses if you want, but that usually makes more spam as well. My network has weekly contests over Twitter where the winner gets a bit of gear or something.   Right now, other than the AudioMicro access, there is no real reason to join a network.  They take a significant cut of your profits and don't offer you the ROI that they used to.  They claim a lot of things without a concrete way of doing them. They also lock you into a contract. The best network that I've seen lately is Curse, but I don't know too much about them. From what I've heard they have a decent split, no contract, and some benefits for joining.  Maybe take a look at what makes them worthwhile?   Also, it seems like we have a LOT of new networks popping up, and most of them are cookie-cutter networks from Freedom or something. Might not be the best market to be getting into right now, as networks are becoming less useful. Hope this helps!"
letsplay,3e3apy,Pyroraptor,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight! Just to correct the ""no contract"" thing, all networks have contracts (And if they don't, you should never join), I think what you mean is by lock in.  Regarding giving managed status to every channel, see my above comment to another user about why networks can't really offer that. I'll link it in a second.  I'd also like to say, what we're doing isn't anything cookie cutter, we're signing the contract directly and not under anyone."
letsplay,3e3apy,Pyroraptor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:35 2015 UTC,"You are correct, I meant no lock-in. A short lock-in would be acceptable as well. For instance a month by month basis like what Curse does (IIRC). I would even consider a 3 month period as fair because it protects both the channel and the network.  While giving everyone managed status is not doable, I was trying to make the point that copyright protection is the main draw of a network. Having a managed status would fit my version of an ""ideal network"" as the question asked. However I completely understand that is is not possible.  Sounds good, I'd be interested in seeing what you come up with. I also understand that my ""ideal"" network benefits the content creators greatly and may not leave much for the network owners. While this version may not be completely possible, I would consider at least some of the and try to balance it to be in favor for both parties."

letsplay,3e3apy,TheSlimyDog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:10 2015 UTC,How bad is it for Affiliated Partners? I don't know what I am but I'm certainly not a big channel and I'm partnered with RPM/Maker. I'd assume I'm an affiliated partner because I haven't gotten anything special on my dashboard.  I've heard stuff like no copyright protection (though that's not too hard to deal with if you make original content and tread cautiously) and that monetization takes days to activate but it probably takes me less than an hour (I've never actually timed how much time it takes. I should check that with my next upload).
letsplay,3e3apy,corobo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:35 2015 UTC,"You are more than likely an affiliate partner (thanks for remind me what the right term is, I couldn't remember). Being an affiliate isn't bad in any ways, just like it is not good in any way.  The network basically doesn't help you with copyright-related issues, which was the reason to join a network originally.  That being said, it is your responsibility, no matter if you are managed or affiliated, to ensure you have the rights to use something before you upload your video.  The question now becomes: what is the benefit you get from joining? Networks will claim higher CPMs but will not provide any proof. They will claim to make you more popular and help you reach a wider audience, which generally means access to a forum full of other creators all spamming their work. You will normally get access to paid content (like AudioMicro or Spreadshirt's premium account), which I'll admit is the best reason I have to joining. However, for that they will take (on average) 20-30% of your earnings. That may not be bad while you are a small channel because you don't make much. However, if you get popular all of a sudden you may be looking at several hundred dollars or more that could have gone to your channel but instead go to your network. Most people will say that networks only benefit larger channel, but I don't think that is true. larger channels have more to lose financially and not much more to gain (unless they get upgraded to managed status).  The whole ""may take up to a few days to monetize"" bit was a reaction to YouTube changing their policies that got way out of hand. I have yet to see any of my videos take longer to get monetized than the time it takes to upload them (unless I get a copyright notice, which is fairly rare). I have yet to see any of my fellow YouTubers I talk to regularly have an issue either.  I may be biased against networks given the poor performance I have seen with my network and also with my friends and their networks. There are countless topics on the forums with complaints of late payments, network support not helping them, and more issues. I think that joining a network is something that everyone should not take lightly. Read through everything carefully, weight the benefits and deficits, and make your own decision for what is best with your channel."
letsplay,3e3apy,SinisterPixel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like another thing that Networks help is unifying the process of getting paid and YouTube because when they're getting a cut of the money, they'll make sure it comes. It's like hiring an investment banker to do things that you don't want to for a cut of the profit. I personally do it as a hobby so getting into all the details of the financials is something that I don't mind leaving to the network."
letsplay,3e3apy,-amiibo-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:21:49 2015 UTC,"Assuming for the sake of comparison your network has no extra perks at all, being an Affiliate is the same as running without a network  As an affiliate channel your network should be doing something that goes above and beyond what YouTube does without being linked to an MCN. The most basic and pretty much only perk most networks offer is being paid more frequently than the Adsense threshold"
letsplay,3e3apy,-amiibo-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"The only thing that will EVER get me to sign is a managed partnership. There's literally no point in me giving a cut to the network if I settle for affiliate, besides being able to be paid under YouTube's threshold (in which case the network shouldn't really be taking more than 10% IMO). I may as well just manage it myself.  Also I want to be able to jump on a network that genuinely does have the audience to give me significant promotion, and will. No point in claiming that you'll promote me if A) you won't and B) your audience is so miniscule I'll never see the effects of that promotion."

(Taking out ads, keyword optimisations, etc). As for managed partnership, I'm not sure how much you know about them, but they're incredibly iffy to give out, as if a managed partner gets a strike, it affects the entire network, even the unmanaged partners.

If I ask a potential network for an average eCPM for a channel of my size on their network, it'd be nice if they didn't dance around the question like a politician on the stand. Yes, we know CPMs aren't set in stone, and we know that no network can promise a certain CPM, but a ballpark figure would be nice. You're otherwise asking me to hand over a share of my revenue in return for an empty promise, and that's crazy.   On top of that, they'd be clear about where along the line that figure is. I've seen networks quote the gross CPM before, trying to slip past the fact that YouTube is taking 45% that, and then the network is taking anywhere from 10%-30% of what's left, leaving you with an eCPM that's no different from AdSense. If the ballpark is before revshares, then say that.   When money is involved, it becomes a business, so I want to see a network that treats it like one and doesn't appear to prey on younger YouTubers who don't know what they're doing. I get both amused and annoyed whenever I see a scumbag network recruiter quote the lack of tax withholding as a ""perk"" of the network.  You have to pay income tax on those earnings, withheld or otherwise, but they deliberately phrase it to make it sound like they're making you more revenue because so many teenagers out there won't know about the tax situation.  Case studies. Case studies. Case studies. If a network is going to sell itself on being a means to help channels grow, then prove it. Don't just say it. Point me to channels that have grown after joining the network, and cite some ways in which being part of that network directly helped with that growth.   I think there are more elements that are thankfully becoming the norm. No contract lock-in. Lower revshare split (the days of 60/40 are gone). Stuff like that.   In short, clarity. Does the network offer a music and art library? Great! Just be clear about the terms of use. Will that music be moentizable in perpetuity or am I screwed the second I leave the network? Do you only offer sponsorship and product placement deals for channels of a certain size? That's fine, just outline that upfront, so you don't fool small channels into thinking it'll happen.  At the end of the day I look at joining a network as a business decision for my side business, because in actuality it is a business decision for my side business. So that means I'd want to work with a company that acts like a company, and treats it's clients with respect and honesty."
letsplay,3e3apy,BogMod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"That's a great list, some of those things seem like they should be common sense, but I actually hadn't though about! I'll discuss all of your comment with the rest of the team. I completly agree that preying on younger YouTubers is despicable, I wish to stay as far away from that as possible. Agreed again that it is a business decision. We want to make it mutually beneficial, the more we help you grow, the more money we both get. There are networks, like Omni Media, that have managed to negotiate YouTube taking a smaller cut, we'll try that, as it's a good thing for all parties involved."
letsplay,3e3apy,BogMod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:31 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, stuff like this helps a great deal too. The fact that you're asking YouTubers directly for feedback and are responsive. If you communicate with your potential channels that same way, it goes a long way.  In my experience, even if I'm not sold on a network, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and hear them out, so long as it seems like there's a person on the other side sincerely reaching out to me, as opposed to copy/pasting a templated e-mail.   One more thing, and this is more speculative, since I've never worked on your side of the network system, but my assumption is that any direct sales team will try to sell as much of their network's inventory as possible, and everything unsold just gets backfilled with AdSense. Is this the case?  Personally, even with my main channel at ~100k monthly views, I always had the feeling I'm still small enough that I'd end up in that backfilled bucket, which is why on top of the CPM doublespeak, I assumed my eCPM would never really improve with a network. Is there any legitimacy to that or am I just making too many assumptions?"
letsplay,3e3apy,-amiibo-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"We've set up this network with the goal of being honest and friendly, none of the bland commercial aseptic front. Adsales is a bit complicated sometimes, it's not really my speciality but this is usually what happens: Networks reach out to advertisers (Or the other way round, there are marketplaces for that) saying what they want and who they want to reach. If you fall in that category of channel they're looking for, or a viewer does, there's a chance that they will roll an add on your channel which usually will always see a higher CPM. If there are no ads available, it will default back to Adsense. That's the case with all channels, big and small. In quite a few cases, targeted ads only get served for the top channels, this depends completly on the network and the ad campaign though. In short, it really depends, they can boost your CPM, but it's not 100 per cent."
letsplay,3e3apy,Addyizoth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good promotion plus Curse levels of royalty cuts would be nice.  Obviously not everything can be promoted at the same level, but what would be great is if the higher ups that review the channels can determine what has potential, rather than just throwing all their eggs in the basket of the already big channels.   Of course ""potential"" isn't actually something that can be measured in numbers, so it's an incredibly subjective thing, but it would still be nice to see the unique and high quality, yet underrated channels get coverage.  Maybe have some kind of ""under 1k sub channel of the month"" thing or something?"

Warner Bros. has no objection to your recording and >posting a short video on YouTube (no more than 5 minutes long), so long as the videos are streamed on >YouTube for free for the enjoyment of other fans.  You must not monetize or commercialize the properties in any >way.  You may not, however, use the music associated with the posting.   In short no monetization is allowed. You can get away with the music muted and skipping cutscenes but the risk is not worth the trouble.  And Feniks, you can equally contribute to a post without dragging that negativity."

letsplay,3e4r31,-amiibo-,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:45:31 2015 UTC,"I'd just go for it, if they don't allow monetization you'd just get hit with a content-id which would just not allow you to make money off the vid."
letsplay,3e4m0i,HawkyYT,3,Tue Jul 21 22:32:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bad idea to advertise yourself in comments, because you usually just get negative responces, however if the comment thread you are responding to involves similar topics/games to what you play there isn't much wrong with a cheeky mention.  I usually post a comment on every video I watch responding to what has been said in the video, because if you ever get top comment, that's a permanent link to your channel on someone else's video.  But then again, that's just my policy and my channel hasn't grown in who knows long."
letsplay,3e4m0i,-amiibo-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it hasn't translated into anything for me. I have a few top comments like this one with almost 400+ and I haven't seen a single sub from it. I am not saying it never happens, but it just never happens for me. Then again the comment is a pretty meaningless one, and doesn't point anything to my channel."
letsplay,3e4m0i,jimmybarrinhio,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:30:43 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but I'm more throwing it out like ""Well, in the long run it's a link to your channel which you wouldn't have otherwise"""
letsplay,3e4m0i,-amiibo-,2,Wed Jul 22 00:34:11 2015 UTC,"You are right sir, its worth leaving comments on things you watch just for giggles and any potential gain."
letsplay,3e4m0i,jimmybarrinhio,2,Wed Jul 22 00:37:15 2015 UTC,"If I see it on my channel in one of my videos, I delete it. If I see it in my inbox, I delete it. If I see it in someone else's comments, or pretty much anywhere that has nothing to do with me, I ignore it. Honestly, this seems like the only reasonable response to self-advertising. There's no point in raging about it, because it's really never going to go away.  If it really bothers you, maybe talk to them about it, and tell them how it probably isn't helping them the way they think it is. Prepare for blowback though. Otherwise ignore/delete/report. It's pretty simple actually."
letsplay,3e4m0i,thespicywaffle,2,Tue Jul 21 23:00:57 2015 UTC,"The only time someone self-advertises in my comments and doesn't get instantly deleted is if they are advertising something that is directly related to my videos (for example ""I took your build and improved it by doing this"" or ""I'm doing a Let's Play of your modpack"") . Even then, I judge if it's worth keeping the comment based on the quality and relevance of what they're advertising.  EDIT: Self-promotion is a necessary evil if you want to grow, but there's a right and wrong way to go about doing it. Spamming other people's comment sections with a cookie-cutter message is not the right way."
letsplay,3e4m0i,welsknight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"THIS. The way I self advertise is to actually make meaningful comments, join a community, and make friends. Granted, this isn't the fastest growth rate, but the people I get genuinely watch my vids because they want to watch me. Relationships build stronger channels, not sub count. For instance, I see many channels in the 1000's sub club that get maybe 20 views a video. I get that with 58 subs."
letsplay,3e4m0i,Lockedontargetshow,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:46:06 2015 UTC,"In addition, the act of simply being present online is self-advertising. You represent and ""advertise"" your channel 100% of the time you are online with an account associated with your channel. It may be indirect advertisement, but it is advertisement nonetheless. That's why it's important to always present yourself in a professional manner that represents your channel properly. As you touched on, building relationships is equally important. I would definitely attribute a significant portion of my growth to the friends I've made and the various communities I've become a part of."

Preamp - Presonus VSL22  Mic - AT-2035  Stand - Neewer Sisccor Boom Arm  You might be able to find a Mic+Spidermount combo for the AT2035 on amazon.  The Preamp comes with a software based EQ+Compressor.  It's really a great tool and awesome once you learn how to set it up properly.  You can really control how you sound very well to make sure you have the best presence.   Lastly you'll need to get an XLR cable for your mic.  If you don't mind used, check out Guitar Center's Used section for the presonus 22VSL.  I got mine used from there for $99.  Also check Amazons used section. :D  HTH  -Agentc0re"
letsplay,3e2i01,Kemp_J,2,Tue Jul 21 14:23:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Agentc0re. Getting an XLR setup is vastly superior to a USB mic setup, and is within your price range of $300.  A Presonus and a AT2035 is a really good combo.  If it si too much then default to the AT2020 instead for a few bucks cheaper. Just make sure to get the XLR one, not the USB one.  You will need:   Presonus VSL22 AT2035 (or AT2020) Pop filter Boom arm (if you want one. I have the Neewer and it works great) XLR cable (get the Neewer stand with the cable built in or get a separate one).   Hook up the mic to the presonus with the XLR cable, then the presonus to your computer via USB."

letsplay,3e2i01,YuB_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:19 2015 UTC,If the budget stretches to the AT2035 then it seems a better deal - slightly higher spec and a bundled shock mount.
letsplay,3e2i01,YuB_,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:44 2015 UTC,"I picked an AT2035 up off eBay barely used for $100.  Also I picked up one of these sure SM57 knockoffs for the hell of it and it doesn't sound bad at all.  For a $10 microphone it's well woth trying.  I like that it since it's dynamic, it won't pick up everything in the room so I can leave my fan running during recording with only 2-3 dB of noise added to ambient noise."
letsplay,3e39v1,Cly_Faker,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"I don't have any experience, but I do have a spec sheet to reference.   This mic is a condenser mic, which generally has a better frequency response than a dynamic mic but is also more sensitive. other popular condenser mics: Blue Snowball, Blue Yeti, AT2020, AT2035, etc It has a unidirectional cardioid polar pattern, which is preferable for YouTube work. However, it is also meant to be placed on a table for conference calls and therefore is made to take noise from a larger angle. A cardioid pattern with a smaller angle would be preferable. A frequency response from 20 Hz to 18 kHz is fairly good. This is better than a Blue Snowball's 40 Hz to 18 kHz and slightly less than the Yeti's 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) is a bit low at 65 dB. The SNR tells us how much louder the signal strength is compared to the noise of the microphone. The lower the number the more hum, hiss, and feedback.  The higher the number the less humming. For comparison, the Yeti has an SNR of 100 dB. Finally, the mic has a fairly flat frequency response with little coloration. That is fine, and you can adjust it in EQ if you want. However, check out the frequency response while off-axis. It dips significantly between 800 Hz and 2000 Hz. I would highly suggest recording on-axis or very slightly off-axis to get the most from your mic.   My conclusion: It is hard to tell from just the specs alone. I would hook it up and try for yourself. It has a decent frequency response and will probably server you well. However, it has a slightly wide polar pattern, is bad at off-axis recording, and is a bit low on the SNR. I would position it directly in front of you, on axis, with your keyboard and mouse as far behind it as you can. This should help you get the best recording and not record too much background keyboard noise. Best of luck!"
letsplay,3e39v1,Pyroraptor,2,Tue Jul 21 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"Well then, not bad for $7 and it definitely blows the DIY mic I currently use out of the water. Once I get my hands on a phantom power supply I'll give it a go."
letsplay,3e39v1,Pyroraptor,2,Tue Jul 21 20:34:11 2015 UTC,"Really not a bad buy for $7 (unless its DOA). According to the specs, to get that quality you would have to pay probably $50-&150 (Blue Snowball to Yeti). I just hope it works :D Let us know how well it works!"
letsplay,3e39v1,Pyroraptor,2,Tue Jul 21 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, they cost ~$265 new, ~$165 refurb, and ~$125 used.

Resolution isn't a scarcity when you're minimizing it to a corner - the c270 will look as good as nearly any other webcam. That being said, for full-size video its poor resolution becomes plainly obvious, so I don't doubt that the c920 is worth every penny."

This way you only need one capture card for your game footage. (If you're using a dedicated separate recording PC)  For reviews or vlogs use a camcorder or dslr. You'll get a much nicer video and you can use the previously mentioned capture card to pull the video into your PC and record directly to your hard drive, which cuts down on file transfer time.  For single PC setups...I would record the game footage on the PC and use a camcorder your video. Otherwise, it would probably be too much on your PC to record two streams AND play the game."

Basically, they stated that you should only expect ten percent of your subs to watch your video in a week so seeing you have 142 subs, you should aim for each video to pull in 14 views in 7 days.  (I'm probably massacring the original intent, btw)  Still, I use it as an eyeball metric to gauge my content. A few low views happens that doesn't make sense, but if I start seeing a trend, then I put the series on watch.  Fun also is a huge factor. If I'm not having fun and the series is underperforming then I'll wrap it up. Of course, when I stop a series, I make a video explaining my choice and/or ask for feedback. We all get goosed with underperforming videos now and then. It only matters if there is a pattern.  I hope that helps."

Open NAT is dependent on forwarding ports to your consoles from your router. Games use specific ports for multiplayer, and you can find that information online. Give that you have ATT might mean that you cannot access your router without their permission first, or at least not without calling their tech support. ATT is an awful provider in my opinion, and love to throttle their speeds for insane prices. I personally use Comcast and get 60Mbps down and 10-15Mbps up, constantly. Speed ► Your downstream is powerful enough to handle all 4 consoles, perhaps even up to 6 total, but your upload is what worries me. A single console can take anywhere from .5Mbps to a full 1Mbps for gaming alone. This is highly dependent on the console itself, as well as the type of game being played. Simpler games mean less load, more complex mean more load.   Conclusion ► Give it a test run first, see if you can all just play online first, don't record anything. If it doesn't work for more than a solid hour (someone keeps disconnecting, someone keeps lagging, or you just haven't figured it out by the end of the day), then chances are your Net speeds are far too low to support 4+ gamers."

letsplay,3e1soh,GHostLPs,2,Tue Jul 21 08:41:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I'd say stick with it. The downside to having a longer running series is that views will taper off over time. Your first video or two will generally have really solid view numbers but as the episode numbers climb higher they'll taper off. This is one of the downfalls of LPing longer games and there's really no way around it.  This is not because you're doing anything wrong. This is mostly due to the investment required to keep up with the series. A Top 10 video requires absolutely no investment in it, a 40th LP episode typically requires that the user invested the time to watch the previous 39 episodes. Most people don't do that.  You also have to keep in mind that viewers tend not to jump into a series mid-way through, they'll watch the first few episodes to see if they like it (hence the high view counts early on) and if they don't they're going to move on. Those ~20 views you're getting on each video are likely from the same group of folks that have enjoyed the specific content up to that point.  If you're going solely for high view numbers you don't want to have long running series'. A lot of one-offs and short series' (~5 episodes or so) will net you large numbers of views because there's next to no viewer investment required to them. There's no time going into watching a Top 10 video beyond the time of the video itself, but if you're looking at episode 40 in an LP, you're typically going to want to have seen the previous 39 episodes first which is in all likelihood tens of hours worth of the viewer's time.  For comparison, the view count for one of my more popular recent series which just concluded was as follows:   First video:  ~9,000 views Final video:  ~175 views   Finally, as a channel with ~50 subs, I would consider getting 20 views a video for a long running series to be pretty good."

However if you're not enjoying it, it could be worth taking a break for a few weeks and seeing how you feel. If you're still not happy with it, then it's probably best to leave it completely. I find when I'm not enjoying a game I produce sub par videos so I try to take a break, find something else to play or go do something in the outside world (ohmygod!) to clear my head.  However I also like to go by a 10% rule. If 10% of the number of subscribers I have are watching a video (regardless if they are all subs or viewers passing by) then I'll keep going with it. But obviously it's up to you what you do. I hope I made sense. :)"
letsplay,3e1soh,TheCaptainSauce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:32:55 2015 UTC,"""As long as im enjoying it"" is a massive trap and lethargic advice people give out. Viewers aren't interested in watching gamers, they want to watch entertainers. Simply playing through a game for 60 episodes is fun for you, but very very few people want to sit down and watch that. It also puts up a huge wall for new people to start watching, since few people want to start on episode 45, so if they come across that video on YouTube, the odds of them clicking to your channel, going to episode 1, subscribing and watching every episode after that in their spare time is almost none.

Here's a common misconception about the ""as long as I'm enjoying it"" philosophy. It doesn't mean enjoyment is the only important factor. It's more that if you're going to succeed, you should do so with content you enjoy making, rather than content that will get you a ton of views.  However, that doesn't make them mutually exclusive. Like most people, I'm guessing you have many series you want to do at any given moment. It doesn't go against the ""for enjoyment"" philosophy to pick something you enjoy and also will bring in more views.  That being said, once you get 44 parts into a series, it's probably better to just finish what you start. Tends to look better later on."

If you want to attract and audience I'd suggest trying to diversify your content. Then once you begin to grow bigger and have a stable fan base you can start focusing more on one game series'.

letsplay,3e1pzx,thekdawg360,3,Tue Jul 21 07:42:09 2015 UTC,Bit if both. I like watching people do long plays and just seeing their experience with the game but I also like comedy in a let's play as long as it isn't forced (I'm looking at you markiplier and pewdiepie)
letsplay,3e1pzx,MR_Krunkle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:51:36 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way, especially about forced comedy. The guys at AH are generally pretty good about being fresh each video. I think it might have to do with being in a group and being able to feed off of everyone's energy. Guys who do it solo really need to do there best to keep it fresh alone. Like with Michael from AH doing Rage Quit. I used to watch it all the time but it started getting stale after it became clear he was really phoning in the rage."
letsplay,3e1pzx,MR_Krunkle,2,Tue Jul 21 08:11:44 2015 UTC,Yeah exactly rage quit was good back when he would actually be getting angry and would quickly turn on a camera to record his screen it was genuine. Even during AH stuff gavin Geoff and Michael all ham it up a bit. I haven't heard Geoff genuinely laugh in a long time Michael tried to find something to rage at gavin for and gavin plays up the dumb card a good bit. Even in one of their mine craft videos recently gavin admitted that they will sometimes do something stupid just to extend the video.

If the LPer's commentary is good I'll watch just about anything that they put out.  I can't say that I watch any LPers specifically for comedy. Sometimes funny things happen to folks that I watch and that's great, but it's not what I'm there for. I appreciate calm commentary much more than over exaggerated screeching 100% of the time.  The really forced and exaggerated reactions shown by some LPers are pretty much instant turn-offs for me and unless it's really rare I tend not to stick with them for too long.   I tend think that a lot of the 'funny' LPers tend to lean on crazy reactions and over-edited footage because they don't think that they can produce decent content otherwise.  Whether or not there's any basis in fact to this, I don't know. It's just something that's always saddened just a little bit about some folks whose content I think would be excellent if they'd just tone it down about 10 notches."

The other water-related tip I've heard is to avoid swishing it or holding it too long in your mouth (reduces saliva production and leads to drying out quicker). I am possibly a little close to the microphone, I'll experiment with distances. The issue there might be me having a condensor mic, which I understand works best when you're close to it.

Microphone changes, extra processing, vocal exercises, anything that can help clear it up?"
letsplay,3e1c8q,petenu,2,Tue Jul 21 13:23:47 2015 UTC,"Try experimenting with the placement of your microphone. Instead of talking directly into it, try positioning it so that you are talking across it."
letsplay,3e1c8q,CromulentArcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Is the idea here that I'm ""aiming"" the s sounds at something other than the mic itself?"
letsplay,3e1c8q,petenu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Sibilance is a high-frequency blast of air, and is highly directional, so moving the microphone out of its path means it just passes right on by. By contrast, those lovely smooth dulcet tones of yours will spread out more, so will get picked up pretty much wherever you put the microphone.  Naturally, once you alter your microphone placement, you'll get a slightly different frequency response, so you'll probably want to revisit your EQ settings."

I've seen people using those mic arms & pop filters, do you guys think that may help here?

letsplay,3e1c8q,Pyroraptor,4,Tue Jul 21 13:35:50 2015 UTC,"That's from room noise, specifically from the reflections in the room you are recording in. There are a few things that can help you out.  1) Eliminate the problem from the source.  If your room is empty, large, and echo-y it will make your recording sound empty, large, and echo-y. Fill your room with more furniture, put blankets on the walls, hang curtains, put acoustic foam on the wall, get/make a mic box or a mic shield.  Anything you can do to cut down on the reflected noise in your room. I put foam mattress toppers on my walls and it works great.  2) Proper mic placement: for a condenser mic you want the microphone 6-8"" from your mouth for best performance.  This will allow you to cut down on some of the background noise because the mic will focus on your voice. Make sure to use a pop filter (locate it 2"" from your mic).  3) Open Audacity and start a recording. Talk at a normal recording level and adjust your gain until you average -12 dB. This is called headroom, and will keep you from clipping.  4) Record your episode, and make sure to add 10 seconds of blank recording for your noise removal. Do a Noise Removal, Compressor (set with ratio 4:1), and then Normalize (somewhere between -1 and -3 dB). After this step DO NOT increase the volume of your vocal track in editing. Reduce the game audio instead.  These steps will help you get the most out of your mic.  It will help reduce background noise, keep you from clipping, make your voice more even, and make your voice as loud as it can be without clipping.   I would be happy to go into more detail, explain how everything works, or answer any questions you have. Hope this helps!  ::SeaOtterGamer"

Therefore I like to post it as often as possible to help mitigate the amount of work others have to do. Plus, increasing your audio quality is rather easy once you figure it out.

Select the text. Then go to Selection -> Grow and add 3-10 pixels. Then make a new layer behind your text layer and fill the selection with your border color.  You can also do this to add drop shadows by moving the selection a bit."

letsplay,3e1c8q,Pyroraptor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:06 2015 UTC,"Nope, because when you make a text block it saves the entire word/sentence as a single layer. Then if you select everything but the transparency you will have  just the letters. Try it and you'll see how easy it actually is. If you run into spacing issues then you can space your letters away from each other in the text options (double click the text tool), or just let the outlines overlap. It looks fine either way."

I lost an entire episode worth of camera footage so the whole episode is has no camera throughout except at the start and end.  My microphone then BROKE in the middle of an episode and I didn't notice until an episode later. So I've had to publish an episode with more then 50% of the microphone audio being horrible quality check it out here if you like and I'll have to reshoot the next episode NEXT week. Since the next episode is the finale to the series I CANNOT upload it in inferior quality and had I more time to record this episode I would not be putting it up in it's current state.  Luckily I've ordered a nice new Blue Yeti so the quality of my videos will be higher in the end. I just have to come to terms with the fact that this is a bad week for me.

I also think you are confusing charisma with pure looks. The two aren't mutually exclusive. Charisma is about personality as much as it is about looks, and you can be super charismatic without anyone ever knowing what you look like.  Obviously if you do things with face cam and blogs being attractive helps, but it's not the end all be all. This isn't Hollywood where you're not even given a chance if you are unattractive.

If they are attractive, they may get slightly more views but I do think the ultimate thing that keeps people staying is their personality and ability to connect with their audience. And honestly, channels without facecam end up keeping views because of their personality, and you can be very successful never even showing your face."

YouTubing is a small screen, but it's not much different than television or film in that regard. You're either attractive, or you set yourself apart as a ""character actor"".  Boogie isn't the widely accepted picture of looks, but he has a personality and character that sets him apart and lets him stand out.  Looking good isn't a total free pass, and not being a model isn't condemnation into failure, but it without a shadow of a doubt plays into how a channel is going to evolve and grow.   You can cherry pick gaming YouTubers all you'd like, but step back and look at the site as a whole. Attractive personalities do well. It's not all you need to make it, but it helps a lot.   It's almost silly to try and argue against this, because we have well over a century of past entertainment industry history as proof. Film. Television. Theater. In general, people like watching attractive people."

letsplay,3e04y2,Mrawesomeguy246,3,Mon Jul 20 22:54:34 2015 UTC,I think it will depend on your style. I sugest checking out Christopher Odd for really good approach to making RPG core of his channel. He doesn't cut anything and still makes it interesting.   You can go with Cryolitic method of cutfing out everything that is usless to the storry. Making your cuts almost unrecognisable. That is my favourite approach to RPG and any other videos for that matter.
letsplay,3e04y2,Feniks1984PL,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:44 2015 UTC,"If you want you can use a fast forward effect on the parts you're worried about being boring and want to preserve the continuous footage effect. If not, some simple crossfades with whatever type of explanation works best for you. Front load it into the first video's intro, annotation, note in the description, in video text, whatever works best for you."
letsplay,3e04y2,FadedReality,4,Mon Jul 20 23:02:10 2015 UTC,"I hate fastworward effect it brings nothing to the video you can't see anytjing on speed x 4 anyway, it breaks the imersion in the series. I thing quick crossfade or dip to black is much better."
letsplay,3e04y2,Feniks1984PL,2,Mon Jul 20 23:12:30 2015 UTC,I totally agree but some people don't mind it. I much prefer crossfades.
letsplay,3e04y2,FadedReality,2,Mon Jul 20 23:17:21 2015 UTC,I think on average more people will prefer stright cut/fade over speed up effect so it is safer way of doing it.
letsplay,3e04y2,Feniks1984PL,2,Mon Jul 20 23:26:50 2015 UTC,"It depends on the game. First off, I'm a small channel with 55 subs so I might not be the authority on how to handle jRPGs but I make content that I'd like to consume.  That being said, I try to keep as much in as possible. My videos range from 30-45 minutes because I find to keep a cohesive narrative, cutting before that window keeps you from being able to do a bit of story and a dungeon.  While I strive to make the LP feel authentic, I will cut out excessive backtracking. Usually I fade in and out of white to signify something that I cut while I fade in and out of black to signify the start and end of my videos.  I keep all grinding off screen because it's not necessarily interesting to watch. In games where the random battle encounter is high I will cut out battles but I always leave one or two battles per episode so they can see what kind of monsters are in the area.  Games that have very quick random battles (Mother 1, Artifact Adventure, The Amber Throne) I leave out all battles because they are quick enough and far enough apart that they aren't a distraction. FF4: The After Years has way too many battles so I cut them out but I leave out the trigger/spirally transition animation so the watcher sees how often they happen (it also explains the breakage in commentary).  I don't do this myself, but I've seen other channels make side videos for the completionists. Basically if the best weapon can only be found on a specific map in a odd corner with a 1/32 chance of dropping, they'll leave that out of the main series. I find that take fun because your LP can appeal to different kind of viewers.  Hope that gives you ideas on how to proceed yourself."
letsplay,3e04y2,MrGazillion,2,Mon Jul 20 23:56:40 2015 UTC,"I'm in the midst of a Dragon Age LP and I've only made one or two cuts so far because of battles being long and boring.  As for traveling, I would say any time you travel somewhere for the first time (City A to City B) record the whole trip. Every time after that plan on cutting it out unless something interesting happens. So keep the camera rolling at all times!"
letsplay,3e04y2,kyleblane,2,Mon Jul 20 23:59:57 2015 UTC,"I'm playing an action rpg now. I just fast forward/cut out parts where I have to run from place to place. Imo, a good rule of thumb is if it isn't beneficial to the story and it doesn't detract from immersion of the game, cut it out."
letsplay,3e04y2,scudponies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:24 2015 UTC,"I personally cut out all the boring stuff and often some of the stuff that does have action but doesn't pertain to the story and isn't that interesting. I try to get an hour of play down to 10 or so minutes (though you need to keep a few things in mind while recording to make sure you don't cut from one context like a city to a place that's completely different like speaking to your friend inside a building in a different town).  Sometimes, if you don't want to cut out that much (it takes between 2 to 3 hours to edit my videos) you can do interesting things like telling stories or interesting things in boring parts. Add your own style."
letsplay,3e04y2,TheSlimyDog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:47:37 2015 UTC,"I cut out backtracking, repetitive moments and sometimes loading screens (Pillars of Eternity had quite long ones). I generally play an hour or two at a time."
letsplay,3e04y2,Kartraith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:43:39 2015 UTC,It usually depends on the game and how I am feeling while recording. If I talk I usually  keep in it but sometimes when I have nothing to talk about I cut it. For more story based RPGs I usually end the episode when I've think it makes sense in the story (so episode times tend to be inconsistent). For battle heavy RPGs I usually show the first couple battles then speed up the rest if I am not talking over it or cut them out.
letsplay,3e16ml,jemite,4,Tue Jul 21 04:07:00 2015 UTC,"These three tricks have been quickly improving my commentary over the last eight months:   Always, ALWAYS listen back to your let's plays. Know what you sound like, how you talk. Know yourself the way your viewers know you. Keep a mirror on your desk at all times. Being able to see your own face while you commentate will make you more aware of your presence as the host of a show, and will keep you attentive so you don't accidentally zone out as though you were playing the game on your own. A facecam preview also serves this purpose, but mirrors are always better. Whenever you find a word you think you say too much in your commentary, write it on a post-it and stick it to your monitor. You'll never say that word again in a commentary, at least not by accident."

Or, as is the case for just about all of us here, use only allowed content or royalty free content. Most game developers/publishers don't mind you using game footage, so long as you comment over it. Most issues come from using copyrighted music, as is the case with Grand Theft Auto 5, but most people get around that by turning off the in-game music and tossing in some royalty-free stuff.  A lot of times, royalty free content (fonts, images, music, video) will require to to properly attribute their creator. Most places with this kind of content will have a 'license' page where you can simply copy/paste the correct attribution.  But when it comes to strictly recording yourself playing a game, so long as you comment over at least part of it, you're good. You might do some searches to make sure the publishers and developers of whatever game you're playing are cool with it being monetized on youtube.  If you have no plans to run ads alongside your videos, then you don't really have to worry about any of this, but you might get copyright strikes or they might shove ads in before your videos with copyrighted content in them."

I remember one of my favourites being a LP of KotOR II which made use of a patch that restored a bunch of content to the game. This was back when I was in college years ago.  I don't remember any of their names but in terms of more modern YouTubers I guess I liked PlumpHelmetPunk's channel because he wasn't trying to be all over the top. He was just playing games that he liked and built a following around it. I thought that was pretty cool. I wouldn't say that he inspired to start my channel but he's probably the person who had the most influence in getting me up and running.

I've been running a collab channel for almost a year now, and at the beginning we just made videos and put them out, nothing was better then something, but now that we have been going for awhile and I'm committed full time basically I've been doing non stop research on SEO, trends, forums, etc and we've taken off since then.

Sure, if you do everything right and consistently do everything right then your channel will grow, but going back to the root question: What are the chances you're going to do everything right all of the time? Especially considering the ""high quality"" part is entirely subjective and as far as content isn't something you can just easily learn.   Statistically if you look at all of the channels out there, the odds are low. That doesn't mean it's impossible. That doesn't mean the window has closed. It just means what it means, which is that the numbers favor the larger majority who don't do all of those things well enough.  It's not meant to discourage the OP, but it's far more realistic than writing it off as BS. That's akin to telling an aspiring actor that the struggle to make it big is BS, and that as long as you act well, you'll succeed."
letsplay,3dzu9s,RobPlaysThatGame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:51:00 2015 UTC,"You can't look at the odds in a sense of the entire YouTube community. That's like saying if you succeed and I fail, it's a 50/50 chance, but if you succeed and a million people fail it's a one in a million shot. It doesn't matter how many people do it poorly and fail, the only thing that influences how you grow is your quality. How many YouTubers out there are struggling to grow making videos as good as the people that are successful? If you have the skillset to make videos of the same caliber as those that are wildly successful on YouTube, you won't go unnoticed for years. Ive seen plenty of YouTubers over the last year alone go from 5k to 500k subscribers. Whether or not someone has that ability, or can develop it in a timely manner is totally separate as to whether or not someone can succeed or not."
letsplay,3dzu9s,TheCaptainSauce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"How many YouTubers out there are struggling to grow making videos as good as the people that are successful?   I'd imagine quite a many. People who are talented when it comes to the production of the content but lack the proper SEO skills. Or people who know SEO but don't make the effort in social media.  At the end of the day, it was far too simplistic to rationalize that as long as you made good videos, you'll make it. That simply isn't true. The whole ecosystem is complex as it is, and it's only going to get more complex over time.   Obviously that doesn't mean you can't make it. As you have pointed out yourself, plenty of people do.   It's a lot of balls to juggle at once, and the entire YouTube community, while not effecting your odds, serves as a wonderful example of how low the odds are for anyone to manage to juggle them all at the same time.   This isn't even exclusive for Let's Plays or even YouTube. Pick any talent based or artistic medium, and the same is true. Acting. Music. Writing. Painting. Every field has plenty of success stories, plenty of talented people who never make it, and swaths of people who are neither.   Some might read that and be dissuaded. They're usually from that third bucket, but the other two typically see the truths as a motivator to work even harder, and they should. But they shouldn't do it under the false security that it isn't a massive uphill climb."

Let out that inner voice that's saying ""OHHHHHHH"" or even ""Yay!"".  There's always those times when we're playing games and we're saying things in our head.

I recommend everyone use one. If you aren't getting P pops without one then you're probably not positioning your mic correctly. You want your tracks to be EQ'ed to the highest level without peaking in order to ensure that you get top audio quality. You also want to be no more than a foot away from the mic. With that in mind you will get popping without a filter.
letsplay,3dwnc8,DeekFTW,2,Mon Jul 20 04:56:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not using a pop filter either. I do think it would benefit my audio quality if I had a better mic, and maybe even a little with my iPhone right now. For now my audio quality is pretty neato to me."

Sometimes not the case. It's commonly overlooked, but YouTube does allow for nudity in instances where the subject matter is either educational or artistic in nature. Basically if it isn't sexualized, there's a good chance you'll be fine as long as it's age restricted.   So in the case of video games, something like LA Noire can go uncensored since most of the nudity there comes from nude corpses at the crime scene. By comparison, trying to post the strip club scene in Max Payne 3 uncensored isn't going to fly.   In OP's case, I'm not sure where it'd fall. I had to Google the game and on the one hand, it's about dick pics, which are obviously sexual in nature.

I don't say that to insult anyone who does post commentary, I just mean from my own perspective as the one doing the let's play. My blind Let's Plays may not always be entertaining, and there might be a lot of dead moments I have to cut out, but at the end of the day, I feel better about the content I produce.   If I was going to do my commentary in post, why not just go the distance and make it a review of the game?"
letsplay,3dw71q,FabbrizioCalamitous,2,Mon Jul 20 02:17:48 2015 UTC,Depends on the game. If it's a story driven game (which I don't do many of) then they would probably be absolutely blind. For other games I tend to play a little bit so I have a handle on the basic mechanics of the game before starting a LP. I never play a game beginning to end before recording though.
letsplay,3dw71q,thunderdan87,2,Mon Jul 20 02:37:00 2015 UTC,"It depends. For my Alan Wake series, I do post commentary because it has a lot of information and gives me more control. Some games I do live because I don't want to spend hours scripting, editing, etc.   I don't see a lot of people who can pull off live. I tend to stutter my way through sentences or pause to give myself time to think for too long. Post commentating has helped get better with my live commentary.

letsplay,3dw71q,fromelmstreet,2,Mon Jul 20 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"Both Blind and Non-Blind LP's have their merits.   Certain games are fun to watch blind because you get the user's first impressions, but generally speaking I find it harder to provide consistent, engaging commentary when I'm playing a game for the first time. It's completely doable... but I recommend practicing with non-blind LP's before you try something blind. Things are likely to go smoother.  If I know the game, I have more to say about the game. Generally speaking my mind is clearer and it's easier to string together coherent thoughts, and engaging commentary.   Personally, when I do blind commentary a lot of what I say is reactive commentary (which I try to avoid when I can). Commenting on what I see, & saying things like, ""Look at that tree!"", and ""Oh, I missed that jump"".... it's not that interesting to listen to, IMO.  The ideal situation for me, is a Duo where one guy knows the game, and the other doesn't. It's cool to seeing one person experience the game for the first time, and the other assisting them when they get stuck, & providing interesting things to say about the game based off their past experience."

I have actually deleted a few blind lets plays because the commentary was lacking.   Of course this varies from person to person and I understand the desire to record blind playthroughs but I think some games are better than others for blind lets plays.

If you're unfamiliar with it, one person played a level and told the next person which level they were going to play. They sent the save file to the person who hosted it, and he sent it to the next person. It would be kind of tricky in Fallout. At first I thought each person would do a quest, but some quests are much longer than others, and if everyone decided to do a main quest, it would be done in 11 or 12 episodes. I was thinking that each person would just have to make progress of some sort. If they complete a quest, that's great. If they only do part of a quest, that's great too.

I've found that I'm getting better and better at keeping the commentary interesting even though overall the gameplay isn't that compelling. By making up stories about the town or the citizens or by pointing out something funny that doesn't relate to the gameplay I keep things entertaining. At least I hope I do.  I'm personally not into editing out parts of this series. If I were to build a new development in my city but cut it out in post I would confuse the audience. When I watch these kinds of series I like to keep watching for what we will eventually build. I like to see each part being placed and then at the end look back and see how far we've come.

I play RimWorld, a game where if I play it on the slowest speed, nothing would get done. What I do is make sure I talk about anything that's going on, try to tell a joke or two, and keep the speed maxed out while I do that. Makes the game fly by faster as I idle and gives me more things to talk about.  A perfect example is a game like Prison Architect, you can say that you're going to build a cell like all the others, cut that out, then resume your commentary when you're finished building it.  I'm not too sure how that'd translate to The Sims in terms of building, but I'd suggest using the max speed to skip to parts you can actually comment on."

If you refer to what you're doing it does make more sense to the viewer when that part is gone. In the end though it is really down to the commentator to constantly keep things interesting. I've found that this gets easier the more you practice. The ultimate goal is to not have to edit things out in these kinds of games because the video is interesting enough to not have to. It's good for the audience and great for you because you free up the potential hours of time that you would be editing."
letsplay,3dwre7,DeekFTW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:14:32 2015 UTC,"Totally. But sometimes the goal has to be reached with editing, like building the 8th cell block will get pretty silly in PA simply because there's not much to say that'd be on topic.

Any software with Nvenc is equally good or better. Shadowplay is a terrible implementation of Nvenc.  Adobe has already said they don't wish to fix this. Personally this is why I don't use premiere pro, the things it has that vegas doesn't don't normally apply to gaming videos and it's much less convenient than vegas. It's not designed for gaming videos and until Adobe sees this as a profitable industry, we're not going to get a better experience on premiere."

letsplay,3dw8b5,hoodiepanda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:29:01 2015 UTC,"Pros   No Lock-In contract. When I was with Freedom, they said that they have no lock-in contract. But when I tried to leave, they strung me along for 30 days, all the while taking a piece of my earnings. Curse has a 3 day waiting period after you request to leave. Meaning that if they don't un-network you (i'm sure there's a better word for it) within 3 days, Youtube will automatically remove you. Freedom's waiting period was 30 days. 90/10 Split Not really much to say about this. A lot of networks take a lot more than 10% of your earnings. Music and Sound Effects You have access to ""Epidemic Sounds"", who claim to have over 50,000 music tracks and sound effects. As far as I know, they are free to use for Curse members and the only thing you have to do is put a message in the description of the video stating who and where you got the music/sound effect from. I've never used it, so I can't say whether it's good or bad service.   Cons   Time to get paid From my knowledge, it's this way with most, if not all networks, but it still sucks. You get paid on the 10th of the following month for the previous months earnings. For example, the revenue I earned in June won't be paid to me until August 10th.     I don't want to sound like an advertisement, but I can't think of any other cons for Curse. Most people seem to say that they are a good network to partner with, and I agree."

letsplay,3dw8b5,ThePixelPirate,3,Mon Jul 20 01:54:56 2015 UTC,The only time you need to start worrying about increased CPM is when you have subs in the 5-6 digits.  Any network saying they can increase your CPM when you are a small channel is straight up lying to you.
letsplay,3dw8b5,iAmMitten1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:44:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if they increase your CPM, but regardless a 90/10 spilt is good. Most networks offer a 70/30 or 60/40 split."
letsplay,3dw8b5,ericshift_1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:58:37 2015 UTC,"They don't want small channels, you need 4k views / mo with 1k subscribers or 8k views / mo for Under 1k subscribers. They are also very strict with copyright, I couldn't get in because of posting trailers.

The vast majority of channels shouldn't expect 5000 subscribers in 6 months to be just ""good"". For most channels, that would be insane.

If your commentary really bothers you to the point that you don't want to upload your video, just learn from that video and try to work on it next time.   If I was in your position I would just upload it, that's what I have been doing because months/years down the road I know it's going to be enjoyable to see how it all started. I just like seeing myself progress. Remember you CAN private your videos, so if you ever decide you don't want your audience to see your video, a couple clicks and it's away from public eyes.  I'm just starting out too and I know I probably am not in good position to give advice, but I just thought I could help. As for any tips on your commentary... I found it helpful to just keep talking. About anything. But I'm not the best so hopefully someone more experienced can shed a little light for the both of us."

Also how can you say there is nothing unusual at 4:27-4:58 where there is cut scene and music going on at a time. Chances are music is done by contractor who gave company permission to use it in their game but didn't give them right to extend that usage to anyone else.   You may dispute it but it's up to creator of the music if they let you if they choose not then there is nothing you can do.

letsplay,3dr9lk,ziakmru,2,Sat Jul 18 18:14:27 2015 UTC,I actually enjoy it more when lets playing I notice that when I play for myself without recording I feel like something is missing.   Also stops are not as disruptive as you think. With most recording software is 2 presses of a button to stop episode and and start recording another one. I have timer set up after aprox 25min I say good bye and start another episode. Editing etc is done later so it doesn't affect my game at a time.   I also think I am focused more when I can articulate my thought process. I play however mostly strategy and base building games so expirience may be different for different genre.

So sometimes video will be 23 min sometimes 28 min depending how it goes.   I also pause a timer if I know something will be cut out. So like in my Crusader Kings Series I am sieging some castles and it is basically me staring at a map for 5 min doing nothing. I pause my timer and wait it out until done."

It's not that I don't enjoy let's playing (I do immensely), and it's not that I wont have fun playing Fallout 4 for our channel. It's that I like LP videos to be fast, intense, and a bit crazy.

My first Let's Play was god-awful and my second Minecraft series wasn't too bad.   My longest will be Halo The Master Chief Collection. I'm 11 episodes in and I just beat the 5th level in Halo 1.

I've heard of channels far larger than ours struggling to get views after a few episodes of a long LP.  During that time we switched mics, improved our LPing skills a ton.

letsplay,3dsppo,-amiibo-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:16:46 2015 UTC,"You gotta remember that this is a business venture, I'd recommend you read this before even taking any action, but then I could be wrong."

letsplay,3dsppo,valeforXD,2,Sun Jul 19 02:30:51 2015 UTC,"Before you ask that question, ask yourself why you feel you'd need to partner with any network.  Every day more developers are granting blanket permission for Let's Players to monetize their gameplay. Every day networks are scooping up more and more small and unknowing channels, reducing the ad inventory even more (which means they'd likely backfill with the same AdSense you can use on your own). Every day there's some new site with free music you can use, free tutorials for thumbnails, or free programs to use.  In short, every day the benefits of being networked are shrinking more and more, to the point where in many cases, depending on your size, you'd be handing over a slice of your revenue in return for nothing.   Once you take that into account, and shake off the aging concept that being partnered is somehow ""making it"", the appeal of a network melts away."

You're your own boss after all."
letsplay,3drym0,StarboardSailors,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:57:35 2015 UTC,Think I might be able to help. Had lot of trouble with schedules myself. Tried doing Mon-Friday and taking weekend off. Tried uploading every day. Tried uploading three times a week. Couldn't do any of these and ended up getting burned out. The changing scheldules also messed with my subs a bit also.   Scheldules are important. People like to know when a video is coming out. For me a a video every second day worked perfect. Day for recording and editing and a day for uploading [bad internet connection].   Channels like Criken only upload once a week. These video are highly edited and if you do decide to do one a week then that video better be good.   Really it's just trial and error and see what works best for you. Not sure if this actually helped a lot but these are my thoughts on it anyway. :]
letsplay,3drym0,Lessthantruthful,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:16:15 2015 UTC,How long are your videos? If you are short in recording time one option is to split up the video and just upload a part each day.  Having some sort of schedule is nice however be upfront with the audience and let them know what to expect from you.
letsplay,3drym0,basedradio,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:42:32 2015 UTC,"If you can't get a working schedule, I think you might want to put out some kind of explanation video or something, just say that your current situation doesn't allow you the time you need to create content at a regular pace. Or at least that's what I'd do."
letsplay,3drym0,-amiibo-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:11:42 2015 UTC,"Personally I believe in quality over quantity. A lot of people here feel it's needed to pump out a video every day to reach any measure of success doing this, as a smaller channel, a strict schedule isn't as important as actually having decent content and realistically, your subs probably won't notice if you miss a day.  If you're rushing to finish a recording or an edit to get it out there, your schedule is too regular so it might be worth dropping back a bit."
letsplay,3drym0,YoungBonesGaming,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:43:50 2015 UTC,"I had missed uploading the past four or five days (I upload twice a day at noon and 3 PM) due to a lightning strike, and as a result, I lost five subs.   It really just depends on who your subs are. If you have subs that want your content out all the time with no missed uploads/days, then they will unsubscribe if they feel you can't do that. If you have subs who like you for you and will stick with you no matter what, they won't unsubscribe and will eagerly await your next video."
letsplay,3dru3a,ImmortalMG,2,Sat Jul 18 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"I have a weird ritual I do before recording. I take a drink of water, breathe for a minute, sing a song quietly and slowly get louder and then think about exactly what I'm going to say for the first 10 seconds of the video before I hit record lol. I just live with my girlfriend and son but I'm always worried they will hear me recording when I first start, even though she knows what I do and is totally supportive of it. If you are worried about people hearing you just do what I do and sing first and get slowly louder and eventually you will just say fuck it, talking to myself is way better than shitty singing haha."

When you are recording the video you are recording for people who will eventually watch it. So your basically having a conversation with a mute who can not respond.  If anyone were to come in and ask you what you are doing you could say what anyone else would say. ""I'm talking to my audience"". The moment you post that video it is no longer talking to yourself. I know others sometimes prepare cards in advance or sometimes they record after playing. I do my recordings from 12am to 6am so I just have to make sure that I am quiet tho. There was this awkward moment tho where my 6 year old brother walked in on a recording and I had to try to shoo him out without distracting from the gameplay. I still don't think I will be able to salvage that clip."

Going off of the flip side to that, there's always going to be things in life you don't feel like doing anymore.  I wouldn't let that feeling dictate your direction.  Sit down and have a heart to heart with yourself.  Where do you want to be in a month?  A year?  Five years?  Map that out for yourself if you haven't already.  If you have a goal and a passion to be the #1 Super Nintendo LetsPlayer for instance, put that down and the different goals you'd think you might need to hit on the way.  Then start consistently chipping away.  Know that you're not always going to feel like it.  Know that from the start.  All of the top business leaders, atheletes, and Youtuberrs would not be where they are if they simply went by their feelings.  Over time, feelings can be a guage, but day to day they fluctuate WAY to much to be any kind of a reliable guide.  Evaluate your progress week to week, month to month.  Bring someone along side of you to help give an outside perspective on your progress, to keep you accountable.  Are you hitting some of your goals and benchmarks?  Are you creating new ones?  Maybe you are starting to see more potential for yourself in Nintendo than Super Nintendo.  Test those waters too then, guage those results.  This is just my perspective and opinion so take it for what you will.  I hope you find the direction and course you're looking for, either in videos or in whatever other adventures in life you set upon.  Have a great day."

letsplay,3dqdmv,gpemby,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, might still be a stigma with being a Youtuber, a lot of people think it's a foolish thing to pursue and will tell you as much.  I watched a pretty sweet video recently where Stan Lee was talking about how embarrassed he used to be telling people in parties that he did comics.  He would simply say he did children's books and try to walk away.  Imagine if he had let those insecurities he had be his guide.    graphic design would probably be a much more stable career to pursue if that's what you're passionate about. And you need to pay the bills one way or another.  If youtubing is a goal, then having graphic design chops would be an excellent way to make money with that and still tie in to your goals.  You could have the skills to create better material for your videos as well as meeting new people in the community by assisting them.  Either way though, setting goals for yourself and benchmarks and figuring out what you want to pursue over the long term still holds up.  If it's graphic design, set to be the best one you can.  Do you need to go back to school.  Are there free online materials to pursue? What type of graphic designer do you want to be?  Can you intern somewhere?  Should you freelance? What are the best freelance sites for designers?  Money is important but don't let it drive your entire life.  For instance, I work in the Studio side of an advertising company and have worked there for 7 years.  I'm greatful that it pays the bills but it's not longer part of the long term goals I have for myself.  I'm by no means quitting my job though.  I am however working hard at my goals to be in a position to eventually do so.  And I'm using a lot of the skills I've learned along the way to help me with that.

It does help those at the bottom of the barrel, but even with infinite money, it's pretty well documented that the rich and idle just consume and consume and consume. I don't mean just eating (they are often fit), I mean they spend all their time taking and not giving. They will watch tons of movies, go on a thousand holidays, eat a million luxury meals, but all of that just masks this feeling of dissatisfaction.  True happiness IMO is giving things to other people. Whether that be your time and effort, your humour, your architectural craftsmanship, or entertainment on Youtube. If at the end of the day you are satisfied, THAT is happiness.  Obviously this might not be true for everyone, but it doesn't hurt to live by. If you really get no joy from this, then it might be something you should stop doing. That said, if you feel really, genuinely happy when you get lots of views and likes, it might be worth the work. On the flip side of everything I have said, nothing you do will be fun 100% of the time. You need to weigh out your options."

Otherwise, the old standard of a towel on top of your hands will help muffle the sounds, but the mechanical noise will still be picked up I wager.  You have an extremely sensitive microphone that's going to pick up the sound of everything in front of it--there's only so much you can do with loud gear and a hot mic."

If you got the normal snowball, make sure the switch on back is set to 2 (-10db padding). Assuming you're speaking directly at the mic, that setting should get rid of a lot of peripheral noise.  It also helps, if you have it around, to put some sort of cushon or padding between your microphone and your desk (sound carries through solid surfaces). I had the good fortune of receiving one of my amazon purchases packed between two pieces of foam padding that bear a striking resemblance to your standard soundproofing material. So I make sure to always rest my microphone on that."
letsplay,3drwej,DigitalShadowGaming,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, I also use a Blue Snowball Mic and had some of the same issues (Das Keyboard with Blue Clicky switches). I tried the towel trick, but I tend to use a lot of keys during games and reach all over the place. Often needed to look so that did not work for me.  Obviously getting the mic onto a stand will help with any vibration transfer from pressing the keyboard/mouse click or slam/bumps, etc.   However, the biggest help I found was using a Noise Gate. With a Gate on, I could get away with having a fan on behind me and it only picks up when I talk (but that leaves annoying background noise when you do lol)  You can do this in post-recording with audacity, but I've been doing it in pre-recording with good results. Requires a virtual audio cable and DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) software to get it working, but it's the only way I use a mic period now.  Note: Clicky Noise from your keyboard will still get through regardless, mechanical keyboards are loud. You can practice and get used to NOT bottoming out the keys to make it quieter, or get O-rings to place under each key to prevent bottoming out and make it quieter."

I have seen some crazy solutions on here, like putting acoustic foam inside 3/4 of a shoebox and putting that over your keyboard. A towel has helped me, but I've got a chiclet keyboard.  What has worked for me is a scissor arm to get right up in my face then turning my mic gain down to 5-10. (Audacity or windows, it's the same measurement) I live less than a mile from an airport (on the take-off side) and the engines don't get picked up at all.

It wasn't really anything to do with views or subs. I was running one series of videos, had about 30 subs, and a few hundred views and I enjoyed it. But I didn't think I wanted this to be a thing for me.   The time and money investment for good equipment was high and I wasn't sure if I'd ever really learn the art. Fast forward 2 months when I stumbled upon this community. I took all the advice I could, checked out others channels, met some amazing people, and decided ""Yes... I want to do this"". I put the pedal to the floor and Haven't stopped. So far I'm insanly happy with the outcome and its proof that with hard work, determination, and learning (Whether from success or failure) eventually can pay off.   I've learned so much in editing, audio, working with graphic design on GIMP. Even if I turned back now, those skills will forever be with me. All the tutorials I've watched, the things I've made. No one can take that from me. I feel like the most valuable thing for me at this point is the massive amount of knowledge I'm taking in. That's worth more then anything else at this point."

I haven't even posted a video yet (I have all the gear I need though) but I really do find myself hesitating at times. I absolutely love games and discussing them but if I'm going to start producing content around this hobby that I love I want their to be a chance of being successful. I'm not looking to be a millionaire or anything like that but if I produce content I want people to actually watch it and part of me worries that might not happen.  I feel like I'm a little too late to the party at times. One advantage that people like PewDiePie and UberhaxorNova had is that they were the first to the party. I think if you had some of these guys start on youtube from scratch today they would have a harder time generating a following. I'm not saying they're not talented or anything like that but I think that a big part of why a lot of the let's play channels that have millions of subs are where they are is because they starting doing it before so many other people.  Now-a-days it just seems like they're's SO many let's players. I just wonder if I'd be wiser to try my hand converting a different hobby into a successful venture.

letsplay,3dp7at,jcmonk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"To record with Obs depends on a few things. First thee are profiles, these allow you to have set ups for different games. Alot of my games require individuals settings to work and this helps with that. So create and save a new profile to identify either the game or if It's streaming.   Once you made one start the selected game. Alt tab back to Obs andchoose a source/scene in the middle bottom area. You may want to add window, game, monitor. You don't need to check them all just one that works for the game. Some games work better full screen or windowed. once you have those, right click and properties. Here you will see a drop down of all the screens Obs detects. You can refresh the list if you went here before launching the game or to double check you have it selected. Also in these options look for the screen resolution. Make sure it's the same as what you want to record at to avoid cut offs.   Now once setting appliedgo to settings on the main Obs screen and go through each option like file name for the game, up the bit rate to 3500, fps can be what you prefer. This is all in the air as you might have to tweak it to work with your pc and game.   If you want to stream or have a video to edit choose the correct file output or source.

For example, I did a Top 10 video about Mario Kart and one of the things on the list was about the Piranha Pipeway track from Mario Kart 8. For that part of the video, I used some gameplay from a race on that track. If you want to keep the viewer really engaged, you can use different clips that all are relevant to a specific game. Like, if one of the games on your list is Fallout 3, you could use a few different clips from Fallout 3. One clip could be the player shooting, another clip could be dialogue, another could be a dramatic clip of the player walking away from an explosion, you get the idea. I also use various images to add more details to the video. Using my Mario Kart example, the part of the video with the Piranha Pipeway track was about the textures of the bushes being the same as the textures of the clouds in a reference to the original Mario Bros. So, I used an image from Mario Bros showing both the clouds and the bushes. In the video, the clip I used also showed both the clouds and the bushes. With the images though, I use various tools to make them appear on screen. Some will come in from the left, slide across the screen, and slide out of the right side of the frame. Sometimes they will come from the bottom and slide to the screen, then fade out. Sometimes they will fade in, and fade out. It really just depends on how I feel about that transition."

letsplay,3dp2gb,nvchad2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:20:05 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, so while I'm not too sure on the exact workings of Vegas itself, I've encountered this problem before with the HDPVR and premiere.  So here's some questions for you.   what capture software are you using?  Is it arcsoft (the old bundled software) or the newer capture program happauge offers on its site?  Arcsoft gave me this issue a lot.  secondly, Are you using the capture software to live record your audio at the same time?  Cause if so, that can cause some troubles from my experience.   Now, I know this is occurring in Vegas, so my previous points may be irrelevant, but they're things to consider.    Now, in Vegas, it could be something as simple as your sequence settings are interfering with the footage itself.    But if you want my personal advice, as someone whose dealt with this before, there isn't an easy fix.  I ended up scrapping my footage and trying again.  It sucks, but it's the trials of LPing.   Here's my process with recording that you may want to try though.  It hasn't failed me yet (knock on wood)  -before capturing, record about 15 seconds or more of footage.  All my lost footage was always the first thing we did for the day.  So I do this to kind of make the pvr get its shit together.   -don't use the audio mixer in the capture software.  Use it only to record gameplay, and use audacity to get audio.  You'll have more options in audio editing and your quality will reflect it.  -update your pvr.  Obvious, I know, but it might be as simple as that.    I'm sorry I couldn't offer more to fix your immediate issue, but you may just have to take the hit and move past it.  Aside from that, try a different editing software.  Premiere is a fantastic alternative.  And maybe try putting the footage in windows movie maker.  Maybe it's just Vegas being dumb.  Make a new project and try it there.  Seriously, these dumb little things could all fix it.   Good luck."
letsplay,3dp2gb,Thecombobreakers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:11:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  We're not using Arcsoft.  This is the newer software I suppose.  Hauppauge Capture.  Yes, we're recording our voice audio as well.  It works flawlessly on the PS4 and the PS3, but nothing using composite cables.  We're not against using Audacity for our voice (we use it for PC stuff) it's just super simple when it works automatically like our newer games.  And you can still open it into Audacity for editing when you open the video in Vegas.  I would hate to just ignore that feature of the PVR since it really is handy for the stuff it DOES work with.   update your pvr. Obvious, I know, but it might be as simple as that.   Is that something more than updating the drivers?  I hadn't tried updating anything other than the capture software.  We'll keep trying things and hopefully something will work.

Does not matter if I hate it cause I am making these videos for them to be entertained not me XD. Now I have gotten over it and iAmMitten1 is right, the more videos you record and edit the less you notice your voice."

letsplay,3do9ss,DavidSpy,2,Sat Jul 18 06:06:46 2015 UTC,"I tend to hate mine at times, it helps adding some bass to it."
letsplay,3do9ss,Doompastry,2,Sat Jul 18 01:35:56 2015 UTC,"I've had some massive voice-related anxiety (still do, just not as bad as before), and I spent years thinking my voice was way worse than it actually is, so I feel fairly confident saying it's all a matter of habit. For the longest time I avoided having to hear myself recorded at all, but then I did a short LP for a friend, and editing that video was more or less like flooding therapy, I guess. I still don't like my voice, but I'm okay with hearing it.  So that's my advice, I guess; just keep exposing yourself to the sound of yourself on recording. Of course you will sound very different from how you hear yourself when speaking, but that's something everyone has to deal with. Most of us sound weird in our own ears, but perfectly fine to other people, after all.  Finding your own commentating style will also help a lot, as that'll do away with some of the awkward ""talking to myself in front of a microphone"" feeling. Just... practice, practice, practice. And learn some sound editing so you can improve the overall quality of your recordings, but that's a pretty basic thing for any aspiring LPer, I think."
letsplay,3do9ss,Addyizoth,2,Sat Jul 18 02:31:10 2015 UTC,One thing I do is read some Wikipedia articles before I start recording to warm my voice up. Most of the time that reduces the number of times I have to clear my throat while recording and it's less likely to crack.
letsplay,3do9ss,McCheeseTits,2,Sat Jul 18 05:33:21 2015 UTC,"I absolutely feel you, bud. I'm grateful that people have told me I have a ""radio"" voice over the years, but it is still jarring to hear it played back to you. I do feel as though I'm getting used to it, slowly. Once we are completely familar with how we sound, it will be alot easier to control the finer nuances."
letsplay,3do9ss,Juliandroid98,2,Sat Jul 18 08:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thattl happen for about a month or 2. I still get cringey moments with things i say/do while recording. Doing let'splays as a group is great for me, because when I say something stupid af I can just cut it out and the other guys talking can sort of drown me out. I've been known to move around conversations just because i say something I don't like."
letsplay,3doxw9,TheCrushSoda,2,Sat Jul 18 01:39:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with these guys. I've had zero problems with the Elgato HD 60. As far as mics go, I use the Blue Yeti with a pop filter. Sounds great. You might be able to get 3 people on that same mic. I've done two and it was fine.  I use Premiere for editing but the learning curve on Vegas is probably more accessible."

It comes with a component cable adapter, and the red video plug works as a yellow composite input.   It cam be a bit unstable at times, just keep an eye on it and make sure it is recording, I lost a few sessions from this, it never stops in the middle of one, just make sure the footage is recording properly before starting."
letsplay,3doxw9,PowerPlaidPlays,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:41:26 2015 UTC,Elgato HD 60 is the best capture device on the market. That one is a given.
letsplay,3doxw9,TehGoobz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:44:55 2015 UTC,"Some capture cards can't do old systems.  However if you're going to play retro games i recommend doing it on the Retron 5.  It has HDMI output so you could easily plug it in to the Elgato HD60.  Which ever capture device you get, just google if it does retro games if you don't get a retron 5.  For mic, i'd recommend AT-2035.  Great mic.  You usually can find a bundle on amazon that includes the shockmount.  I personally have the AT2050. The biggest difference between the two is the type of pickups.  I have 3 options to choose from where as the AT-2035 is set to cardioid only.  If money is not an issue i would recommend that everyone has their own mic and get the AT-2035.  Other wise you could get the AT2050 and turn it to the figure eight setting to accommodate two people.  If the room is sound proofed, you could change it to omni-directional to pick up everyone.  For preamp devices i recommend presonus.  I have the 22VSL.  But depending on your setup, you might need to get the 44VSL so you can have mic's for everyone on one single device.  HTH"

Basically what's happening is Skype and the game audio are being recorded by your software at the same time as they are both being pushed into the same output (your speakers). To resolve this you need to change the output of Skype, so that it's not recorded by the software, but so that you can also hear the conversation as you're playing. A tricky task. You can probably accomplish this with what are known as Virtual Audio Cables. And then you would need to alter what outputs your software records.  In the end it is a somewhat complicated and time-consuming solution. Evaluate whether it's worthwhile."
letsplay,3dnx0c,Incoherencel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:39:27 2015 UTC,"You can set the audio output from Skype independent of your default audio output, so if you plug in some headphones or something you can set Skype to use those and then set your recording software to record whatever your default speakers are.  I have a pair of Turtlebeach headphones that plug into a USB port and the headphone jack, so it has 2 separate audio outputs, so I can hear both Skype and game audio in my headphones but only record the game audio."

Personally I find ""Collaborations"" pretty awkward if the people don't have a mutual understanding of each other and can talk comfortably, and can often times have a negative effect to one or both channels. The only way someone would be willing to do a collaboration with a channel your size is if they find the commentator genuinely interesting or funny. But after reviewing your channel that situation is very rare considering your channel is , for a better word, lacking in ""uniqueness"". But don't be discouraged, the more you keep improving your self and cultivating your own ""youtuber personality"", you'll have people lining up to do videos with you."

I feel its important to make friends and thus your collab videos will seem much more genuine and natural rather than just a one off video featuring another youtuber.  How you find people?

The Elgato Game Capture HD comes bundled with a component cable adapter for the A/V input, so really, it's not a matter of time, it's just a bit of an investment.  If you've never used a Wii with component video before, definitely check it out. My mind was blown to pieces the first time I saw our Wii in 720p.

Even though I doubt anyone currently subscribed to me is going to be like ""WHERE'S THE VIDEO"", retaining that expectation for yourself DOES build good habits."
letsplay,3dnqs4,FabbrizioCalamitous,2,Fri Jul 17 21:08:32 2015 UTC,"I'd say for starting out it's not too big a deal however it should help you a good idea of how much footage you'll need to kind of keep a steady flow going (record X amount during this session to keep me going for X amount of time). We are on vacation right now and have still had our videos releasing steadily! You'll find your rhythm soon enough im sure, it just takes time!"
letsplay,3dlsp6,ImAtlasOk,11,Fri Jul 17 08:38:17 2015 UTC,"Here is my replay to similar post from month ago  Best route for beginner IMO is to take What? How? Why? approach. What am I about to do? How I will do it? Why I did it?  Example: We are playing Resident Evil:  Commentary goes:   (What?)Okay guys I can see two zombies down the corridor but there is also a door there. (How?)We are going to go sneak in to the door and have a peak, (Why?) to make sure there isn't anyone else in there. I don't want to risk bigger fight.   You check the room there is nothing.   (What?) Okay guys room is clear I am quite confident we can take those two down now. (How?) As you can see I'm charging at the one on the left (why?) he is closer and I am hoping to finish him off before the other guy grabs me.   It turns out more zombies appear out of nowhere   (What?) Shit there is like 10 of them (how?) we got to run to this empty room) (why?) I have seen window in there we should be able to jump out on the roof from there. Quick!   And so on. As you practice this will come naturally to you. Share your though process explain why things happen the way you play and if things go according to plan or not.  With time you will learn to add other bits to the commentary and talk casually about what happens around the channel, with game you play etc. But as a new to LP focus on what's going on in the game and explain to viewers why it is that way. In my opinion job of Let's Player is to enhance experience and add to it not just talk about anything over the gameplay footage."

letsplay,3dlsp6,Tsuzihri_07,6,Fri Jul 17 20:18:28 2015 UTC,"First, pauses aren't always bad. I think they cause a nice flow to the video, without someone constantly jabbering about things that could possibly concern no one. For instance, whenever I play a story-driven game, I usually keep talking during cutscenes to a bare minimum.  Whenever I do talk, it's about the game and what I'm spotting on screen, some additional information about the game, like patches and updates, or my channel or myself. I usually try to mix them up good.  For the 'uhms' and 'okays', I edit a lot in my video, and if I can miss the footage, I will edit it out. I have also trained myself more and more to keep them to a minimum. This comes with time."
letsplay,3dlsp6,RustySpongeGaming,3,Fri Jul 17 08:50:28 2015 UTC,"First, pauses aren't always bad. I think they cause a nice flow to the video, without someone constantly jabbering about things that could possibly concern no one.   Absolutely. To add to this, go listen to Vin Scully call a Dodgers game. Specifically, the 1988 World Series when Kirk Gibson hit a game-winning walk-off homerun (they weren't called walk-offs back then... sigh. I'm old). Vin, calling the game as only Vin could, called the play and then shut his yapper for a good stretch of time, much longer than most would.  Most broadcasters (and YouTubers--myself included) could learn a lot from Vin. Knowing when to let the game do the narration for you (aside from obvious cut scenes) isn't always easy to figure out, but silence can be far more powerful than words. It takes time and practice as well as an awareness of what is happening. Silence, in the right moments, can tell your story more effectively than you can with words.   I remember reading an interview in the newspaper (remember those things?) a couple years back and Vin basically said about his call and roughly a minute of silence (think about that: silence for a minute on national television) that there was nothing he could say that was more insightful, entertaining, or otherwise powerful than what was happening right before him. So he shut up, sat back, enjoyed the moment, and let the story tell itself.  /soapbox"

letsplay,3dlsp6,DeekFTW,5,Fri Jul 17 08:57:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I let my viewers know that whatever pause is due to me trying to concentrate. It's a little hard to keep talking constantly. Especially trying to make sure that you don't repeat yourself. It's a good idea to just start let's playing and ironing out the kinks as you go. You'll get better and better until you don't sound as awkward."

Talk about what's on screen Talk about what you're going to do about it Make some jokes to kinda lighten up the mood Be yourself   I say pauses are good, but don't have too many for too long.  I hope I was helpful! Good luck on your YouTube adventures!"
letsplay,3dlsp6,theSecondAgent,3,Fri Jul 17 11:53:53 2015 UTC,"Practice, practice, practice. Pauses aren't always bad but dead air is a killer (pun!). If there are extended moments of no commentary the audience will get bored and leave. You just want to fill up the time by talking through what you are doing in game. Creating backstory for a character or explaining your strategy or even pointing out something funny that's going on.   I noticed a few little um moments while watching my episode back in editing. I like to make notes of what I did in a notebook and then read the notes before recording the next session. The more you practice the better you will get. It's all about getting over the fact that you're essentially talking at a computer screen and not a person and learning to riff with yourself."
letsplay,3dlsp6,QuilavaKing,4,Fri Jul 17 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"The advice you seek is the following:   practice practice practice  prepare some jokes or topics sticky notes on your screen with pointers for yourself practice practice practice   Good luck and get out there and start!

letsplay,3dlsp6,TPofLove,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:52:14 2015 UTC,"its worth noting that sometimes I find humor in the letsplays that have the jokes and topics prepared, that have NOTHING to do with the video. Like once, I was watching a LP of amnesia and he ran out of things to say so started talking about how he was getting a cat, all while being chased. Was pretty hilarious, because he would be chatting, then scream, then carry on chatting normally."
letsplay,3dlsp6,Jonruy,2,Fri Jul 17 11:35:37 2015 UTC,"Massive amounts of practice. I've not done too much of this, but some folks will commentate their commute, doing the dishes, taking a shower, walking to the corner store, etc, etc, etc. Perfect practice makes perfect.  In terms of reducing filler words, the best things that I've come across is to   1) Regularly remind yourself that you want to reduce them. If you're really running full cylinders to reduce them, you could set a timer multiple times a day (10 times? 20? 30?) to remind you not to use them. Also note that this will likely make your speech more eloquent for the rest of your life so... time well spent?  2) try and catch yourself when you do use them. Don't beat yourself up of be hard on yourself, but do acknowledge it and tell yourself you'll catch it beforehand next time.  3) record and review. Record yourself talking (about anything if you're not yet into making Let's Plays. Just grab audacity and record talking about your day or something). After you record, play it back and make a note of every time you use filler words. Again, don't be hard on yourself, but commit to reducing them next time.    Essentially, ""paying attention"" and ""practice"" are the best ways I know if to improve your commentary and reduce your filler words."
letsplay,3dlsp6,TheCamPlays,2,Fri Jul 17 12:59:08 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I saw this advice posted here recently, but while out and about practice narrating your life as if to your viewers. Explain aloud things that are on your mind, what actions you're performing, what you have to do today. When you're in the car narrate what the driver in front of you just did and why it is making you upset. Talk about your destination and why you're going there.   Talking is the most important thing. Getting used to vocalizing your thoughts and getting a good stream of consciousness going. Games take a lot of concentration so you want the talking part to come as naturally as possible."
letsplay,3dlsp6,ebolanation,2,Fri Jul 17 13:22:48 2015 UTC,"I honestly just say whatever pops into my head. I enjoy putting myself into my characters shoes, so i'll say stuff he/she would probably think during whatever is on screen. I've always talked to myself while playing games, which I guess is a little weird xD As for awkward pauses or gaps, i'll either speed up the footage or leave them in. I don't think there's anything wrong with the quiet moments during Let's Plays. In fact, there's some people (Carcinogen) who don't speak much, but still very fun to watch."
letsplay,3dlsp6,IronChariots,2,Fri Jul 17 14:26:15 2015 UTC,"Open my mouth and let words fall out. No thinking, ever. Just make sounds. (Okay, you might want to make sure those sounds turn into words, but after that anything goes.)  Of course, this probably won't sound too professional. lol"
letsplay,3dlsp6,FelvixOpher,2,Fri Jul 17 15:01:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, this is the umpteenth thread I've posted this suggestion in and I'm going to keep posting it until everyone tries it: regardless if you do facecam or audio-only, keep a mirror on your desk so that you can see your face at all times, even if it's just in your peripheral vision. Being aware of yourself while recording makes you less likely to zone out as if you were gaming alone, making you more attentive and engaged with your own commentary."
letsplay,3dlsp6,Avastyescumbags,2,Fri Jul 17 16:23:21 2015 UTC,"For me, I do a lot of my personal channel stuff during post (which means I record game footage first, then record my voice afterwards). This solves a lot of the problems I used to have trying to do everything live since I am prone to focusing too much on the game. Sometimes it is easier for people to do it this way as they can come up with a topic to discuss and then basically just kick back and commentate while watching the video you recorded play out.   Bonus: To stop saying um, stop trying to think of stuff to say. Say whatever comes to mind, and if you can't think of anything, just take a pause. It isn't as awkward as you think it sounds, especially if something intense is going on in the game."

Anyway, my partner and I generally leave the subtitles on and comment over what the characters are saying, hoping the audience is able to keep up. Anything with lengthy text, however, we try to avoid, since we don't want our audience reading the ENTIRE time we're playing.

letsplay,3dlbz5,ImAtlasOk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:11:43 2015 UTC,There is only a few things that need some improvement. One would be some of the commentary seems a bit forced in the Super Mario Bros video. The second would be adding a bit more flair to your channel for your banner and thumbnails specifically. Other than that just keep up the good work!
letsplay,3dlbz5,boon1168,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:35:10 2015 UTC,Thanks so much!  That helps a lot.
letsplay,3dlbz5,Falshane,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:37:32 2015 UTC,"I watched the Mario video, and for your first video it isn't terrible. You have a decent set up, the camera seems a little bit high, your voice comes through clear, and the audio levels are well balanced. The only downside is that the commentary does seem  a bit stilted and repetitive. The most important thing, though, is to keep practicing and working on your improv. I look back at some of my old videos and love seeing how far I've come. I'm sure you'll be bale to do the same the more you try! Keep it up man!"

The facecam seemed to be at an awkward angle, it seemed like you had to strain your neck when you talked.

Coming off of that, we're ready to start releasing some new content, starting with Part 1 of our new Lords of the Fallen series.   I recently had another member of The ClassyCast down to visit me in Texas for a couple of weeks, and while he was down here we recorded like madmen. Unfortunately, due to the nature of trying to record multiple people in one room on a budget, we ended up having to use just one mic. I'd appreciate some feedback on how I handled our mic audio for this one, as it's a whole different beast than doing everyone's mic separately like I'm used to doing with our Payday 2 series. I've already identified a few areas where I can improve, and have started incorporating those changes into the second episode.   Also, for those of you that have been enjoying our Payday 2 series, fear not as Episode 10 will release next Friday, and will continue our collaboration with SGTRoss from the Squad development team."
letsplay,3dlbz5,FriendshipBreakers,3,Fri Jul 17 16:16:03 2015 UTC,The video quietly is spot on! Your audio on the other hand could be much more crisp. But audio is always a tough one to nail down completely so keep working at it! Other than that this is a great first video of a series!

The 'cold open' part will change with each episode, but the logos and whatnot will always remain the same.   2) Video feels spot on, no problems there.   Thanks. :)   3) How did you implement the ""Skip"" feature? That as I'm watching and taking notes the coolest thing so far. :P   Just set up a spotlight annotation, and use the 'video' link. Use the link for the video, and have the link start at whatever time you want to skip to.   4) I've not seen this game before, but your playthrough has got me interested.   I'm glad! That's the whole idea. I felt like Lords of the Fallen got trashed for some pretty stupid reasons. All the technical issues have (for me) been patched out, and while the game isn't anywhere near the length or depth of the Dark Souls games, I feel it's still good enough to stand on its own.   5) Thanks for making me feel old.

I think thats something to improve on.. but its not that bad.. overall I rly enjoyed the video :D"

letsplay,3dlbz5,SoliloquyGaming,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:24:08 2015 UTC,"1 - Maybe this is just me, but I think you should maybe swap your opening line order.  ""Welcome to Alan Wake Part 4.  Last time we .....""  Seems to me it would flow a bit more smoothly.  2 - The audio levels are a bit...off.  It's a bit too much of a spread.  The game audio can't be heard unless I turn up the volume, but then the commentary is too loud.  Turn one up or the other down a bit.  3 - While it can be done sparingly, I think if you're going to summarize the cutscenes while they're happening, you can cut them down a bit.  Summarizing every cutscene while it's happening isn't necessary.  I, as the viewer, can see what's happening.  Hope these couple of pointers help!"
letsplay,3dlbz5,fromelmstreet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:40:08 2015 UTC,Yeah. I am trying to experiment with hooking people in the beginning. I didn't successfully hook in the beginning this time.

letsplay,3dlbz5,scoutfreak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:03:45 2015 UTC,"Alright after watching your video I saw two big no-no's right off the bat.  1.Refrain from talking over in game dialog, especially if it's part of the main story (Unless the story is irrelevant or complete trash then feel free). This can turn off A LOT of people.  2 Video starts abruptly in the middle of an important segment (Dialog, action, cutscene, ect.) this can ruin the continuity of your videos as a whole and can be very annoying to the viewer when the video just abruptly ends during the middle of something important. Always try to find a spot in the recordings were there is down time and edit your videos based on that, even if you have to shorten/lengthen the video.  Also another note,the video lacked actual commentary, most of the video was mostly silent with only a view comments between action sequences."
letsplay,3dlbz5,fromelmstreet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:39:05 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I'll keep an eye on this for future episodes. That's the very beginning of the segment. Often I end on a cutscene for videos. Maybe I'll save the cutscene for the beginning of videos?    Thanks for your feedback!
letsplay,3dlbz5,ChangeBrulee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:01:25 2015 UTC,Here's a list of things   Your commentary is very loud compared to the in-game audio. Keep your in-game audio louder and keep your commentary levels a bit above the in-game dialouge levels. Also I'd suggest using auto-ducking. This can be done in ex. Audacity. Avoid talking over dialouge. It's hard to keep track on what both are saying. The way you're talking is clear and relaxed. That's good. You also sound a little bit like G.R.R Martin :P   Good luck on your series. I hope that these few notes will guide you on your way to improving your content :)
letsplay,3dlbz5,fromelmstreet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:45:35 2015 UTC,I'll look into auto-ducking in Audacity. On it! I will fix this in the next video.  Thanks!   Thanks so much for your feedback! :D

A few comments:   The video started right in the middle of the scene, which can be a little jarring. Try to start videos when nothing is happening, that way you can get straight to your intro. If you can't find a good place to stop, just skip to where you can and recap. Your voice is very clear and audible, but I felt like the commentary was basically just a recap of what was going on or information about the game. While I did find the information interesting, I think the video could benefit from being a different kind of format than a playthrough."
letsplay,3dlbz5,fromelmstreet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:08 2015 UTC,Yeah. I feel awful about this. It's something I am going to be extra diligent about from here on.  What format do you suggest? Analysis style? Smaller videos? I'd love to hear your thoughts.   Thanks for your feedback. :D

If you use it once or twice, cool, it's a funny little way to fix things.  If you use it constantly, you're just inept and need to get your settings fixed before you record.  There's three of you, someone should be paying enough attention to catch things like that.  So, for this, all good.  Just bear in mind it'll become annoying if repeated often.  Audio is not bad.  Game audio is a bit quiet, but not too quiet.  Bump it up a bit and it should be good."

letsplay,3dlbz5,TazerLad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I just finished up watching your drunk Zelda gameplay and I very much enjoyed it. I loved the thumbnail, it's funny and I didn't quite know what to expect. I was surprised when I found out that neither of you were drunk while playing. Haha. That being said, I think the gimmick you have will be good for some laughs to come when you interact with Zelda and the Gorons in future installments.    You two have good chemistry it feels like. Despite not getting into any gameplay for the first 5 minutes of the video, I didn't feel like nothing was happening and only really noticed that until after the fact. One suggestion I do have though is to maybe introduce yourselves at the start for newcomers, especially if this is the start of a new Playthrough. Personal opinion but I think it helps the audience identify with you more.   I enjoyed the sidebars you have and the fact that it actually contains pertinent information to the game rather than just a background or something. My only concern is that the right hand side top emblem might not come into play for a good ten episodes of your playthrough, depending on progress, and could leave some people confused if they (God forbid) don't know anything about the Legend of Zelda. That being said, I can't really think of anything else to put there in its stead. Maybe key items? Like the Ocarina and currently known songs like it has in the menu with blue notes being the ones you know and grey ones being ones you don't. Just an idea, and then you can swap out the bottom bit once Link transitions to the second part of his journey.   Overall great job. I think you guys are good and maybe with a slight improvement to your mics and more practice (as we all need) you can be great. :)   -TazerLad"

My opinions  Your audio is fantastic, good voice, Comfy to listen to you. Your commenting style and sparse editing makes me think you should be streaming this too. The conversation you two are having is fine, but it's is slow and more like background noise, also your skill level isn't very interesting, ie. not impressively good or bad.   Advice, Keep making vids to practice talking and being more interesting of a gamer and speaker. Try streaming, its a nice and I think fits with your style.   I feel you are doing fine, and millions else could find you riveting as you get yourself out there."

We are still in the sweet spot of learning and adapting ourselves to a standard for every video.  We will continue to press onwards into the void of youtube and hopefully we keep improving, thank you again so much for your comments."

letsplay,3dlbz5,T3CHN0B4BBL3,0,Fri Jul 17 18:55:54 2015 UTC,"Was only able to post one video this week, but I'm pretty happy with it. It's a playthrough of Crypt of the Necrodancer using music submitted by small artists. I'm not too happy with the title, so let me know what you think would be more catchy. Let me know what you think!   Crypt of the Necrodancer | Zone 1 | Viewer Submitted Music"
letsplay,3dlbz5,HardLeg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:58:28 2015 UTC,"Greetings good sir, just got done watching your video, and here are my thoughts.  On a technical level everything is solid.  Audio/visual quality is good enough, and the audio was balanced nicely so that I could hear both you and the music fairly well.  My only nitpick in this area is that your vocal audio sounded a bit rough, like you were a bit too close to the microphone.  Hard to tell if it's just your mic, if you are too close, or if it's something to do with the way you're mixing, but if you want things to be perfect I'd look into trying to improve your audio, it's not bad by any means but it is noticeably distorted.  As for you ability to entertain it was decent, watching you was entertaining, and you did a good job of explaining the various mechanics of the game and alternating between listening to the music and talking.   Unfortunately it wore thin at about the 10 minute mark and I was pretty bored by the end.  Normally I'd recommend cutting some footage out of your playthrough, but since it's a music based game you probably wouldn't want to do that, as it would disrupt the beat.  I'm not sure how difficult it is to change out the songs, or if you can during a game, but switching to a new set of tracks after one or two deaths might help keep the pace up.  Alternatively I might suggest you try streaming this game instead of filming it as an LP.  The musical nature and limited speaking on your part makes it perfect for the type of long sessions that work better on Twitch than Youtube, plus you could get song suggestions in real time.  Finally there's your title.  Generally you want to put the most original part of your title first, the part that you'll change with every episode, followed by the game title.  That way when the audience scans your videos they don't all look the same and start with ""Crypt of the Necrodancer"".  As for the words you used I think Viewer 'Created' Music, or Viewer 'Made' Music would be better, since it better implies that the music was sent in by the creators of the music, and is not other people's music that viewers requested.  Also, if you do future episodes of this, it might be cool to split the music into different genres for each episode, so they can have a theme, one episode do rock, one dubstep, hiphop, etc.  So overall a good video, a little long for my tastes, but certainly interesting.  Refine the setup a little bit and I think it would be awesome.  Anyway, hope this feedback helps, best of luck in the future, and have a great weekend! :)  P.S. If you're looking for some cool and challenging music for Necrodancer, look up RainbowDragonEyes.  Not sure if you could film it, but seems like it would be fun to play in this kind of game, or at least worth a laugh."
letsplay,3dlbz5,Shimmytox,0,Sat Jul 18 04:13:35 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, I haven't been here for a while. how are you? :) So, my channel is almost at what I want it to be and I just want to know if I'm something missing. I recently changed my recording location so I got a bit of an echo in my voice recording (quality is not that good right now), but I will work on it, asap. I have a 2 facecam setup and you probably will say that its not necessary, but I like it and maybe change it a little bit, but I will definitely stick with it.. so yeah.. maybe just watch 10 seconds and tell me what you think, if you have the time. Thank you. <3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQnVnECVE4"
letsplay,3dlbz5,DeekFTW,2,Fri Jul 17 05:03:55 2015 UTC,I feel like the two camera thing can work especially with two people in the video. I would have zoomed them in a little more on each of you so it would look like they are getting their own individual shots. I also liked how you have topics picked out top talk about. It gives the commentary more direction than just focusing on the game itself.
letsplay,3dlbz5,Shimmytox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:13:18 2015 UTC,"thank you, yeah.. hmm do you think we should put more space between us.. and The zooming idea is great. thank you very much :D"
letsplay,3dlbz5,DeekFTW,2,Fri Jul 17 05:15:59 2015 UTC,My first thought was to get you to have me space in between you two but I didn't know if that were possible because of how you needed to play the game. But if possible I would say get a little space so you don't show up across both cameras.
letsplay,3dlbz5,iAmMitten1,2,Fri Jul 17 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"Since you already said you will be working on the audio, I won't go into it too much. But it is definitely one of the bigger things you need to work on. I like the idea of a ""PodPlay"", and I enjoyed listening to you talk about how you feel about upcoming movies. Not that you can really do much about it, but there were a few times when I found it a but difficult to understand you through your accents. That's probably because I primarily watch videos made by people in America. It's not a big deal, but I think it might look nicer if you use the background image as the border for the facecams instead of just black. Having a facecam in each corner for each person is fine, but you should relocate them so that you can only see one person in each. It took me a second to figure out that there wasn't 3 people in the video.   Overall, not bad. Just a few technical things to work on."
letsplay,3dlbz5,Shimmytox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:16:41 2015 UTC,"haha yeah.. now that you say it. it rly looks like 3 guys xD  .. yeah sorry about the commentary.. we are not nativ english speaker and the new recording location gives us some bad echo that I have to fix.. maybe we should talk a little slower. anyway, thank you for taking your time and writing this feedback :)"
letsplay,3dlbz5,ChaoticSmiley,2,Fri Jul 17 05:33:41 2015 UTC,"Right off the bat I notice the dual camera setup and actually love it! It's a nice way to kinda capture everything going on with both of you and helps give a face to the voice of the other player. But I did take way too long to realise there are just 2 of you xD Might want to zoom in a bit. Do you two play together a lot? Because there was really good teamwork between you two. Now I did have a hard time understanding you guys at times but it didn't really ruin anything for me so it's whatevs. The video was good and audio could be better but all in all, I thought it was good c: Keep it up!"
letsplay,3dlbz5,Shimmytox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:17:24 2015 UTC,"this is actually the first time we did something like this together .. yeah the camera positioning is a bit awkward you are right ... yeah we have a rly bad echo here in this new location, I have to fix that, it rly disturbs the audio.. and we are not nativ english speaker so maybe we should improve that too.. anyway. thank you very much :)"
letsplay,3dlbz5,heyskater137,2,Fri Jul 17 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"So the dual cam thing is a unique idea, but I think it could be pulled off a bit better.  There's two main ways I could see on improving this.  One, you could point the cameras so it seems more like you each have your own camera.  I would just keep each of you completely in your own frame.  The second thing I would consider would to be to cut between angles.  Think of a mutli-camera sitcom, with cutting back and forth between angles based on who is talking.  Your commentary is pretty solid.  It's very laid back and calm.  At times you guys did border a bit on sounding bored.  The part that stands out the most is near the beginning when you guys were very first talking about the DC movies.  You guys kind of slowed for a minute as you decided whether or not to talk about it.  The outro was solid as well.  I would say try to bring it a bit more to life though.  Adding some footage from other videos can make it more enticing to actually click on a video.  Also I would offset your animations so they're not going off all at once.  Animate one thing at a time like Update Tuesday, then Next video, etc.  This would make it a bit cleaner in my opinion.    I checked out your channel as well.  Thumbnails are good for the most part.  A bit plain, and adding some branding could help.  Like your logo somewhere.  Your banner was solid, and I like your thumbnail.  On your channel itself I would suggest adding and featuring a playlist of your best videos. If potential viewers come to your page it's nice to present to them your best works for consideration."
letsplay,3dlbz5,Shimmytox,2,Fri Jul 17 05:18:17 2015 UTC,"thank you :D yeah. I thought so too, some people already pointed out its confusing and I thought so too after watching it. too bad I have 3 more recordings before I can change that :< .. yeah the ending is rly weird, I think I should just animate the subscribe thing.. thanks again :)"
letsplay,3dlbz5,SoliloquyGaming,0,Fri Jul 17 05:29:34 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone,  Two things, take your pick.  First is literally 90 seconds long, the other, under 20 minutes.  Whichever floats your boat!  This one is 90 seconds of highlights  Whereas this is 20 minutes of badassery  Thanks ladies and gents! And remember, be honest. I can take it."
letsplay,3dlbz5,2PGChannel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:20:27 2015 UTC,"Hey man, i just checked out your highlight reel today, here's my opinion: First off I like how it was set out, having each game in order with its own music and whatnot, a lot of peoples channel trailers are just a bundle of stuff happening that can be disorientating, especially for people who haven't seen them before, which is who the trailer is aimed towards anyway, so that was well done.  On the other hand, a lot of the included moments you had, not much commentary wise seemed to be going on. If you want the trailer to show you off, in future at least make a note to include more of your actual input so people get a sense of you. Basically need to let your trailer advertise you more!  Other than that...i think most people would say it was a little lengthy for a channel trailer. You might have better luck having a greater number of shorter snippets chucked in for a length of 30s - 1min. But then again if you get more feedback on here listen to what others have to say, It may not be that big an issue."
letsplay,3dlbz5,SoliloquyGaming,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:43:07 2015 UTC,"Ironically, the two things you mention were directly juxtaposed in my mind as this came to development.  Not wanting it to jump around like crazy or be disorienting, I decided elongating the trailer to accommodate for the flow would be worth it.  My logic is that if I haven't sold them on it in the first 30 seconds anyway, whether they tone out or the video ends is sort of a moot point.  It's risky, but the fact that you commented on it's flow validates it's length in my mind.  Thanks for checking it out!"
letsplay,3dlbz5,scoutfreak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:58:29 2015 UTC,"Well the problem I see with the trailer is that it starts off sounding like an infomercial. Personally i found it a bit off putting. Like you said, the first few seconds are what are important in catching your viewer and when you start off with ""here's why you should watch us"", it can definitely turn some people away. A trailer should do at least one of two jobs. Show what your channel can offer them or raise their interest about your channel so that they browse around a bit.  A good example of a great intro would be JefMajor's. It's entertaining, interesting right off the bat, and gives the viewer and instant impression on his silly, immature personality. Now not everyone's trailer has to be as polished or well done as this, but I feel that meeting at least some of these marks can make a big difference."
letsplay,3dlbz5,DeekFTW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:27:57 2015 UTC,"I only had time to check out the 90 second video unfortunately but here's my thought:   If you are going to use this as a channel trailer I would cut it down. I would probably take it down at least to 45 seconds. The beginning of the video had me but it felt like it dragged on the father we got in to it. I would say you should pick just a couple of the very best highlights that showcase your style and keep them short. Maybe a good joke or a funny reaction or two. Keep it moving and keep me, the viewer, interested enough to want to subscribe. Then you need a call to action. Maybe an outro that says thank you for subscribing or something along those lines. Maybe in your introduction you hint at what your subscribers have come to know Soliloquy as. The subtle subscribers name drop hints at clicking that little red button. Your production quality seems pretty good which also helps when a viewer is considering whether or not to subscribe.   Good luck out there!"
letsplay,3dlbz5,SoliloquyGaming,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:43:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for checking it out.  A subtle call to subscribe; that's a good idea.  I think I can add one of those 'cards' that pops in the corner with a link to do just that.  As to the length, yeah, it's a touch longer.  It's a risk, but the flow of the video becomes harder to maintain as it gets shorter and shorter.  A balancing act I'll have to improve on."
letsplay,3dlbz5,jjfshow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:00:52 2015 UTC,"Checked out your highlight reel, I thought that the concept is great with having an actually order to what your showing instead of random highlights and over the top dubstep music. The only thing you  might need to do is cut down the length of the video, I enjoyed it but for a trailer to your channel most people will tune out maybe 25-30 seconds in. Try to cut down the clips themselves or eliminate some if you can."
letsplay,3dlbz5,SoliloquyGaming,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:52:21 2015 UTC,"I'm relying on the fact that I will be able to sell them on the channel in the first 30 seconds anyway, such that whether they tune out or the shorter video ends, the result is still that their next click is towards one of my other videos.  It was hard to cut it down much further without sacrificing the flow and order, but that'll be the thing I bear in mind for the next one.  Thanks for stopping in!"
letsplay,3dlbz5,Warthong,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:02:59 2015 UTC,"I checked out the channel trailer because I am short on time.   Right off the bat your introduction sounds strange to me for some reason, what mic are you using? It sounds a lot better in the clips.  Secondly; in my opinion your clips would be better if they included more of your commentary rather than just the game play.  Third; add in a little call to action in the end of the video. Just saying something like Thanks for watching and dont forget to subscribe! would push the viewer in the rigth direction.   Last little bit of advice; be wary about including the radio music in Fallout 3 if you are planning on monetizing your videos. I know a lot of bigger YouTubers who avoid it like a plague because they dont want copyright strikes on their channel.  Keep it up though, you'll work it all out eventually! :)"

My advice might be flawed because of this!    I think you said the audio was distorted, but as was said it's a little quiet. I would suggest using a vocal enhancer or bass boost to bring your voice out a little bit more, if your video editor supports one!    I didn't notice much from the reduced framerate, I think playing an older game helps that a lot - the quality looked nice!    Every jump I made you were talking. This is great! Even if your commentary isn't AWESOME (which the parts I heard were amusing and engaging), just keeping the voice going can really help when people jump ahead in your videos.    IDK if with a game like this you can do any cuts of open world driving from point A to point B (because of the narration and stuff in game), but it might drop your minutes down if you were looking to do that due to retention, or maybe even split it into two 10m videos?    As was mentioned, the annotation came in a bit early, and the ending was forced - a possible workaround is a fade to black with a voiceover after, splitting the video, and picking up in another video.    Overall I'd say I watched about 10 minutes of your video, and I say it's pretty good! Keep it up!"

The room I record in has yellow walls, and the lightbulb itself produces yellow light. It's also behind me, so I have to mess around with the lighting/coloration settings a lot before I record. I'm hoping to put up a black curtain to cover the wall to stop reflection and also get a faint white light ASAP."
letsplay,3dlbz5,onionknave,0,Fri Jul 17 16:40:10 2015 UTC,"Okay! (rofl) So I think I've got my channel situated, and I think I've got enough content on reel I can meet my demands for decently edited stuff - now I need you to look at it and tell me why it sucks!    Things for you to please look at please!    My Channel! - What do you think about the icon, and the channel art?    Channel Intro - I don't know how I feel about not having any voice in this. I should add voice to this, as soon as I perfect my 80's cartoon announcer voice. Thoughts?    Games With Girlfriend! - This is a thing I decided to do since girlfriend wanted to play vidjagamez with me. I know her audio sucks, so I edited in text for it and will correct it in the future. I went with a montage, because there was an hour of footage from the first chapter.    Thanks!"
letsplay,3dlbz5,ChangeBrulee,2,Fri Jul 17 08:38:01 2015 UTC,"I'll type a few notes while I watch:   Icon and channel art looks good Your channel intro is good Your in-video intro is also very good. It's short, which is good. It's very difficult to hear what you're saying. The texting helps, but that's not enough imo. I almost didn't notice you were talking in the beginning. I think it's better to cut out parts rather than fast forwarding it. Practice your commentary. I think there's way too little commentary adding value to it. I see you're quite new so that'll improve over time. As for just starting out I think you're doing rather good.   I'd say the most important things to work with is your audio and commentary. Good luck! :)"

The text on the side, it's not really needed but it could just be personal preference.   With the icon, the text at the bottom is unreadable, I'd say just take it out entirely to be honest, much to small to put any readable words anyways.   I'll let someone else do videos!"
letsplay,3dlbz5,AlternaArcadius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:10:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like a show called 'Games With Girlfriend' could turn out really great! However you should think about what would happen to the show if you guys broke up, just try to keep that in mind y'know.  Also, I feel that 6 minutes and 46 seconds is a bit on the short side of a video, since this is a montage you could probably make it a bit longer."

letsplay,3dlbz5,onionknave,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:07:59 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah - this was an impromptu recording session. Girlfriend was on the bed, I was at the desk, my mic was picking up the game on the TV and OBS was picking up the game on the PC, PLUS the mic was at a weird angle. There's one more episode where the audio is going to suck like that, but afterwards we should have it fixed. Thank you!"
letsplay,3dlbz5,MadammeMarkus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"Hey, Ian!  Your channel looks amazing! The small text on your icon is pretty much unreadable though, so you might wanna change that or just simply remove the small text and keep the ""OK"" logo.  The Intro is phenomenal! It worked very well without the voice, but as your channel grows you might wanna improve it further. Don't attempt doing it without having perfected your 80's cartoon announcer voice. If you aren't 100% comfortable in that voice it might ruin the intro. For now, it's perfect!  I checked out both of your videos, and they are sooo different from eachother. The Games with Girlfriend one is funny to watch, but as you said yourself the audio isn't doing the video any favors. That should absolutely be your prio number 1 to fix.  The Vain Glory one, I have to say, I didn't get. You sound almost super bored in the video, and the poor audio doesn't help it. You need to get a recording device that doesn't generate as much background noice as the phone. You could until you get a proper mic use a program like Audacity ( it's free ) to remove background noice and improve audio a little with some editing. There are great and easy to follow guides on YouTube.  That was my most prominent thoughs as I watched through your videos. If you have any questions or anything just let me know, and I'll see if I can help you out! I left you a sub to help you grow! Have a good one! /Statn, from Up To No Good"
letsplay,3dlbz5,onionknave,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:19:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts! A lot of folks have mentioned removing the icon text, so I reckon I'll do that.    I didn't want to publish the Vain Glory video. I'm not sure why I did. I had my fans running in the background, and I was trying to multitask, and it ended up really poor. But I think, at the time, I had just had enough of not having anything up there, so I put it up anyway - will be fun for a look back in a year or so when I can just cringe at it!

letsplay,3dlbz5,MadammeMarkus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:11:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, Kemp!  I checked out your videos and the best feedback I could muster is this:   I think it would do your videos very much good if you started each video off with some general info about the game. Releasedate, publisher, platform but most of all the ""story"" or ""purpose"" of the game. Dedicate perhaps 1 minute of the start of the video to this, so that people like me, who haven't ever played or even seen any of these games know what it is I'm watching. On the Wizard of Legend video I kept thinking of how you focused on the positive side of the abilities. It would be very interesting to hear about your thoughts on how the abilites could work against you. Like the Ball Lightning move can be stressful to aim during overwhelming situations. Just small thoughts like that. Your intro and commentary is of amazing quality for a channel your size. A nice sign of dedication!   That's all I could think of! Have a great day and good luck in the future! /Statn from Up To No Good"
letsplay,3dlbz5,Kemp_J,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:07:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks, very useful feedback :)  In my newer videos I'm starting to add in a little information panel that slides in from the side while I give my intro. It's only in one published video so far as a test, but I think it will be useful in regard to your first point. I included the name, status (alpha, beta, released, etc), developer/publisher, and locations it can be bought from. Platform is a good addition which I somehow didn't think of. I'll try to get better at describing the game as well, that's something I know is a weakness of mine. My intros and outros tend to get a bit rushed because I can easily get really awkward in them.  Thank you for the compliments with regard to the commentary. I still hate my voice, so it's good to hear it's not so bad ;)"

letsplay,3dlbz5,BossRoomAhead,2,Fri Jul 17 10:56:44 2015 UTC,ok so step one: you should set up channel navigation so your channel doesnt look like a long list. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etMCVx-fpTo (this will show you how to do that) 2: you should probly looking at custom thumbnails with maybe episode number and game name( usually a funny screen shot from he game or cover art. 3: the banner has just about nothing to do with gaming. i think i see just one game on there total.  4: your voice sounds good but you may need to turn the game volume down abit. i hope those things are helpful :) keep creating.

That was a joke. Wait for laughs. Alright, let's get to the feedback:  Your videos themselves are fine. I assume you already know that you have to edit your audio to make it that little extra crispy. The commentary itself is fine. You obviously like this game and know enough about it to make the LP flow.  You might want to make a new banner for the channel that focuses on games and gaming. Right now when I enter your channel I feel like I'm about to get someones MySpace picture-reel right up in my face. Also you should spruce up your front page. It doesn't look very inviting. What you want to do is press that pen icon and put your most liked video on top for returning subscribers, and some playlists under it. It can make a channel with 20 videos look like a well oiled machine that's been going for years, and also give people the feeling that there's a lot to see on your channel.

I'm planning on changing the banner asap, the current one is a placeholder I made just to have something there.

I'd love some feedback on my latest episode of Ori and the Blind Forest featuring my brand new Green Screen setup. As for now I've only been using normal lights due to some issues with 130/230V. I've aquired two transformators capable of 100w and 4 european bulbs capable of up to 240V so my future videos will have much better lighting! :D   Here's a LINK to my latest episode of Ori and the Blind Forest.
letsplay,3dlbz5,YoungBonesGaming,2,Fri Jul 17 11:13:52 2015 UTC,"Hey man, the green screen setup looks great already, with a game as dark as Ori, you don't overpower it by being massively lit up. Straight up Let's Plays aren't something I watch a lot of but from the good ones I've seen, you do seem to tick all the right boxes."
letsplay,3dlbz5,ChangeBrulee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:04:07 2015 UTC,Perhaps I should dim the lights a bit then. I think it'll become much better with the non-dimmable lights at 5500K. Thank you for the positive feedback :)

letsplay,3dlbz5,ironflyx,0,Fri Jul 17 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone, I'm new to this subreddit, so i have two videos for feedback.

The Amber Throne - Part 2 Windward - Part 2  I try to do chill and ""not too much talking"" commentary, i want viewers to enjoy the game the same amount as my commentary. P.S English is my secondary language, sometimes i have problem for some words or pronunciations :D Need all the help i can get, thanks to you all."
letsplay,3dlbz5,blasterbrewmaster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:43:06 2015 UTC,"The first thing I've got to comment on is your commentary style. I know you go about ""not too much talking"", but the thing is you're bringing something to the game. That's the reason you're here as a let's player, we're all here as a let's player. I catch your accent definitley, is it a german varient? You speak very fluidly so I don't think you really need to worry. Some people will comment about it and give you a hard time, but you definitley need to bring some confidence to it. Be confident and proud in your commentary, you've got a great accent that's not too harsh to understand and brings an extra character to your commentary.  Additionally when you're playing games with heavy narrative but no voice acting, you should definitley bring the commentary to it I think. These are really good games to work on building your confidence as a let's player as you can get really comfortable bringing characters to life, and in the process find your own character as a let's player. I started out lacking confidence and wanted to just straight up voice act on some older rpgs, finally set on one that I can mess with and bring comedy with Mario and Luigi superstar saga and it's been great to help me in my commentary. Something more serious gives you alot of opportunities to practice and work on your commentary as you don't have to think about what to say, you can just read it of the screen and work on speaking w/o being afraid.  So work on speaking up, it sounds at times like you're muttering and you want to be confident.   I don't want to comment too much on what you should be doing commentary wise as you mentioned you try to do a ""not too much talking"". The problem I find is you're not going to get alot of people that way, when there's alot of walking around and nothing being said or done. You might have a few people like that but the vast majority would probably just go out and play it themselves in that sorta situation. Still, that's your choice. I'd just suggest filling it with more substance in there. Specifically I'd definitley try to remind anyone coming into the middle of the series like I am what exactly you're doing and what's already happened, little summaries so we're not going ""what's oging on?"".  I mean there's really not much more that i'm seeing beyond this. I can't really comment on stuff if you're not commenting much either. Me personally, to be frank and blunt, it's just not captivating me and making me watch too much of it. I'm jumping around and it's really kinda empty. I'm seeing the game but not getting much ""let's play"" out of it.   So I don't mean to be really harsh about it. I'm just offering a perspective. I'd suggest checking your video analytics on youtube, see where people are jumping off in audience retention and watch the videos, see why they might be jumping ship. I could be full of shit and you may have people staying on for longer. But I think that these are things you should keep in mind when you're trying to improve and grow your channel.   Like I said, I have an example of a series that's dialogue heavy where even when adventuring I'm adding lively banter between the characters. It's not a straight up let's play but I feel like it'll give you an idea. It's a bit of a shameless plug, but you can check it out if you want or not. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxskSNU8Ui8bJY1nAZmJLZz_IkbKzbHt4 the first few episodes some of the voices are a little rough, but as I get into it I warm up alot and I personally at least feel like I'm bringing alot to the game that if I wasn't commenting on as much wouldn't be as interesting to watch.  Hopefully this gives you another perspective and maybe can help you see what you personally want to improve. I don't want you to necessarily do it to appease me, but I want to give you another perspective that may help you see what you want to do with the channel."

I also will leave a few likes on videos as an added courtesy.  I do this rather than ask for feedback myself because 1) I find some of the feedback to be a bit generic or unhelpful at times, and 2) because I think seeing other channels from a third person perspective helps you see things you might find annoying or turn you away from channels that you didn't realize you were doing yourself.  In any event, same deal as before. I'll respond in 24 hours of posting this and give feedback.

letsplay,3dlbz5,TsundereKermit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:01:15 2015 UTC,"I think your videos can benefit a bit from having stronger, more engaging openings. The commentary itself is fine, but the first few seconds of the video are important for capturing attention, so even just starting off stronger and then dying down a bit into your normal speaking voice is good as long as it doesn't come off as forced. A minor thing, but remove the ""channels I watch"" from your list and consider just leaving your subscribers list open for public view if you want to show that. You get the benefit of being shown in related channels when users subscribe, but the odds of you showing up there based on YouTube's sorting is next to none. It gives bigger channels that viewers are more likely to be familiar with more attention and draws them away from you. If you're more interested in being linked on peoples' channels, then it's more effective for you to get closer with friends or something and just have them link you in manually. Last thing, I'd be a bit careful with the number of games you're covering, if people follow the channel for specific playthroughs. If I'm understanding correctly from your banner, you'd have five playthroughs going at once, meaning if people watch for one playthrough, the might get turned off and jump ship to another channel. I could see three playthroughs at most if you alternated Monday-Saturday with one and did a shorter game on Sundays, but it's your call. People tend to subscribe for specific games a lot, so not spreading yourself as thin may work in your favor here."

letsplay,3dlbz5,TsundereKermit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:45:42 2015 UTC,"I think your videos can benefit a bit from having stronger, more engaging openings. The commentary itself is fine, but the first few seconds of the video are important for capturing attention, so even just starting off stronger and then dying down a bit into your normal speaking voice is good as long as it doesn't come off as forced. Additionally, I'd look up some public speaking videos or something for more specific pointers, but switching up the inflections of your voice will help to hold attention longer and help to sound more interesting. Even if the commentary itself is fine, the voice saying it is important as well."

letsplay,3dlbz5,BlackIronDiggle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:57:45 2015 UTC,"The videos are pretty informative, but a big issue that I can tell already is that you've got a lot of long pauses, and a couple of bouts of 'umm and ahh'-ing here and there. It might do to perhaps make some footnotes for yourself to go off of while you make these sort of tutorials; not a script exactly, but just some points to speak about, and you can wing it from there. Also, enunciate a bit more, sometimes you mumble a little and it's a bit hard for me to hear you.  All the best!"

Another great thing.    You guys had great audio quality, so no complaints there.    What was really nice is how you guys kept the commentary flowing.  Not only that, but it was funny.  You guys did an amazing job.   As for your intro/outro situation, I always kind of liked the intro riff you guys used.  But this isn't a bad route to go, especially for a game like this.  It fits the tone better, so I understand the concession.   Anyway, amazing job.  I'm pretty sure I'm subbed but I'd do it again if I could."

No, I do not think that all LP'ers sound the same, purely because we all have different voices, different personalities. I think we all change a little bit in front of the camera, but the trick for me is to make sure that I become the same person when recording as when I'm not.   While my LP videos are about fun, there is always a certain part of me that wants to inform. I try to mix the two, making small talk and giving information about the game or topic discussed. It is my opinion that you will receive far greater audiences by being you, purely because you're being, well, just you. It makes your channel personal, and for me, it made me appreciate my audience even more. I notice more and more that they watch because of me, instead of my content. I couldn't possibly upload something that isn't me, although the interaction with your audience is obviously something that you wouldn't normally do. But hey, that's YouTube."

letsplay,3dmlt2,YuB_,2,Fri Jul 17 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"I certainly feel a lot of lets play channels often come off as being similar, more so in their format than the voice itself though.  Stuff like intros, descriptions and titles being very similar, but that stuff is SEO related usually, which makes sense but it's still a little boring to see imo.     I don't think there's anything wrong with exaggerating yourself a little bit. I think it's rather fun, but I've got to say that it does feel a bit more special when I'm complimented on moments where I'm more genuine.   There's a video where I exaggerated my humour to an absolute extreme, it was easily the most fun I have had making a video, but it's also my least favourite to watch back on.   Double edged sword really, so i'm trying to balance it a bit from now on.    :)"

letsplay,3dmbcn,RyeRoen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"My first thought was that it was a rather recent upload and that YouTube just hasn't placed it yet. The second thing is that the ""primary"" tags should be first. More people will be searching for ""rake review"" than your channel. But the tags that relate to the name of the game and the video first. Put your channel tags towards the end."
letsplay,3dmbcn,iAmMitten1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:02:37 2015 UTC,Oh really? I had no idea the order of the tags meant anything.
letsplay,3dmbcn,MilimateHD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:24:07 2015 UTC,"I am not 100% sure on if putting the most important tags first really matters. As far as I know, YouTube only uses the tags for video indexing, and how relevant you are to other videos. I did some A/B testing, and didn't notice a big difference. Different sources around the web, including previous Reddit threads, confirm this. That being said, of course, it won't do you any harm if you put the most important tags first, but I doubt that it'll make a very big difference. You have 500 characters to use when doing tags, and YouTube will read them all.  However, the order of the title and description does matter. While the order of the tags is then irrelevant, going off my initial comment, you always do have some keywords that are most important and aligned with your video. These keywords should be the first mentioned ones in both the title and the description. Neither of these things is something you do. The title is very short in which I'd suggest you add something like ""(Rake Review)"" to make it clear. I never heard of 'Show'n Tell', but that might be personal. The same goes with your description. The first few words are on how the format has changed, rather than the content or game shown in the video. Put personal things and other 'irrelevant to the content'-kinda things at the end of the description.  There is somethin else that I noticed - you do not use the word 'video' in any of the tags, which is important if you want to pop up in Google as well."
letsplay,3dmbcn,MilimateHD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:33:03 2015 UTC,"That's some good advice.  Edit: that said, it still doesn't explain why I don't show up when I search for my video on youtube specifically. Does it have something to do with the age of my channel maybe?"

letsplay,3dkdo4,Jonruy,2,Thu Jul 16 23:48:13 2015 UTC,"This question is directly related to how frequently I expect to die and/or how quickly the game iterates. Games with quick iteration (short matches like in Splatoon or frequent death/respawn like in Super Meat Boy or Happy Wheels) will be highlights because any content that isn't either a success or a really funny failure is probably going to blend in with the background and not make for interesting content.  If the game has minimal iteration or none at all, however, I'll treat it like a journey, because the whole thing contributes to the complete picture."
letsplay,3dkdo4,FabbrizioCalamitous,2,Fri Jul 17 02:11:04 2015 UTC,"I find that ""Journey"" Let's Plays are tricky because they are not typically effective for growing an audience. On the other hand, they could be effective at reinforcing an already established audience.   I guess it depends on what your goal is. If you're a small channel trying to grow, I'd suggest sticking to highlights. If you're a channel with a reasonably sized audience, then releasing journey let's plays may create rapport with your audience. That being said, certain games are definitely not suited for highlight LPs."

It can also include finding all the secrets or items or any other useful tips. They can be done with or without commentary, but commentary of some sort (even text on screen) is usually preferred.  Let's Plays (or playthroughs as I tend to call them) focus more on pure fun. Maybe you're playing the game for the first time, so you're recording your first impressions and reactions.

For a walkthrough I want more information than a longplay provides, I want some commentary about how I was meant to figure it out, or what I should be paying attention to.

Did some research and it was miles better than any other network (in terms of the split and the reviews).  We actually specifically waited until we qualified for Curse's standards before we monetized.  Haven't regretted it at all.  CPM/eCPM has steadily risen, and is through the roof these days (I won't disclose the #, but it's higher than I've even seen anyone claim) for reasons unknown to me.  So, as far as CPM goes, Curse does a great job for us.  Although, % of playbacks monetized remains very very low (~25%), despite a heavy PC:mobile ratio.    Does anyone else run a more ""high-level"" (in terms of gameplay skill) channel and get a 50% monetized playback ratio?  I'm wondering if it's an issue with ad block and the type of viewers this type of channel gets, or if it's our channel specifically (or if it's Curse not filling up the ads well?).  Either way, I've identified this as the main weakness of our monetization scheme (and it's not like you can ask people to turn off Ad Block for a specific channel on YouTube (I think? never used Ad Block before), so this one hurts a lot)."

So if they include a clause in their contract barring you from disclosing your income, then you can't, but that has nothing to do with YouTube or AdSense's terms."

For example if you google my name MrXuiryus or just Xuiryus you will find nothing but me. This is mostly due to a side effect of me having a unique name for so many years and wasn't a concious decision when making my channel it was just natural for me.   At the end of the day it's your name and your channel you make all the decisions and how you move forward is completely up to you my only advice is for you to OWN your name and become synonymous with that name and nobody will be able to take it away from you.

I am one of them. The amount they take from your cut doesn't reach the net benefit you get from joining (in my opinion). I would rather be solo.  It used to be that joining a network would protect you in a way from copyright (although you still needed to make sure you only upload stuff you know you have the rights to). Now that is not the case. In fact, when I emailed Fullscreen about a falsified claim I got once they told me to handle it myself."

Especially if you join a network like Fullscreen that locks you in for 2 years.   A lot of networks will claim to help you grow an audience, and that is false. At most that means they have a forum for you to talk to other creators. However,  they get inundated with spam links and the people in the forum are not necessarily your target audience. They claim higher CPM, which may be true. Ask them for proof first, usually they won't give any. Stuff like that.  I will say, however, that I am going to miss the free AudioMicro subscription.

You might want to brighten up your thumbnails because I could barely tell what game it is that you were playing. Your channel art isn't bad but it suffers from the same problem as your thumbnails. It's too dark and usually people will gravitate towards brighter colours. I don't mean to come off as too critical, at the end of the day it's your channel and you can do what you think looks best. Good luck on your let's play journey! :)"

My art may or may not be good, but I do not think that something bright and colourful is the absolute only way to go if you want ""good"" channel art. Something ""noir"" and stylistic can be just as appealing if done right. I'm wondering, mostly, if this is done right. I think much of the issue might be the centring problem.  After a little bit of consideration, I think the art itself is great. I think there is a composition issue though."
letsplay,3di6ma,-Tyketto86-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:08:44 2015 UTC,At the end of the day you want whatever your trying to promote to stand out and be at the forefront of your image. It HAS to be the thing that draws people in and if this is something you intend to represent you it has to be eye-catching and recognizable as a brand image.  I'm not saying it has to be BRIGHT I'm saying it has to stand out and have a good contrast that draws in the eye and shows people exactly what you want to show them. All I see is a faceless colourless person and a channel name that isn't even under the light in the image and just kinda off to the side.   The avatar on the top left looks almost invisible with the background and looks like it's intentionally made to blend in too.

Totalbiscuit is one of the of the most successful Youtubers, but his icon is black and white -- same with his banner.  I understand the importance of brand image. Believe me.

Your name/branding is off to the right and the only thing in the middle is a lamp that is shining on a blank wall.  Maybe the solution is to move the speech bubble and silhouette to the center, so the lamp is shining on the speech bubble.  But again, just my opinion :)"

letsplay,3di3p8,MilimateHD,2,Thu Jul 16 14:19:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's the danger of so many series isn't it? If you don't want people to wait that long, the only option is to maybe release two per day? Really not seeing any other option here, without making the schedule a complete mess. I don't think you want to be uploading this many series without a clear 'this serie on this day'-schedule."
letsplay,3di3p8,Humblewit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:10:32 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I was just curious if I was overlooking something obvious and that maybe a similar channel had a solution for this problem. I think the answer might be to   just record early and as often as possible, doing two episodes a week of each series. I just don't want anyone to get left out or start prioritizing series. I've found that regardless what you do, it's all about time. Ideally, I would love to record these after the previous episode released, but we just don't have the time.   Thanks for your input!"
letsplay,3di3p8,Humblewit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"That kind of begs the question of why one channel is needed for everyone's daily content?  Seems like with five guys all doing different games and different playthroughs, could get really convoluted really quick.    Couldn't you have the main channel be for when you do videos playing together and have everyone else have their separate channels for solo work?  You could still brand all the channels similarly if you are wanting to make sure it's clear everyone is in the same group/team.  If you don't have a particular video for the main channel on any given day, you could also alternate featuring someone's most recent solo work.  Pretty sweet you have a core group committed to making content together, good luck!"
letsplay,3di3p8,Humblewit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:05:20 2015 UTC,"This is a thought that has crossed my mind, but at the same time, I feel as though more channels equals more work individually. Part of the reason that I wanted to start something like this is because I love everything about YouTube: the marketing, the strategy, and the viewer interaction, yet I don't have the time of day to be able to produce content on a regular and scheduled basis.  I think that something like this would help us in terms of content coming out consistently and motivate all of us to keep going and not let the others down. I feel like if we had our solo channels, everything would be inconsistent with the other channels and some people would eventually die out on the group.  Thanks for picking my brain a bit and making me rethink my decision about the grouping of everything. I'm really excited for when we head back to university and get to do group stuff all the time!"
letsplay,3di252,Enduratrum,3,Thu Jul 16 13:13:21 2015 UTC,"Most important thing: consistency. We can all prattle on and argue about the ""best"" thing to do to grow our channel. No amount of planning and plotting ways to grow will work if you don't create a schedule so that your viewers know when to expect videos. Start small, one series, maybe 1-3 times each week. Go from there and welcome!"
letsplay,3di252,Saigancat,2,Thu Jul 16 13:16:45 2015 UTC,My current schedule is to upload every other day - got a few made in advance so that if I get a bit too busy I have a buffer for a few days to give me time to create more. Hopefully that works out :)
letsplay,3di252,Tarquinnff3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"I can definitely vouch for this. I was doing too many series on my channel at one point and got burnt out. I then got stuck on a few games that I wasn't enjoying and took an unannounced sabbatical, during which I moved and changed jobs. My viewership took a beating.  I returned with one series 3 days a week until I got back into the flow. Just recently I increased my schedule to 3 series total and 1 video a day. It's going great. I get nowhere near the views I used to get, but I'm having fun again, which is the most important thing. So, yes, start small until you can find your rhythm and then go from there."
letsplay,3di252,SendMeRammusRule34,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you are aiming to achieve with youtube as a whole, but consistency is a large part in growing an audience, and if you are only actually able to work on it between your time at university, which I imagine is only a few months a year - you're going to find yourself very frustrated with the fact that you can't even manage one video a week, and that sub count is stagnating. By all means upload videos for fun - but providing regular, consistent content is not something you do over the course of a summer vacation, it's something that takes months and months to do."

letsplay,3dj53e,DeekFTW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"They aren't really BS though. I mean, the writers of the song own the rights to the song. They put the creative effort into it and the time and money into recording it so they go through the effort to protect it. It would be like someone taking the video that you put a week into making and editing and using it as their own and making money off of it.  The automatic claim system is in place because it would physically be impossible to go through the years worth of content that is uploaded every few minutes to YouTube and mark claims by hand. I've heard that it is extremely annoying and slow to be cleared from a claim even if you present YT with written authorization from the content's rightful owner. That part is a little BS."

letsplay,3dj53e,morjax,3,Thu Jul 16 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"Bonus points: do the same at the end of your recording to ensure there is not cumulative desync (e.g. if your audio is at 30 fps, and your video is at 29.97, that's a 1 second desync after 20 minutes of recording time - quite noticeable).

Trust me, you don't want copyright strikes/claims or community strikes.  Most publishers will allow you to upload content, yes, and you can always deploy the Fair Use clause, but there are limits. Uploading entire gameplays without any cuts or commentary will lose its right to fall under the Fair Use clause, for example."

I had modest success by coming up with new things to do on old games - recently I did a series on Transport Tycoon that went down well. And my 100 Worst Spectrum Games video got lots of views.

With retro games you're going for a very specific, almost niche audience. The broadest audiences are gonna be looking for the newest games, while most people will likely be looking at older game videos as guides or looking at them for nostalgic value.   If you wanna do it you shouldn't expect a lot of growth immediately but if you do it because you love the games, like I do, then nothing should stop you.

In OBS I was filming my Evil Within series in 1080P at 30FPS and was getting this horrible stuttering which was only shown in the actual recording NOT the gameplay while I was playing. I honsetly couldn't figure out how to fix it so I thought I'd try using Shadowplay.  Not only does it film perfectly I can even bump up my recording to 60FPS so I can now film in 1080P 60FPS and the difference in the smoothness of the video is incredible. The only problem I need to worry about is that shadowplay splits the files ever 4GB and there's a TINY popping sound between files, but it's something I can work around.  Very happy! :D    EDIT: Here's some footage of cheaters in payday 2 at 1080p in 60FPS"

Shadowplay filming at 1080p 60FPS 10Mb bit-rate. 2 pass VBR with maximum quality and depth turned on in adobe premiere. Looks perfect.

letsplay,3dghdb,FabbrizioCalamitous,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:41:13 2015 UTC,I only use AE for very specific effects that would be time consuming in Premiere. It's very much an as-needed basis. Most of the time it goes straight from Premiere to youtube.
letsplay,3dghdb,cheesycoke,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:37:47 2015 UTC,After Effects is pretty much overkill when editing an LP unless you're doing something like an intro/outro. Any effects you will need or want in a standard let's play can be done with Premiere.
letsplay,3dghdb,TheCamPlays,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:17:22 2015 UTC,I don't see why you'd need After Effects in an LP.
letsplay,3dghdb,ReplayTyHeretic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:46:44 2015 UTC,"After Effects is like a spice; you add a tiny amount to give the video flavor. Too much, and you spoil the entire meal. So use in moderation and it should be fine, but don't overdo it. I personally only use After Effects for like...masks and motion tracking.  Slight edit: Although, curiously, when I first started using professional editors, I used After Effects primarily before finally using Premiere Pro. I was not a very smart person at the time."
letsplay,3dghdb,AlanDavison,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:06:22 2015 UTC,"I use After Effects purely for my intro/outro/transitions, having the .aep files in a bin in Premiere Pro. Then I just shove them in the sequence when needed. Something like this.    Now, given that, if I could only have one piece of software for video editing, I would choose After Effects. Purely because all of the cutting/splicing I do in Premiere Pro, I could also do in After Effects. On top of that, I would also be able to do any fancier editing if needed.    Regardless though, PPro + AE is the best combination of tools I could ask for."
letsplay,3dghdb,CmdrJameson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:32:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, you can import AE files to Premiere.. I never thought about it.

letsplay,3dghdb,ebolanation,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:18:50 2015 UTC,"For LPs I use it for a few recurring motion graphics, but I usually render those and just drop them into Premiere as clips, and once they're done they stay the same through the series. I don't touch AE in the course of making the average LP, but I'll use it extensively on showpiece stuff like gaming history videos (mostly for digital rostrum to add some motion to stills and magazine scans... Premiere can do this, but AE will motion blur it, so the result looks much less digital)."

letsplay,3dghdb,DeekFTW,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:25:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah all the time. I just section off parts that might need some Motion Graphics so maybe a specific intro or overlay, or if I call attention humourously to something OR if I get rage. Then I dynamic link it to AE. For my FNAF cartoon I just layed out the audio and cut it to where it sounded good, then placed titles in Premiere Pro according to how long I wanted shots - THEN I dynamic linked each shot with audio to AE. Hahaha.  Generally you want Premiere for cutting up and assembling footage, AE for any motion graphics, advanced title work, or animations. Dynamic linking means you can avoid re-rendering and quality loss/time loss doing so. Usually the quality loss is pretty negligible anyway. I wouldn't use AE for straight editing pieces together, necessarily. BUT I would use it in a similar capacity to Photoshop. If that helps you further distinguish the program :D"

Paying for ads on YT, twitter or FB probably isn't worth it because if you're like almost everyone else who just started your content sucks anyway.

letsplay,3dewk1,mlcgaming,3,Wed Jul 15 22:21:23 2015 UTC,"Hey man,  We record with two people in the same room running the same setup as each other so I've got a fair idea of what you'll need. What I'll write is basically how I'd run it.  First of all you're going to need space, if you're too close to each other then you'll echo over each other's mics and if your audio isn't exactly in sync then its extremely noticeable. Ideally you also want to be facing away from each other as well to help this. Use Audacity to record your commentary, unfortunately as far as i've been able to tell with what I have, there is no way to record different feeds at once on this either and be able to split the audio tracks, but our interfaces only cost about £50, by all means experiment with it.  Lugging everything over to one place is a hassle, but it's also the easiest and cleanest way to do it. Potentially you could use Skype or a similar service on your PCs for chat and disable voice chat in the game settings (to keep the game audio voiceless.) and record your commentary with Audacity.  I only have limited experience with the capture card side of things, but there is no way to have multiple instances of Elgato's software running at once.  After all of this is done and you have the first recording under your belt, your biggest problem will be the edit. I don't know what your style would be, but even the achievement hunter guys (who's audio has been a mess the last year as they talk over each other all the time) have to choose who's feed to cut to. Let's say you record for an hour. You'll have to sync all tracks to one point so it's all lined up, and then you'll have to watch that one hour four times.  For getting the data around, we have a 1TB external hard drive we use, if you're using elgato, you shouldn't need that much space though.  I'd also recommend that each of you do your own test recordings as well so you know how your gear works and how to fix any problems."
letsplay,3dewk1,mlcgaming,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:45:30 2015 UTC,"You're right - after thinking/talking it over, I think we're voting against the remote aspect and voting for everyone being all in one place, which will be my basement basically!  So I'm going to break this down into two parts - 1. equipment all 5 gamers need just to get the ball rolling, record, send files to my laptop, and 2. equipment/software I will need post-gaming to actually edit, produce a final video to upload.  1. -Everyone already has their own: console, USB mic (AT2020), webcam, and capture card. -JUST thought of this - internet connection in my house? How do I approach that??? I have the fastest tier internet that ATT Uverse provides in my area - can I just connect a router/switch to my ATT modem, plug all 5 consoles into that, and we all log into our own Xbox Live accounts good to go? Am I at risk of lag here? Or any other connectivity/access issues? I've read of people having issues using multiple consoles in one household, issues with NAT type, etc. Suggestions for routers? -Everyone's audio footage will be recorded on their own tower, using...Audacity? -What's the best software/method for recording webcam footage? -Game footage recorded using El Gato and software included with that.  -For editing, and a couple questions in terms of how to approach this process:  -I will be doing the editing on my laptop - 2014 MacBook Pro, 16 GB RAM, Intel i7, can't remember other specs right now, but I'm hoping it'll be okay for what we need. -Am I thinking this through correctly in terms of how many files I will have: if I have 5 gamers total, I should have 15 separate media files (3 from each gamer - their individual audio track, their webcam footage, and their game capture), correct??? -A couple of you have mentioned audio interfaces and referencing XLR mics; my line of thought is thinking it would be best/easiest for everything to be USB interfaced into everyone's individual PC tower (capture card, webcam, AT2020 USB mics) - any disadvantage to this??? -We've got one buddy who is currently without a dedicated PC of his own - what would be the MINIMUM specs for a tower he would need for this? We will not be doing any PC gaming (yet), and no one else besides me will be using their PCs for editing or running any software, so basically the only functions everyone's towers need to perform are: capture audio, webcam video, and console footage simultaneously, no lag, frame drops, etc. Would I be safe to use the El Gato HD60 minimum system requirements (4GB RAM, 2nd Gen Intel i5 2.0 or greater) as a baseline for finding the cheapest tower if we all pitch in? -Once I get all files on my laptop, can I edit everything I need in Adobe Premiere? I've gotten recommendations for that, seems expense, but we're also splitting this cost between 5 people. Any other suggestions?  I've you've read through this entire post...you're awesome and I appreciate it!!! Will have to shoot out a channel link when this is all set up.  Thanks again!"

letsplay,3dfff5,AelisAndura,2,Thu Jul 16 04:48:04 2015 UTC,"No no.  No no no.  No. Just no. :)  I'm a blogger by trade and we have always had love-hate relationships with Facebook because it was in the past a huge part of how we advertised.  A lot of bloggers put ALL of their social media effort into Facebook to watch a steady stream of updates that each reduce how many of your fans they'll show your posts to unless you pay.  It's like having your content held for ransom.  Most of the people gained from boosts are not real fans interested in your content, but people who are paid at click farms who add non-paid-for channels to their likes to look like they're still legitimate.  That's going to be the case unless you choose a VERY narrow audience demographic and location.    I have around 7,000 fans.  My posts get shown to about 30 initially.  If a lot of those people like/comment on that content it might go up to 200 who see it.  You can get tons of new fans by paying for a boost, but that doesn't mean Facebook's going to show your posts to any of them.  After gaining new fans, you'll additionally need to pay for every single post if you want anyone to see them."

And if you're looking for a free program, it doesn't get much better than GIMP.   If what you meant was that you wanted to snag still images from your video to make the thumbnail out of, the simplest way is to bring the video up in a finder preview (hit space), pause it at the moment you want, fullscreen the video and hit Apple-Shift-3. This will take a screenshot of the video. The file will appear on your desktop and you are free to manipulate it as much as you need. It might not be the full resolution of the video, but youtube thumbnails are automatically shrunk down to either 15% or 25% of their original size, depending on where you're viewing the video, so it would be impossible to notice that it's not the full resolution."

If you're planning on playing awful games, play off of the dark connotations in your name, like ""Dark Death's Purgatory"" or something.

Unfortunately, there appears to be no way for me to type in exact time values for start times, stop times, durations... It seems that they just want you to drag things along the timeline and pray you hit the second that you're aiming for? I can't work with that.  In VSDC, I can just import an image or video, and in the properties tab very quickly type in all the values I need and the timeline changes as I go. Apply fades and other effects and then type in all their exact values. No dragging or dropping of any kind. This HitFilm editor is way, way better than Lightworks, but lacks the ease of use I find in VSDC. Don't get me wrong though...I'm dying to drop VSDC for something else. Way too many crashes and bugs.  Edit: I just checked to see if there have been any new versions of VSDC. A new one came out July 1st. Hoping they fixed some of the bugs."

Left Click on the image's rectangle in the timeline and a ""Properties"" tab displays the image's settings. An example setting would be ""Start Time: 00:00:00.00"". Left Click on the Start Time's time value in the Properties tab and type in ""0000145"" and hit Enter. Now it says ""Start Time: 00:00:14.50"" and the image's rectangle moves to that spot on the timeline. Another example setting would be ""Duration: 00:00:30.00"" and so now on the timeline the image can be seen to start at 14.5 and end at 44.5 without having dealt with the timeline at all. Right click on the image in the timeline and select ""Effects"" and then ""Fade"". Now in the Properties tab are new settings...    Fade 1 vvv Start Time: 00:00:00.00 Duration: 00:00:05.00 Start Opacity: 0% End Opacity: 100%   And again you can just click on the number values and type in what you want.

letsplay,3dd944,fromelmstreet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:35:56 2015 UTC,"I actually kind of like that way of asking for subscribers. It makes more sense then a lot of the ways people ask.  I was checking out your channel and I only looked slightly because I typically stay up to 6 am recording and such, sleep till 12 and then leave for work at 1. I was curious about the way you choose series to stay with. I noticed you have 3 different videos with part 1 listed but no part 2's. Were those videos not popular enough to keep going or was it for some other reason I could have listened to?(broken footage. Save lost. Game doesn't work past a certain point on computer.)"

I'll be making a video 2 for most of the series you mention, but the delay stems from technical issues. Dead Space 3 episode 2 had significant sync issues (burned hours away doing this), Hyperdimension Neptunia had significant audio issues, 60 Seconds I've been meaning to get back into, etc. Usually it's a technical issue."
letsplay,3dd944,fromelmstreet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:36:15 2015 UTC,Ive actually had similar technical issues recently. I have a gaming quality laptop and that is what i use for recording. I quickly found out that my computer would sometimes dip fps from 60 and this gave me incredible glitches. I recently tried to record at 50 fps but i think for a while i am going to switch to 30 to ensure less glitches.   What software do you use. I was using lightworks for the first videos but it is limited really badly when it is free. I am now trying hit express because it is free and i don't have anymore room in my budget for new software.

letsplay,3dd944,ericshift_1,2,Thu Jul 16 22:19:49 2015 UTC,"Right, so first of all, there is a major difference between 'feedback' and constructive feedback. While I am more than okay with criticism and people telling me that I need to do things differently, comments like ""Your (intentional error) so bad at YouTuub, pleas just kwit!"", really grind my gears. They're intentionally pissing on something you worked really hard for, without any viable reasoning as to why I should quit YouTube. Because I'm ugly? Because my videos are bad? Because my voice sounds like a cat being murdered? It's not feedback. It's insulting.  Dislikes are actually not as bad as people tend to think, because they mean one thing: interaction. I would love to see why people press dislike in the form of a comment, but that's something they rarely do. As long as I have significantly more likes than dislikes, I don't really mind. To me, as long as it's not some brainless watcher, it means that they viewed my video, and they didn't like it, which could happen. Maybe I'm targetting the wrong audience, or my current subscribers do not like the shift in content.  Lastly, I thought about not asking people to subscribe, but the reality is that there is nothing really bad about it. You create something you're passionate about, somebody watches it, and you then ask them to support your cause - it happens everywhere in the world in every industry. There is a difference between spamming someone with that message, but a quick favor to ask at the start, or preferably the end of the video, is nothing to be frowned upon."
letsplay,3dd944,ericshift_1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:56:51 2015 UTC,I know non-constructive feedback isn't the best in the world but isn't every interaction a possible pr spin? For someone who doesn't respond to a comments section non-con feedback would just be a stain sitting there but what happens when you respond to them?   I noticed that you do respond to your comment section and currently a very popular thing to do in the media is to respond to negative and insulting feedback. Videos responding to negative feedback are highly popular. Pewdiepie for instance had insult response videos and I know the one you tube showed me randomly had 17million views. His videos typically get around 1-4 mil so that would be an odd high.   I realize no one likes their work to be spit on but you could insult them just as much by using their insults to spread your message.

If you have to push gain really high, you might notice more noise on the Behringer piece, but since you're using a condenser mic, you most likely won't be pushing gain very high anyways. One thing that's important (to me) is a direct monitor feature, so you can hear your voice in your ears when you record. As long as they both have that, I'd just buy whichever one is a better deal."

The markets are overplayed or dead already.   I'd suggest putting your immediate efforts into developing marketing strategies and understanding how YouTube works instead of just trying to brute force your channel's growth."
letsplay,3ddfh4,Blitzkriegsler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:32:34 2015 UTC,"I can honestly say that I am doing my hardest to employ every marketing tool out there - I have a website, Facebook page, Twitter profile, I am part of multiple communities and, of course Reddit. I honestly don't know if getting 180+ subscribers in 3 months would be the maximum result of that. I don't spam Twitter or other people's videos with my comments, nor do I use every sharing platform to put my videos on. I see my videos ranking quite high on YouTube, but it seems as though every time I rank them, there are more channels with more videos in that series, hence the reason why I want to upload daily as well.  As I'm currently running The Witcher 3 and Outlast as my main series (I know Outlast is outdated already), specifically The Witcher 3 needs more and faster uploads. In that light, I cannot expect someone to subscribe to my channel, assuming he or she found me via The Witcher 3, if I upload one video in that series a week.  But yeah, I will dig deeper into marketing, and look at what else I can do. As far as tools go, I am almost fully stretched in terms of the different tools used."
letsplay,3ddfh4,Blitzkriegsler,2,Wed Jul 15 14:54:35 2015 UTC,"Dig deeper into your analytics. 180 subs in 3 months is a great start, but where are your new viewers coming from? Which series do they prefer the best? What's the audience retention like?  Like you said, 1 video a week of Witcher 3 isn't going to work - especially since the big channels have already stopped playing it and that the series will likely run you 100+ episodes. Nobody is going to continue watching it in 2 years.  You have so much stuff going on in your channel. 7 different series going on with 21 total videos in the last month. These are all long games too. It's so confusing to a viewer and people will just move on because they aren't really getting what they wanted. Simplify your content and create a consistent schedule. This is what I meant by marketing strategies - not just marketing. You have to start understanding how YT works rather than just starting up a series because it will be fun. Develop a plan and a schedule, and implement that plan."
letsplay,3ddfh4,Blitzkriegsler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:21:58 2015 UTC,"I understand now what you meant with Marketing, so thank you for this. Because of the consistent schedule that you mentioned, there is a high chance that I will go for the daily uploads.  About my analytics, great suggestion. I have an average retention of 36% in the last 28 days, of which I don't know if that's good or not. My GTA series has the highest retention rate, being at an average of 45%. The Witcher 3 clocks in way lower, but I have changed too much about that series in its life-time. I am now in the process of getting that series straight.  As for traffic sources, I get 29% from my views from YouTube Search.  In terms of consistency, I think having daily uploads will help me greatly. The long games are indeed not helping, adding oil to the fire in regards to the fact that I only upload once a week. Thank you so much for these tips, they're great.

letsplay,3ddfh4,LordHighSummoner,3,Wed Jul 15 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"I've been doing daily (with few exceptions) since about February and I'll never do it any other way. For me it's about two things.   Knowing myself. Knowing that I like to play a bunch of different games and jump between them. I could never do 2 videos a week and focus on 1 or 2 games. Because of this, doing daily videos is a must because... I don't expect anyone to watch every series I do. I myself tend to only watch specific games, even from my favorite Let's Players. So the idea of providing 4 different series each with at least one episode a week is a no-brainer.   These ideas may ultimately spread your views thin, but overall it's a better experience (and more fun) for me.  It's also worth noting that my Let's Play style requires very little editing. I can have a video go from the captured file to the rendered file in about 20 minutes (This includes running the mic audio through audacity).  Edit: I'd also like to add that I have a full time job, a wife, and two kids. With proper planning (I'm currently about 2 weeks ahead of schedule) it's very possible to make daily videos work."
letsplay,3ddfh4,LordHighSummoner,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:41:07 2015 UTC,"Seems like I have to get some footage to be ahead in planning as well. I now have enough footage to last me 1,5 weeks if I would upload daily starting tomorrow. For me, the time between, for example, The Witcher 3 videos can be up to a week, which means anyone subscribed for that series would have to wait quite a long time. Getting in touch with daily uploads will help me reduce that time, while not neglecting the other 2 main series, GTA and Outlast."

In this case, I think your content allows you to spread them out a bit more, which is great.

I INVITE YOU TO DISAGREE    I find this post to be a case of an inexperienced channel posting a theory that sounds great on paper, but lacks actual data or information that backs up the claims. The post starts with saying that using social media capturse a wider audience, but where are the screenshots of the analytics showing a breakdown of traffic sources showing that these practices? OP's main YT page doesn't even have links to your G+ or Facebook pages. To me, this reads like self-promotion to try to get more views on channel's ""how to grow your channel"" series.   Social media is probably the easiest and quickest way to not only release content to a very large audience.   The easiest way to release content to a very large audience is through YouTube itself. So many people disregard YT as a social media source because they don't understand how to use it properly and the channel never grows. t's true that the typical social media sites can help out, but you have to use it as part of your entire marketing approach, not as your whole strategy. It's pointless to brute force your channel's growth, it won't happen - even if you link dump and twitter spam everything.   Marketing is fairly straight forward.     Determine the needs of their customers through market research Analyze their competitive advantages to develop a market strategy Select specific markets to serve by target marketing Determine how to satisfy customer needs by identifying a market mix    Basically, we need to figure out what games/videos people want to watch, analyze the saturation levels of that genre of video or game, know how much search ranking weight your channel can pull, and develop content that people can find. Here's a hint - the vast majority of viewers don't want to watch any game older than about 4 weeks - unless it's an established community (which are very hard to break into).  Social media sites are great ways to advance these videos for our specific markets. Short funny videos are extremely easy to share and people really enjoy them, but conversely, nobody is going to go to twitter or facebook to find a LP video. They will go to YouTube and search for what they want.  tldr: use social media as part of your marketing approach, not as ""the quickest easiest way to share content"""
letsplay,3dddew,Blitzkriegsler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:00:51 2015 UTC,"I kinda had the same thought. OP's a great guy, but this post said a lot without really saying anything.

letsplay,3dddew,kyleblane,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"Well said. While I don't agree entirely with your part about YouTube I'm glad you provided your own take. Especially from a channel like yourself. Thank you for helping with the overall discussion.  Yes, YouTube can be seen as platform of social media. But from a perspective of someone with 0 views and 0 subs. This can be very hard to use effectively when starting out. Unless you are 100% aware of the SEO details, YouTube can be a very unforgiving place and I'll let you consider me dead wrong if many people who begin to create content know that this is something you need understand before you begin posting videos."
letsplay,3dddew,Blitzkriegsler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:06:33 2015 UTC,"So for my point about it being easier to reach a large audeince through YT instead of social media - think of this:  Your videos are a product that you are trying to sell. Imagine them as watermelons. You are trying to sell those watermelons on a street corner in a little kiosk. You are relying on word of mouth and hoping that a car will stop on their way home from work and buy a melon. You will have a few people come by out of curiosity, and you may develop a group of dedicated buyers that will stop by weekly. Sure, there is a huge market of people that see the product, but nobody is buying because they don't want to get out of their car.  Now what would happen if you took the time to get your watermelons into the local grocery store? Your market totally shifts. You now have people who are actively looking for watermelon and will gladly buy it. It's easier for them to find your melons and it takes a lot less effort to sell your product, and you will receive a lot more sales.    This can be very hard to use effectively when starting out. Unless you are 100% aware of the SEO details   Sure it can be a difficult place to learn, but once you figure it out, you don't have to sit in a kiosk on the busy street corner for days hoping for a sale or two. I was basically eluding to the notion that it's better to learn the system of YouTube and focus your efforts there rather than treading water in social media while your YT channel sits idle. Sure, social media is a great tool, but it's not the best option like you make it sound."

letsplay,3dddew,SgtKeeneye,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:47:59 2015 UTC,"There are guides out there especially in the Let's Play Wiki on the sidebar that gives very good info on SEO optimization. Many people don't know that they should work on their SEO to succeed in the YouTube Algorithm and thats a problem. Because of this many people fail because they do not see any growth because YouTube can't help if they don't help themselves.   One thing that people need to realize is YouTube is not someone hold you down from growth and others seeing you. YouTube is code, an algorithm that i have personally see work much better than anything else i have done.Having an already groomed Audience helps but if you lack the SEO with it you only inhibit yourself and prevent yourself from actually growing one.. In the past 6-8 months I have gained 800 subscribers since i changed my practices and worked on SEO. This is compared to the previous 2 1/3 years That I only got about 200."
letsplay,3dddew,Luxbu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:00:54 2015 UTC,100% Yes. I've personally seen the effect of longer series over and over again as I'm sure you have as well. I have also seen YouTube SEO be the reason videos do well. SEO optimization its the biggest reason why my channel broke 1k subscribers this year. It was not my twitter or facebook or a reddit post it was YouTube entirely.   When you learn the game and how to play it you will succeed through hard work. If you never learn the game the game will play you and you'll be stuck.
letsplay,3dddew,RandomiseUser,0,Thu Jul 16 01:51:03 2015 UTC,"""tldr: use social media as part of your marketing approach, not as ""the quickest easiest way to share content""""  I'm going to recommend that you watch/read the second part of the video I'm going to make then. This video just briefly covers pros/cons of using different social media platforms, things to be weary of, etc. and it is not a poor assumption to assume that the general You Tube gamer who is starting fresh knows a great deal about everything you're basing your argument off of.   Marketing now a days isn't as straight forward as you think. Even just determining the needs of the consumer with market research (invaluable) is extensive and takes an incredible amount of time if you want your marketing efforts to be as effective as possible. That includes secondary & primary research, surveys, field studies, data collection... That's even after you figure out exactly what need you must address, determine exactly what you want to do, etc.. It's comprehensive is where I'm going with this (I get a boner for market research, excuse my banter)...   Anyway, what you really start talking about is integrated marketing and you can't have any form of integrated marketing with out a plan, Stan. Once you establish your goals, research, objectives, and plans... then (and only then) will you start using analytics and different metrics to determine what is working for you after you implement your strategy and have real results. You could ring the bell for lunch everyday, but what if you also made an app to help drive customers?  Even if we had a billion subscribers and backed it with analytics, that ultimately shouldn't mean anything to anyone. Anyone that knows marketing would know what works for one person might not work for the other person.  I'm not calling you out or anything by any means, nor should anyone be mad!

All of these platforms are useless if you're only using them to share links and show your stuff.  You need to engage with them as if you were talking to friends, not go into them looking for a way to gain views.  If you're comfortable with social media as a whole, consider using something like Hootsuite to schedule shares of your content and the content of others.  This lets you avoid burnout and make sure you're consistent.  Outside of those scheduled shares, engage with your fans and other creators.  Share others' videos, gaming articles, game sales, and anything you think everyone would like.  Make your social media a reflection of you as a person and more than anything else be genuine.  Don't forget that the comments and likes system in Youtube really makes it a social media site in itself.  Watch videos that interest you and when you do, leave more than just a ""Cool video.  Watch my channel!"" after 30 seconds of it.  Making friends will take you a long way if you're a good friend in return."

letsplay,3dddew,kyleblane,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"Good read, as always.  I agree with your statement on Twitter - it is an absolute must for a YouTube channel, and I've seen a significant increase in traffic. One thing that has to be said, is that there are 2 ways of positioning yourself on Twitter, one of which is my personal favorite. That favorite is to position myself as a person, rather than a channel. While this may sound weird at first, I use my Twitter to really interact with me, and I thought it'd make more sense if it would be an actual person. Examples of how I do this are that I use my real name as the username, and I have a profile picture of myself. I do use my channel's banner, to have some consistency and touching points with my channel. I also use my description to point out that I have a YouTube channel, and what kind of content I release.  The second way to position yourself is the opposite of the above. You will be a channel, aimed at increasing your views with the use of hashtags and replying to gaming communities, developers and other users with that in mind. For me, it's not a personal way to do things, so I stay away from it. But it has been proven to increase views, although there is nothing said about how many subscribers you gain.  Additionally, if you upload your video at around a time you're still awake, I would send out a custom tweet instead of the tweet that YouTube sends automatically. You have far more control about it, and can shape the message in a different way.  Facebook hasn't worked for me at all, but I once heard that there was someone posting teasers of upcoming videos on his page. One of those went viral, and well, you know what happens then.  I stay away from Google+; as you said, it's a dumping ground of videos, and it's becoming more and more every day. It's a big mess, and I don't do anything with it.  Again, great post. I love Social Media, as it is partially my 'real' job as well, and you hit a lot of good points. I am not in the position to check out your video now, but will do and support you once I'm back home."

Vlogs seem to be a good idea.  Some people do them a lot, others weekly, others on occasion.
