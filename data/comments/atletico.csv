atletico,3ddb3o,acoconut,9,Wed Jul 15 11:09:44 2015 UTC,10 is the playmaker number. I guess Oli is the right person to take it considering he's a technical playmaker. I really hope this works out for him and Atleti

atletico,3d5tub,carpetano,4,Mon Jul 13 19:27:25 2015 UTC,I do think we might be headed to a 4-3-3 because we have so many attacking players. I see Carrasco and Griezmann on the wings and Jackson in the middle. We just need a good center mid to play with Koke and Tiago/Gabi.
atletico,3d5tub,im2Spooky4you,3,Mon Jul 13 23:38:51 2015 UTC,"Possibly RG or Saul can play there? Obviously they aren't as good as the others you mentioned in the defense but we don't need to have 3 centermids to only focus on the defensively.  Both Saúl and RG would give so many useful runs from deep if they got played deeper. I guess it all depends on who we play, good to have many options."
atletico,3d5tub,Rojiblanc0,3,Tue Jul 14 00:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Oliver could be a good option as well."
atletico,3d5tub,im2Spooky4you,7,Tue Jul 14 00:10:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. Kinda in the role he played in with Porto even though he was mostly on the left-mid.   I'm so fucking excited about next season with all these youngsters + Jackson. Just wonder who we will get to play in the defense."
atletico,3d6t33,im2Spooky4you,2,Mon Jul 13 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"I think Simeone might try to change things up.   If you think about it, he tried at the beginning of last season. We started the league having more possession and trying to do different things. I think we ended up going back to the previous season game style because we lacked the players to continue playing like that.   I think Simeone has, again, asked the clubs for a number of signings to be able to change our gamestyle. I think he might be trying to implement a new gamestyle since our rivals have figured out how to play against us.  However giving the signings we got, I'm not so sure he will try to go for the more possession thing like he tried last season."
atletico,3d5zht,Cambijao,4,Mon Jul 13 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"How do you feel this player have performed throughout the season?   As well as I expected from him. Okay substitute option, limited ability. Nothing special. I don't remember an outstanding game and I don't remember a horrible game from him.   What was this player's best moments this season?   The lucky goal he got against Bayer    What are your favorite aspects of this player?   I guess his defensive ability. Being a decent option as a substitute CM.   Where do you see this player in the upcoming year?   I don't know. Maybe to be used as a bargaining chip for Jackson? He would probably be great for a lesser league like Portugal or even Germany. If he doesn't care that he's a sub than keeping him as 4th choice behind Saul would be decent.  Mario Suarez doesn't seem like he has the quality to become a player of Atletico's level. Leaving the club would probably be best for everyone."

My heart stays red and white and supports the players that feel the same. Koke is one of those. He could have gone to the ""far better club"" Barcelona, but he stayed true.

You often say that you don't support any particular team, so perhaps that's why you don't understand how we feel about this. I'm going to try to explain how Atleti fans feel about their players.  Imagine that you're in a relation with a great girl for 4 years. She have said several times how she loves you and how happy she is being with you. However, you have heard from her and her BFF that she'd love to move abroad at some point, and you know that this relation won't last forever because you can't go there with her. One day, she gets the chance to get a job in the country where she wanted to move. You don't want to be the guy who interferes with her dreams, so you decide to end in good terms with her instead of fighting for every book in your apartment. Soon later, you find out that she hasn't taken that job abroad, and now she's with a rich snob with whom you had some recent confrontation. Facebook is full of pictures of them kissing, and everybody is congratulating her for getting such a great catch. You feel betrayed. Was the ""job abroad"" an excuse to get rid of you? Was she just saying that she loved you because she couldn't get a better guy? There are people who are even wondering why aren't you happy for her because she had a crush on him since high school and now they are finally together. If this wasn't enough, you find out later that it wasn't something out of the blue, but they had agreed to be together two months ago. Then you understand why she looked a little distant and not trying enough during your last months together, and why she and her BFF had been recently talking again about that job abroad. Was just a strategy? Manipulation to not be ""the bad guy""? Some people would call her a bitch, and some people wouldn't bee so aggressive, but everybody would feel betrayed and humiliated. Ending a relation isn't easy, but it's worse when  you know that you're going to run into each other quite often.   Eventually, everybody (or most people) will move on, but don't expect that all of us will overlook how he has screwed his history with us by leaving in such a shitty way."

You think the guy would even be at the girl at the first place if he knew that openly admitted that her dream was to be the 'rich snob'? And btw, are you accusing Arda for only joing Barca because of money given to the 'rich' you included? I mean, it's not like that the offers from others clubs were poor...    Most footballers aren't gonna stay at one in whole carriers and in Arda's case, he's moving on while you and other Colchoneros are gonna cheer for a new Atleti hero."

atletico,3cvpmm,carpetano,7,Sat Jul 11 04:15:54 2015 UTC,"""I've dreamed about this moment, since I was a kid I dreamed about playing for Atleti, I've always liked them and today a dream is becoming true"", said Ángel Correa during his presentation with Atlético de Madrid at Majadahonda. The player finally got fulfilled his desire of being presented and playing football again after the heart condition that kept him out of playing during last season.  Some words that are very common in players during their presentations with their new teams, but in Ángel Correa's case are sincere. Since some time ago there are some pictures on the Internet where he can be seen wearing Atlético de Madrid shirts, time before the negotiations for his signing. So it seems that the Argentine does actually fulfils a child dream for playing at a team that he always liked.  Correa did know the colchonero home because of the conversations with a former Atleti player like Salvio. Both haver a very good relation, and they actually have the same agent. ""Toto"" is one of the players who recommended him to sign with Atleti."
atletico,3cvpmm,Pedrinho21,4,Sat Jul 11 04:21:59 2015 UTC,That's quite amazing to hear! I could see why Atleti was big when Angel was growing up in Argentina. Happy to see an international Colchonero join the squad.
atletico,3cvpmm,Brunton22,4,Sat Jul 11 05:43:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is refreshing and I hope that in future there will be more players like that who watched Atleti win la liga or play the Champions League final and dreamed about playing here. Of course we couldn't limit our signings to players who loved Atleti as kids because most of the squad would be composed by /r/atletico subscribers or colchonero.com visitors. Kudos to Salvio who recommended him to come to Atleti. He never was one of the main players at Atleti, but he still has a soft sport for us (it's easy to see it for anybody following him or his wife on Twitter).  The current success will mean more future Atleti fans. I love to see Atleti signing players who actually give a fuck about us instead of ""yesmen"" who pretend to love us while they're waiting to be signed by someone else."

atletico,3ctnl5,Pedrinho21,2,Fri Jul 10 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"I think getting a CM might have been more important, but I think having a player of his characteristics is a good deal too. Last year there was matches were we needed someone like this.   I don't think he'll become a midfielder, apparently his defense is one of his weakest spots. That is what  I read, because I haven't ever seen him play."

Honestly besides the marketing, and modern football aspect, Atleti and Barca are historically equal clubs. Gil fucked that up.  Sporting wise Barca are still not that much better. Their defense is weaker and without Messi their attack isn't that much better.

atletico,3ck1it,maese,-4,Wed Jul 8 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly besides the marketing, and modern football aspect, Atleti and Barca are historically equal clubs. Gil fucked that up.   I would also say that Barce have much better economics resources compared to Atleti. And since Barca are doing far more great than Atleti.   Franco tried to harm Barca but they rise up and became one of the most successful club in all times, which you can't really say about the same regarding Atleti.    Sporting wise Barca are still not that much better.   If that wasn't the case, then why are Barca favorites to win title in every competition while Atleti are underdogs? I mean, there's no fiasco if Atleti finish the 3rd place in La Liga or quarter-final in CL. But if Barca made those thing, they would've been critized heavily. The expectations are higher for Barca because they're a better team than Atleti.   Their defense is weaker   Oh, you mean the defence who conceded the fewest goals among teams teams from top 5 leagues after Bayern? :)   and without Messi their attack isn't that much better.   Yeah, because Neymar (37 goals + 11 assists) and Suárez (25 goals + 24 assists) weren't a huge part of Barca's offensive as well.   Their midfield is the only spot where Barca are clearly better and Arda decided to join the spot where they really don't need a player like Arda.   I don't agree with you since it's clearly not their midfield isn't great as it was for a couple of years ago. Barca wouldn't be intrested in Koke, Arda, Veratti, Pogba and so on it that was the case. I don't think the Turk will be a starter immedeialty when he return but at least he'll be a huge improvement as a sub compared to likes of Rafinha. Iniesta doesn't really fit in Barca's playing style and Arda will mostly replace him fully in season 16-17."

atletico,3chegh,guisasolaa,3,Tue Jul 7 22:45:45 2015 UTC,Fucking hell. I'm getting tired of signing attacking players when our problem was clearly our midfield. We've sold our best midfielder and bought 2 strikers and now 3. This is fucking stupid.
atletico,3chegh,Pedrinho21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:05:46 2015 UTC,Although I agree center mid is what Atleti need - I'm okay with Carrasco.  He's good on the ball and can play on the wing.  Cholo will need to improve his defensive rate.  At half the price of Gaitan - he and Oliver could provide the offensive spark from midfield we did not have last season.  That said - we better get players to take over the box to box / defensive mid roles from Tiago/Gabi/Mario.
atletico,3chegh,Mighty-Mouse-Saves,0,Wed Jul 8 14:49:39 2015 UTC,"To play the devil's advocate, what's the problem if Atleti are doing som great reinforcements regarding strikers? Unlike the previous season, Grezmann isn't the only goal scorer you can rely on.  And why are you saying that Atleti's problam was on the midfield?"
atletico,3chegh,Cambijao,4,Wed Jul 8 04:41:42 2015 UTC,"what's the problem if Atleti are doing som great reinforcements regarding strikers?   Because we already have player like Borja and Leo who can be great 4th choices behind Torres or even Raul Garcia. Our striker position is by far the most covered. We literally have 8 strikers in our team right now, arguably 9 considering Angel.   And why are you saying that Atleti's problam was on the midfield?   Because we only have Koke and Tiago in our midfield who are able to contribute to a Champions League team. Tiago is 34. 34!!!! I honestly can't hope for a more than 3 matches where Tiago does what he did for the last 4 years. Koke is great but he really can't conduct attacks by himself. Yes we'll have Oliver but he'll probably take a while until he can have an effective chemistry with Koke."

atletico,3cexw8,guisasolaa,2,Tue Jul 7 11:43:47 2015 UTC,Arda is still my favorite player but it is hurtful that he joined Barca. I'm not to angry as he will probably ride the bench and give almost nothing to the team. I really can't see any other reason for him doing this other than him wanting himself a large paycheck.
atletico,3cexw8,Pedrinho21,4,Tue Jul 7 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"If Arda really wanted a large paycheck, then the Turk could've just move to PL where they can offer huge money. He said himself that his dream was to play Barca since a kid and it's pretty clear he want to forfill it. And I don't think Arda will sit his ass on the bench all day long since he's more than good enough to replace Iniesta in the line-up."

They can double Arda's wages without much difference in the total wages. I'm sure the top EPL teams would pay 1.5 his salary, but Barca wages are notorious for being overinflated.   And I don't think Arda sit his ass on the bench all day long since he's more than good enough to replace Iniesta in the line-up.

I'm sure the top EPL teams would pay 1.5 his salary, but Barca wages are notorious for being overinflated.   Well, I don't know if I can agree with you there fully. According to ESPN, PSG pay highest wages while Barca are 4th in the same list. And the reason why I said that Premier League can offer players even more wages is due to their enormous TV-money which will increase for each season it goes. The fact that a bottom team from PL had even more TV-money than Bayern says all.    True but trying to get a spot after half a season is gone and you haven't played a minute is much harder than you think.    You're right that Arda won't play a single minute in official games until the ban is over. But keep it mind that the Turk will participate during the training where he'll learn more adapt Barca playing style. And I'm sure they'll do some practice matches.   Suarez was given his spot when he came back, but Arda will not be treated the same.   To be fair, Suárez had Pedro to compete with..."

With this clause that states Barca can sell him back anytime before July 20th, Atleti basically have to sit on their hands and wait to sign a replacement.

They sell for a little less than they should and buy for a little more than they should. And at the end of every transfer window, I usually feel like they've pissed away some 5M, 10M, 15M euros that could have gone toward a signing, or been reinvested into contract improvements.

He gave you 4 great years, he played his heart out for you guys, he was involved with Atletico's biggest achievements in two decades AND he brings in 34 million euros while leaving the club."
atletico,3cc17t,kabka123,5,Tue Jul 7 05:44:54 2015 UTC,"If you're a Fenerbahçe fan consider this: how would you react if one of your best players was saying that he wants to leave to play in a different league and then asked to be sold to Galatasaray or Beşiktaş? Would you think: ""he has given us X good years and he has left X money""?"
atletico,3cc17t,euyyn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:34:55 2015 UTC,"Actually i am a fenerbahçe fan, i know what you mean. But for years most of our talented players waited for their contract to be over and earned the club shit, so Arda going to a rival must hurt but at the very least he made you enough money to replace him."
atletico,3cc17t,kabka123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:58:51 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't that he left, but that teams from other leagues were offering the same money and he chose to go to a rival. If he had gone to England the reactions around here would be much different.   That leaving aside that he had been saying for years that he ""dreamed"" about playing in England (was he lying? Did he change his dream? Was this his plan all along?) and that he won't be allowed to play until January (are we such a worthless for him that he prefers not to play for six months instead of staying one season more?)  I don't hate him, but his final decision made me sad."
atletico,3cc17t,Ashitakaa,4,Thu Jul 9 13:16:04 2015 UTC,I don't hate him but i am disappointed in him. He gave all for us and speaks how he'd like to go to england and then leaves for another La liga club where he won't even play for 6 months + Barca is our rival. I always thought about him as Uno di noi but i guess i was wrong.

I wish he would get injured, badly, because I can accept him moving to premier, but I cannot accept him moving to the fucking barcelona. I cannot and for me he is dead.  Swearing love to us and then he leave us for a rival.  Torres left us, but he didn't go to a rival, he left us for a premier team in a really good moment. That's why Torres is an idol an others are RATS."

atletico,3cc17t,carpetano,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:21:41 2015 UTC,I was lurking the Barcelona subreddit (i think this is the first time) and apparently Barca have an option to sell him back to us for a 4 milion loss. With the elections and Bartameu losing popularity him returning could be a real possibility.  Also this purchase seems to be a political move by Bartameu to gain popularity which I don't think will work considering that creativity and vision is clearly not needed for Barca.  In other news we can use this money to buy Verratti. Maybe another Midfielder but I can't think of one right now.

atletico,3cc84v,im2Spooky4you,9,Mon Jul 6 19:54:44 2015 UTC,Oliver Torres. He seems like he's ready to take the spot as our central source of creativity. Maybe we can buy an aging for cheap if we need a back up
atletico,3cc84v,Pedrinho21,3,Mon Jul 6 22:04:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. If I'm not mistaken, Correa could play on that position as a backup for Óliver (I'm not entirely sure). I rather spend this money on a good CM"

atletico,3cc84v,Pedrinho21,9,Mon Jul 6 22:12:44 2015 UTC,"Carlos Vela I would guess. Proven in La Liga, and would probably cost a similar amount to what Atletico ended up getting for Turan."

atletico,3cc332,m0ckers,6,Mon Jul 6 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"Cholo's counting on him. If Atleti bring in one more non-EU player during this window, it's likely Correa will go out on loan, but at the moment, he's set to stay."
atletico,3cc332,csmcgowan,4,Mon Jul 6 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"Simeone talked about him in an interview for Tyc sports, in Spanish.  He sees Correa as a very talented player, with a great 1v1 and explosivness in the last few meter, but he still has a lot of things to improve and needs to find a position in the field where he can give the team the most.

We still haven't reached a deal. I'm good in Madrid and although there has been other clubs interested in me I want to stay."" ""Simeone is a great manager. During the preseason he told me to be ready to play. I played 6 matches and are really happy. He is a great manager. You have to train hard and be serious, but after you can joke as much as you want"". We'll see how much playtime Lucas gets this season, I was thinking if he stays he'll probably be 4th choice CB and could play as a LB if required. I hope he gets enough playtime to keep growing as a player. Him and his brother Theo are amongst the most promising players in our club."
atletico,3c7y1v,Cambijao,4,Sun Jul 5 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"I think Saúl can give us more than he has this season. I know Simeone insists on him playing closer to a wing as an interior, but I would personally like him to see him as CM. However, I understand Simeone gives a lot of importance to that position (obviously) and Saúl might not be ready for that responsibility. I recall reading somewhere that he was one of the players from the team that lost most balls, which is a thing you can't really do as a CM."
atletico,3c7y1v,Cefalido,2,Sun Jul 5 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty solid for the first year I'd say. Better than Oliver the year before. Hoping there are less injury issues next season, though...  It also doesn't seem very defined where he is going to play within the midfield next season, I guess it depends a bit on who the new players are...with the current squad I'd expect more minutes on a side (Koke + Gabi + Tiago pretty solid for the center), but who knows..."
atletico,3c7y1v,_arkar_,2,Sun Jul 5 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"Remind me of a more technical Raul Garcia, great with his pointmaking which I love.  I think he performed over his expectations for this season so a big plus from me, hopefully we will see him get even more playtime.  Better in the offense than the defense, more similar to RG than Koke.   And my favourite moment of the season was his bicyclekick against Real."
atletico,3c7y1v,Rojiblanc0,2,Sun Jul 5 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"Biggest problem may be he is too versatile for his own good, needs to settle somewhere a tad more permanently and get into a rhythm.

atletico,3c7y1v,starvs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:00:33 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. He is a great mid table player for almost any position, but He needs to begin to specialize to be able to be a starter in a team like Atleti"

I haven't had the chance too, but I know the team finished 3rd in their group, quite some points behind the 1st and 2nd.  If you are interested you ca go to this link and go through the different matches to see whether Gonzalo played or not.

If the club knew Barça were after Turan, we should've moved faster to find an appropriate substitute. Also selling for less than the clause, is a bit of a joke. We are always forced to pay clauses, but clubs interested in our players rarely do so.   *He also said that Barça would pay 35 million €, 6 million € less than Arda's buyout clause."

atletico,3byljx,carpetano,3,Fri Jul 3 05:37:28 2015 UTC,"Not really surprising. He did OK, the first few games, but then his performance dropped. I think Rodgers said Manquillo did not attack enough for the game style of Liverpool. I'm not even sure Liverpool were using true fullbacks at the end of the season anyways. Maybe someone that watches Liverpool regularly can confirm this.  I understand why Manquillo wanted to go to Liverpool, but he should've chosen a different team were he could've gotten the game time he needs. Going to Liverpool was pretty much a year wasted."
atletico,3byljx,Cefalido,2,Fri Jul 3 08:10:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they switched to 3 CB so he wasn't playing at all towards the end/second half of the season."
atletico,3bwfk3,Cambijao,7,Thu Jul 2 18:34:34 2015 UTC,How do you feel this player have performed throughout the season?   Well above my expectations. I thought he would be a very solid secondary striker to Mandzukic. It turned out the Mandzukic was the one who ended up being the secondary striker. He scored 20 goals in almost literally half a season.   What was this player's best moments this season?   His hattrick against Athletic was extremely memorable and was the beginning of his amazing run of form.   What are your favorite aspects of this player?   His speed is a given but this season he also showed his great work ethic. Absolutely forced Cholo to play him with the few chances he got. Considering that Mandzu and Jimenez were always above him in the team sheet in the beginning of the season.   Where do you see this player in the upcoming year?   As our number one. Even Martinez is going to have to sacrifice himself to get the most out of Griezmann. He can even be our creative player if Vietto wants to play upfront. Super excited to see his progress this year.
atletico,3bwfk3,Pedrinho21,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:32:54 2015 UTC,That would be my thoughts as well. How he would fit with Jackson and Vietto.   Time for 4-3-3?
atletico,3bwfk3,lingmister,2,Fri Jul 3 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"I think Vietto will be treated the exact same way that Griezmann was treated last season. He will be given time if either Griezmann or Martinez are injured. I don't think a 4-3-3 is something that Cholo would like. Though that seems like a good option if we're going to have such a weak midfield; Koke, Arda, and Tiago being the only ones having the ability to compete with the likes of Barca and Real in terms of quality."
atletico,3bwfk3,Pedrinho21,2,Fri Jul 3 02:29:13 2015 UTC,"He is great and his debut season couldn't have gone to much better, despite what was actually a slow start.   I didn't realize just how clinical he is, he finishes his chances. But what I like most about him is he defensive play, especially his pressing. He has a really good instinct for intercepting passes or otherwise forcing turnover and creating a break.  He has to be the focus of the offense next year. He can score and create for Jackson who I hope can move/run off the ball effectively to create space for the both of them."
atletico,3bwfk3,starvs,5,Fri Jul 3 04:39:13 2015 UTC,25 goals.  And he assisted Torres on a goal he could have scored.  Griezmann is legit as hell.
atletico,3bwedf,Cambijao,14,Thu Jul 2 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"Probably Tiago. Consistently covered Gabi's continuous failings defensively and even put in some goals if it was necessary. His passing is also quite good. He also is never mentioned after matches including me. We still should be looking for a replacement, but Tiago has been the few consistent and impactful players in our squad."
atletico,3bwedf,Pedrinho21,2,Thu Jul 2 22:30:53 2015 UTC,Oh I guess you missed my comments aobut him! Been very important for our balance.
atletico,3bwedf,Rojiblanc0,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"I probably forgot lol, I'm sure I've mentioned him once or twice. Just not nearly as mentioned as Arda or Griezmann"
atletico,3bwedf,Pedrinho21,7,Fri Jul 3 00:28:08 2015 UTC,Raúl Garcia!
atletico,3bwedf,Lawleyna,2,Thu Jul 2 22:45:33 2015 UTC,Yep. I think he did as much as Mandzukic this season without making nearly as much fuss.
atletico,3bwedf,Pedrinho21,2,Fri Jul 3 00:31:26 2015 UTC,"That's unfair to Mario who actually was Atleti's best player in the autumm, the team wouldn't secured the 3rd place if it weren't for the Croatian efforts."
atletico,3bwedf,Pedrinho21,2,Fri Jul 3 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think Mario was that great considering that the whole game was built around him. What I am saying is that we almost always forget Raul Garcia in our gratitude. He really is the best squad player in our team besides Gimenez last season. He did his job, supported his teammates and made no fuss when nobody thanked him."
atletico,3bwedf,angrymonkeyisangry,3,Fri Jul 3 02:23:19 2015 UTC,"Raúl García, hands down."
atletico,3bwedf,Hermitrage,3,Fri Jul 3 07:37:32 2015 UTC,"For me, it's definetly Arda Turan.  There's no doubt that he's one of the most important player for Atleti and is, in my opinion, an almost complete midfielder. The Turkish international is extremely gifted technically, have great game intelligence and is willing to give 110% for the team even if he must trace back to defend. But unfortuanaly, most people appears to overlooked his performances and they even accuse him (especially Barca fans) for being hot-headed. I think it's all because for the shoe-incident...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7Xl5ywZ910"
atletico,3bwedf,Pedrinho21,5,Thu Jul 2 19:00:52 2015 UTC,The comment that absolutely killed me was the one of Arda getting his second yellow card against Real Madrid in the CL quarters. this guy literally said that Arda was a cunt for being very surprised for receiving his second yellow.. I can't believe how you can call a player like Arda a cunt.. he NEVER does something cunt-ish...  can't find the comment.. zzz
atletico,3bwedf,Pedrinho21,2,Thu Jul 2 22:47:25 2015 UTC,"Yep. Everytime I bring up Arda, someone automatically assumes that Arda get's angry very easily. It's always the same people who think that Atleti play violently. Many Barca fans are also very ignorant on anything that isn't Barca or Real so they like to assume things of the one game they play against us.  Arda is also the few players that we have that is a top 20 player in the world. Godin is the only one who I think is in that group. Arda is also one of the few creative players who can also provide defensively as well. Hazard, Messi, even Ozil don't have the defensive ability and workrate of Arda. Keeping him is absolutely crucial to us staying competitive in La Liga and Europe.  EDIT: After watching the video you linked also made me remember that even though this wasn't his best season, he still provided with many plays and passes that nobody else in the team could dream of doing this season. Arda really is a magician."
atletico,3bwedf,JDV_1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:29:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ignorance has a part of it of course. But we shouldn't forget that Barca-fans (and others who have criticized Atleti) have double standards, like their teams have never played dirty & violently. But since we're talking about Barca-fans and their hypocrisy, I've made this GIF to respond a culé when he/she will bring up the shoe-incident during the CdR at Calderón in the future...  I agree that both Arda and Godín are among the very best in their respective positions. However, there is a huge difference when it comes to their reputation. Almost all people agrees that Godín is a fantastic CB while Arda is heavily underrated sadly enough. Just read about the negative comments in /r/barca and /r/soccer regarding his possible move to Catalonia.   I think it's very hard, if not impossible, to convince him to stay.  Previously, I had the opinion that Koke was better than Arda given the Spaniard hade some better stats (lol). But I've took my time to watch many games during the past season in replay and I was so wrong, Arda is a better player than Koke for me."
atletico,3bwedf,LegalMexican,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:55:37 2015 UTC,"Arda is a better player than Koke for me.   As much as I love Koke, I agree, but we're also ignoring that Koke is only 23 and Arda is in his prime at 29. I think Koke will end up as a much better player but right now Arda is better."
atletico,3bwedf,JDV_1,0,Fri Jul 3 02:27:02 2015 UTC,"I don't wanna be that one but Arda's actually 28 :)  But anyway, I really doubt if Koke will reach that level, Arda was a better player than the Spaniard at the same age back then. Personally, Koke isn't so good that some may think he is I'll make a thread to explain more about this subject in the future..."

atletico,3bv3tm,angrymonkeyisangry,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"I think Leverkusen is a bit to high if you consider that they already have Toprak and Papadoupolis. Maybe we can sell Lucas to Borussia Monchen. and buy Dominguez from them, He would be the beyond ideal 3rd choice."
atletico,3bv3tm,_arkar_,2,Thu Jul 2 16:40:58 2015 UTC,"Sell Lucas?   That would be a huge mistake. He is the most promising player from our youth academy, and probably one of the very few which look able to get in the first team.   Don't really think Dominguez would be the ideal 3rd choice, as much as his departure sadden me."
atletico,3bsxma,InAndAroundTheForum,3,Wed Jul 1 21:56:52 2015 UTC,Uruguay's centerbacks choices are gonna be crazy if they keep coming to us. Our scouts really deserves a lot of credit for finding these youngsters.  I'm really excited by Emiliano after his season with Getafe and hopefully he'll challenge JM for the starting spot next to Godin.
atletico,3bsxma,Rojiblanc0,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"Both of the two youngsters came from the same team in Uruguay too, which is quite nice. Velazquez coming back (and Giménez being insanely good) makes this the perfect time for Miranda to have left them."

Sport is an absolute shit pro-Bartomeu and they are working hard to show something in his favour.  The club also has denied any deal or even negotiation with barcelona.  For me it seems that Atleti wants the 41M from Chelsea and get Filipe in a different operation and Chelsea wants to cut a bit Arda's price adding Filipe in the same deal.  Barcelona in this case is something ""good"" to warn Chelsea and say something like ""hey if you don't pay the whole shit we have another club that can do it"".  My bet it's on Chelsea unless they cut the negotiations."

atletico,3bae7t,bgjerlow,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:32:57 2015 UTC,That's great to hear. Looking forward to seeing him play. Does anyone know if he has a European passport or if we have to give up a NE spot for him?
atletico,3bae7t,Hermitrage,2,Sat Jun 27 09:22:32 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he doesn't have European passport.
atletico,3bae7t,Cambijao,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:30:02 2015 UTC,"I am more than happy right now. When looking at attack, we lack nothing. we've got strength (Torres/Jackson), pace (Vietto/griezmann) and also a bit of good passing (all of them). woo"
atletico,3bae7t,Hermitrage,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:55:20 2015 UTC,"But unfortunaly, neither of them are good enough to create chances from nowhere on their own.  Especially against teams who sit back."
atletico,3bae7t,Cambijao,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:03:03 2015 UTC,"That's what we have Arda, Koke and Oliver for"
atletico,3bae7t,bgjerlow,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:33:47 2015 UTC,"I can't find stats for Óliver but Koke is able to create more than 60+ chances per seasons, something Arda isn't near at..."
atletico,3bae7t,nananananaBETMAN,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:29:36 2015 UTC,"Oliver had 6 assists in 26 games for Porto last season, so I'd imagine he can create quite a few chances."
atletico,3b9puz,Januzaj7,3,Sat Jun 27 03:22:51 2015 UTC,"Man... Maybe nobody wants to say anything right now, because it looks like he's actually going to leave us?"
atletico,3b9puz,el_cipote,5,Sat Jun 27 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"Not his best year, but he drops incredible pearls here and there. He made a real difference in 2013/14 when he was more consistent. Let's hope he'll be back to his form (he's 28 so it's not a matter of age)."
atletico,3b9puz,maese,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, his stats from the previous season dropped significally in almost all areas compared to 2013-14 season stats."
atletico,3b9puz,Cambijao,5,Sun Jun 28 11:38:27 2015 UTC,"Arda has always been a player that we could bring on and completely change a game. Sometimes we are passing around without much end product and we plug Arda in and out team comes to life. Not only does he bring experience, creativity, and flair to the side, he also has the heart of Cholo. He is one of our most passionate players. I don't think he actually had that bad of a year. He was overworked and he had to adapt to the loss of costa like the rest of the team. If it's true that he is leaving them I will obviously be quite sad. Itl be hard to replace his talent and impossible to replace his heart. Im just so thankful that we had the Turkish magician in our club for awhile. I hope he goes back to Galatasaray. It will be so wrong to see him fighting in blue for Mou."
atletico,3b9puz,RATMachine,2,Sat Jun 27 19:15:23 2015 UTC,"He definitely has not played to his full potential. He has had his moments, but overall his season have been more towards the mediocre side.

No professional would ever say that, less so Arda. Also he was chosen as one of the models for the new kit. I don't think Nike would allow that if they knew he was leaving."
atletico,3b7ckc,maese,5,Fri Jun 26 17:00:26 2015 UTC,"Well, this is no good. If it's true, there's nothing Atleti can do but point other clubs toward his release clause. He's worth it."

atletico,3b78v2,AestheticFC,5,Fri Jun 26 15:15:13 2015 UTC,Atleti are counting on him for the up-coming season.
atletico,3b78v2,Januzaj7,2,Fri Jun 26 15:33:09 2015 UTC,IF HE GOES OUT ON LOAN AGAIN I AM GOING TO BE FUCKING LIVID.   .#FREEOLI
atletico,3b78v2,starvs,2,Fri Jun 26 22:23:24 2015 UTC,It's been confirmed numerous times that he will play for us.
atletico,3b78v2,Drygon,3,Fri Jun 26 15:29:32 2015 UTC,Source to these confirmations? And does he have a squad number?
atletico,3b78v2,carpetano,2,Fri Jun 26 16:04:31 2015 UTC,"Simeone has said in several interviews (example) that Óliver has improved a lot during the loan and now he has big plans for him.   There isn't an official squad number for him yet, but he had the 16 the last season he played for Atleti and now he may get it back because nobody wears it. I'm just speculating, don't blame me if he picks a different number!"

atletico,3b4wd0,guisasolaa,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:28:56 2015 UTC,Very important with all our SouthAmericans. Does this transfer mean we will sell Mario though?
atletico,3b4wd0,Rojiblanc0,4,Fri Jun 26 00:57:27 2015 UTC,We're most likely selling him anyway
atletico,3b4wd0,guisasolaa,2,Fri Jun 26 01:09:29 2015 UTC,"I really hope so, way too inconsistent. I'm still sure we are not using him in his best role and the best formation for him but I'm tired of seeing him barely being able to pass a ball 5 meters against smaller sides while doing (almost) everything right against big teams."
atletico,3b4wd0,Rojiblanc0,3,Fri Jun 26 01:12:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Mario is a peculiar case. I have a love-hate relationship with him, but I hope he goes somewhere he'll play consistently."
atletico,3b4wd0,guisasolaa,2,Fri Jun 26 01:17:16 2015 UTC,"I hope he joins a team who aren't in Spain because I know he would become a beast against us. A midteam in PL would be cool, maybe like Swansea."
atletico,3b4wd0,Rojiblanc0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:18:34 2015 UTC,"Nah, he's better than that. I'd like to see him in Napoli"

atletico,3b4wd0,Rojiblanc0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:32:24 2015 UTC,Shit I completely forgot about Borja. Fiorentina would be amazing for him
atletico,3b4wd0,guisasolaa,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:49:39 2015 UTC,"One of my favorites along with Joaquin, old but still gold! He would make a great player to have available in Atleti."

atletico,3b4wd0,sancredo,3,Fri Jun 26 00:45:50 2015 UTC,"Great signing! Desperately needed an up and coming defensive central midfielder, I'm excited to see how he develops."

atletico,3b4wd0,RATMachine,2,Fri Jun 26 00:45:54 2015 UTC,Scouting video looks promising
atletico,3b4wd0,Zokneenho,2,Fri Jun 26 01:37:03 2015 UTC,"Any argentine colchonero here? I would like to know more than those highlighting videos about him. I know he has a lots of talent and some compare him to the young Mascherano, but not more. I would be glad to read some reports about him until he arrives in Madrid as well, since I don't really follow the argentine league."
atletico,3b4wd0,COG9789,2,Fri Jun 26 05:46:59 2015 UTC,Him and Saul in mid in the future is gonna be awesome
atletico,3b4wd0,Hermitrage,2,Fri Jun 26 13:18:24 2015 UTC,Saúl needs to step it up big time though. there are those games that he looks way too relaxed to play and just takes too much time to make a pass etc. he needs to learn a bit from Tiago and Gabi.

atletico,3b4s1z,Januzaj7,3,Thu Jun 25 23:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure myself, maybe he feel like he have won everything he can win with Atleti similar to Diego Costa and Filipe Luis..  Maybe need a new challenge in his career, would really hurt me if he left us though but I'd understand. But if he leaves to a popular club people will finally appreciate him as the great player he is."
atletico,3b4s1z,Rojiblanc0,5,Fri Jun 26 00:59:46 2015 UTC,I'd say there is at least one more major trophy he could win with Atleti... One that the team came within minutes of winning 2 seasons ago...  Hint: rhymes with shmampions league.
atletico,3b4s1z,eddie_atleti,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:36:56 2015 UTC,"Hm, what could that be! :O  Sure he can win it with Atleti but I struggle to see us in a CL-final anytime soon unless we have one of those freak of nature seasons again."
atletico,3b4s1z,Rojiblanc0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"I admit it is a bit optimistic, but I feel like if we are smart about rotations we have the capacity to go far in knockout tournaments. With a little luck, I think we can find ourselves in a final again soon.  Last season though, we just didn't have the depth or bench quality to win a cup while still maintaining our position in the league."
atletico,3b4s1z,eddie_atleti,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:35:10 2015 UTC,Would you say he is worth the release clause that's been mentioned around?
atletico,3b4s1z,gosha1988,3,Fri Jun 26 02:11:42 2015 UTC,"Yes I think so, I think Arda is a player who will be able to play until his late 30's because of that he doesn't rely on his pace.  It's really hard to find players like Arda who can hold off 3-4 players and being able to keep the attack going. Easily been one of our most important players since he joined the club. He would improve any club he'd join (except maybe Barca/Real)."
atletico,3b4s1z,Rojiblanc0,3,Fri Jun 26 02:23:27 2015 UTC,"I love Arda, he's a fighter and he understands and appreciates the atleti spirit, but I would not be too sad to see him go for 41m euros. He will often slow down counter attacks too much which annoys me, and he seems to thrive mostly via linkup play in tight spaces along the wing. I would like see us get away from working down the sides/crossing and more down the middle, so moving him may aid with that.  That is me picking out the negatives though, and I do not want him to leave. Nor am I sure we could use 41m to strengthen our team that much, there isn't that many starting positions to realistically upgrade (considering I want Oli to get real minutes). If we could use the money to fund an elite CM who skews a bit defensively to pair with Koke then maybe. But the sale of Arda may not even be necessary for that?"
atletico,3b4s1z,starvs,2,Fri Jun 26 12:45:09 2015 UTC,I really hope he doesn't. Atleti seems like a perfect fit for him.
atletico,3b4s1z,maese,2,Fri Jun 26 11:07:46 2015 UTC,no way he is leaving.
atletico,3b4s1z,nananananaBETMAN,2,Fri Jun 26 11:08:20 2015 UTC,"I actually think he might and it really hurts... I won't hold any grudges if he does end up leaving, but this will really really hurt."

atletico,3b4s1z,guisasolaa,3,Fri Jun 26 13:52:38 2015 UTC,"I'm at work, but here's a quick summary.  Bartomeu promised Arda as his star signing if he wins the candidacy.  Atleti would be willing to let him go because he's not one of the three players Cholo named as not for sale.  then a bunch of bullshit.  The AS article says:  Atleti executives came back from China and spoke to Arda.  Arda confirmed his desire to leave because he thinks Cholo's playstyle is taking a toll on him and he wants to try something new.  He thinks his cycle with Atleti is over and wants a fresh start.  Arda is and was super professional so Atleti will repsect his wish even though they wish to keep him.  The relationship between Arda and the club is excellent and they do not wish to harm that.   The club would be willing to listen to offers that are close to the release clause"
atletico,3b1j19,carpetano,6,Thu Jun 25 05:31:47 2015 UTC,"I know Arda had a slightly down year, but it would be a huge mistake for Atleti to let him go, even at a high price. He's a creative player they won't find elsewhere.  I really hope all these United and Chelsea rumors are just his agent angling for an improved contract, because Arda's irreplaceable, as far as I'm concerned. Plus I just really like the guy and don't want to see him go."
atletico,3b1j19,csmcgowan,2,Thu Jun 25 20:59:52 2015 UTC,It's not even that he had a down year imo. He was just overworked
atletico,3b1j19,RATMachine,2,Fri Jun 26 01:37:57 2015 UTC,"I really can't think Cholo would let him leave, let alone now, that he stated that we'll play with more ball possession (and they won't sell our key players), and for that, Arda is perfect. I really-really can't see his departure."
atletico,3b1j19,Zokneenho,3,Fri Jun 26 05:23:02 2015 UTC,I swear to god we better not pay that kind of money to get Filipe back. He left us for a seat on the bench at Chelsea! And now he wants to go back to us now that he realized what a stupid mistake he made?

I guess that a lot of people probably have already try to scare you telling how hard it is, so I'm just going to tell you to work hard, find what do you like the most, never stop learning, and once you start to work, try to specialise in developing software for some specific area or business model. Some people prefer to know ""a little about everything"", but in my opinion, a developer who is an expert on some business model and can learn new technologies will have a better chance to make more money because technologies change faster"

atletico,3ay01e,Januzaj7,20,Wed Jun 24 12:12:25 2015 UTC,"Juanfran, holy fuck Juanfran.... Where do I start? No, seriously. Where do I start?  Juanfran was signed for us in Jan. 2011 as Simao's replacement. If I remember correctly, he played his first match in the Bernabeu in a cup match. He hadn't even trained with the first team and needless to say, he was kind of shit. He was kind of invisible for the rest of the season, until he scored against Mallorca and practically broke down in tears because his dad had died and the goal had been dedicated to him. From that day, I could see the passion Juanfran had.   Manzano came along and, well, Juanfran was still shit. In one of our Europa League games against Rennes, Juanfran tied it in the 90 minute, but that wasn't enough for us. Manzano then tried to play him as right back, but I think it was against Albacete and we don't like to talk about that match. Along came Cholo, and Juanfran's transformation was clearly visible. From a weak winger, to a top-notch rightback.   The passion Juanfran had shown before was now present every single time he put on the Atleti kit. Each year, his performances are massive and his fighting spirit is, honestly, unmatched. Remember in the Copa del Rey final when he was limping around and still managed to make a goal line clearance?! Or during the Champions League final, where he was clearly injured and still running and giving his heart in every play, every tackle? Like he said, he doesn't bleed red, he bleeds red and white.  This season, Juanfran was pretty solid as always. He had some very high points in the season, along with some low ones. But that's the truth for the whole team.   I honestly think his best moments were when he was playing with Spain. You can see how much it means for him to represent his country. He's worked so hard to get there and he never wants to stop playing for his country. His pride and love for Atleti and Spain are admirable.  I see him as one of our captains.  My favorite things about Juanfran are everything. The love he shows for his family, country and Atleti. The fighting spirit he shows every time he puts on our red and white kit. The courage and resilience he shows every time he's limping around on the field, fighting for our team until the last second. His love for Atleti. He rejected a contract from Arsenal that would double his wages! Why? Because he loves his family. He loves his red and white family and we love him."
atletico,3ay01e,guisasolaa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:07:43 2015 UTC,"His first game was absolutely against Madrid (don't remember that it was a cup match specifically, but certainly makes sense). But I do remember vividly, in this first game against Madrid, we got some bullshit call against us, nothing too huge, but def an injustice. No one on the team really seemed to care that much, about the call or the game even, but Juanfran was fucking pissed and fired up and he was going at the ref, I've loved him since then. You could tell he really cared."
atletico,3ay01e,starvs,3,Fri Jun 26 12:48:23 2015 UTC,Yeah! Juanfran used to be a die hard Madridista until he played in the Bernabeu with Osasuna and got sent off after he got two yellows for 'diving'. Replays clearly show he hadn't dived and then the ref insulted him. That was when he realized how biased the refs were in Madrid's favor
atletico,3ay01e,guisasolaa,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:13:17 2015 UTC,"Great post /u/guisasolaa :)  But if I remember correctly, wasn't Juanfran hated by other Rojiblanos given to his past as an ex-vikingo?"
atletico,3ay01e,Cambijao,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:20:09 2015 UTC,He wasn't well received and it didn't help that he wasn't that good either. But he worked and worked and worked and you know how much we love hard workers
atletico,3ay01e,guisasolaa,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:10:05 2015 UTC,You have a fair point and I'm just glad it ended well for Juanfran.
atletico,3ay01e,Cambijao,4,Sat Jun 27 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"I guess I can't beat what /u/guisasolaa wrote, but I guess I can bring my opinion of him.   How do you feel this player have performed throughout the season?   Below the absurdly high expectations I've had for him, He's still a top 10 right back, but he is no longer the 2nd best right back in the world which is a shame.   What was this player's best moments this season?   His  many  assists   Where do you see this player in the upcoming year?   I think it should be his last year as our number one in Atleti. Even though he can run to no end, I don't think he can do that for more than one more year. Maybe become our number two to Manquillo or maybe even Gamez if he some how improves immensely this year.   What are your favorite aspects of this player?   He's very well rounded as a right-back. He's also still one of the best right backs in the world. Besides the small group of clubs like Bayern, Chelsea, Barca, and arguably Manchester City have had better right-backs this season."
atletico,3ay01e,Pedrinho21,2,Wed Jun 24 16:11:07 2015 UTC,I absolutely love him but i feel like he should work on his crossing. Too much wasted crosses crosses(lol) my mind. That's the only bad thing i can say about him.
atletico,3ay01e,Cempton,2,Wed Jun 24 14:28:01 2015 UTC,"Juanfran - I think my flair shows how I feel about him.  The man went from being a weak replacement for Simao on the right wing to becoming one of the best all-around right backs in the world.  He shows heart, passion, and love for Atleti and Spain every game regardless of the opponent.  Him and Arda have created the perfect team on the right side and his overlapping runs always look threatening.  However, I do think it's time to bring it support for him.  Gamez can spell him for games, but I'd prefer to bring in a young player to learn from Juanfran.  He's relentless and is always willing to give his all, but he just looked tired by the end of the season.  Best moment of the season for me has to be this goal against Real.  The vision to cut it back instead of crossing it in the air, the wait, the celebration...all perfect.  One of my favorite players and the day he isn't able to continue as an Atleti will be a sad day."
atletico,3ay01e,Mighty-Mouse-Saves,2,Wed Jun 24 16:12:55 2015 UTC,I'd prefer to bring in a young player to learn from Juanfran.   Do you think Manquillo can be that someone? Or will they have to look for the next guy?
atletico,3ay01e,el_cipote,2,Wed Jun 24 20:04:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure - he doesn't seem to get playing time at Liverpool and they opted to play Can at RB or as the right CB with 3 CBs.  I, honestly, haven't seen a lot of Manquillo so someone else is definitely more qualified to speak of him.  Hopefully he's able to get time this year though."

atletico,3axmb4,tuai-,4,Wed Jun 24 15:29:34 2015 UTC,Yep. He absolutely adores this club. I can't find any reason for him to leave. The agent is just asking for more money.
atletico,3axmb4,Pedrinho21,3,Wed Jun 24 14:50:02 2015 UTC,"Here is the link on As. Apparently Arda's agent spoke directly with them.  His agent said the same thing a couple of years ago, and Arda ended up staying so we'll see. If he really wants to leave, we who ld at least try to get all the money than we can (buyout clause is 41 million €). We would also need to bring in an appropriate substitute."

But honestly, he's still an incredible defender and while he made some mistakes this season, his goals in the beginning of the season saved us and his partnership with Godín is one of the best in our history.  His best moments this season were probably in the begininng when he scored three goals in the first 10 or so matches. He was playing incredibly well and then he got injured with Brazil in November which set him back a bit.  Miranda, to me, is an absolute legend. Even if he hadn't scored that goal in the Bernabeu he would still have been a legend in my eyes. He's incredibly kind and full of love. I hope his kids aren't scared to wear their Atleti jerseys now!

If I remember correctly, the share price was about 10000 pesetas (~110 € including inflation), and Gil was every night on the radio saying how broke was Atleti. People was scared of losing their money, and they thought that Gil was going to save the day somehow. At the end, the socios were the only people who actually paid for Atleti shares, and that was just the 5% of the capital."
atletico,3am0v8,carpetano,4,Sun Jun 21 16:03:08 2015 UTC,I was too young then to remember details or to even have an opinion. Garate9 spends a lot of effort trying to explain how the socios felt they had no other choice but to let Gil take control. 20 years later it's easy to see the mistake.

atletico,3amohe,starvs,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:34:50 2015 UTC,"The 28-year-old was signed for €9.5m from Real Madrid when Rafa Benitez took over and his price tag has since doubled.   ~€18-19m for him... I admittedly don't watch much of Napoli (somebody else can tell me more assuredly if he's worth it or not) but if he no longer fits the club, then he's obviously not good enough to be worth keeping around. Considering that and his age, I would not like paying that much. Hell, I'd even have to think hard about the original €9.5m, especially for him to come be a backup most likely. If Napoli wants that high a price, I think Nolito is probably as good or better and cheaper."
atletico,3amohe,el_cipote,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:14:30 2015 UTC,"He's a very good pointmaker and has been key for Napoli the seasons he have played there.

That's one of the best points about him, I hate those players that even if the team is defending and without being capable of attacking, the forward stays frozen in the great area only complaining with the team for not passing the ball to him.

In the /r/soccer thread of this post, a Porto fan said this source, Ojogo, is usually reliable when it comes to FC Porto news.

I'm just gonna assume Atletico doesn't play 100 % and got some kinda financial back-up on the deal.  I really like Jackson but if someone said 3-4 years ago that we would sign him I'd never believe them.

atletico,3aky0u,Drygon,3,Sun Jun 21 09:51:16 2015 UTC,"The club is great at transfers, so if they're priotizing Jackson over Bacca there has to be a reason(I think because he is more different than Griezmann). Anyway, Griezmann, Vietto, Jackson, Torres, Correa and Garcia."
atletico,3aky0u,Hermitrage,2,Sun Jun 21 10:03:51 2015 UTC,This is awesome. Jackson is a very different striker than Mandzukic. He is strong (like Mandzu) but also has quite the technique and pace. Can't wait to see him in action :D
atletico,3aky0u,bgjerlow,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:11:29 2015 UTC,Fantastic signing if it happens. Are we still getting Vietto though? Seems like a bit of a waste getting two good strikers when we have a midfield in desperate need of upgrading.
atletico,3aky0u,csmcgowan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:24:40 2015 UTC,"As far as value is concerned, I think it's a bad signing. But as far as the player is concerned: I'm a big Jackson Martinez fan and think he'll be terrific."
atletico,3aizjl,Cefalido,7,Sat Jun 20 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"Also, Baptistao will go on loan to Villareal.According to Marcelino, they didn't want to sell, but Atleti payed the buy-out clause."
atletico,3aizjl,guisasolaa,6,Sat Jun 20 17:33:47 2015 UTC,Villarreal is a great team for Leo
atletico,3aizjl,Rojiblanc0,4,Sat Jun 20 18:23:58 2015 UTC,I think so too. They have an attacking play style and play Europa League. I think it will help him further develop

atletico,3aim2t,guisasolaa,6,Sat Jun 20 17:14:45 2015 UTC,"As others have said, absolutely Godin for a his importance to the defense and maybe even more so Arda!    There have been a few articles talking about his numbers from last season being mediocre but his intensity and heart contribute immeasurably to the team and are vital to el Cholo's playing style.    And he threw his boot at a lines man (albiet missing horribly) and got away with it. What more could you ask for?"
atletico,3aim2t,detoriginalet,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:45:41 2015 UTC,"To show some intensity and heart is something most fans expects from every player...   Anyway... Arda had, unlike Koke, bad stats and it's unacceptable. Especially when he's regarded as one of the best offensive players in the world..."
atletico,3aim2t,Januzaj7,3,Sat Jun 20 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that every player should play with intensity but there are some players, like Arda in my opinion, that transmit that to their teammates and raise the level of the game in a special way"

atletico,3ahqb5,Hermitrage,3,Sat Jun 20 14:16:28 2015 UTC,"According to As, Atleti are close to signing Jackson Martínez.  His price would be 30-35 million euros. Raúl Jimenez has recently been linked with a loan to Porto.   I'm don't give much credibility to this rumour, we will see.   Marca is reporting it too. However, Marca says it's a difficult move and that Milan looks as Jackson most likely destination.  As translated the article to English, in case anyone is interested."
atletico,3ahqb5,Rojiblanc0,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:55:00 2015 UTC,"30-35 is too much for us for a 28 year old imo, hope this doesn't happen."
atletico,3ahqb5,Mighty-Mouse-Saves,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:49:46 2015 UTC,I agree - sadly that's how much it'll take to get Bacca and he's also 28.  Not sure of a younger forward I'd rather have though.
atletico,3ahqse,Cefalido,4,Sat Jun 20 07:57:53 2015 UTC,"Velázquez's idea is to one day play for Atleti, but as in now, he wants to keep playing in La Liga to develop as a player.  He has no european passport, which further difficults him staying at the club this season. Getafe and Levante have asked for him on loan.    From Getafe and Levante, I would prefer Velázquez going on loan to Getafe. He has already been there, knows the club and the players. Moreover, Levante can fuck off.   Ideally maybe getting a loan to a better club, opting for europe, would be better."
atletico,3afc23,Cefalido,6,Fri Jun 19 17:50:09 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't undestand why we keep selling players, before buying their replacement. Moreover, why are fucking selling without even knowing if we will be able to get new players?"
atletico,3afc23,Ashitakaa,5,Fri Jun 19 17:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yep,I agree with you,but I hope and belive we will get proper replacements."

atletico,3ac9fu,atletifan1,4,Thu Jun 18 22:50:24 2015 UTC,I think we could've sold him for more.
atletico,3ac9fu,MandzoAtleti,5,Fri Jun 19 08:35:57 2015 UTC,"If that's official, we are selling our players for much much less than I expected. First Miranda, now Mandzukic. We better not be leaning towards being more of a seller this window.  Also, with him gone, are we bringing a marquee striker to replace him? Or are we cool with Vietto/Torres alongside Griezmann? Maybe Raul J staying to provide depth? Watching the Copa America I'm kinda wanting Bacca based on the simple fact he pushed around Alves and Neymar :-P"
atletico,3ac9fu,el_cipote,5,Thu Jun 18 23:38:06 2015 UTC,"If that's official, we are selling our players for much much less than I expected.   What did you expected?  We bought Mandzukic for 22M, he is a year older and his last goal was in February, 18M is more than fine.  I would have kept Miranda, because of that goal in CdR final, but 15M for a 31 years old player (next September) in his last year of contract is not bad."
atletico,3ac9fu,angrymonkeyisangry,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"I expected more because previous rumors had figures higher. I know you shouldn't trust what the media says, but I did and it whet my appetite to making a profit off him. Especially when I thought he'd be in higher demand to drive up the bidding price.  In the end, I guess I'm good with it. We have the money to bring someone as good or better and he had to make way for some decent amount."
atletico,3ac9fu,el_cipote,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"Bacca is one of our main targets for striker if not the main target. Also, If we don't get Bacca we may head towards Jonathas. Reports say that we are aiming for Lacazette and Icardi as well but I don't think they are going anywhere. I really hope we get Bacca though!!!"
atletico,3ac9fu,COG9789,2,Fri Jun 19 00:08:36 2015 UTC,I think Lyon wanted 50 million for Lacazette and Bacca would cost somewhere around 30 million. Personally I really like Torres-Griezmann but Bacca would definitely fortify the attack.
atletico,3ac9fu,Maoux,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:18:43 2015 UTC,Bacca's release clause is apparently 25 mil euro.
atletico,3ac9fu,Rojiblanc0,2,Fri Jun 19 12:45:29 2015 UTC,He's only a few months younger than Mandzukic. Is he worth it?
atletico,3ac9fu,el_cipote,2,Fri Jun 19 12:58:28 2015 UTC,"He fits our style much better, he's very similar to Jackson Martinez/Diego Costa.   But I dunno, 25 million is a lot of money and that's similar to what we spent on Griezy. He's a top striker though, would probably do good in almost any big club."

atletico,3ac9fu,angrymonkeyisangry,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:13:29 2015 UTC,I can't believe we're selling him for 5 million euros less than we bought him for.
atletico,3ac9fu,acoconut,2,Fri Jun 19 08:19:17 2015 UTC,"His last goal was in February and he is one year older, what did you expected?  Also, be bought him for 22M."
atletico,3ab6ej,carpetano,7,Thu Jun 18 18:00:32 2015 UTC,We couldn't get more? I had got the sense enough teams were interested to bring the price up higher than that. Expecting at the very least 20 mil.
atletico,3ab6ej,el_cipote,2,Thu Jun 18 19:49:09 2015 UTC,"I love him, great player. I didn't want him to leave.  But he's 31 yo, €15M seems alright."

atletico,3ab6ej,guisasolaa,2,Thu Jun 18 20:03:43 2015 UTC,"I also would have been happier (duh...) with 20 mil, and would have expected closer to that. But we had to move him this summer as he is expendable with Gimenez being awesome. Although I'd rather have Miranda than Toby in the team next year, makes more sense to sell Miranda due to age and contract. Would mind selling both and bringing in a cheaper LA liga experienced back.   Lucas Hernandez 4th CB?"

atletico,3aaetu,Januzaj7,7,Thu Jun 18 14:33:08 2015 UTC,"I thought Moyá was solid. Perhaps not much was spectacular, but definitely solid performances. I thought some of his best work included how he handled coming fresh into the squad and impressed vs Real in the Supercup.  Unfortunately for him, that's probably his peak, and with Oblak hot on the rise and crazy potential, he's got to settle for #2 GK. However he's good enough to where if Oblak is out, or for the Copa del Rey matches, I still have confident that he can perform well enough for the team to win."
atletico,3aaetu,el_cipote,2,Thu Jun 18 15:04:44 2015 UTC,"I was going to type something on this very way. You know here in /r/atletico that I really like him and had my doubts about Oblak at the beginning, but this describes perfectly the situation."
atletico,3aaetu,enodium,2,Thu Jun 18 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was definetly impressed who he was able to handle the pressure in a fierce Madrid derby.   I'm not fully sure if Moyá reached his peak already, there's player who are older than him but still are able to perform. After all, age is just a number."
atletico,3aaetu,csmcgowan,4,Fri Jun 19 11:38:21 2015 UTC,"I thought he was rock solid early in the year. Made few mistakes, got beat for a handful of goals he couldn't do much about, organized the defense well, etc. He's going to be an excellent backup this upcoming season, and if Oblak, say, sprains something and misses a month, I'm confident Moyà can step in and play 95 percent as well as the Slovenian.  Also, it must be said that Miguel is a handsome, handsome man."

atletico,3aaetu,Pedrinho21,2,Fri Jun 19 11:05:25 2015 UTC,"How do you feel this player have performed throughout the season?   He performed far above his expectations, but still not enough to deserve the first choice as Oblak is already in a higher level.   Where do you see this player in the upcoming year?   I see him as a great secondary option. I think he's on par with Claudio Bravo with the small negative of not having great feet, which is not really necessary to have as an Atletico goalkeeper.   What was this player's best moments this season?   Mostly in the early season, where he really shined in Atleti. His performances against Real Madrid have been his best.    In conclusion, Moya was one of our best signing besides Griezmann and Oblak. I am happy he has joined us and hope he stays here. Considering we had Aranzubia last year Moya is an astronomical step up from the man that almost lost us a league."
atletico,3aaetu,carpetano,2,Thu Jun 18 17:02:15 2015 UTC,He performed far above his expectations   Agree :)   but still not enough to deserve the first choice as Oblak is already in a higher level.   Shouldn't the GK spot go to the keeper because of performances and not based on who they are? Should Oblak really be the starter even if the Slovenian make some bad matches in a row?
atletico,3aaetu,JustMetod,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:18:37 2015 UTC,I think you remember Our first leg in the Champions league against Real and there really is no comparison to Moya. Moya is still a great GK but not on the level that Oblak is right now.

atletico,3a9ei7,carpetano,5,Thu Jun 18 10:47:51 2015 UTC,Tiago should definitely stay at least one more season.
atletico,3a9ei7,Drygon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:53:12 2015 UTC,"I think that he will leave if he gets one of those ""last big contracts"" in another country. After all, that was the plan last season, but at the end Atleti offered him a new contract because he had nowhere to go.   Tiago is living a second youth, back in his National Team, and he can offer at least one season more of good football. The only problem I see is that there will be too many midfield players. Óliver will be back, although Simeone said that he would play where Koke has been playing. Then Koke will play on the centre and so do Gabi, Saúl and Tiago. Assuming Mario Suárez's departure (replaced by Motta, if this goes through), we're talking about 5 players for two spots. Koke won't leave, and I think that Atleti won't loan Saúl again. Between Gabi and Tiago, I think that if anyone is encouraged to leave, the chosen one will be Tiago. Gabi's future depends on the Zaragoza match-fixing thing, but I don't think that it will be solved before the end of the Summer."

atletico,3a9ei7,MandzoAtleti,2,Thu Jun 18 07:20:53 2015 UTC,Is that really smart to buy that old midfield player when we have Thiago and Gabi already.
atletico,3a9ei7,Drygon,5,Thu Jun 18 07:59:44 2015 UTC,Yes. He's very good and gives us time to let Saúl grow or find a young cm that we are capable of getting.
atletico,3a9ei7,Rojiblanc0,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:06:39 2015 UTC,"Perfect player to have in our squad, great leader and rolemodel. Would also give us more balance and he's very good at making smart passes."

atletico,3a1pw5,kirbydude1234,6,Wed Jun 17 02:40:56 2015 UTC,"Well the Ligue 1 is easier than La Liga and even so I don't see PSG not winning the league any time soon. Atlético in the last 5 years has won two Europa Leagues, two EUFA Supercups, one Copa del Rey, one Spanish Supercup and a league title. Also in the last two CL has reached the final and the quarterfinals. Not to mention that the best French player also plays for us.  If Lacazette is ready to join a top 5 squad then he is welcomed to join us."

atletico,39zimx,Hermitrage,8,Tue Jun 16 01:29:03 2015 UTC,"But with Mandzukic, Griezmann, Torres, and very likely Vietto ahead of him in pecking order, he'll probably only get playing time by loan.  Even if they sell someone, they're bound to get another big name to replace him, rather than move him up. Sucks because the potential is there, but when you're challenging for titles you almost have to impact immediately or Cholo will look elsewhere."
atletico,39zimx,el_cipote,6,Tue Jun 16 01:56:34 2015 UTC,Wasn't he supposed to be a long term plan?. Signed till 2019 or more if I recall correctly.
atletico,39zimx,Frankocean2,2,Tue Jun 16 02:00:28 2015 UTC,Yes. I was speaking of him getting more playing time next year though. Probably not here at Atleti... unless there's [knocks on wood] an injury or something and he comes in and performs admirably.
atletico,39zimx,el_cipote,5,Tue Jun 16 02:13:09 2015 UTC,"His time will come. It was never going to be easy joining a champion club and getting playing time ahead of experienced players, and on top of that being unable to be loaned out. I think his case is different than other young players because as a striker you need to consistently score to gain form and improve, so a loan would be best. He's going to be a deadly player in a few years time."
atletico,39zimx,fackyouman,3,Tue Jun 16 16:31:06 2015 UTC,"He wasn't well adjusted to the style at Atleti for the first half of the season. Then he had a good international performance against Belarus (scored a brace) which gave him some confidence back and bought him some playing time. He showed a few glimpses of growing form but with Griezmann, Mandzukic, and Torres ahead of him, he wasn't able to make enough of an impact. His confidence seemed shot until just recently.  He has the potential to grow into something special but with the plans to get bigger names for next year he would probably get more playing time at Porto or another team that wants him. If Cholo instead chooses to use the transfer budget to really beef up the midfield, Jimenez might see more playing time next year. I would love for him to stay, but I don't want to see him sitting on the bench because he's not high enough on the pecking order."
atletico,39zimx,robermeheecan,3,Tue Jun 16 03:53:24 2015 UTC,He's a good player but he does ruin a few runs he makes. He'll sometimes tries to force a ball into the box or he was in a position where a pass/shot would fit better.

Messi, Iniesta, Xavi, Puyol, Eto'o, Rafa Marquez, and Ronaldinho were heroes that got me really into football. I still cheer for them when I can catch a game and I'm really happy they won the treble. Barca will always be a special team to me. However, when they play against Atleti, I try and steer clear of conversation and enjoy the football being played.  On the other hand, I can't stand the fans. I stopped visiting their subreddit because the fans were so toxic. I like this sub because there's no ""they hate us cuz they ain't us"" circle jerk and people here seem interested in real discussions. This sub has played a huge role in turning me into an Atletico fan."

I just can't wait for Messi to retire and watch them basically become Real 2.0 buying brands more than players.

Every midfielder besides Koke, Arda, and Saul should leave. Even Saul is staying purely because he has the excuse of lack of experience in the squad.  TL;DR: Our midfielders are shit and we should immediately be signing players to fix it, not spending on strikers"
atletico,39t1qt,carpetano,3,Sun Jun 14 16:21:33 2015 UTC,Don't think this is unpopular. Our defense is solid and our striking team is pretty good. It's what's in between that sucked.

atletico,39t1qt,COG9789,5,Sun Jun 14 21:26:52 2015 UTC,I want Mandzukic to stay and buy Vietto and a couple midfielders. I think it's time for Tiago to leave and Gabi to move into the bench. I also wouldn't mind keeping Siqueira.

atletico,39t1qt,_arkar_,4,Sun Jun 14 14:25:37 2015 UTC,"Idk Vietto could be a hit or miss but hopefully he evolves into a great striker mostly because this wouldn't be the first time Simeone will coach him and I don't think Simeone is going to spend money on those he doesn't believe will do well. Also when it comes to Arda he did have ""bad"" stats but so did Koke this season because the difference between this season and last is that Koke and Arda had to play more defensively but I'm sure if we did have the same team as last season their stats wouldn't be so ""bad."""

It's very possible that Vietto could end up as a great striker but Atlético can't afford to take such a risk. It's would be more wise to wait and see if the Argentine could improve or he could end up like Cerci who had just a good season...   And I think it's not relevant if the player had El Cholo as manager before, we all know what happend when Diego returned to Atlético for the second time for an example.   Also when it comes to Arda he did have ""bad"" stats but so did Koke this season because the difference between this season and last is that Koke and Arda had to play more defensively but I'm sure if we did have the same team as last season their stats wouldn't be so ""bad.""   It's very hard to agree with you, just look at this as Koke has far better stats in terms of assists and chances created. And if Koke can do that even though the Spaniard had to play more defensively, then why can't Arda to the samt thing as well?"
atletico,39t1qt,RATMachine,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:34:21 2015 UTC,"Well by coached him before I meant he helped Vietto grow into the man and player he is today just like Angel Correa has been influenced greatly by Simeone. Simeone knows how they play because he taught them. Also Diego was a great player when he was on loan to Atletico from Wolfsburg during the first and second loan spell. Also /u/Drygon is right that Koke had taken more corners and free kicks and also Arda and Koke are different players with different personalities and Arda does work hard and as hard as Koke does but for those people who constantly eat up stats without ever watching Arda believe he isn't a good player but Januzaj stats aren't everything and those who dont watch him play don't know that he makes ""key passes"" and by ""key passes"" I mean he helps build plays that lead into goals he's constantly scoping out the best situations for Atletico and he makes important passes that do truly help us. Not only that but Arda can constantly hold his own and I've seen him get out of tricky situations to make these ""key passes"" plenty of times. Arda is an amazing player and so is Koke and without them as we've seen this season our midfield collapses and when our midfield collapses so does our offense."

atletico,39orpp,nananananaBETMAN,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"this would be huge. i still remember that goal against sevilla off this exquisite pass from cani. the through ball was magic but it was really surprising that he converted with that beautiful chip after running into space perfectly and i just thought, damn...who is this kid. from that point on every time i watched him play i saw some aspect in his game i liked and haven't seen before. very gifted and young forward molded by simeone. the future is looking good to me."
atletico,39orpp,lingmister,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:14:20 2015 UTC,I'll believe it when the announcement is made. But this makes me as happy as when they signed Griezmann.
atletico,39pik2,Januzaj7,2,Sat Jun 13 14:21:47 2015 UTC,He only has 12 months on his contract tho..
atletico,39p0fc,DesOconnor,18,Sat Jun 13 10:45:09 2015 UTC,"If he was barely playing at United or he was moving from a poor team to Real Madrid, then perhaps I could understand it, but leaving one of the richest clubs in the world to play for Real Madrid? In my opinion he would be betraying his past."
atletico,39p0fc,carpetano,17,Sat Jun 13 11:40:42 2015 UTC,"I would see him as a traitor, yes."
atletico,39p0fc,Drygon,10,Sat Jun 13 10:46:26 2015 UTC,"I still will support De Gea as a part of the Selección, but no I can't say I'm too pleased about him going to Real. He should go anywhere else."
atletico,39p0fc,RATMachine,11,Sat Jun 13 14:28:38 2015 UTC,Betrayal by Dr. Gea in stores now.
atletico,39p0fc,guisasolaa,10,Sat Jun 13 14:45:55 2015 UTC,He won't be able to go outside without having someone reminding him of his betrayal.
atletico,39p0fc,maese,7,Sat Jun 13 14:48:33 2015 UTC,"Lol, Dr. Gea"
atletico,39p0fc,Hermitrage,3,Sat Jun 13 11:06:13 2015 UTC,What's your opinion on it?
atletico,39p0fc,Hermitrage,8,Sat Jun 13 11:11:41 2015 UTC,I'd say traitor too...
atletico,39p0fc,euyyn,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:20:51 2015 UTC,Makes good diagnoses though!
atletico,39p0fc,grip0matic,3,Mon Jun 15 08:29:07 2015 UTC,Autocorrect made it Dr.
atletico,39p0fc,seokaiba,4,Sat Jun 13 10:45:50 2015 UTC,"Almost every ex-player came back once to visit the club, the players, the friends...  Diego Costa did it, Tibo did it, Ujfalusi did it, Simao did it, Forlan did it, even when there is no mates from their time they came and say hello.  Even the fuckin weirdo of Reyes did it... ffs  De Gea, Agüero and a very small group never came.  This can sound stupid, but if a player like Simao or Ujfalusi or Tibo, that didn't come from the academy only say good things about Atleti it's for some reason.  Forlan had a strange exit, almost everyone was mad at him... but who hates Forlan?  De Gea fled from the club when we started to arise again, he just fled at the minimun opportunity. Ok was ManU who picked him, but his way out was like ""fuck you all"", the thing with the blanket... wth was that?  Now it seems he wants to come back to the city says the media, he want to play for madrid... from our academy it seems he wasn't one of us.  As Juanfran said... ""yes I came from madrid academy, I played for them, but the best thing in my career is to play for Atletico, it's a pride""  TLDR to be a traitor you should be loyal in first place."
atletico,39p0fc,seokaiba,2,Sun Jun 14 10:21:40 2015 UTC,can you explain what that blanket incident was about?
atletico,39p0fc,enodium,2,Sun Jun 14 10:28:38 2015 UTC,"nevermind just looked it up lmao, what kind of idiocy was that"
atletico,39mwim,Januzaj7,3,Fri Jun 12 21:42:14 2015 UTC,And where would Griez play?
atletico,39mwim,Verrico,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:01:17 2015 UTC,Probably as a winger.
atletico,39mwim,Drygon,3,Sat Jun 13 00:03:09 2015 UTC,"No, as the main striker."
atletico,39mwim,el_cipote,3,Sat Jun 13 07:47:06 2015 UTC,I'm sure he'll play a lot at both second striker as well as winger next season. Maybe finally get a good rotation going and rest guys so they don't flame out later.
atletico,39mwim,ChinggisKhagan,2,Sat Jun 13 01:33:19 2015 UTC,"But given to how Griezmanns goal scoring production increased tremendously when the Frenchman played as a second striker, I can't really see a good reason why he should play as a winger again."
atletico,39mwim,csmcgowan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:16:14 2015 UTC,"He scored a lot of goals in his last Real Sociedad season too. It was in kinda a weird role as a winger, but played very high up the pitch. Almost as a second striker just played wider than normal. He might been able to do that again or it might make the team too unbalanced."
atletico,39mwim,lingmister,2,Sat Jun 13 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"I guess it's here where I ask if they could play together. I'm not sure if it would work, but I think it's worth a shot."
atletico,39m9kj,Januzaj7,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:59:04 2015 UTC,"Boca has asked Tevez to wait to make a decision until the Copa America is over. Boca’s president spoke to his agent yesterday and they think it’ll be easier to convince him in person once the tournament is over. On july 8, Tevez will go to Buenos Aires to play in Battaglia’s farewell match. There, Boca’s president, Daniel Angelici, will try to convince Tevez. Other ex-players like Palermo and Riquelme will be there to try to convince Tevez because he debuted and played three seasons at Boca. Boca’s coach, Arruabarrena said, “I see it as something difficult. His return is far away, but it’s a crazy thing that is still possible.”  Meanwhile, Tevez is silent. Juve is pushing him to decide his future as quickly as possible. Atleti is negotiating with his agent, Adrian Rouco. The rojiblancos won’t raise their offer of 4.5 million euros a year, what Tevez currently receives at Juve. The conversations between Atleti and Tevez are currently frozen. The player wants to improve his contract while Atleti can’t pay something so high.   Credit to /u/guisasolaa for the translation"
atletico,39kt6x,carpetano,2,Fri Jun 12 12:42:27 2015 UTC,There is still an option to buy a spot in Segunda B for Atlético B The Academy will be subjected to deep reforms as Atlético have confirmed to Marca Atlético still trust in Aguilera to keep his position
atletico,39kt6x,Cefalido,2,Fri Jun 12 12:43:58 2015 UTC,"What a fucking joke. After various awful seasons, the team gets relegated and the still keep the guy around.   What a joke."
atletico,39kt6x,Januzaj7,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:53:39 2015 UTC,Maybe a stupid question but who's Aguilera /u/carpetano?
atletico,39kt6x,Januzaj7,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"He's the main man in Atleti Academy. It's said that he uses it for his personal gain, giving preference to kids who have his 'friends' as agents"
atletico,39fmuf,GPFB,4,Thu Jun 11 12:01:41 2015 UTC,"I see this was posted a few weeks ago, but it's worth acknowledging the players again"
atletico,39fmuf,enodium,3,Thu Jun 11 12:05:05 2015 UTC,"I'm watching as many matches as I can, and I am really enjoying it!   As I said a couple weeks ago next season I will post weekly about the Féminas team. Go girls!!"
atletico,39gb41,carpetano,3,Thu Jun 11 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"Yesterday, Fernando Roig confirmed that the deal will be closed soon and they only need to agree some details. They didn't want to sell him, but there are conditions in his contract that must be respected Racing Club (former Vietto team) will get the 20% of the transfer as they agreed when Villarreal bought Vietto and that's why Villarreal don't want to negotiate a lower transfer The deal with Vietto was reached weeks ago. He will sign a 5 years contract (Marca said that his initial salary would be about 1m€ with yearly increments until about 2m) The transfer would be 20m + 5m in variables Villarreal are interested in the loan of some Atleti players like Baptistao, Jiménez or Correa, but they don't want to include them in Vietto's transfer. They would talk about that once Vietto is sold AS speculate about how will Simeone play Vietto. He would use him as a mobile second striker, so Griezmann may go back to the wing"
atletico,39gb41,el_cipote,2,Thu Jun 11 15:14:41 2015 UTC,"I think Griezmann can go play in the wing for us in a style like Ronaldo or Robben and cut inside. It'll also add speed out there, something we lacked last year.  I guess this means Koke will play more centrally? With Arda or Óliver playing the other side. Assuming the speculation is true."
atletico,39b1wa,guisasolaa,5,Wed Jun 10 15:20:14 2015 UTC,"I hate posting my own articles on here, but this is massive massive stuff guys. When Cholo comes out and names players...oh, my.   Also, a few moments ago Fernando Roig, Villarreal's president, said, ""Vietto isn't officially leaving yet. There has been contact for him and it's very likely that it gets done soon."""
atletico,39b1wa,carpetano,6,Wed Jun 10 15:22:13 2015 UTC,"I hate posting my own articles on here   ...and I don't post your articles to let you do it. Seriously, I see nothing wrong with people posting their own stuff as long as there is a minimal quality and they are adding something to the subreddit. It's original content after all, and the community will say if they are worth or not."
atletico,39b1wa,grip0matic,2,Wed Jun 10 18:00:00 2015 UTC,"Well, offtherecord said that Tevez is gonna leave Juve for sure but if he joins Atleti wants a good contract...   I don't have hope for him."
atletico,39b1wa,acoconut,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:50:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced with Tevez, and if he wants a good contract then I want him even less."
atletico,39b1wa,Springsteemo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:26:39 2015 UTC,"Why? Tevez is an absolute beast of a player and it's not unreasonable for him to want one last big contract before going back to Argentina,  if he doesn't already do it in 2016. when his current Juve contract expires."
atletico,39b1wa,acoconut,2,Thu Jun 11 09:41:50 2015 UTC,"I just don't want a big part of our available money into yet another forward when we have huge needs in the midfield and leftback positions... that's all. If he comes and everything budget-wise fits, then welcome!"
atletico,39bdh4,carpetano,2,Wed Jun 10 16:43:37 2015 UTC,"Also Ivan Alejo, left as a free agent to Villarreal."
atletico,39au20,nicisatwork,3,Wed Jun 10 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"Not unless he personally commits some large amount of money to help bring in players this window. Otherwise it's business as usual.  I feel like his investment is more for the long term, rather than making Atletico instant big-money buyers."
atletico,39au20,el_cipote,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:43:30 2015 UTC,Is the stadium being worked on again? Do you know?
atletico,39au20,el_cipote,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:49:00 2015 UTC,I don't know. Maybe someone from there can tell you.
atletico,39atj1,carpetano,3,Wed Jun 10 14:19:45 2015 UTC,GIFS of the candidate goals   Arda v. Real Madrid Koke v. Malmö (fixed) Giménez v. Elche Griezmann v. Athletic Torres v. Real Madrid Saúl v. Real Madrid Mandžukic v. Real Madrid Griezmann v. Deportivo Torres v. Villarreal Siqueira v. Levante
atletico,39atj1,mylomusic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:20:02 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming number 2 is the wrong gif and the goal is the Koke backheel vs Malmo haha But man, we've scored some nice goals this year!"

atletico,39atj1,mylomusic,2,Wed Jun 10 14:58:23 2015 UTC,Almost half have been the result of Juanfran's play. Awesome player.

atletico,398uih,guisasolaa,2,Wed Jun 10 13:45:11 2015 UTC,This could be a PR move by the Atleti board...
atletico,398uih,carpetano,3,Wed Jun 10 11:24:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I'm surprised that the picture isn't one of Filipe's pugs wearing an ""antimadridista"" shirt"
atletico,398uih,guisasolaa,2,Wed Jun 10 13:07:57 2015 UTC,"Don't remind of his pugs, man :("
atletico,398uih,carpetano,5,Wed Jun 10 13:16:41 2015 UTC,At least Saúl is trying to fill that role
atletico,398uih,guisasolaa,4,Wed Jun 10 13:22:12 2015 UTC,They're so ugly they're cute. Especially the one on the far right.
atletico,399zps,carpetano,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:16:09 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't Chelsea's eagerness to sign Miranda grease the wheels for Filipe Luis' return? Not a one-for-one swap, but perhaps Chelsea would provide the right to buy back Filipe Luis plus 20 million Euros to sign Miranda? Not saying that is an ideal situation, but it seems like a distinct possibility to me."
atletico,39a1u4,carpetano,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:43:01 2015 UTC,"So if I understand correctly, they may be able to spend about €100 million?  Also can that number increase depending on any player sales?"
atletico,39a1u4,el_cipote,3,Wed Jun 10 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, the restrictions are on net spending, so it Atleti increase their income with sales they should be allowed to spend more"
atletico,39a1u4,el_cipote,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:08:22 2015 UTC,"Hot damn! If it goes through, they'll be able to quite a bit of shoring up the squad with that money."
atletico,399zmd,carpetano,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:15:01 2015 UTC,Seems like we're not getting him. He's going to Valencia for €12.5M with a possible €4M based on his performance.  http://www.saopaulofc.net/noticias/noticias/futebol/2015/6/12/sao-paulo-confirma-venda-de-rodrigo-caio/
