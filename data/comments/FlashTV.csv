FlashTV,3e2lc5,legauge,6,Tue Jul 21 17:12:09 2015 UTC,god dammit
FlashTV,3e2lc5,KennyFulgencio,17,Tue Jul 21 18:35:32 2015 UTC,"Not god, Grodd"
FlashTV,3e2lc5,3Pertwee,18,Tue Jul 21 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"Very cool, but he looks a little young, no?"
FlashTV,3e2lc5,somefuzzypants,13,Tue Jul 21 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"It's the actor that has been cast as Jay, Teddy Sears. I do however think he could use some stubble or something."
FlashTV,3e2lc5,somefuzzypants,4,Tue Jul 21 15:23:06 2015 UTC,Yea I think the very clean shaven face made him look a little young. Awesome poster regardless
FlashTV,3e2lc5,dr_theopolis,15,Tue Jul 21 15:24:47 2015 UTC,Flash noob here. Help me out - what's up with the shiny metal helmet? It looks cool but is there story around why he runs around in it?
FlashTV,3e2lc5,YoungNeil38,9,Tue Jul 21 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure on the Flash lore, but if I had to guess, it's to look like Mercury, the messenger god's helmet"
FlashTV,3e2lc5,anemous,15,Tue Jul 21 17:36:14 2015 UTC,Also Hermes from the Greek Gods.
FlashTV,3e2lc5,panthyren,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:19 2015 UTC,"those two are literally the same, one is just the Greek version while the other is the Roman one."
FlashTV,3e2lc5,KennyFulgencio,3,Tue Jul 21 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"might they have different looks or something?  I mean even if it's the same god, they're two different cultures with different artistic preferences"
FlashTV,3e2lc5,panthyren,9,Tue Jul 21 18:36:16 2015 UTC,If you google Hermes then Mercury god a lot of the same images come up. It wasn't really two different cultures considering that Rome lifted them and much of the traditions from Greek culture so it makes sense that they kept the same look.
FlashTV,3e2lc5,anemous,4,Tue Jul 21 18:40:58 2015 UTC,I never said they weren't the same. A lot of people are more familiar with the Greek names than the Roman ones so it's worth mentioning.
FlashTV,3e2lc5,Preparator,3,Tue Jul 21 21:16:47 2015 UTC,"It's inspired by Hermes, his specific helmet belonged to his father in WWI, which Jay modified."

FlashTV,3e2lc5,_JustToComment,6,Tue Jul 21 18:17:55 2015 UTC,Jays helmet isn't that low. Jay isn't that young
FlashTV,3e2lc5,F1uffyTurtle,5,Tue Jul 21 21:19:58 2015 UTC,I believe their going to use the new 52 Jay Garrick that's why they casted him so young. New 52 Jay Garrick
FlashTV,3e2lc5,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,8,Tue Jul 21 16:04:38 2015 UTC,The actor really isn't that young though. He is 38. A lot of the articles announcing the casting put a young picture of him. Here is a more recent one:  Teddy Sears-2015
FlashTV,3e2lc5,KennyFulgencio,6,Tue Jul 21 16:31:28 2015 UTC,Looks (slightly) like Tyrell from Mr. Robot!
FlashTV,3e2lc5,zoopityzoppity,4,Tue Jul 21 18:36:55 2015 UTC,now that's Jay Garrick
FlashTV,3dzttj,Melanismdotcom,159,Mon Jul 20 21:31:39 2015 UTC,"Awesome, can't wait to see Jay's."
FlashTV,3dzttj,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,84,Mon Jul 20 21:33:54 2015 UTC,I'm very interested to see if they'll be doing a classic or New 52 look as I'm fairly certain they've confirmed that the universe Barry traveled to was Earth 2.
FlashTV,3dzttj,StraightScotty,77,Mon Jul 20 21:37:15 2015 UTC,The helmet at least will be classic style based on the S1 Finale and that's the important part for me.
FlashTV,3dzttj,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,14,Mon Jul 20 21:38:23 2015 UTC,Please please please not the New 52.
FlashTV,3dzttj,Hammertoss,4,Tue Jul 21 02:17:37 2015 UTC,What's wrong with New 52?
FlashTV,3dzttj,Terakahn,8,Tue Jul 21 09:40:26 2015 UTC,"The new uniform looks like what someone thought the future would look like in the 90's. The classic uniform is a simple, graphically-striking motif with a Mercury helmet from the Roman gods."
FlashTV,3dzttj,pressuretobear,17,Tue Jul 21 09:57:56 2015 UTC,"In other words, some people, mostly older people like older ""classic"" things that remind them of the Silver Age and hate modernization because it's intended to please young, new readers and not them."
FlashTV,3dzttj,fullforce098,5,Tue Jul 21 12:00:08 2015 UTC,For me the problem is not so much the uniform but the helmet. The Mercury helmet is a defining aspect of the character's look that is no longer there. Which is odd considering his powers come directly from Mercury in the New 52. The New 52 helmet looked like a bike helmet and the thing they have him wearing post-Covergence makes him look like a conehead.   Link
FlashTV,3dzttj,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Tue Jul 21 13:03:53 2015 UTC,He looks like something out of Voltron or Robotech.
FlashTV,3dzttj,Grimorg,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:08 2015 UTC,Is that... Wildcat?
FlashTV,3dzttj,cocoram,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:53 2015 UTC,I believe it's Dick Grayson/Batman
FlashTV,3dzttj,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:06 2015 UTC,That's almost weirder. Gonna have to read up on that
FlashTV,3dzttj,cocoram,4,Tue Jul 21 17:15:24 2015 UTC,Yeah post convergence he looks like he's got a short red dick growing on his head. Not cool
FlashTV,3dzttj,Zoso-Overdose,3,Tue Jul 21 20:56:13 2015 UTC,"Jay Garrick's story was awesome. He inspired Barry across universes, trained and mentored other heroes. He was created 75 years ago and kept relevant throughout this time. He was an honorable man who instilled legacy to a younger generation. This has been lost in the DCU with their 10 year history: heroes with experience and something to give to another generation. People get old, die and are unable to be heroes any longer.   Earth 2/post-flashpoint Jay is just a guy with the same name. He isn't relevant or modern; he is a Flash in a redundant alternate timeline with a stupid helmet."
FlashTV,3dzttj,pressuretobear,2,Tue Jul 21 15:26:18 2015 UTC,Or maybe some people just don't like it because it looks ugly and not at all like Jay Garrick?
FlashTV,3dzttj,nurdboy42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:48 2015 UTC,Not at all. Young people like the real JSA characters better too.
FlashTV,3dzttj,Hammertoss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:18 2015 UTC,obviously they have the helmet... they literally showed it in the finale. it was the first hint we had of his character appearing in the show.
FlashTV,3dzttj,rejectionist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:16 2015 UTC,The person to whom I was responding asked what was wrong with the new 52 Jay. Obviously it is the shitty helmet.
FlashTV,3dzttj,pressuretobear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:58 2015 UTC,The New 52 interpretation of the Justice Society characters is unrecognizable and nowhere near as good as the real thing.
FlashTV,3dzttj,Hammertoss,-16,Tue Jul 21 17:12:57 2015 UTC,Well we already saw his helmet in the finale.
FlashTV,3dzttj,sunealoneal,25,Tue Jul 21 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"It cannot be Earth 2 since Earth 2 is a comic book format right? From what I understand with their universes, each one exists and to pass to one or another he will become one or the other.   Like, if he would travel to the DCAU then the show would become that style. If they came to his universe they would be played by live action.   Am I understanding this correctly?"
FlashTV,3dzttj,BearZeBubus,-10,Mon Jul 20 22:15:59 2015 UTC,Not really sure what you are talking about. Earth 2 is just an alternate universe in the DC multiverse. The universes are bound to one medium or another. This will be a live action depiction of an Earth 2 character.
FlashTV,3dzttj,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,19,Mon Jul 20 22:32:35 2015 UTC,"Would it not be called a different Earth then? Even though the MCU is similar to Ultimate, it is not the Ultimate universe and cannot be mentioned the same. I am using that same logic.   EDIT: It is pathetic someone who is trying to understand something is getting downvoted. Shame on all of you."
FlashTV,3dzttj,BearZeBubus,7,Mon Jul 20 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that the MCU is a part of the overall marvel multivariate, whereas the CW shows don't seen to be a part of the comics' multiverse, so there can be different incarnations of earth-1, earth-2, etc."
FlashTV,3dzttj,Not_Green_Arrow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:16:50 2015 UTC,The MCU is Earth-199999. Whereas Ultimate is Earth-1610
FlashTV,3dzttj,eob157,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:24:48 2015 UTC,Didn't Ultimate merge with 616 thought?
FlashTV,3dzttj,ScrabCrab,2,Tue Jul 21 11:52:37 2015 UTC,"1610 and 616 were both completely destroyed, iirc, and the bits that remained combined to form a new unified universe."
FlashTV,3dzttj,OmegaX123,10,Tue Jul 21 15:35:35 2015 UTC,Thank you for this answer.
FlashTV,3dzttj,BearZeBubus,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:52:08 2015 UTC,"I think you, if I'm understanding you correctly, are thinking about this all wrong. This will be the Earth-2 of the CW universe, Jay will not be coming from a comic book universe into the CW universe."
FlashTV,3dzttj,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,4,Mon Jul 20 22:44:39 2015 UTC,"If what I understand from the comics, this will not be the comics Earth 2. It will be another Earth, like Earth 212345 or whichever number they appoint it. Since from everything that has been happening in the comics, all the Earths (including the animated series, comics, and cinematic) are all connected."
FlashTV,3dzttj,BearZeBubus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:51:13 2015 UTC,"To put it most simply, Marvel uses a Multiverse, where any character can technically cross over into another (Japanese Spider-Man and his giant robot, Leopardon, in the comic series Spider-Men).  DC uses an Omniverse. The Comics, Animated Series, Movies, Series and the new CW shows each have their own Multiverse, where the other groups don't even exist. Dean Cain Superman will never show up with Smallville's Lana. But within those multiverses, there are dimensional rifts, pocket universes, and split timelines that can be crossed into, like in Crisis events."
FlashTV,3dzttj,kinyutaka,0,Tue Jul 21 13:51:00 2015 UTC,It will be the Earth 2 of the CW Universe. Imagine that there is a CW multiverse within the greater DCU.
FlashTV,3dzttj,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Tue Jul 21 01:55:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, and that is also what I meant. So this won't exactly be comics Earth 2 but the CW's Earth 2 which is similar if not the same as comics Earth 2."
FlashTV,3dzttj,BearZeBubus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:47 2015 UTC,Correct

FlashTV,3dzttj,Terakahn,17,Tue Jul 21 09:41:52 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping they use a different style than Barry's. Obviously Jays costume looks different, but I hope they steer away from the body suit being leather and Lycra, like The Flash and Reverse's."
FlashTV,3dzttj,GoWebbGo,3,Mon Jul 20 21:52:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would prefer that as well. I think they could get some humor about Jay showing up in just a long sleeve shirt and jeans when Barry has this advanced suit."
FlashTV,3dzttj,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,19,Mon Jul 20 21:56:16 2015 UTC,Or just the clothes running athletes uses

FlashTV,3dzttj,nurdboy42,13,Mon Jul 20 23:52:27 2015 UTC,They wont - we have already seen his helmet.
FlashTV,3dzttj,bananabooks,2,Tue Jul 21 00:01:19 2015 UTC,"New 52 Jay is a younger version of the character. They casted an older actor and showed us the helmet of his classic costume last season, so I'd expect we'll classic Jay Garrick."

FlashTV,3dzttj,Caraes_Naur,114,Mon Jul 20 22:23:46 2015 UTC,They just changed the emblem. The thing to note is that's the easier to change since that emblem is not built onto the suit. It's uber interchangeable.

FlashTV,3dzttj,TheLieLlama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:58 2015 UTC,I wish the colors become a bit brighter too! But don't think it's happening in this iteration. I'm still hopeful though.

FlashTV,3dzttj,loki1887,9,Mon Jul 20 21:42:32 2015 UTC,"You'll notice that most superhero costumes (DC or Marvel) they darken up a bit. It's usually because brighter colors can tend to look very fake, especially when it's the entire costume."
FlashTV,3dzttj,neoblackdragon,34,Tue Jul 21 00:28:39 2015 UTC,Also just color control. These suits are much brighter then they appear. The issue is it's easier to light a color in the middle then one that's too bright or dark.

FlashTV,3dzttj,balleigh,5,Tue Jul 21 07:52:25 2015 UTC,I heard online that this show was good but it was created for a younger audience (under 18). I watched the first few minutes of the first episode and it also seemed that way. Is this true? The shows concept seems nice but I'm not really a fan of kid humor and such. I want to like this show. Any opinions?
FlashTV,3dzttj,MrFrimplesYummyDog,-2,Tue Jul 21 10:03:07 2015 UTC,"Watch an entire episode or better yet, a few.  I really don't think it's something you can really decide in just a few minutes."

FlashTV,3e46uj,diamondDNF,2,Tue Jul 21 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"Brett Booth, the current artist on Flash, was given free reign to change the costume. From comments I've read from him he seems to hate traditional comic elements(e.g. Hates Superman's haircurl and tights, thinks the normal Flash logo ""stood out too much"")   I would expect the next artist to switch it back to the white background. That logo endured for 60 years for a reason."
FlashTV,3e46uj,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"That would explain Green Arrow's New 52 redesign, but I like the CW style better. What's next, are they giving Firestorm the original suit? He honestly looks cooler when his entire head's on fire instead of just flame-hair."
FlashTV,3e46uj,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,0,Tue Jul 21 20:53:27 2015 UTC,I would guess CW Firestorm will get a full suit at somepoint but I doubt they change the flame head visuals they've been doing.

FlashTV,3e0naf,Ice_tail,17,Tue Jul 21 04:15:46 2015 UTC,I hope they don't make it too dark. It's one of the reasons I love this show.
FlashTV,3e0naf,LastRedShoulder,7,Tue Jul 21 04:12:42 2015 UTC,"Nah they won't do that. They've said they're gonna make Arrow lighter to fit The Flash better, so they wouldn't 180 it like that.

Season 3: Just when I thought they couldn't make him more like Batman... BOOM sword fights Ra's Al Ghul shirtless for fucks sake. Also just as bad, but slightly better than season 1."
FlashTV,3e0naf,UtterFlatulence,3,Tue Jul 21 21:14:22 2015 UTC,"Meh, fair enough.   Season 1 is still my personal favorite and I enjoy both 1 & 2 more than The Flash."
FlashTV,3e0naf,CreepyClown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:16:28 2015 UTC,"Yep. They need to do something drastic after that last season, before the show goes to shit. It's not gonna be as light hearted as the Flash, but Amell has said there will be some opportunity for the characters to actually smile, instead of crying and bitching the whole time.

FlashTV,3e26fx,ForIAmTalon,10,Tue Jul 21 11:28:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think they will keep both separate. No crisis, no alternate earth, no crossovers. Not for the foreseeable future at least.  Audiences aren't that dumb.  I think they can tell that there's two different versions of the Flash; that not everything is linked to another. If movies can do remakes and reboots which don't have any connections to the original, DC can have two Flashes.  The Flash TV show is way to popular. If anything, the weekly Flash episodes will allow people to expand their knowledge of the lore and get to know the character better (even though DCCU might be a bit different). The TV show has more air time and therefore has time to expand the lore."
FlashTV,3e26fx,TwitchyCookie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:44:53 2015 UTC,"The problem with that logic is presuming the show keeps going that by the time the show will have aired, it'll have shown at least 5 full seasons. People who want the flash movie and go ""WOW! THIS CHARACTER IS AWESOME"", won't be able to jump right on into the show. They'll have a lot of catching up to do."
FlashTV,3e26fx,EnihcamAmgine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"They will, but people will probably have access to all the past seasons on Netflix.  Makes it easier than it used to be to catch up on a show."
FlashTV,3e26fx,Rowlf_the_Dog,6,Tue Jul 21 15:52:04 2015 UTC,Everything they've said and done so far indicates they intend to keep the movieverse and the tvverse completely separate.  The odds of them changing their mind on that are right next to nil.
FlashTV,3e26fx,yosemite_sam_tarly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:39:58 2015 UTC,"The problem with that decision is that if they are going to keep them separate, they need to make it so the characters aren't restricted. For instance, we evidently aren't getting GL now because hes restricted. We already know Deadshot is being restricted which is why he was ""killed off""."
FlashTV,3e26fx,EnihcamAmgine,4,Tue Jul 21 14:33:01 2015 UTC,"I think multiple Earths might be too complicated and I don't think that the fact we don't have Gustin or Amell is a bad thing. Sure, I would like to see them on the movies but if it happened, they would be victims of the movies.  Take Flash for exemple, if Grant Gustin was in the movie instead of Ezra, the WWE would probably say no to the newspaper or no to the Lazarus Pit ( not that I would be against this ).   I think we should look at this from the good side and the good side is that they can do whatever they want without having to think about the movies"
FlashTV,3e26fx,Tamaur,2,Tue Jul 21 11:42:30 2015 UTC,I honestly don't understand why DC is going to the trouble of making entirely separate film and TV universes if they're just going to only allow characters in one or the other.
FlashTV,3e26fx,ThawbutSad,2,Tue Jul 21 12:35:49 2015 UTC,"I like the idea that they are seperate. Look at Agents of Shield which struggled until The Winter Solider. They are limited to what they can do. I wish we did get to see the same characters from TV and Movies (At the same time). But only some...I don't want to see Batman or Superman on Arrow/Flash, but somebody like Deadshot..yes."
FlashTV,3e26fx,ThawbutSad,3,Tue Jul 21 12:43:09 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely think it's better that they're separate, this way we can get actual heroes on TV instead of random SHIELD agents and the occasional Extremis victim. I just don't understand why, if DC is so eager to specify that their shows and movies are differing universes, that they don't embrace that and let characters like Harley Quinn be in both the films and shows."
FlashTV,3e26fx,Techno_Bacon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:18:53 2015 UTC,"It's so that the TV Universe isn't restricted by the movies, so they can be free to do whatever they want.   EDIT:Also, why would they take out titular characters like Arrow and The Flash?"
FlashTV,3e26fx,iOrbiTzz,2,Tue Jul 21 20:03:22 2015 UTC,"As much as I want to see Gustin's Flash on the big screen, it just isn't going to happen."
FlashTV,3e26fx,Element1232,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:39 2015 UTC,"The one way they could do it, which would gather all sorts of attention from the show, is if Ezra's Flash story is that he gets struck by lightning, but that lightning is the Flash from an alternate reality who had entered the speed force, and Grant has a 3-5 second cameo apperance as being that lightning bolt which will strike Ezra, making him into The Flash!"
FlashTV,3e26fx,MainlyPardoo,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:16:59 2015 UTC,I'd say Earth 0 is Smallville Earth 1 is Flarrow and Earth 2 is the movies but as stupid as DC/WB are they aren't that stupid to kill off Grant also geoff johns said that all the live action dc things are in a multiverse

FlashTV,3e1f5c,DoctorSteve,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:19 2015 UTC,"Well, If RF died/faded away because Eddy killed himself, shouldnt Gideon fade away for similar reason.

FlashTV,3e1f5c,Mr_Wasteed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"So this poses an interesting point. Because Eddy killed himself, and getting rid of Eobard things it should go back to the original timeline but we don't know if it does. It could pick off same timeline of events that we see in season 1. Gideon should still be there and adapting to the timeline as needed."
FlashTV,3e1f5c,thesequimkid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so usually, looking at multiple sci-fi movies and shows, when this sort of things happen, the current people should forget about Eobard and things as he was never in this time line at all. But if he didnt come to this timeline then Eddy would not kill himself and Eobard would come to this timeline. This is one of the time paradoxes. I think the answer lies in the huge rip in space (the singularity) and   the word ""SpeedForce"". I am pretty sure the writers would do the right thing."

This rumor goes around since season 1 of the Flash. I remember I read an article once & those who wrote it didn't even know that it was Bart Allen the Flash who appeared on the Smallville show, they thought it was Barry so they made a connection. On a different note, Superman exists in the Supergirl show so they could cast Tom Welling just to please the Smallville fanbase."
FlashTV,3e32q5,m0rfeas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:43 2015 UTC,"The fact that he could meet both Barry and Bart isn't an issue. The fact that Oliver is totally different is more of a continuity issue.

Keep it simple and separate, let Smallville have its interpretations of the characters and arrowverse have its own."

Long story short, comic fans will have a general idea of what will happen, but not the specifics."
FlashTV,3dzx69,sonofodin25,2,Mon Jul 20 22:07:13 2015 UTC,Does this mean that all the characters in the show are from the comics or are there characters that the show has introduced just for the show?

Barry's origin, the death of his mother, Captain Cold assembling the Rogues - these are all elements that happened in the comics, just in a different way.  That said, I'd still recommend picking up some comics. Don't try to draw parallels or comparisons to the show and let the story unfold on the page.   And for the love of god do not start with The Flash: Rebirth. That's a story that requires an in-depth knowledge of the Flash's comic mythos to fully appreciate. The Flash: Move Forward is a good starting point for anyone to jump onto the comics."

FlashTV,3dz6ie,ForIAmTalon,5,Mon Jul 20 18:45:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, although Hunter Zolomon/Zoom also took on the moniker and suit of Reverse Flash decades after Thawne.   Cobalt Blue in the comics is Malcolm Thawne. Some have speculated Eddie will be Cobalt Blue but there aren't many similarities.   Hunter Zolomon is Zoom but The Rival is a separate character. The Rival was kind of a precursor to The Reverse Flash, appearing in one of Jay Garrick's comics before Barry Allen's debut.   Yep"
FlashTV,3dz6ie,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Mon Jul 20 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"wait /u/HappinessIsAWarmPoop was the guy running in the flash comic con trailer Cobalt Blue. Because I remember reading that in the comics, Cobalt Blue had stolen the ability of flash's speed by engulfing it in blue fire and then had replicated the blue flash.  Flash Picture  Also I was genuinely curious about who the Black Flash is?"
FlashTV,3dz6ie,CodeRed1,2,Tue Jul 21 02:22:26 2015 UTC,The trailer is almost certainly featuring a new designed Zoom as his name appears at the end of the trailer in the same blue color.   The Black Flash is the speedster version of death.
FlashTV,3dz6ie,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:49 2015 UTC,Yeah but I think this version of Zoom is a mix of Zoom and Rival.
FlashTV,3dz6ie,Todrick,3,Mon Jul 20 19:28:43 2015 UTC,why?
FlashTV,3dz6ie,Todrick,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:38 2015 UTC,I think he will be the Rival but will be given the name Zoom. I'm guessing he's from Earth 2 and is Jays RF..but they just changed his name.
FlashTV,3dz6ie,Todrick,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"That would be pretty silly of them to hype up that ""Zoom is coming"" then... considering the backlash it could generate.  I'm Expecting Zolomon... or some variation of him, his plot line."
FlashTV,3dz6ie,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:32 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm confused on Zoom. I have the feeling he is from Jays world and could be Jays RF. It could be Hunter due to Wally coming on this season. However if they did bring on Hunter I'd like him to be a cop or something before he becomes Zoom.

FlashTV,3dz6ie,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"The Eddie Thawne being Cobalt Blue is most likely NOT going to happen.  Cause he just recently signed on a new show on ABC, though I could still be wrong."

FlashTV,3dz6ie,babypoodle,0,Mon Jul 20 19:51:44 2015 UTC,It kinda would make sense. Wells was a mix of Hunter/Eobard. He was in a wheel chair like Hunter and wanted to make the Flash better. I can see Eddie being Cobalt..Malcolm had an aunt (Can't remember her name) but Eobard mentioned her on the show (When he had Eddie tied up). Plus he had the blue flame thing around his neck when he died.
FlashTV,3dzogg,ajrawings,6,Mon Jul 20 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"Pick up the main New 52 instead. It doesn't tie into the show, but it's much better."
FlashTV,3dzogg,walterpinkman45,2,Mon Jul 20 20:59:07 2015 UTC,Agree with this. The tie-in comics are fun but they go nowhere plotwise and the art stinks.
FlashTV,3dzogg,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:29 2015 UTC,I can't stand the art..pretty much the main reason I won't buy

FlashTV,3dzm8m,jmartinez042899,8,Mon Jul 20 20:38:05 2015 UTC,Because Eobard doesn't generate speedforce.... he just leeches off Barry.
FlashTV,3dzm8m,Todrick,5,Mon Jul 20 20:42:48 2015 UTC,"It's not a comics issue, they did explain it in ep 11, 17 and 23. The issue is that Eobard was having problems sustaining his speed; his powers would randomly short out at times making attempts to time travel extremely risky. Barry had no such problem, so he could open a stable wormhole and Eobard could use the time sphere to travel through it."
FlashTV,3dzm8m,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Mon Jul 20 20:50:14 2015 UTC,Oh ok. I just thought during one of those spurts where he had his speed he could generate enough of it to time travel.
FlashTV,3dzm8m,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,4,Mon Jul 20 20:59:39 2015 UTC,"He might be able to, but if his speed gives out mid time stream, he's dead."
FlashTV,3dzm8m,neoblackdragon,2,Mon Jul 20 21:00:18 2015 UTC,In the finale we found out that if Barry had been too slow he would have been killed in trying to hit that particle. I doubt Thawne wanted to take the chance.

FlashTV,3dvpku,PossiblyLeibniz,7,Sun Jul 19 23:45:10 2015 UTC,"it was one of the only shows ""I have to watch"" as soon as it aired.   Flash aired at 4am over here. In the beginning I watched it, when I came back from Uni. Then I came home from Uni asap to watch Flash. By the end of the season, I stayed up until 4am in the middle of the week to see the episode asap."
FlashTV,3dvpku,DuEbrithil,15,Mon Jul 20 01:07:52 2015 UTC,You're asking a bunch of people subscribed to a fanboard of the show if the show's any good?  Nah.  It sucks.

FlashTV,3dvpku,walterpinkman45,5,Mon Jul 20 08:18:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know how anyone could read the comics and not enjoy the show - while there are some differences (Director Singh is Captain Singh, and Joe seems sort of like Darryl Frye), it is one of the closest adaptations of a comic book you'll ever see.  Barry's power will ratchet up - he's fighting elements and cosmic events by show's end - so you needn't fear that."
FlashTV,3dvpku,TheMurderCapitalist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:46:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was mainly disappointed with the handling of the West family, I didn't like how Barry had just been in Iris' friendzone since he was little and how they basically made Iris' dad Frye. I guess they had to simplify the story but it's just a bit weird I guess."

FlashTV,3dvpku,EobardPrawne,4,Sun Jul 19 23:51:16 2015 UTC,"I love the show. I don't think the Flash is fun unless he's nerfed, he's way too OPed in comics to have any sort of threat levelled against him"
FlashTV,3dvpku,Zoso-Overdose,3,Mon Jul 20 01:27:29 2015 UTC,"Idk about that, but certainly he needs to be nerfed for the Rogues to stand any sort of chance against him"
FlashTV,3dvpku,EobardPrawne,3,Mon Jul 20 08:07:53 2015 UTC,"By far one of the best superhero television shows, on par with the Timmverse animated shows."
FlashTV,3dvpku,Zoso-Overdose,2,Mon Jul 20 08:16:40 2015 UTC,"Yes you should watch it! The cheesiness IMO is great. Really gets to what the silver age Barry Allen stories were like. If the cheese is a little too much for you, wait till episode 9. After that it takes a bit of a back seat to the main plot. And then you have Geoff Johns in the writers' room, so you get a great mix of Wally West and Barry Allen in terms of the characterization, and some really great adaptaions of plot points from the comics, with enough new content to keep people who read the books guessing. Can't recommend the show highly enough"

FlashTV,3dy9zq,daniellsigr,3,Mon Jul 20 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"Will they do any episodes set in an alternate timeline   you need to be very specific and clear  Earth 2 is an Alternate Universe  Which is very different from an Alternate timeline.     But to answer what I think is your question:  ""Will we see any episodes set entirely in Earth 2's Alternative Universe?""  Truth is, we don't know.  We do know Earth 2 characters will be coming to Earth 1.   I suspect we will be spending portions of episodes in Earth 2, to give these characters back story.  Also bare in mind that Kreisberg was involved in the show Fringe, which dealt heavily in Alternate Realities... so that may give us a clue of what to expect(It also may not). If that's the case, the amount of time we spend there per episode may increase as the show progresses... eventually Fringe actually spent entire episodes(and seasons) there."

FlashTV,3dv4mb,catelldm,2,Mon Jul 20 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"That was my first takeaway from the pic, before I noticed that Jay and Zoom were grouped under one actor (which, since IMDB is edited by people in general rather than industry people specifically, I assume was just someone who doesn't know the comics, saw Jay Garrick and Zoom both being announced, and put 2+2 together and came up with 22 instead of 4). I met her (technically not 'met', but close enough, I was at a Q&A session she did, though technically I was closer to meeting Mark Sheppard because he actually stood less than a foot away from me while walking around the audience at his Q&A) at a convention in my area last year, and this never came up. Flash being a big thing both in comics and the show, one would think either she or one of the audience would have brought it up.  EDIT: Interestingly, her time on Gotham as Leslie Thompkins on Gotham did get mentioned, including some vague reference that it was à darker take on the character`."

FlashTV,3dudii,sonofodin25,22,Sun Jul 19 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"1 - Daredevil  Easily the best superhero TV show, the tone and the action sequences are just amazing. I'm generally more of a DC guy, so I didn't have much experience of Daredevil before this show, but after watching it I was completely sold. This show is what I want Arrow to be.  2 - The Flash  Has all the same problems as Arrow does bar one: The Flash isn't scared of being a superhero show. Sure, the low budget can constrain it at times, but it has so much heart behind it that I don't ever really care. Also, time travel is awesome!  3 - Guardians of the Galaxy  I barely even think of this film as a superhero film, and I was tempted to drop it a few places because of that. But I just can't do it. An outstanding space opera that has so much soul that a lot of Marvel movies tend to lack.  4 - Man of Steel  Yes, I'm one of those people that liked Man of Steel. I like that DC is going for a different tone to Marvel (who I'm worried are going to over-saturate the market of the things they're good at) and I disagree with most of the arguments people make against the film. Plus, the Superman/Zod fight is the most epic thing I've ever seen in a superhero film, in the most basic sense of the word.   5 - X-men: Days of Future Past  Time travel is still awesome! Not much to say about this one other than it's really really polished and more than a little bit clever.  6 - X-men: First Class  When the X-men films really hit their stride in my opinion. The friendship between Professor X and Magneto really makes the film, and I just want to be James McAvoy's Charles Xavier so badly. Which is always good for a superhero film.  7 - Iron Man  Solid film that kick-started the MCU. Has a bit more depth than its sequels that lets the film hit the sweet spot between serious and comedy.  8 - The Dark Knight  I love this film. I really do. Heath Ledger's joker deserves all the praise it gets, and I think the adaptation of Two-Face is often overlooked because of him. But it's only number eight because I hate Batman in it. Almost everything that makes the comic character who he is it taken away from Bruce, and given to Lucius or Rachel. Still a great film, but a bad Batman adaptation.  9 - Captain America: The Winter Soldier  Solid superhero spy movie, really made as good as it is by the antagonist being so... not there. Hydra gives the film a real sense that people are in danger, as opposed to having a super-powered meglomaniac we know the hero will defeat.  10 - Arrow  A potentially great show hindered by budget and ultimately not knowing what it is (I always found it amazingly appropriate that season 3 was was about Oliver not knowing who he was). It tries to be a superhero show while all too often saying ""Don't worry normal people, we aren't going to make it all silly calling him Green Arrow or having superpowers or anything. Here, have a romance triangle! That's a realistic problem, right?""  Note: These are all my opinions and you are free to disagree with them without being wrong.

It's been a while, but I think it was a combination of plot holes, bad action scenes in a Batman movie, lack of real detective skills, and a poor script.  I wasn't really a big fan of Bale's Batman either, tbh.  I liked the acting from everyone else, and that was about it."

Still, I feel like Dark Knight is the bright spot in that series. I'd like to find a movie that is airtight without any plotholes whatsoever, but so far no luck.  And you're right, Bale's Batman isn't that great. I feel like Affleck is the one actor who really, REALLY loves the character - so we should be in for something special."
FlashTV,3dudii,ajwhite98,3,Mon Jul 20 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty optimistic about Affleck, actually.  He looks great in the trailers.  One problem that really bugged me was in the beginning, at the end of the Joker's bank robbery.  He drives a school bus out of a smoking, gaping hole in a bank, with the implication that he is successfully sneaking away.  But seriously, no one noticed?  That kind of set the tone for the rest of the movie, to me.  It was a piece of just bad writing, and the rest of the movie felt like it suffered from the same bad ideas."

The Dark Knight-Loved Ledger, but I didn't see him as the Joker. I loved everything about this movie and will go down as one of my favourites. Flash-Best comic book show on network TV, but I hate the fact that it is a CW show. Arrow-Only counting the first two seasons. Hope S4 is more light hearted. I don't want it to go down the Daredevil way. Avengers-The best superhero team up film so far. Xmen First Class-The relationship between Charles and Magneto. Plus that coin scene. Agents of Shield-Great show, loved the Hydra storyline. Now just turn Grant into Taskmaster. Watchmen-Loved the dark, gritty feel to it. Also Rosharch is probably as close to the Question I'll get.

FlashTV,3dsep4,_RoyalFlush,13,Sun Jul 19 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"[Possible Spoiler] In the comics Patty and Barry had a really great relationship and I'm hoping that he doesn't spend this one (like Linda) fawning over Iris half the time. Please actually develop this relationship, and let them actually have feelings for each other, otherwise this is really a pointless implementation."
FlashTV,3dsep4,TheConfusedHippo,3,Sun Jul 19 16:29:46 2015 UTC,"I really hope so too. I know they'll want to do Barry/Iris in the future but whatever romance existed between them in S1 was IMO wrong. Barry looked more obsessed than in love and repeatedly acted like a teenager/jerk around her and poor Eddie. Iris' first feelings for Barry were shown through jealousy and a childish attempt to mess with his relationship with Linda. Also, Iris chose Eddie in the end and if they start the heart eyes too soon, I'll feel like Barry is her second best choice now. Even if Barry/Patty is doomed, I hope they use that relationship for some good character development for Barry and Iris in her own. I really don't want to see Barry madly in love with Iris while he dates Patty..."
FlashTV,3dsep4,TheConfusedHippo,4,Sun Jul 19 17:18:15 2015 UTC,"Glad someone agrees with me. In New 52 at one point Barry actually says he ""loves Patty"" and I feel like that dynamic could be totally ruined if he spends all season moony-eyed over Iris."
FlashTV,3dsep4,daniellsigr,2,Sun Jul 19 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"But if they show him as wanting to be with somebody else, the Barry/Iris relationship will be ruined. You can't tease something for longer than two seasons without people losing interest. I still think Barry and Iris will probably get together by the season finale."
FlashTV,3dsep4,daniellsigr,2,Sun Jul 19 18:39:04 2015 UTC,"I agree but they already confirmed that Patty will be his girlfriend, so what's the point if it's just S1 all over again? He dates her while waiting for Iris to be ready for him? Kind of a dick move. I don't want to watch them build up a relationship with Patty and keep the Barry/Iris will they won't they at the same time... But that's just me maybe, love triangles make me cringe and this show has so much potential, I hate losing screentime over it. The writers can make us love Iris for who she is, look at Laurel S3 or Smallville Lois Lane."
FlashTV,3dsep4,daniellsigr,3,Sun Jul 19 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"I don't really see how he can be with Patty and have them NOT keep the Barry/Iris thing going still (at least underlying), if they're going to eventually lead to B/I together by the finale. They've got to keep it going somehow if that's going to happen. I figured what they'll do is show Iris pining after HIM for a while in the second half of the season, as a reverse of last year, while he's with Patty."
FlashTV,3dsep4,ezreading,0,Sun Jul 19 19:25:28 2015 UTC,"I'd like that actually, as I said earlier for now I think Iris loves Eddie more than Barry and it'd be nice to have her POV and see why/how much she loves Barry too. Meanwhile Barry can try to move on with Patty and don't act like Iris' puppy."
FlashTV,3dsep4,SleeplessNightz,3,Sun Jul 19 19:32:49 2015 UTC,"Here's what I predict will happen: 1) they build up Barry/Patty for the first half of the season (before Christmas), while Iris gets over Eddie and has her own family story or whatever, then 2) Barry/Patty get together in the second half and Iris realizes her feelings for Barry and we get to see her pine after him for a while, and 3) some plot related event or story makes Patty realize that Iris will always ultimately come first for Barry and that they will always love each other, and it leads to 4) B/I finally getting together, probably just one kiss, in the season finale, leaving them to be together for real in Season 3. This is very similar to what other shows have always done for these will they/won't they stories, so that's what I'm thinking will probably happen."

FlashTV,3dvb0r,DeathFeind,4,Sun Jul 19 20:39:49 2015 UTC,"You are right that this timeline shouldn't exist anymore, that's why the Sigularity opened up. In order to close it Barry runs into it, to find a way to close it again and prevent it from destroying the timeline so it still can exist. Because the show is having a 2nd season it pretty much means he made it and the timeline is still intact."
FlashTV,3dvb0r,ElsakaS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"Does that even work? What I mean is, before flash takes off, he stated that he will run counter direction to stop the blackhole, and the scene ends with him just running. Then we see S2 spoilers of the Flash saving the day event. Does stopping a blackhole make everything all better? Even excusing the fact that Eobard Thawne doesnt even exist? Also, season 2 can exist with or without the current timeline since they are introducing Jay Barrick, meaning Flash could've jump into another multiverse. Similar to the tv show Fringe."
FlashTV,3dvb0r,Vlinux,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:00:09 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain there will be more to saving the world than just stopping the blackhole. Presumably that will be explained in the beginning of S2.
FlashTV,3dvb0r,ElsakaS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:33:48 2015 UTC,That is the question everybody is waiting for. :)
FlashTV,3dvb0r,Plightz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:31 2015 UTC,"That's what spawned the Singularity, it's trying to wipe out the dimension cause of the altered timeline.  I think everything will be just okay- judging that Barry does indeed stop it, probably."
FlashTV,3dvb0r,xHovercraft,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:21:06 2015 UTC,I'm afraid of how they'll explain Barry stopping the singularity. I mean he can't just run around it really fast; it was spawned by time itself.
FlashTV,3dv790,orangemonkey21,2,Sun Jul 19 20:07:34 2015 UTC,It's actually currently on CW's site.  Here

FlashTV,3dshn3,Techno_Bacon,2,Sun Jul 19 00:56:21 2015 UTC,They know who Barry Allen is now?   The fuck?
FlashTV,3dshn3,TheChaosController,7,Sun Jul 19 08:23:21 2015 UTC,"I assume he means that the Flash is a wider known entity to all of Central City, and officially established as a hero."
FlashTV,3dva7z,Apple-Juicy,11,Sun Jul 19 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"RF manages to fight with future Barry on arguably even ground. Would be embarrassing for RF to lose against a younger, less experienced Barry."
FlashTV,3dva7z,RetroSplicer,2,Sun Jul 19 20:47:11 2015 UTC,Hmm I never really thought of that but it makes sense
FlashTV,3dva7z,Ackerack,6,Mon Jul 20 13:14:06 2015 UTC,It would have bothered me very much if he was able to beat him 1 v 1. Let's put it in the context of Smallville. Imagine S10 Clark Kent vs S1 Clark Kent. S1 Clark would get his ass kicked.
FlashTV,3dva7z,Deka145,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:59:37 2015 UTC,"To make it even more appropriate, imagine S1 Clark Kent vs S10 Clark Luthor.  Edit:  I don't know how to spoiler tag on this sub."
FlashTV,3dva7z,HPSpacecraft,3,Sun Jul 19 23:40:10 2015 UTC,He's the reverse flash... from the future when Barry just started to be the Flash it would be ridiculous for Barry to beat Eobard
FlashTV,3dva7z,Kromgar,2,Sun Jul 19 21:35:06 2015 UTC,"I think that was a very smart move. I liked that Flash acutally never beated RF or Grodd, either way he got help or lucky.  If it would be just a mini-series I would be bothered by it aswell, but it's just the beginning and it's great to see how he is keep getting better and still have challenges."
FlashTV,3dva7z,ElsakaS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:10:18 2015 UTC,"Well he has been preparing for this for 15 odd years homie, he's going to be more than will prepare for anything Barry throws at him involving any speedster stuff. It makes a lot of sense for Barry to have never beaten RF in a fight, he's been a speedster and knows way more about the speedforce than our Barry does.   It makes it great too because when Barry eventually encounters young eobard, he's gonna at the very LEAST be on the same level, if not better than young eobard. But we shall see."
FlashTV,3dva7z,platinumrug,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:15:10 2015 UTC,It will happen eventually. That episode is not the last we will see of the Reverse Flash. There is absolutely no way they would give up on using evil Tom Cavanagh after only one season.
FlashTV,3dva7z,TheKevinShow,2,Mon Jul 20 17:17:42 2015 UTC,"Man I hope Tom Cavanagh comes back as a regular. Whether he comes back as the actual Harrison Wells or Eobard Thawne, I don't care, I just hope he comes back.   I loved his character!"
FlashTV,3dva7z,Techno_Bacon,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:01 2015 UTC,He is a Regular for Season 2.
FlashTV,3dva7z,Nightdocks,2,Tue Jul 21 00:02:04 2015 UTC,He said at comic con he will come back and his interest is being reverse flash
FlashTV,3dva7z,TheKevinShow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:00 2015 UTC,I hope he comes back as both. The multiverse enables that.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,sonofodin25,136,Sat Jul 18 16:40:08 2015 UTC,Probably Reverse flash.   His speed combined with his intelligence and knowledge of the future and who people are made him formidable.   It was only through so many people working together that he was able to be beaten.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,danielr1341,102,Sat Jul 18 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Reverse Flash was so powerful because he came from an alternate timeline where the heroes are more developed: I would assume, for example, that the future Flash we see in Barry's house the night his mother died was just as powerful as Eobard was.  To put it into the perspective of the show, it's like a season 10 character travelling back to season 1 and kicking everyone's underdeveloped asses."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Garahel,46,Sat Jul 18 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"I think that while in the pipeline Wells does actually say how he and future Barry are evenly matched.   Also, if they weren't evenly matched, Eobard would have no reason to travel back in time to kill kid Barry."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,BlackCharizards,36,Sat Jul 18 17:40:30 2015 UTC,"He didn't mean current Barry. Eobard is definitely more powerful than him. He meant future Barry, the one Eobard fights when he travels back in time to kill Barrys mum."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,iDillo17,-20,Sat Jul 18 17:42:57 2015 UTC,Mom.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,MichaelArnold,5,Sat Jul 18 17:49:30 2015 UTC,Yes son?
FlashTV,3dqyv7,iDillo17,-4,Sat Jul 18 21:18:41 2015 UTC,Why do you call Dad 'mum'?
FlashTV,3dqyv7,MichaelArnold,4,Sat Jul 18 22:13:52 2015 UTC,The Flash that Barry see's in his home as a child and later tells present Barry to stay back is on par with Eobard.  The Flash we watch all season was of course way behind.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Leftys-Wheelchair,3,Sat Jul 18 23:13:00 2015 UTC,Never thought about it this way before. Only makes the Flash team more badass for defeating him!
FlashTV,3dqyv7,StraightScotty,27,Sat Jul 18 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"I still think Eobard let them defeat him, it was all part of his plan to end up in the pipeline. The only moment he hadn't predicted was Eddie's suicide."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Airsay58259,12,Sat Jul 18 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"The only moment he hadn't predicted was Eddie's suicide.   Part of me even thinks he predicted that and that was his insurance if his primary plan failed. I can't figure out why exactly but I'm still left with the question of how Eddie was his ""insurance"" and why he would spend so much time berating him about being a nobody."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,8,Sat Jul 18 18:49:30 2015 UTC,"True, why keep him as an insurance and then leave him behind at Star Labs, knowing the team would find him... It's all very confusing."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Airsay58259,4,Sat Jul 18 19:36:51 2015 UTC,Well my thought on that was that he made Eddie feel like crap and then made it all seem like Barrys fault. That was him attempting to instill the family hatred of the Allen's into him. If he had just kept him locked up that may have prevented him from hating Barry the same way.  Possibly part of a plan on case he failed. Also if he left him locked up then failed he would never exist as Eddie would starve to death.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Fiorbeth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:42:44 2015 UTC,Maybe he knew. That if he's erased from that timeline he would something something SPEEDFORCE and get back to the original?
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Taconinja007,17,Sat Jul 18 23:42:15 2015 UTC,"Even scarier is that they didn't beat him. Wells was about to kill Barry and there was nobody else there who could possibly match up to him, but Eddie more or less cheated the system to finally take him down."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,scampae,5,Sun Jul 19 08:30:28 2015 UTC,That's still beating him.   Technicalities don't matter.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,danielr1341,2,Sat Jul 18 17:40:02 2015 UTC,"I'd view him as tied with Barry. Reverse Flash can do faster bursts of speed than Barry, but he can't sustain them. RF seemed suitably impressed when Barry was able to sustain Mach 2, plus who knows how fast he was going when he ran up and down that coast line? That looked like near orbital speed.   Wells is shrewder than Barry, which makes him formidable - ""I'm always one step ahead.""  But Barry is a better team leader - he inspires loyalty and sacrifice.  And that is a ""superpower"" too."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Reverse_Grodd,45,Sat Jul 18 17:43:54 2015 UTC,"Characters from Arrow can be suggested as well, but they don't even have powers soooo..."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,kewers77,10,Sat Jul 18 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"Well Cisco and Caitlin defeated him in 10 seconds in 219, with no powers. And also made the mirakuru cure... Team Flash FTW"
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Airsay58259,10,Sat Jul 18 18:07:07 2015 UTC,"Lol wasn't saying he's the most powerful, just that he had powers."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,kewers77,6,Sat Jul 18 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, I read it like that lol sorry."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Airsay58259,47,Sat Jul 18 20:00:56 2015 UTC,"Going by who's appeared on screen... Firestorm. The guy is a walking, talking nuke."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Lavaros,23,Sat Jul 18 20:18:22 2015 UTC,"They haven't done the transmutation stuff yet either, which is straight op. The only thing that kept comic Ronnie from instantly solving most problems was his own stupidity, which isn't present in TV Ronnie."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,armakaryk,16,Sat Jul 18 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"was his own stupidity, which isn't present in TV Ronnie.   I like to think he's a bit of a pretty boy in the series, and not as bright as the others... but then he worked at that facility, so that theory is right out."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,_mach,5,Sat Jul 18 18:32:25 2015 UTC,"He's hot, smart, and hot. It's just not fair :("
FlashTV,3dqyv7,mirrorwolf,6,Sat Jul 18 18:53:05 2015 UTC,"I think you forgot to mention charming, hot, courageous/self-sacrificing and hot."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Roman2250,5,Sat Jul 18 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"He's Amelltastic, he's amellirific."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,SleeplessNightz,13,Sun Jul 19 04:46:36 2015 UTC,They did but they reportedly cut it out of the final copy and decided to leave it to the more heavy (what I assume is) firestorm/killer frost episode
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Jackstryder508,9,Sun Jul 19 11:44:13 2015 UTC,"But they HAVE mentioned the Firestorm Matrix, which is incredibly powerful even if he has not used it. Of course in the original run it was ""meant"" to be Stein only in the explosion and he was going to be Gaia's fire elemental as a champion for earth. Firestorm was an accident. But that has probably been retconned a dozen times.   Even without transmutation Firestorm is more than a walking nuke. He can create eat nukes and create the core of the sun on the earth. It is how he killed the original Killer Frost. Her power is heat absorption...he MELTED her. It is like Superman getting a sunburn or Aquaman drowning."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,albygeorge,13,Sat Jul 18 19:10:23 2015 UTC,"Grodd seemed really powerful to me. He tanked a mach punch from Barry and demonstrated the ability to wreck his mind in a few seconds. Since Barry rarely likes to go all out and tries for a less aggressive and more holistic approach to heroism, Grodd can use that and exploit Barry's good guy nature.  Reverse-Flash is definitely powerful. He knows how amazing his abilities are. And keep in mind we're seeing a pretty weakened version. Imagine what he was like in his prime.  I'd also mention Firestorm. He seems to have a lot of potential, plus he can fly and seems pretty durable to energy attacks (though we haven't seen much from him - hoping for more awesome abilities in Heroes of Tomorrow)."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,somethinglawful,6,Sat Jul 18 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"I'd rank Reverse Flash over Grodd, though I agree he was mad  powerful. Reverse Flash is more creative in his application that Barry using what ultimately comes down to brute force - vibrating handknifestabby vs ""I'mma run real fast and punch 'im again!""."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Ahesterd,22,Sat Jul 18 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to say the Reverse-Flash to start it off, but Firestorm and Weather Wizard come to mind as well..."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Timetmannetje,10,Sat Jul 18 18:54:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's the Reverse Flash. He handled himself well against the Arrow, probably the best martial artist/hand to hand fighter in the CWverse. He knocked away Firestorm in a flash . And in the Pipeline he would've been able to kill the Flash if Eddie didn't shoot himself. And Arrow and the Flash have at least at one point taken down every other powered character. Which means Reverse Flash would probably be able to take on everyone in the CWverse."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,silly_sia,8,Sat Jul 18 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"While probably never going to be this powerful on the show, I read a fun fact on wikipedia that spoiler. In terms of pure power, that's pretty impressive."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Leftys-Wheelchair,3,Sat Jul 18 18:12:06 2015 UTC,In regards to your spoiler
FlashTV,3dqyv7,silly_sia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:40:37 2015 UTC,I believe he becomes a super hero. :)
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Leftys-Wheelchair,4,Sat Jul 18 20:41:02 2015 UTC,AHA! Spoiler on what we're talking about
FlashTV,3dqyv7,silly_sia,3,Sat Jul 18 20:43:10 2015 UTC,spoiler
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Leftys-Wheelchair,2,Sat Jul 18 20:45:54 2015 UTC,I'll google.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Pluijmpie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:07:01 2015 UTC,RSK!
FlashTV,3dqyv7,pizzaslice,9,Sat Jul 18 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say that future Barry is the strongest person we've seen so far, even though it was only for a few minutes, from what we know about how difficult it was for reverse flash to deal with him it's probably safe to say he's stronger than Eobard."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,50sDadSays,33,Sat Jul 18 21:26:56 2015 UTC,"Reference was made to a particular test pilot at Ferris Aircraft who, if he had his jewellery, is the most powerful (except, I guess that would imply his bosses exist too)."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,xxMrAnarchyxx,8,Sat Jul 18 19:45:37 2015 UTC,Airfield?
FlashTV,3dqyv7,BlackCharizards,16,Sat Jul 18 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"Reference to Green Lantern, who was all but name dropped in 1x22, where there is a mention of a test pilot who went missing. This is the origin for Green Lantern."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,xxMrAnarchyxx,8,Sat Jul 18 17:35:25 2015 UTC,"Lol I know, but he said Ferris Aircraft not Airfield."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Leftys-Wheelchair,7,Sat Jul 18 17:42:15 2015 UTC,It was also mentioned a bit in the Arrow right?
FlashTV,3dqyv7,MightyGreenPanda,10,Sat Jul 18 18:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, and Ollie was heading for Coast City on the flashbacks. That, and the fact that the ""disappeared Ferris Airfield pilot"" bit was cut from the Pilot but added on 1x22 makes me extremely hopeful for Hal to appear at some point. spoiler This is going to be fucking insane."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Leftys-Wheelchair,6,Sat Jul 18 20:38:14 2015 UTC,Oh. Forgot about that simply because this year was lacking IMO.   Can't wait though. Hopefully they introduce some things :)
FlashTV,3dqyv7,SleeplessNightz,3,Sat Jul 18 21:41:18 2015 UTC,don't forget Hawkman.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,ludsp,0,Sat Jul 18 21:44:12 2015 UTC,Except Supergirl isn't in the same universe.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,roxxas92,2,Sun Jul 19 11:45:03 2015 UTC,And the pilot was pretty awful so I'm glad its not haha.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,MightyGreenPanda,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yet. The producers have expressed several times that they want the shows to be connected, and it's still a possibility on S2 depending on how well the first one does."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,JoeyPantz,5,Sun Jul 19 07:33:28 2015 UTC,They also train Barry at Ferris airfield in the first couple of episodes.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,AcesCharles2,13,Sun Jul 19 07:44:47 2015 UTC,The Flash. If it wasn't for plot armor the villains would be locked up in the first fifteen minutes of an episode.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Leftys-Wheelchair,6,Sat Jul 18 18:11:10 2015 UTC,"Which Flash though?  If we're talking about removing all plot armor, I'm still assuming at the start of the season we have a really new and useless Flash. By the end he's stronger but only really because of the plot armor and/or team he has. Eobard was still stronger in the end, only to stopped by the plot armor.  Or am I taking this wrong?"
FlashTV,3dqyv7,00wolfer00,6,Sat Jul 18 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly the plot armor in this show is pretty damn stupid... no one without powers should be able to even go as far as touch Barry, let alone do any harm to him."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,ecnahc515,7,Sat Jul 18 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"He's not in the universe yet, but will be. So I'd have to say Zoom. When he arrives shits going to get intense."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,ErwinsZombieCat,5,Sat Jul 18 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"Technical if Barry could harness the speedforce correctly he is easily the most powerful. But due to plot devices he can't be, sooooo RF"
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Airsay58259,4,Sat Jul 18 19:42:00 2015 UTC,"For now in the show I have to say Reverse Flash, but Firestorm is one of the most powerful human on earth when he has all his abilities, right? He could turn Eobard's blood into water and that's it. Then if we talk about potential, isn't cold a speedster's weakness? Killer Frost could slow both Eobard and Barry down and then steal their heat. Sure they could go fast enough to stop her before but without touching her, it could be difficult. I don't know enough about Vibe's powers but apparently they can be pretty epic. In other words: can't wait for S6 when everyone is fighting each other (or well, S3 if everyone in Barry's entourage gets a suit that soon... cough Arrow cough)."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,albygeorge,2,Sat Jul 18 17:41:17 2015 UTC,"He could turn Eobard's blood into water and that's it.   Not unless they changed him recently, haven't read him much since the original run but he was always limited to inorganics, and cannot transmute living material. He did it once by accident when he was hit with a weapon that made him lose control of his power and when he transmuted a living person...it had a REALLY nasty backlash on him.  But yeah, Firestorm is the most purely powerful we have seen so far. He took on the entire Justice League and won. Though to be fair he is kind of made to drop their heavy hitters. Plus there was the issue when he created a star. A full blown full size star."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,thenottoserious,5,Sat Jul 18 19:01:59 2015 UTC,"Zoom, hunter zolomon is way faster than any given speedster. Wally could not even SEE him after speed stealing other flashes on the scence."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Plightz,2,Sat Jul 18 19:55:03 2015 UTC,He did see him after Jesse quick gave her speed.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Canadian_SNIFFLER,5,Sat Jul 18 19:20:59 2015 UTC,"When grodd develops even more, I have no doubt in my mind he will be the strongest. An ape with super strength more intelligent than any one in the show."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Thesheephead007,2,Sat Jul 18 21:55:00 2015 UTC,Not actually powerful but mentally better is arrow
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Thesheephead007,4,Sat Jul 18 19:34:53 2015 UTC,"I think that The Reverse-Flash, Martin Stein, Cisco, Caitlin, Deathstroke and Diggle are all smarter than Oliver. He's made some pretty bad decisions in his show."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Kolanj,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:52:06 2015 UTC,"That he has but he beat Barry once, beat RF with little help, and also beat rhas who is one of the most notorious in the comics for being super skilled as is deathstoke. Yes all of those people are smart but Oliver isn't stupid and he understands the world how it is better than them. To RF everyone is just a headline or history figure, to Barry everyone is supposed to be good, to Cisco its numbers and machines hat fonts make them powerful  I understand that I said mentally but I meant more of a batman type thing and that arrow doesn't have superpowers"
FlashTV,3dqyv7,dogty,3,Sun Jul 19 03:34:09 2015 UTC,OBVIOUSLY ITS CISCO. CMON BRO VIBRATIONS OF THE FREAKIN UNIVERSE?
FlashTV,3dqyv7,Copper_Coil,3,Sun Jul 19 04:46:58 2015 UTC,Anyone who can travel back in time is the most powerful character in the universe.
FlashTV,3dqyv7,spoyte,2,Sun Jul 19 03:46:53 2015 UTC,Vibe. His powers can counter the speed force. He's the great off button.

So, I guess it's pretty powerful. Else, I would says futur barry (when he control a bit more his power) as then he's pretty much a god, and can even go back in time to make whatever he wants."
FlashTV,3dqyv7,SleeplessNightz,2,Sat Jul 18 21:53:40 2015 UTC,Well Zoom's use of time allows him an edge of Flash because Zoom isn't so much moving faster. But his control isn't really leagues above the powers of the speed force. Wally has triumphed over the man many times.   Then Barry's ability to time travel. Well Rip Hunter can do it without breaking a sweat. It's being able to do it and not bleep up the timestream or else Barry would erase himself.

FlashTV,3do26k,SirSX3,10,Fri Jul 17 21:05:25 2015 UTC,Oh my god I've had the S01E09 video you did of this in my favorites for so long. How do you do it?
FlashTV,3do26k,BrightDarkness16,3,Fri Jul 17 21:41:22 2015 UTC,my guess is SVP for MPC HC

They've already said he's going to be more on his own, and after his experience with RF, he might be pretty skeptical of other speedsters...  On a slightly less interesting theory, though, I'm fairly certain those soundbites came from the table reads, so there's a good chance the tone may change when those scenes are filmed."

FlashTV,3dpll5,xHovercraft,3,Sat Jul 18 12:30:53 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the only answer, although not good enough for some  I think this is our very first real ""speedforce"" explanation we will have on the show. Everything can be explained in one way or another yet this instance is where we can say ""speedforce"""
FlashTV,3dpll5,nerfAvari,2,Sat Jul 18 12:09:51 2015 UTC,"An even more interesting question is how he was able to talk while doing the speed mirage thing. Does he say the words in bits? Or does he speak normally during the whole thing? But then where does the sound of his voice come from?  The less you think about this stuff, the better."
FlashTV,3dpll5,aGuyFromReddit,3,Sat Jul 18 15:47:46 2015 UTC,"It was a hologram and Eobard was punching/damaging himself so fast no one could tell it wasn't the hologram hitting him, the only person who would have been capable of even noticing something that fast would be Barry but Barry wasn't there at the time. While everyone's confused and the forcefield turns off, Eobard superspeeds into his Reverse Flash costume, beats the shit out of the police team and runs off while everyone follows, forgetting 'Wells' is left behind and bleeding."
FlashTV,3dpll5,Theculshey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:02:58 2015 UTC,"I guess that could make sense. The thing that just bothered me with S01E15 is how they introduced the idea of the speed mirage but didn't really ACTUALLY explain what he did, just that he used it at some point."
FlashTV,3dpll5,daffydunk,2,Sun Jul 19 19:23:12 2015 UTC,It was a hologram.
FlashTV,3dpll5,FriendlyBatman,3,Sat Jul 18 06:30:06 2015 UTC,"The hologram was inside the machine, then The RF ran around the room killing people"
FlashTV,3dpll5,daffydunk,2,Sat Jul 18 14:24:21 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't make sense because when Cisco said, ""that night, there were two of you"" Eobard said it was the speed mirage."
FlashTV,3dpll5,essentialblend,2,Sat Jul 18 14:39:51 2015 UTC,Then Cisco discovers the Hologram recording in the trap room.
FlashTV,3dpll5,Kotsoumpis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"IMO this is what happens, either of these two cases.   One, its a Hologram which starts 'My goals are beyond your understanding etc' monologue, and Harrison Wells is on his chair.   Then suddenly he gets grabbed into the forcefield and gets beaten up.Its either Eobard changing into the suit quickly and leaving a 'normal Wells' mirage behind, where he would change into the suit beat his speed mirage up.   OR   Its either him getting out of the suit > becoming Normal Wells , getting beat by his mirage.  its confusing, but if you just look at the comics ,Flashes are capable of doing incredible things with their residues/mirages. So while in the series, the writers have poorly explained it, it's definitely possible."
FlashTV,3dpll5,tardis27,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:49:32 2015 UTC,The one thing that buffles me that Harrison Wells was in star labs and on the stadium beating Barry . HOW DID HE DO THAT?!
FlashTV,3dpll5,AlexHD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:00:00 2015 UTC,Speed mirage when RF is fighting police and Wells is just lead there. Pre-recorded hologram when RF is in the trap and talking and beating up Wells. Speed mirage isn't him moving between two places really fast. It's doing it for a second to create an image of himself that just stays there whilst he goes off and does his thing.
FlashTV,3dpll5,agreedis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"It was pretty poorly explained. We don't know how much of that sequence was RF's hologram, and how much was his speed mirage making it look like he was fighting Wells.  The whole thing is much more easily explained with a choreographed hologram, but if that's the case, why even bother explaining the speed mirage thing?"

FlashTV,3dmlmx,AGreenspun,13,Fri Jul 17 16:11:44 2015 UTC,"One thing he does that I love about Tom as an actor is he always distances himself from Eobard/Wells (speaking about the character in third person), but the actors he works with are their own characters (talking about Rick Cosnett like he's actually Eddie)."
FlashTV,3dmlmx,RG00,9,Fri Jul 17 18:11:14 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too. Candice also talks like she's Iris (even on Twitter), so does Carlos. Danielle (Caitlin) doesn't though, maybe because both Tom and her have more experience as actors."
FlashTV,3dmlmx,DragonNades,8,Fri Jul 17 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"It's the difference between their acting style. Carlos, Candice, and many actors are method actors (Like Daniel Day Lewis and Jared Leto). It helps the actor learn more about their character, and what they may do or how they think. With Tom and Danielle, the style is called ""Practical acting"" which helps keep the actor seperate from the character, and allows for a subtler performance, in my opinion.l"

FlashTV,3dlanc,overkill136,2,Fri Jul 17 22:03:12 2015 UTC,"There are two different setups for his masked/unmasked scenes. My best guess is that for the unmasked scenes, his Flash jacket has a detachable hood piece meant to look like the mask.  For the masked scenes, he wears a one-piece mask (as shown here).  There's no way the present hood can form around his head the way the mask does, and any scene where Barry puts up or takes down his mask, there's always a cut. It's no big deal, but they are different pieces of costume."

In it is a desperate and depending on how much time has passed, despondent ""Wells"" trying to figure out how to locate Barry and get home. So either he will find a way to the show's current timeline or the team will feel they need him for some purpose(I would guess Zoom.)  If you are asking about how we know he's playing Eobard, in addition to the voiceovers he provided for the trailer which are clearly Eobard, there's these interviews he's done:  Link to IGN interview where TC says he's not interested in playing real Wells  Link to interview where he says the thing he is most looking forward to in Season 2 is putting the RF costume back on"

It also means on some level he really doesn't like interacting with his fans, just not for a bad reason, and he clearly pushes it aside to interact with people anyways. As a once really shy person I definitely both loved and hated being around people and probably looked like I hated being where I was fairly frequently."

FlashTV,3djywf,dontforgetpants,7,Fri Jul 17 16:09:39 2015 UTC,"It's honestly suprising the way they handled the flash. I come from a non-comic book perspective but I love to read around and have seen justice league etc. It's hard to introduce topics such as time travel in flash and keep it simple but at the same time keep the comic fans happy too, which is something they did really well. Arrow started off as a show which has defined its borders with comic books, but now those lines are blurred. I'm happy the way both shows are going, but the pace of the flash is refreshing and I can't wait to see what's next. The only regret I have is not being a comic reader I can't spot minor or major Easter eggs and nerdgasm. Oh well, normal fangasms for me it is. September/October can't come sooner.

Like Barry when his loved one are in danger (fast enough to time travel, outrun lightning), Clark was able to fly in extreme situations, he just didn't realised it yet.

FlashTV,3dk4ea,quintislice,21,Thu Jul 16 22:32:06 2015 UTC,I think the best way to do it is like Saints Row 4's super speed. That game felt like a Flash game mixed with other heroes too.
FlashTV,3dk4ea,MisterrAlex,8,Thu Jul 16 22:35:21 2015 UTC,My idea:  Instead of making it so you are going super fast everywhere I think for going about the city you go at a default speed and when you go faster you go slightly faster but time slows down (cars go slow) making it easy to control and also giving a similar vibe to what the flash sees.

FlashTV,3dk4ea,Techno_Bacon,2,Fri Jul 17 06:03:12 2015 UTC,I have seen people talking about the difficulties of this kind of game. thought this was cool.
FlashTV,3dk4ea,zoneluke,4,Thu Jul 16 22:32:59 2015 UTC,the issue is always making it fast but slow enough that is controllable.  this sonic demo looks controllable
FlashTV,3dk4ea,Anivair,2,Thu Jul 16 23:13:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah. As MisterrAlex said, saints row had a very cool super speed engine. The thing would be seeing other speedsters in action in the game. How would they interact at super speed?"
FlashTV,3dk4ea,xHovercraft,2,Thu Jul 16 23:17:58 2015 UTC,"Slow is easy,  too.   The oldest speed effect is just slowing everyone else down.  The problem there is that it no longer feels like a flash game at that point,  it just feels like a game where everyone is moving real slow."
FlashTV,3dk4ea,Zinkos,3,Fri Jul 17 03:57:10 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between controlling that kind of speed in an empty field and in a city with people, buildings and cars."
FlashTV,3dk4ea,EliteCinema,4,Thu Jul 16 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"Saints Row 4, Infamous Second Son and Infamous First Light all handled speed pretty well. I think if a game was made with similarities to those it could be awesome."
FlashTV,3dk4ea,RhettS,2,Fri Jul 17 02:46:23 2015 UTC,For combat I feel like it should use sorta the same combat as in the batman arkham games because its already fast just use it for reference speed it up some and boom.
FlashTV,3dk4ea,Agent_Ozzy,2,Fri Jul 17 01:20:15 2015 UTC,"In the MMO DC Universe Online one of the option for ""movement ability"" is superspeed. It's actually really fun to use but can be hard to control. Take that mixed with maybe a slow time mechanic and I think it could be alright."
FlashTV,3dk4ea,Wombat_H,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:39:57 2015 UTC,"They could have some event where the speed force has almost been all but torn from you and you must gain power (points) to get it back (unlocking abilities) And thats how they can get you to start out slow and get faster, with upgrades/unlocks as you play."

FlashTV,3dqan8,Bloo_Driver,6,Sat Jul 18 16:18:53 2015 UTC,It's a good theory.  And a possible one.  I suggested that Ezra would be Wally and we would see Barry in BvS and see him die in JL.  But...  Ezra's been saying that his character is Barry Allen...  so I'm now leaning that we will have both Barry Allen on TV and in the movie.    I think this is why they're diving into the multiverse and parallel timelines in the tv show so fast.  It's kinda a test... to make sure fans don't get confused and angry about multiverse and multiple Flashes.  If this season goes real well.  They may have a story for the multiverse in the movies that they're debating over.
FlashTV,3dqan8,AREYOUSauRuS,3,Sat Jul 18 13:30:35 2015 UTC,"Ezra himself suggested a crossover between both universes. He said that he loves the show, and that he would love a race between the two ""like Jay Garrick and Barry Allen did back in the day"".  DCWB aren't stupid. Both Arrow and The Flash are doing incredibly well for both general and hardcore audiences, Legends of Tomorrow is coming next year and Supergirl may or may not crossover too. They won't just waste the TV shows when people clearly want a crossover. Make a Crisis on Infinite Earths movie and you'll win the fucking show."
FlashTV,3dqan8,MightyGreenPanda,2,Sat Jul 18 22:03:09 2015 UTC,Sadly barley anybody watches these shows compared to those who watch the movie.

Like dead shot is black in the movie but white in arrow, yet they killed him off because they didn't want their fans getting ""confused"" it feels like DC is being ran by like 7 different people in 8 different directions sometimes."

Exactly.  I feel like with Flash being so popular they have to keep both the TV and the upcoming movie one.  And since they always claim ""multiple incarnations is confusing and new fans(non-comic readers) won't like it,"" if Flash s2 maintains it's popularity after diving into multiverse and having multiple Flashes.... they might then allow Harley/Deadshot to come back to Arrow... and allow for Supergirl to have a Superman in that universe.  It'll set precedent that fans aren't as dumb as DC execs always fears them to be."

FlashTV,3dqan8,JumpingCactus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:29:42 2015 UTC,What I would do is have Barry (Grant) run fast that he crosses over to Earth 0 (Movies). That way Flash 1-would be Grant and Ezra team up. Flash 2-Ezra as Flash and Flash 3-Flashpoint (Reboot DC Universe by merging Earth 0-Movies and Earth 1-Arrowverse). After Flash 1 is a JL film I think. I'd have that as a Movie/TV crossover.

I didn't accept that as confirmation.    Ezra, himself, has been saying he's Barry Allen.  I accept that.... but my hopes still tell me that ""Ezra saying it while high in MTV interviews, isn't 100% confirmation"" but it's as close as you can get to confirmation without the studio releasing a press docket with ""Ezra as Barry Allen"" in it."
FlashTV,3dlmsy,Howler452,10,Fri Jul 17 07:13:20 2015 UTC,Reverse Flash reverse to the Flash's Rival.  Eobard Thawne = Professor Zoom = Reverse Flash  Hunter Zolomon = Zoom = Reverse Flash
FlashTV,3dlmsy,daffydunk,9,Fri Jul 17 07:23:21 2015 UTC,"To clarify even further  Zoom= Wally West's RF  Professor Zoom= Barry Allen's RF  This may confuse you because you're not well versed in comics, but in the 80s Barry Allen died and Wally West took over as The Flash for almost 3 decades. Wally was Kid Flash before he was The Flash. Wally is gonna be introduced this season, but there have been no casting announcements for him yet. I'm not sure when we will see him get his powers. I'm thinking very late in season 2."

FlashTV,3dlmsy,PunkIsPunk95,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:46:14 2015 UTC,as many have said zoom is a name for RF.  now onto the trailer. the guy we see isn't really zoom. in the new 52 future barry has a dark blue costume and his lightning isn't yellow but blue. SPOILER ALERT  SPOILER ALERT: future barry comes back to the pass because present barry opened a tear in the speed force and barry is losing his speed and becoming slower(he doesn't notice this until many years later) basically future barry comes back in time killing some people on the way and when he meets present barry he is about to kill him but wally stops him.  End OF SPOILERS  my theory is that the ZOOM we are going to meet is going to be Jays version of Zoom. how future barry might fit into that i have a theory but wont putted here until we get more leaks or news.
FlashTV,3dlmsy,Giotto10,0,Sat Jul 18 20:52:20 2015 UTC,"So basically, the Zoom potrayed by Thawne that we saw in Season 1 is an iteration from a alternate future and now in Season 2 we're going to see the Zoom that directly conflicts with Barry's life (or timeline?)"
FlashTV,3dlmsy,dicedtomatoes55,2,Fri Jul 17 13:30:14 2015 UTC,"No. Thawne is Professor Zoom, this season seems to be featuring Zoom, a separate character from the Wally West Flash era."

FlashTV,3dlmsy,DogmaBlade,3,Fri Jul 17 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"Thawne (Professor Zoom) IS Barry's nemesis. Zoom, however is a different character that is usually the nemesis of Wally West Flash. There isn't really a definitive answer in regards to the context of the show because we don't have any information yet. It'll probably be a original iteration of Zoom that'll be made specifically for the show."
FlashTV,3dlmsy,dicedtomatoes55,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:43:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, so what I'm getting at is the first season of flash was about Professor Zoom and Barry. This season could be about Zoom and Wally West? Somehow obviously this is going to affect Barry Allen's life because it's going to be the main arc for season 2.  Tell me, why were two separate characters given the name Professor Zoom and Zoom?"
FlashTV,3dlmsy,DogmaBlade,5,Fri Jul 17 19:52:55 2015 UTC,"The second season is probably going to be about Barry and Zoom. While Zoom is more of a Wally villain in the comics the show is obviously Barry centric, so they will likely change Zoom in the show to fit that. In the trailer (assuming that was Zoom) we already saw that he is ""blue"", when in the comics he is yellow.  Zoom came after Professor Zoom in the comics and I think he modeled his costume and took the name because he was inspired by the latter. The reason they never called Thawne Professor Zoom in season 1 is probably because they knew people would get confused when they did Zoom in season 2. For the purpose of the TV show one will probably just be Reverse Flash and the other will be Zoom."

FlashTV,3dg671,ketsugi,17,Thu Jul 16 04:31:27 2015 UTC,Because it's an interview on MTV?
FlashTV,3dg671,Edge271,48,Thu Jul 16 10:27:03 2015 UTC,I thought it was entertaining. He's an entertainer. What's the problem?
FlashTV,3dg671,baalroo,-11,Thu Jul 16 05:38:04 2015 UTC,"Well, sure, it's entertaining if you're into watching train wrecks and car crashes. But I'd much rather listen to someone lucid and cogent.  Regardless, my original analogy remains: I doubt it would have been tolerated if he'd shown up drunk. Why does showing up high get a pass?"
FlashTV,3dg671,ketsugi,17,Thu Jul 16 06:14:18 2015 UTC,"It's excused in this case cause he still answered the questions. Just like being tipsy and showing up to answer questions (in a non serious tone) would still be tolerated (by some people).   I'm not defending him. Just trying to give reason. Plus, he fully supported Grant and the show and we're on /r/flashtv so that's a huge thumbs up."
FlashTV,3dg671,HotBreadKitchen,18,Thu Jul 16 07:06:20 2015 UTC,Interviews are incredibly dull for actors. They have to sit in an uncomfortable chair for hours and have 100 reporters come in one at a time and each one asks the same 5 questions which they have to give the same answer for.   The 70th interview in a row could be the one that ends up getting viewed by millions and by that point they're tired and bored and likely at the stage of giving one word answers. If getting high is going to make his day better and make him more happy and energetic for his interview and therefor not look like a jackass to the viewers then bash on!
FlashTV,3dg671,Gwardinski,21,Thu Jul 16 09:22:03 2015 UTC,"Because being drunk and high are 2 very different experiences? You can still have an intelligent discussion with someone who is high, drunk probably not."
FlashTV,3dg671,Ludachriz,3,Thu Jul 16 06:42:04 2015 UTC,Honestly it depends on the person. I know plenty of people whom I can still carry on intelligent conversations when they're drunk. But then there's some guys that everything they say is nonsensical.

FlashTV,3dg671,Blueowl789,22,Thu Jul 16 12:11:22 2015 UTC,Let's be real here. A lot of people are upset and seem to be taking it as a personal attack. But it's unprofessional as fuck. Smoke however much you want to at home. Don't show up to work high.   It's the same as being drunk not in how you act but in how unprofessional and trashy it is to do it when you're supposed to be working.   The guy above's comment is nothing against weed or smoking itself. Just how odd it is that he suffered no repercussions from showing up to work absolutely blazed.
FlashTV,3dg671,CrystalElyse,-1,Thu Jul 16 12:32:56 2015 UTC,"I am not sure that this qualifies as him ""showing up to work"". He is an actor, meaning he is essentially his own brand. Is Snoop Dog unprofessional for ""showing up to work high""?   I think it is perfectly acceptable socially given the circumstances of the interview, and the fact that he would only be shooting himself in the foot if there was negative backlash. But there seems to be mostly laughs and positive response, so maybe this was professionally the best calculated decision for him?"
FlashTV,3dg671,Blueowl789,5,Thu Jul 16 12:35:54 2015 UTC,"Part of Snoop Dog's gimmick, a huge part of his music, and his brand (and therefore what he needs to promote) is weed. ""Snoop Dog"" is almost synonymous with ""high"" at this point. It's a completely different situation. Snoop Dog needs to show up high and talk about weed. Just like how literally anyone endorsing any product needs to talk about that product. Imagine Dave Thomas showing up to an interview about Wendys wearing a Wendys shirt. That's the same as Snoop showing up high. It's brand awareness and endorsement.   Interviews and promotion absolutely count as showing up for work. It's in the job description, in the contract, and they get paid for it.   Ezra Miller is a small name actor representing DC's and WB's new multi million (if not billion) dollar franchise. He's a good actor, but he's not exactly well known. This is a make or break role for him and he is there as the face of those two huge companies and as the face of his role.   Yes, there seems to be mostly laughs... from us. From a group of 15-25 year old kids on the internet. But that still doesn't make it professional or the correct way to act while you're actively working. I imagine that a LOT of people at WB (and maybe DC) will be pretty upset about this.   Smoke at home, have a good time. There's nothing wrong with weed. But showing up to work high is something the vast majority of people get fired for."
FlashTV,3dg671,CrystalElyse,0,Thu Jul 16 12:43:42 2015 UTC,"From a group of 15-25 year old kids   Who do you think watches MTV?    But showing up to work high is something the vast majority of people get fired for.    Sure, depending on the job at hand. It doesn't matter if snoop dog is high whether it is part of his brand or not because he is a ""musician"", and in a creative field some people feel more comfortable high- not just on weed but on all sorts of things. For all you know, Ezra gets extremely nervous at interviews and wanted to get high to get through it. Regardless of him having glassy eyes etc. he composed himself and spoke intelligently about the subject matter. The only time drugs at the work place logically should be an issue is if they interfere with the work you do, the act of being on drugs itself should be of little importance by itself. Otherwise we are just defending the status quo of ""normally people get in trouble for this!"" rather than addressing why they do, which is far more important right?    I imagine that a LOT of people at WB (and maybe DC) will be pretty upset about this.    Only time will tell! I am guessing he won't even get a lecture."

With Suicide Squad it's obvious they were going for a more street-level approach, but with Flash they're most likely going to have Michael Wilkinson design his costume. This is the same guy who designed the costumes for Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as the Watchmen, so we can expect another amazing suit."
FlashTV,3dg671,PurpleZion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:36:56 2015 UTC,"wonder woman i'm still worried about, the costume seems alright but if i'm being totally honest i don't think the washed out colors brown works as well for her.  I am also worried they might sideline her, as well as flash and aquaman, because in my eyes even though batman vs superman is the name of the movie this is a JL movie, it has to be, how can it not with 5 of the most important members of the justice league present?  it would only be a disservice to themselves as well as the fans and further solidify the opinion that DC doesn't know what the hell to do with WW/can't properly do female characters on screen."

The suit is actually fairly brightly colored, it's just that Zack Snyder used a shitty filter on his camera when he took the initial reveal pic.    I am also worried they might sideline her, as well as flash and aquaman, because in my eyes even though batman vs superman is the name of the movie this is a JL movie, it has to be, how can it not with 5 of the most important members of the justice league present?   BvS is not a JL movie, it's a segue to the Justice League. Flash hasn't been confirmed to be in it, and Ray Fisher will probably only appear as Vic Stone (instead of Cyborg), with Momoa as Aquaman most likely being a literal cameo, probably at the end. WW's role has already been said to be really important, though of course the focus will be on Batman and Superman since it's Batman v Superman."

I just don't think the guy meant it with any sort of fanboy nature, just that to him Grant will be his idea of what the Flash is, if you get me."
FlashTV,3dg671,TheJoshider10,11,Thu Jul 16 14:09:31 2015 UTC,"Watch Perks of being a Wallflower, it's absolutely excellent and he plays his roll perfectly. As with all things the books a bit better but the movie version is damned close. Also Emma Watson, so yea there's that too."

FlashTV,3dg671,mflbatman,17,Thu Jul 16 15:36:24 2015 UTC,I think he's seriously excited about his role. But I also think he's seriously high. Why can't it be both.

I hate it when actors/creators are dismissive of other projects in the same franchise.   I doubt it will happen but it would be awesome if they actually did set up the shows and movies to be in parallel universes."
FlashTV,3dg671,RadiantViper,51,Thu Jul 16 02:10:28 2015 UTC,if they actually did set up the shows and movies to be in parallel universes.   The greatest thing about multiverse theorem.  They already are.
FlashTV,3dg671,AREYOUSauRuS,24,Thu Jul 16 02:13:20 2015 UTC,"Sure but an actually hint/tease in a movie would be amazing. Like if they showed some multiverse stuff in the Flash movie and one of those universes was this TV show. They could have their their cake and eat it too, separate but connected franchises."
FlashTV,3dg671,RadiantViper,16,Thu Jul 16 02:16:49 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, don't worry.  I said this awhile back, too.  Just... have Ezra have a little cameo inside the speedforce or some shit in an episode or something."
FlashTV,3dg671,AREYOUSauRuS,2,Thu Jul 16 02:17:54 2015 UTC,More likely that Grant would cameo in the Movie.
FlashTV,3dg671,docfunbags,8,Thu Jul 16 10:14:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree. It would make more sense from a business / marketing standpoint to have Ezra have a cameo in the TV show right before the movie is released.  The TV show already has a fan base and WB/DC is much more interested in promoting their movies  edit: let me also throw this in.  If Grant cameo'd near the end of the Flash movie, critics would bitch that they just paid ""$10-$15 for a 2 hour commercial for the CW Flash series that can't live up to what the movie industry does."""
FlashTV,3dg671,AREYOUSauRuS,5,Thu Jul 16 11:05:47 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is it wouldn't even be a surprise. That shit would be marketed for months by CW and it'd be featured heavily in the few weeks before the episode airs. It gets more views for the Flash and also more advertisement for the movie, so it's a win win, except for those who'd want it to be a surprise (which would 100% not happen)."
FlashTV,3dg671,TheJoshider10,3,Thu Jul 16 12:26:19 2015 UTC,the trailers would just spoil the entire thing by just giving the speedforce clip and the text comes on screen. THE MOVIE FLASH PLAYED BY EZRA IS ON THE TV SHOW WOOOO. it's gonna be spoiled by everyone
FlashTV,3dg671,urbanbliss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:44:35 2015 UTC,Sounds great and all - but I believe it would be treated as an easter egg to the TV fans in the movie.   Grant is shown in the speedforce.  It won't be marketed - because its an easter egg.  It however could swing some FlashTV fans who are dead set against or pissed off about seeing Ezra in the role.
FlashTV,3dg671,docfunbags,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"RemindMe! 3 years ""Check your Flash Facts"""
FlashTV,3dg671,docfunbags,0,Thu Jul 16 18:48:09 2015 UTC,Naw - if any cross pollenation takes place it would likely be Grant shown in the speedforce as a cameo/easter egg shoutout to the TV fans.  No big marketing push needed.
FlashTV,3dg671,docfunbags,8,Thu Jul 16 17:33:30 2015 UTC,That would be nearly as mindblowing as the whole Nick Fury reveal at the end of the first Iron Man. Just a tease that opens up a whole new world of possibilities and speculation for an event that people thought would probably never happen on film.

FlashTV,3dg671,silas34,61,Thu Jul 16 12:33:43 2015 UTC,"I always thought the idea of doing like a crisis crossover was too far out there. But if anyone would do it, I could totally see Ezra doing a guest appearance in Flash season 3 or 4. Probably won't happen, but I think it would be a nice treat for the fans and a cool way to promote the movie."
FlashTV,3dg671,daffydunk,55,Thu Jul 16 01:57:58 2015 UTC,I'd love for DC to be willing to get weird like that. Seeing two versions of Barry Allen would be amazing. It would be the coolest to see them race.
FlashTV,3dg671,NotEnoughGun,28,Thu Jul 16 02:18:10 2015 UTC,"I dont need to see Arrow meet Batman or anything, but if any two characters would crossover, it would be these two. Just how he seems in this interview, it seems Ezra would do it, i guess it just all depends on the studio."
FlashTV,3dg671,daffydunk,8,Thu Jul 16 02:34:59 2015 UTC,Who will unfortunately never approve that.
FlashTV,3dg671,NotEnoughGun,3,Thu Jul 16 05:19:07 2015 UTC,i'd say it's more likely than you think. The ultimate problem would be scheduling.
FlashTV,3dg671,daffydunk,14,Thu Jul 16 05:48:29 2015 UTC,"In a world where DC have already barred characters from the Arrowverse, I'd be surprised to see them crossover."
FlashTV,3dg671,NotEnoughGun,-3,Thu Jul 16 07:11:59 2015 UTC,"I'm so fucking tired of hearing about fuckin Blue Beetle and Deadshot, which are totally differant scenarios by the way. Blue Beetle has had a show in the works for years with Cartoon network. They probably withhold those rights for now, like Syfy and Booster Gold. We don't know why Deadshot is off the table, people just jumped to conclusions. Who else overlaps? Boomerang, Katana, Flash, and musings of Harley Quinn. Boomerang and Katana aren't out (they aren't in, but they aren't out). I cannot imagine Harley Quinn ever having a role because they used Britney Murphy's voice. It's not WB and the CW have some horrible fucking relationship, when the CCO of DC Entertainment rights for the Shows and the movies. In the case, you have an actor who is fan of the show and passionate about the character, shit like this happens in hollywood all the time. Like getting Hamil back, or using the Superman Returns suit in Smallville and giving the original Superman a pretty big role. Stranger things have happened."
FlashTV,3dg671,daffydunk,9,Thu Jul 16 07:33:28 2015 UTC,"I cannot imagine Harley Quinn ever having a role   It was in fact confirmed in an interview (possibly a panel) with Arrow people that Harley Quinn would have had a big role in Arrow if not for the suicide squad movie. They already had a plan for her arc and everything.   But yes, I agree that it's not a hostile relationship between WB and CW, but the conflict must surely be there. It's just not expressed publicly.   Imagine yourself in a showrunners position. You plan out a great story, you take time to write certain things and set them in motion, plant the seeds in your show, hoping to one day bring them to fruition. And then the studio tells you to drop it since it's a character who's already being used somewhere else.   My first thought as showrunner would be ""who fucking cares?"" As long as it's not a show or a movie within the same continuity, why should it matter if a character is being used somewhere else?   The WB explains these decisions by saying that they don't want to ""confuse people."" What the fuck does that even mean? Who would actually get confused if they see, lets say Green Arrow in a movie and think to themselves ""Hang on, did they recast Stephen Amell?""  I'm sure if your IQ is atleast double-digits, you won't get confused by that.   Then there's also the matter of WB's selective attitude towards this issue. Why deny characters from Arrow, yet greenlight a Flash TV show with a bunch of characters who will probably appear in their cinematic universe? Just seems illogical.  And now, for my closing argument. THE FUCKING MULTIVERSE! There's literally no reason for them to ever deny characters from anything, they can just explain it away with multiverse. It's basically the ""speedforce"" of WB's current situation, yet they refuse to use it. I'm sure they have some reason as to why they're treating this as idiotically as they are, but for the life of me, I can't think of anything that would justify this."
FlashTV,3dg671,oss1k,6,Thu Jul 16 08:51:51 2015 UTC,"I am not kidding when I say this, someone on the Flash sub was seriously confused on why Flash couldn't crossover with Agents of Shield. I know people who do understand that the comic's continuity is different than the cartoons and the movies.   As for Arrow, I can see them potentially blocking characters if they don't have faith in what they are going to do with them. Maybe it's not so black and white, maybe Gugenheim's plan for Harley was so utterly horrible, Warner Bros had to say no because they didn't want them fucking with her popularity and current status. For all we know, Warner Bros and DC entertainment saw the shitstorm that Arrow was becoming, so they wanted to limit their future big hitters.   These problems can't be remedied by saying ""it's a different interpretation,"" look at Green Lantern. One bad interpretation and now he is by and large shit on. That nearly killed their hopes of future superhero movies. I'm not kidding, I remember when it bomb and slowly all their plans got cancelled. The Flash show? It's built around a script for a movie written in case Green Lantern succeeded.   I'd say it's all about managing expectations. After the whole Johnny Storm fiasco, I can understand why WB might want the public to not really have a version of Deadshot in their minds. So Will Smith's isn't judged by any preconceived notions. Whereas Gustin's Flash is looking like a similar direction as Ezra's, in his energy, ability to comedy and drama, as well as the look.   I just don't think it's fair to say this is a stupid decision when you have only heard one side, for one show, that has just had it's worst season by far."
FlashTV,3dg671,daffydunk,2,Thu Jul 16 09:20:17 2015 UTC,"All those actors you mentioned were proper famous like thirty years ago, they're easier to cast these days. As for the barred characters, like Deadshot, as far as I recall, there's been a decent amount of confirmation from cast & crew.  Considering how cohesive Marvel is and they still haven't had any of their superheroes crossover into a show, nor have the TV created characters crossed into the movies.  It's hard to imagine WB seeing the appeal of blending two separate universe's."
FlashTV,3dg671,NotEnoughGun,3,Thu Jul 16 09:09:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it's because none of the actors want to crossover. Sure RDJ says he does, but he also takes like 40 mil per movie. I've never heard any of the cast praising the show or mentioning anything in relative detail (maybe, i haven't seen the right interview). This guy obviously loves the show, and feels no jealousy or cattiness to the other Flash. I could see it as Constantine situation, where everyone wants to do it, it's just got to be worked out a bit."
FlashTV,3dg671,daffydunk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:25:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know. In the animated series and video games DC seems to have a hard on for the multiverse. And Christopher Nolan has made both Inception and Interstellar profitable, and we all know he's a big influence on the DCCU.   This would be a way for DC to do something before Marvel."
FlashTV,3dg671,RhettS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:45:44 2015 UTC,"Animation & live action are very different. Nolan has basically nothing to do with anything DC related, anymore. He barely did anything on Man of Steel other than help with the basic story. As far as I'm aware, he's not at all involved, going forward."
FlashTV,3dg671,NotEnoughGun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:24:09 2015 UTC,"Oh yea he's no longer involved, but it just shows that DC/Warner Brothers is somewhat influenced by him, and he's already made things similar to parallel universes make money."
FlashTV,3dg671,RhettS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:01:15 2015 UTC,"I just got a cool idea. There should be different levels of parallel universes. Like maybe there's a certain range where things look similar (same looking Barry) and then as you go further out things start to become more different (maybe these two universes hardly intersect). So it would be rare for FlashTV and DC cinematic universe to cross dimensions just cause this is the ""science"" of parallel Universes.   We can go further and make it so maybe one Flash became the lightning bolt and created the other Flash? I dunno. Love all the possibilities."
FlashTV,3dg671,HotBreadKitchen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:11:27 2015 UTC,"I think that if they met, they'd just use the butterfly effect to explain away the differences.  There's a lot of potential for a lot of fun if we had both Flash's, but it requires a lot to align for there to be a movie with both of those Flash's. It would be fun if Ezra's Barry Allen is a bit more like he is in the comics, and Gustin/Miller don't get along. It could be especially fun for them to take the piss out of how DC are doing more dark & serious movie (although, I imagine The Flash movie will be more light-hearted)."
FlashTV,3dg671,NotEnoughGun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:31:22 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree that it would be great for fans and for promotion. You're doing the Marvel thing by spanning your brand/universe across multiple mediums; however, you also have the Multiverse which gives you a lot more creative freedom that Marvel doesn't have.  Unfortunately, I also agree that they probably won't do it. Especially after seeing how Arrow's Suicide Squad is being swept under the rug."
FlashTV,3dg671,KAhnSolo,0,Thu Jul 16 15:39:56 2015 UTC,More likely that we're see Grant in a movie scene ala Movie Barry in the Event Horizon catching a glimpse of TV Barry.
FlashTV,3dg671,docfunbags,23,Thu Jul 16 10:13:45 2015 UTC,"I had no idea who this guy was, and still don't, when they announced him. I am happy that he's excited to play the role and geek out on the comics. The fact that he loves the show makes me happy as well. It means we may see a little of Grant's flash in the way Ezra plays the role.  Finally, how awesome would it be to have Ezra show up on the show to promote the movie and him and Grant's Flash get into a footrace. It'll never happen, but it'd be cool."

FlashTV,3dg671,Techno_Bacon,6,Thu Jul 16 03:40:15 2015 UTC,They're two different universes.   That didn't stop DC from pulling Deadshot and Harley Quinn out of Arrow thanks to Big Willy Squad.
FlashTV,3dg671,TheKevinShow,8,Thu Jul 16 04:47:06 2015 UTC,Geoff Johns is one of the showrunners for Flash (and Chief Creative Officer for DC Entertainment) so it's got a hell of a lot more protection from WB/DC meddling than Arrow does
FlashTV,3dg671,Jaliu,9,Thu Jul 16 05:17:41 2015 UTC,"That's fine and dandy, but it still doesn't change the fact that they fucked over Arrow a bit just because they assume their viewers are idiots who can't tell two versions of a character apart."
FlashTV,3dg671,TheKevinShow,2,Thu Jul 16 05:22:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, I was pretty fucking disappointed in Arrow s3 to the point that I'm barely even looking forward to s4 at all.   And yes, you can count me among the many/few who are aware (and unhappy) regarding DC's treatment of Arrow and their perception of their fan's intelligence.  I'm just pointing out that Flash is probably (~90%) unlikely to be tampered with given Geoff John's attachment to the show."
FlashTV,3dg671,Jaliu,2,Thu Jul 16 05:30:07 2015 UTC,"It's pretty fucking stupid when you think about it. I mean just acknowledging it in the Arrowverse that parallel universes exist should've given them freedom to do whatever they want.  It honestly doesn't hurt to show the speedforce visions of Man of Steel maybe? Like seriously..... honestly fuck the classification of movies being ""A Class"" and tv shows being ""C Class"" entertainment. Just fuckin acknowledge the differences and be free cause even if they fear that the tv shows will not be up to standard so they shouldn't risk associating it with them well then you're still safe cause its a alternate universe."
FlashTV,3dg671,HotBreadKitchen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:14:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seeing as quite a few of DC's crisis level events and more than a few other stories involved the multiverse.  It's kinda foolish how they're disregarding their non cinematic universes. It'd be the perfect setup, they've got a pretty great/decent foundation upon which they could establish their presence and give them a unique flavour vs Marvel.  They could eventually reference their other iterations of Batman and Superman movies as a nod to their older fans.  Although I guess they won't since there's already more than enough material for them to draw upon without going into the multiverse."
FlashTV,3dg671,Jaliu,2,Thu Jul 16 07:28:42 2015 UTC,"I think the reason ""The Flash"" is diving into the multiverse so quickly is to set the groundwork for DC accepting that fans won't get confused.  Basically, next season it's definitely gonna be focusing on multiple universes and if it keeps a good viewership, then obviously the people aren't too confused that they hate it... setting precedent for DC to accept multiple incarnations of a character across different media at the same time."
FlashTV,3dg671,AREYOUSauRuS,2,Thu Jul 16 13:29:44 2015 UTC,"You assume they pulled those characters due to their preconceived notion about fans' intelligence, but what if brand confusion isn't why they did it, but brand saturation? Maybe Will Smith doesn't want another version of his character running around on TV at the same time as his movie. Maybe WB doesn't wanna steal the thunder/hype for Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad by having her live-action debut in Arrow. I know technically Harley Quinn made her live-action debut more than a decade ago in that shitty Birds of Prey show, but that was before the current golden age of superhero media, and it's mostly forgotten and she hasn't appeared in live-action since, so I digress."

FlashTV,3dg671,HotBreadKitchen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:16:52 2015 UTC,"It had to do with rights issues with Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman characters not being allowed to appear in media in which they're not the star. That's why back in the day they used Big Barda in Batman Beyond instead of Wonder Woman and it's also why Wonder Girl's the only founding Teen Titan not to appear in the animated series beyond unnamed cameo.

FlashTV,3dg671,DrakenZA,3,Thu Jul 16 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"Finally some more Flash fanboy material out there.  Too much time has expired since the Comicon panel.  Ezra's lucidness is not really a matter of concern if you realize that actors are not meant to be idols and meant to be looked up to.  Most of everyone's points are valid, but the concern and discussion here is about the hype for the movie.  The writers are of vital importance [always].  And Ezra's storyline may be completely different from the show.  One thing people have to remember is competition against Marvel.  Marvel has a big line-up, and DC has to compete.  DC just needs to do it right.  And in my humble opinion, people love origin stories.  If they can lace together some superhero origin stories in a flash movie, then bless them and hope they do it justice, pun intended."

I wasn't sure how long Huntress was in the JSA, and I have no excuses for Red Arrow, never knew he was a member. I don't think Huntress will join the JSA if it does happen, and I feel like the Red Arrow can just be Green Arrow.

FlashTV,3dijh4,FFXIV_Machinist,7,Thu Jul 16 15:35:58 2015 UTC,I don't think the speculation about season 2 will come to fruition. They have already said Nora will not be alive.
FlashTV,3dijh4,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:53:02 2015 UTC,"i figured as much.   the ""true"" timeline does have nora allen dead. i was thinking that it would be more of a ""flashpoint"" timeline in which barry is thrust into a world where nora never died."
FlashTV,3dijh4,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,0,Thu Jul 16 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"By ""true"" do you mean the one we've seen or the one before Eobard messed things up?"
FlashTV,3dijh4,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Thu Jul 16 16:03:38 2015 UTC,"there is the Season 1 primary timeline, before Barry created the alternate timeline in which eddie thwayne kills himself, and creates a massive paradox as a result.   The timeline the entire first season took place in, however was already an alternate timeline created by eobard when he was trapped in the past.  The true timeline is the one in which eobard initially came from, and will likely be the timeline that barry winds up in for season 2, since the paradox completely undid everything that Eobard had done.   So in essence- Nora dies, Barry never has any clue as to who killed her, untill meeting the reverse flash, who eventually becomes Zoom, goes back in time to stop zoom, tells alternate future barry to not save his mother, as it would change the true timeline, then alternate future barry's world is blinked out of existence. ."
FlashTV,3dijh4,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Thu Jul 16 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"The true timeline is the one in which eobard initially came from, and will likely be the timeline that barry winds up in for season 2, since the paradox completely undid everything that Eobard had done.   Like I said the producers have already said that won't happen. They aren't going to unwind the events of the first season and they aren't bringing Nora back. Which is what would happen if you took things back to the original timeline before Eobard interferred.   And just to be clear, it's Thawne, not Thawyne."
FlashTV,3dijh4,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:18:05 2015 UTC,"So in essence- Nora dies, Barry never has any clue as to who killed her, untill meeting the reverse flash, who eventually becomes Zoom, goes back in time to stop zoom, tells alternate future barry to not save his mother, as it would change the true timeline, then alternate future barry's world is blinked out of existence   so lets preface this with ""timetravel is hard"".  Cannonically in the comics, barry's mother is killed by zoom. barry still becomes the flash, because zoom didnt stay in the past. this is the ""true"" timeline.   in the future, barry learns that eobard was trying to kill him in the past, and goes back to try and stop it. he realizes that it was the night eobard kills his mother, and decides that he cant save her, or else all of time will become undone. he saves his child self, and flees. however by leaving eobard in the past- he created an alternate timeline in which eobard exists stuck in the past- a timeline where the speedforce doesnt exist, as it hasnt been created yet.   In this timeline Eobard interferes by speeding up the process in which barry becomes the flash (by 5-6 years or so), in order to regain his connection to the speed force- which he is still unable to do, and is still forced to rely on barry to create a way home for him.   Alternate timeline barry then goes back in time, sees true timeline barry fighting eobard, and gets his message of ""dont do it"". stuff happens, and eddie unknowingly creates a massive scale paradox in which the events in all of season 1 never happened.   For continutiy sake, season 2 can pick up roughly where season 1 left off, with barry having memories of the alternate timeline, the same as cisco, and him trying to piece together what happened, which will then segue into his meeting zoom (keep in mind, he never got to see Eobards true face- only harrison wells), and then ultimately back into the night where nora dies."
FlashTV,3dijh4,Thingreenveil313,0,Thu Jul 16 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"Cannonically in the comics, barry's mother is killed by zoom. barry still becomes the flash, because zoom didnt stay in the past. this is the ""true"" timeline.   Why would you call that the true timeline? Barry existed as a character for many years before Eobard went back in time and killed Nora. Originally Barry's parents outlived him.   As far as the rest of what you wrote, I keep telling you the producers have already said they will not be unwinding the events of season 1. You can stop speculating that will happen. Also Barry did see Eobard's real face before he was erased from time in the finale.   I think you are confused as well that Zoom and Professor Zoom(Eobard) are different characters."

FlashTV,3dijh4,TheKeav,0,Thu Jul 16 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"So why did you mention Eobard's true face in relation to the Flash meeting Zoom?   which will then segue into his meeting zoom (keep in mind, he never got to see Eobards true face- only harrison wells),"
FlashTV,3dijh4,Timetmannetje,-3,Thu Jul 16 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"context is a thing- you should look it up. if i reference zoom, while speaking about eobard- that means i am speaking about professor zoom.   furthermore, the zoom you are reffering to is the primary antagonist of wally west- not barry allen. in no contex is there any room in my commentary to ever be talking about anyone but professor zoom."

FlashTV,3dijh4,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:47:32 2015 UTC,What question?
FlashTV,3dijh4,Todrick,2,Fri Jul 17 03:56:09 2015 UTC,this was.... complex.
FlashTV,3dijh4,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:36:11 2015 UTC,"I think your first Green box on the main timeline is wrong. (or just phrased badly)  I believe the reason Thawne is trapped is far more simple...  Barry left.  When Barry jumped forward in time, he left Eobard tramped in the past because when Barry went back to the future, he took the Speedforce with him... no Future ""Speedster"" Barry... no Speedforce.  --edit--  typos"
FlashTV,3dijh4,Todrick,3,Thu Jul 16 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"the thing is that the speed force exists parallel through time- regardless of what age Barry is in, or eobard is in, if the speed force would exists, or does exist in that timeline, then , the speed force can be tapped.   Eobard created a past in which Barry was never destined to become the flash, and as a result the speed force was never created- I.e An alternate timeline where travel backwards is only possible, as the future has yet to be created."
FlashTV,3dijh4,AREYOUSauRuS,2,Thu Jul 16 16:18:20 2015 UTC,This sounds... wrong.   Eobard Killed Nora. Nora dying prompted Barry into forensics Barry was in his lab when the Accelerator fired Barry is hit by lightning   Flash.  Eobard even tells wells as much before he kills him.. Barry was going to still be the Flash... Eobard just needed to use the accelerator to make it to happen sooner.  So Barry could start generating Speedforce again... and he could go home.
FlashTV,3dijh4,Todrick,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"its cannon that the speedforce exists allthroughout time once its created- because eobards actions created an alternate timeline in which no speedforce existed, he was trapped. him being in proximity to barry has nothing to do with it."
FlashTV,3dijh4,AREYOUSauRuS,2,Thu Jul 16 16:38:16 2015 UTC,its cannon that the speedforce exists allthroughout time once its created   In the comics   him being in proximity to Barry has nothing to do with it.   It's not proximity... proximity is distance.
FlashTV,3dijh4,Keegman_99,0,Thu Jul 16 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"This sounds... wrong.   But it's not.  He's right, the speed force exists outside of time.  As soon as it's created it exists throughout that whole timeline.   Eobard just needed to use the accelerator to make it to happen sooner.   You're reading into this.  He never said why he needed the accelerator to happen earlier except ""to get home.""  That doesn't necessarily mean anything about Barry's origin.  The only thing we 100% know he needed the particle accelerator for was to launch a hydrogen atom into for Barry to run into and open a black hole.   Nora dying prompted Barry into forensics   Another presumption you're making.  Gideon even says that in the original timeline Barry still works for CCPD."

FlashTV,3dkzxs,ingenuity,3,Fri Jul 17 04:31:34 2015 UTC,IMO anyway. There's no clean way to reconcile Eddie's death so the universe kinda nopes the fuck out. There are some new shots of season 2 filming if you want hints/spoilers.

FlashTV,3djva0,TheIncredible_BatCow,2,Thu Jul 16 22:40:12 2015 UTC,What's the difference between a Justice society and the justice league?
FlashTV,3djva0,RangersCrusader,5,Thu Jul 16 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"Justice Society are from the Golden Age (the 1940's) of comics and include older versions of classic heroes (ex. The Flash, but not Barry Allen, Green Lantern, but not Hal Jordan). In the comics Justice Society is usually from another timeline named Earth 2.  The Justice League is composed of DC's greatest, most iconic heroes. Including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Green Arrow, Black Canary and more. They protect the Earth from giant threats such as Darksied. Think The Avengers, but DC"

FlashTV,3dlauw,hal4567,6,Fri Jul 17 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"if the flash pulls bigger numbers in s2   in all probability, DC should stop claiming ""multiple incarnations of a character across mediums is too confusing for the fans"" since it will set precedent that the fans enjoy and accept Multiverse Theorem and multiple incarnations of Flash not only in different mediums, but in the same medium.  Which means..... they should then be willing to allow characters like Deadshot and Harley Quinn to exist in both DCCU and Flarrowverse."

FlashTV,3dlauw,walterpinkman45,2,Fri Jul 17 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"The Flash will be in the first Justice League movie for sure. Also, I don't think that the DCTV Universe has any impact on the DCCU. We already have a movie Flash in Ezra Miller, so if we were to get the whole Flash Family in the movies then I'd assume they would use all different characters."
FlashTV,3dlauw,SockPenguin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:05:23 2015 UTC,"I thought Flash and Green Lantern were both being introduced in the first Justice League movie. Other than that, I don't know that anything the show does will really affect the movie. While Flash is doing phenomenal for a CW show, it's still not a big 'everyone is going to be talking about this the next day' show like Walking Dead or Game of Thrones. It's not really big enough that a significant number of people would be comparing the two Flashes. The show might give them some idea of which villain(s) would work best on screen, but odds are we're getting Reverse Flash in the first movie regardless."

FlashTV,3de1t9,brucewaynewins,26,Wed Jul 15 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a hit though. It debuted at #6  and never went higher.  It reviewed well among critics and it's box office drew $34 million with a $8.5 million budget.  It on paper made profit but with ""hollywood book keeping"" it may be considered a loss.  Nobody references it in media or quotes it.  It's not a movie people are still talking about.  The only time I really see it still brought up is among Flash fans when discussing Robbie Amell's career.  If that's a hit to you, then that's a hit to you.  But to me that's misuse of the word ""hit""."
FlashTV,3de1t9,Delvoire,6,Wed Jul 15 17:14:17 2015 UTC,"With the budget being $8.5 Million and the Domestic earnings being $34 million, that is very much considered a success.

FlashTV,3de1t9,brucewaynewins,16,Wed Jul 15 19:56:18 2015 UTC,"To you and Hollywood outsiders, yes it would be a success.

It got big nominations in TCA, against big movies and actors (Robbie is up against Bradley Cooper for best comedy actor for example). The movie is all about social medias and I assure you, the Duff was everywhere in social medias and magazines/channels for teenagers and young adults.   Variety explains it better than me. For months, the Duff was all over Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr. It was definitely the marketing team's goal and they achieved it. Success."

I was under the understanding that he's going to be a series regular again. I'd also heard that it'd been announced that we'd see spoiler. I do hope that Tom sticks around, because you're right, he was fantastic. Absolutely pitch perfect.  I'm sort of expecting them to have a ""first meeting"", as it were, from the perspective of Thawne. He mentioned that he hates Barry (""Nothing is forgiven"") so I assume there's some sort of thing that happened between them. As far as I'm aware, in the comics Thawne is a little like Syndrome from The Incredibles - he was a fan of Barry, bordering on the obsessive, who then became a villain. The reason for this was because... well, he became a villain because he found out he was a villain, which is a bit paradoxical. I figure the show might try and reference that by, I guess, maybe him travelling back to meet Barry, or Barry travelling forward for some reason.   Thanks for pointing out the links, by the way. The YouTube ones show up like that because that's just how they show up when you insert them on tumblr, but I'll try and do it direct as HTML next time.   I think the bottom link is fine though - did you try scrolling down the page? Everything is in one DC TV section together, and this Harrison Wells post is the most recent, so it's at the top.

FlashTV,3dfhje,MainlyPardoo,6,Wed Jul 15 21:43:40 2015 UTC,In the comics Reverse Flash is a title for a speedster who is the arch-enemy for said Flash.  Barry = Prof. Zoom  Wally = Zoom  Jay = The Rival  Bart = Inertia  In the show it seems they are making Reverse Flash the actual nickname for Eobard Thawne instead of Professor zoom. So Zoom probably won't be called a RF.
FlashTV,3dfhje,suss2it,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:16:21 2015 UTC,"I think there is still room for Reverse Flash to be a general title for multiple evil speedsters.  We're looking at it with the benefit of all of the mainstream continuity, but from the characters' perspective there's only one evil couterpart. Perhaps Zoom will be called the Reverse Flash by accident during a briefing sequence (especially with inevitable drama from Wells still being around in some yet-to-be-revealed context), and the Professor Zoom name will be introduced to distinguish Wells from the newcomer?"
FlashTV,3dg237,Flgibson97,5,Thu Jul 16 00:04:44 2015 UTC,"There isn't an obvious answer but from what we've seen in the recent teaser trailer and heard from Tom Cavanagh and the producers, Eobard is not done on this show. Not that that is a surprise however, they were never going to get rid of Barry's archnemesis in season 1."
FlashTV,3dg237,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Thu Jul 16 00:17:17 2015 UTC,God this is Arrow season 1 all over again.
FlashTV,3dg237,xHovercraft,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:13:32 2015 UTC,Sounds good. I'm looking forward to see how Thawne plays a role in the future.
FlashTV,3dg237,Reverse_Grodd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:28:54 2015 UTC,"I think they did kind of answer this - twice after this episode, Eobard noted that he had not anticipated growing fond of Barry. As Cavanagh has said, ""He just wants to get home."" It is pretty clear that this is all that's left of the original mission - his fondness, ""looking on you with love"" as he says to Barry 1x23, has kind of subsumed the other feelings."
FlashTV,3dgf4y,mweinrib,3,Thu Jul 16 01:52:21 2015 UTC,"Hopefully very different, I'm glad they are going with a whole new color scheme at least."
FlashTV,3dgf4y,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Thu Jul 16 01:57:25 2015 UTC,I like the blue and obv I don't want the same thing but isn't yellow a must when it comes to zoom?
FlashTV,3dgf4y,Hellstormer,5,Thu Jul 16 02:52:24 2015 UTC,They can use some Cobalt Blue elements and the singularity was bluish.

FlashTV,3dgtcc,LTComedy,-2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:57 2015 UTC,"""The Return of Barry Allen"" is $35 on Amazon and contains the arc from the comics. Not only is it a damned good Zoom story, it's considered one of the best Wally West stories.   The 2nd Zoom is introduced in ""Blitz"" which is $50 at Amazon, but that's way overpriced. The individual issues (97-100) of the 1987 Flash series will most likely be cheaper, depending where you get them."

FlashTV,3dgtcc,TheChrisDV,4,Thu Jul 16 04:36:04 2015 UTC,"'Return of Barry Allen' isn't a Zoom story. It's an Eobard Thawne story.  Zoom was introduced in the Geoff Johns' early 2000s run - he was introduced as Hunter Zolomon in 2001, became Zoom in 2003, and his last appearance in costume was in 'Final Crisis: Rogues Revenge' in 2008, at which Barry & Eobard came back as the main Flash & Reverse Flash."

FlashTV,3df5ad,KillerPayback,5,Wed Jul 15 20:01:22 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, even if they hadn't confirmed it (which they have) and cast Rogue dad, it would still be a pretty safe assumption that we'd see more of the Rogues after Barry's agreement with Snart and considering the outcome of their last meeting.   That agreement really paved the way for a lot more Captain Cold episodes, because it opened up the question of whether or not he's completely a bad guy. We saw his bad side at the end of the season, but he still comes off as a reasonable (not crazy) dude. PLUS, he has a huge fangirl base, so I don't think CW would get rid of him so quickly. Attractive but believable villains are not always so easy to come by."

FlashTV,3df5ad,TheJoshider10,4,Wed Jul 15 20:17:25 2015 UTC,I'd like to see Snart go up against Oliver before Legends starts. The Arrow stopped a super soldier army and the League of Assassins so there's a challenge there.
FlashTV,3df5ad,Doctor_Squared,2,Thu Jul 16 01:10:00 2015 UTC,"One could argue that they wouldn't have stopped the super soldier army without Star Labs' antidote, and same goes with the League of Assassins (Flash + Star Labs', I assume, antidote again). And what's very nice is that Barry needed Oliver's help to defeat his own baddie. One big family. But anyway, Ollie can totally take on some Rogues and I hope to see it soon. He will have arrows ready for anything. I read not long ago a story where Green Arrow stops Killer Frost with a fire arrow, it'd be cool to see that someday in the shows."

FlashTV,3dfa6h,Kolanj,8,Wed Jul 15 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Eddie's body getting sucked into the wormhole is a good substitute origin for Zoom's time based powers considering we don't have a cosmic treadmill. As far as the story goes, Grant has mentioned that the city will laud him as the hero despite Eddie being the one to stop ""Wells."" Despite Barry's discomfort with this I could see a returning Eddie interpret this as a betrayal and set out to inflict tragedy in Barry's life to teach him what it means to be a ""real hero"" similar to Zoom's motivations from the comics."
FlashTV,3dfa6h,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:39:21 2015 UTC,"I use to think Eddie could be a Zoom/Cobalt character, but then i was convinced he was more of a Cobalt character due to the blue references. I'm really interested how this turns out."
FlashTV,3dfa6h,Flarow,3,Wed Jul 15 23:09:53 2015 UTC,I don't think he'll be a Cobalt character at all.  The blue scheme will probably be used to differentiate him from Barry and Wells

I think their differences and Barry's seriousness/Wally's joking get played up more when they are together, especially true in modern age pre-Rebith stories.   While TV Barry is a younger, more inexperienced version than we've seen in the comics I don't really consider TV his personality to be a mix of Wally/Barry. Except on Arrow, they tend to make him cockier and more jokey on that show for some reason."
FlashTV,3dbum3,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and they even sort of justified it by having Thawne screw with the timeline to get him his powers back when Barry was young and single instead of when he was a veteran and possibly jaded CSI who was all-but-married."

FlashTV,3dbum3,Jangwin,3,Wed Jul 15 12:42:50 2015 UTC,I think he/she means after 1 year of being the Flash.
FlashTV,3dbum3,ultrasargent,3,Wed Jul 15 12:57:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah that makes sense. My apologies /u/Teves3D"
FlashTV,3dadg9,The_Llamapocalypse,80,Tue Jul 14 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"Since Jay Garrick is being introduced so early, it's possible that line is just referring to the Singularity. He might not be talking about Zoom at all."
FlashTV,3dadg9,M1M1R,31,Tue Jul 14 19:44:57 2015 UTC,That's what I would guess. I think it would be weird to have Zoom not have a personal relationship with Barry.
FlashTV,3dadg9,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,13,Tue Jul 14 19:58:45 2015 UTC,I agree. And that's why I don't think Zoom will be Hunter Zolomon. I've seen a lot of people throw out Eddie and Future Barry as Zoom suspects.
FlashTV,3dadg9,TrippyTippy,29,Tue Jul 14 20:19:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my money is on Eddie. The personal angle is already there with everything that happened in season 1. Grant has said Barry will struggle with being hailed a hero when Eddie is the one who stopped ""Wells"" and I could see that being spun into Eddie/Zoom feeling he needs to make Barry into a better hero. Plus Eddie's body getting sucked into the wormhole could be an interesting origin for his time based powers since we don't really have the cosmic treadmill."
FlashTV,3dadg9,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,6,Tue Jul 14 20:35:33 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the actor left the show for personal reasons.
FlashTV,3dadg9,ExynosHD,11,Wed Jul 15 02:39:23 2015 UTC,Grant said that but according to the producers they were the ones to decide that Eddie would die and stop being a series regular so I don't know what to believe.
FlashTV,3dadg9,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,6,Wed Jul 15 02:41:33 2015 UTC,"Could be Zolomon trying to kill Barry so there is no speedforce for Wally to use.  Zolomon uses time manipulation and does not tap into the speedforce at all, hence getting rid of Barry would not stop his powers."
FlashTV,3dadg9,DrakenZA,9,Wed Jul 15 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of how Zoom's powers work, but trying to get rid of Wally, a new character who hasn't even gotten his powers yet seems like an odd choice for the season arc."
FlashTV,3dadg9,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:11:14 2015 UTC,"Time Travel/Time Shifting etc, anything is possible for season 2. They did confirm Wally also."
FlashTV,3dadg9,DrakenZA,2,Wed Jul 15 02:05:37 2015 UTC,I think it would be disappointing if we didn't see Wally start as a young guy and alternatively I think having a Zoom who already knows adult Wally and is time traveling back would be too much a rehash of season 1.
FlashTV,3dadg9,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,5,Wed Jul 15 02:11:48 2015 UTC,"Comic book Hunter Zolomon doesn't want to get rid of Wally, he wants to make Wally a better hero. Granted, he wants to do that through tragedy, but deleting the source of the Speed Force would be counter-intuitive to his motivations. It's possible that this version of Zoom departs from that, but I sincerely doubt it. Zoom's unique motivations are what sets him apart most from the other Reverse Flash characters."
FlashTV,3dadg9,M1M1R,5,Wed Jul 15 04:54:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly, for Zoom to do anything Wally has to be involved + he only does things to make Wally stronger"

FlashTV,3dadg9,1live4downvotes,65,Tue Jul 14 23:37:50 2015 UTC,"Zoom could be ""The Rival"". Jay Garrick's version of the Reverse Flash.  Or he could just be the Zoom we all know and love from the books.   Or he could be this Zoom:"

FlashTV,3dadg9,GloriousGe0rge,13,Tue Jul 14 20:58:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I guess it would be.   RF is just so different to who he was at the start of the season, I kind of forgot."
FlashTV,3dadg9,XMenOrangesTangerine,8,Tue Jul 14 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hadn't really considered it, but (knowingly or not) the show really condensed the two main Reverse Flash characters into one in several ways. It'd be pretty difficult to add Zoom from the comics in as he has been without it looking like a retread. Difficult but not impossible, I guess."
FlashTV,3dadg9,Bloo_Driver,4,Tue Jul 14 21:00:39 2015 UTC,"While I don't really agree that the show condensed Thawne/Zolomon into one(their methods/motivations were very different and ""Wells"" was only faking crippled) I do expect them to change up Zoom's origins quite a bit.  I think Zoom will be Eddie revived and granted Zoom's time based powers as a result of being sucked into the wormhole. You wouldn't have to create and build up Hunter Zolomon as the personal angle is already there with Eddit. It has been said Barry will struggle with being hailed a hero when Eddie is the one who stopped ""Wells"" and I could see that being spun into Eddie/Zoom feeling he needs to make Barry into a better hero."

FlashTV,3dadg9,AJockeysBallsack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:08:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, TV-Wells and Comic-Zolomon are definitely different enough if you know the comics already. But given the scope of the TV show, it'd be difficult to introduce him and take the time to make him like the comics and still also take the time to differentiate him enough so it doesn't look the same to people who don't know."
FlashTV,3dadg9,Bloo_Driver,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:40:17 2015 UTC,I would certainly agree with that.   Even without that issue I think it would be hard to introduce Hunter and have him reach his full enemy potential in one season without it feeling rushed and cheap. Using Eddie in his place helped provide a much more fleshed out story that will capture the essence of the comic story even if the details are drastically changed.
FlashTV,3dadg9,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,8,Tue Jul 14 22:45:59 2015 UTC,Yeah it's probably Tim Allen.  He must be related to Barry.
FlashTV,3dadg9,Justice_Prince,9,Wed Jul 15 04:09:17 2015 UTC,What about Zoom Zoom?
FlashTV,3dadg9,darkrobstar,28,Wed Jul 15 00:04:08 2015 UTC,Barry goes into the singularity.  Barry meets Jay Garrick and gets a tutor.  Eddie comes back to life (through speedforce) as Cobalt Blue/Zoom in that universe.  Caitlyn and Cisco work on bringing Barry back.  They open a wormhole and all 3 come through.

FlashTV,3dadg9,BrentEdwards,6,Tue Jul 14 22:43:06 2015 UTC,"I like this idea. I also think he could be talking about Vandal Savage. Barry deals with the singularity, becomes the city's hero... but a door to another world was opened for a while. Zoom came yes, but he's the season villain, he could be hiding for a while (maybe as someone we know). Jay seems to be talking about a pressing matter, like an immortal trying to take over the world maybe. Barry then needs to assemble a team with Oliver, hence Arrow/Flash first episodes being used as introduction for LOT (SDCC panels). Jay stays as a mentor for Barry and at some point realised Zoom is also in our world. Zoom wouldn't be a threat to the entire world, would he?"
FlashTV,3dadg9,Airsay58259,3,Wed Jul 15 00:26:50 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking the same thing. Zoom should have a personal connection to Barry, not Jay/Earth-2."
FlashTV,3dadg9,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:33:46 2015 UTC,Why not? We just spent all this time with Reverse Flash and his personal connection. It wouldn't be a bad thing if Barry is not the center of every villains world from the start.
FlashTV,3dadg9,neoblackdragon,3,Wed Jul 15 01:10:27 2015 UTC,I think you drift too far from Zoom as a character if you don't have the personal connection to the Flash.

I think that after Eddies body was sucked through the worm hole, it was spat out on Earth 2 around 6 mouth previous to when he actually shot himself, and he developed the powers from the negative energy of traveling through the void.  He will then travel back through the worm hole when where it opened up onto Earth 2 parralel to Earth 1."

I'm not bothered too much by the order. Yeah, I would've liked GL earlier, but who cares? I'm confident that we will get a Lantern in Justice League and we already have a GL ""solo""movie announced. So it's looking really good for this character - or these characters, since ""GL Corps"" indicates that we get multiple Lanterns at once."

FlashTV,3der75,Aexil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"But in the tv show, if he did save his mother, than bad things would of happened, I assume that's why the future Barry didn't want the present Barry to help her."
FlashTV,3der75,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:13:27 2015 UTC,"I think that was more a general warning about changing the past. Original Barry would have grown up with his mother, so again it's not a straight butterfly effect where Nora living equals bad news."
FlashTV,3der75,Todrick,0,Wed Jul 15 21:16:39 2015 UTC,"I just checked and I was somewhat off; they don't say specifically that Barry has to bring Nora with him, but they do say that he has to return to his own time so that they can close the wormhole. But still, my main question stands, shouldn't the changes take place immediately, as we saw in the previous instances?  ""So, once the wormhole stabilizes, Barry will have one minute and fifty-two seconds to alter the past and return to this time. If and when he does that, you can close the wormhole, and we can all live happily ever after."""

FlashTV,3der75,essentialblend,3,Wed Jul 15 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"Oh OK... He had to return to close the worm hole.  In out of time he traveled using the speedforce, which is why there was only one Barry. This wasn't the case in the finale... He traveled via a wormhole, which is why there were 2 barrys."

FlashTV,3der75,essentialblend,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:01 2015 UTC,The multiple Barrys is really the clue.  I figured it out in reverse... I wondered why future Barry was there.  Because the time travel rules established in out of Time dictate that he should have vanished from the timeline.  the Wormhole answers that problem.
FlashTV,3der75,Todrick,0,Wed Jul 15 19:10:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was just beginning to wonder the same thing prior to your response, so I'm glad you mentioned that as well. Thanks again, that tidies it all up. :)"
FlashTV,3der75,DoctorSteve,0,Wed Jul 15 19:29:11 2015 UTC,"The amount of mis-information on this thread is mind-boggling.  Let me clear some of the stuff that I noticed  -Barry IS NOT responsible for shutting the wormhole.Neither is he capable of creating one (for other people to travel), I think they can only travel through time on their own.  They used the 'Flash running at Mach 2 colliding with the Hydrogen particle' , this is what makes the 'stable enough for other people to travel' type of a Wormhole.All they have to do is manually shut it down, not have Flash come back, which is what they did but Eddie shooting himself caused a Paradox I guess.  Secondly, I doubt you can 'retrieve' someone from another time, that is simply impossible IMO (not going by comics canon, but I can be wrong and the writers may pull this off).They just meant, saving her from getting killed and then coming back to the present to find her alive but him not being the FLash ala Flashpoint.  They have actually just kept the whole time-travel rules thing quite ... ambiguous so they can properly flesh them out as they go.There are still lots of things that don't make sense to me from Season 1, lets see how it goes.  Another one, saving Barry's mom wouldn't cause a Paradox, it would just alter the future of the timeline Barry would be in.  OP please read up on the fundamental concepts of Multiverses, Parallel Universes, Alternate timelines etc. That answers half of your doubt :))"
FlashTV,3der75,DrakenZA,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:16:13 2015 UTC,I never said he was responsible for closing the worm hole  but he had to return so they could close it... otherwise he'd be trapped.  because he doesn't have the control to travel the speedforce yet
FlashTV,3der75,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,0,Wed Jul 15 19:32:49 2015 UTC,"Nah, I dont think he'd be trapped if they shut the wormhole.Thats what I'm trying to explain.  His time travel abilities would be complete bullshit if he's easily able to open a wormhole and not able to open another one after this one is shut down.  Now whether he NEEDS the Hydrogen particle for creating a stable wormhole for himself OR only for other people ,is up for debate."

FlashTV,3d8g2m,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Tue Jul 14 18:00:59 2015 UTC,Golden Age Flash has a very different tone than Silver Age-today.  I collect and enjoy it all but those original Jay comics are similar tonally to most cape stories of the time and very much just an extension of the sunday comic strip. There's plenty of Jay in the silver/bronze age and even more during the Mark Waid Wally West years for you to get a feel for the character.

FlashTV,3dcmpx,HollowmanNapkin,9,Wed Jul 15 05:45:44 2015 UTC,"Think of ""Reverse-Flash"" as more of a title , used by multiple characters basically representing the opposite of the flash. Eobard Thawne was a Reverse-Flash, he also would sometimes go by Professor Zoom, although still the same person. This was the character we seen played by Tom Cavanagh. ""Zoom"" is an entirely different character and is another Reverse-Flash whos name is Hunter Zolomon. Zooms powers were time manipulation based, meaning he was a great deal faster than other speedsters. He was the ache nemesis of the Wally West flash. We're Eobard Thawne was the arch nemesis of the Barry Allen Flash. I hope this makes sense and wasn't to confusing. I'm very sleepy."
FlashTV,3dcmpx,TomTheHuman,2,Wed Jul 15 06:08:11 2015 UTC,Ok. So Reverse-Flash and Professor Zoom is one person.
FlashTV,3dcmpx,TomTheHuman,4,Wed Jul 15 06:09:42 2015 UTC,"Professor Zoom is a Reverse Flash. Like I said, Professor Zoom is just another name Eobard Thawne would sometimes go by. So yes Professor Zoom is a reverse flash. He was called this due to his extensive study and knowledge of the speed force if I'm not mistaken. Although the TV series never referred to him as Professor Zoom. Up to this point he has only been referred to this name in the comics."
FlashTV,3dcmpx,Animation,-1,Wed Jul 15 06:11:54 2015 UTC,I think he was called Reverse Flash because he reverse engineered the Flash's powers. The name also implies they are opponents and moral opposites/antagonists. But it was directly related to him reverse engineering the powers using technology.
FlashTV,3dcmpx,DrakenZA,3,Wed Jul 15 13:16:37 2015 UTC,"They are called Reverse-Flashes because they are the reverse of Flash, not because of reverse engineering.  Zolomon controls time, he has no access to the speedforce at all."

FlashTV,3df3dk,hal4567,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:24:29 2015 UTC,Actually they do have the budget to make it happen. All they have to do is make less episodes so they can have more budget per episode. Also it's just called shooting lasers flying and maybe maybe 1 or 2 constructs throughout the show. Hal could just not to very experienced. Also you never know with dc/wb

I don't think that's how it works. The budget is going to be dependent on how much money they can make off the show and they make their money off selling commercial time. Less shows=less available money.
FlashTV,3df3dk,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Wed Jul 15 20:22:41 2015 UTC,That's what they're doing with Legends of Tomorrow it's only 15episodes and they'll have the same budget as a full series

Midseason shows in the CW usually gets 13 like iZombie and The 100.This means the network is expecting Arrow like ratings from it. In the past, CW midseason shows usually get cancelled cause they're ratings dud. The 100 broke this trend then iZombie performed better than the 100."

FlashTV,3df3dk,MainlyPardoo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:45:08 2015 UTC,Where have they said that they will have a budget of a 23 episode series? That makes very little sense; is the network just going to shrink their profits to make better CGI? That doesn't sound like something they'd want to do.
FlashTV,3df3dk,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Wed Jul 15 20:41:08 2015 UTC,caity lotz said it in an interview which I'm trying to find right now

Regardless I don't anticipate them doing it with Flash as it's their big hit show right now. It may be that after delivering teo hit shows to the network they got a little extra leeway on this passion project."
FlashTV,3df3dk,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:54:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I only really see them doing it with LOT out of the current shows because of how cg heavy it will be
FlashTV,3df3dk,MainlyPardoo,2,Wed Jul 15 21:05:22 2015 UTC,I think it was more about TIME... they have the time to do 23 but are only doing 13.  allowing them to do more CG
FlashTV,3df3dk,Todrick,2,Wed Jul 15 20:54:54 2015 UTC,"Its pretty common. The reason you get 12 etc episode TV series is to to funnel the same budget they would have for 23 episodes into a smaller series, allowing for more money per episode, and by turn, more/better CGI.  Pretty sure one of the writers even said it was the reason for the lower ep count, there will be a lot of CGI compared to Arrow/Flash."

FlashTV,3dds70,TheDangiestSlad,5,Wed Jul 15 14:33:04 2015 UTC,It's not the GL constructs that are troublesome and expensive to create. It's their interaction with other objects that sucks the CGI budget dry.

There is still a year he became a Bratva captain and, presumably, an island year (where he was found; temple easter egg).  On top of that, hes a celebrity. Being in Coast City ought to be spotted by a few smartphone cameras as hes no longer hidden by Waller."

FlashTV,3dds70,DuEbrithil,5,Wed Jul 15 15:38:43 2015 UTC,How does multiverse connect to aliens?
FlashTV,3dds70,Future_Vantas,3,Wed Jul 15 15:27:25 2015 UTC,"1) Budget is definitely still an excuse. The most CG intensive character currently on the show is probably Firestorm, and he doesn't take as much effort as GL and barely gets any screentime powered up.  2) I don't see how multiverse has anything to do with aliens. Even if it did, GL will clearly be from our universe.  3) There was also a reference to a merger between Wayne Tech and Queen Inc. Clearly, we're never going to get Bruce walking around on the show. That comment by Grant was in response to a fan asking about Jay Garrick's Helmet, and it's quite possible his answer was colored by the fact that he already knew Jay had been cast.  Even if we do eventually get Green Lantern, I doubt it will be for a while. We may see Hal Jordan during the flashbacks this season in Arrow, but don't expect him in the present as a full blow Green Lantern for a while."
FlashTV,3dds70,M1M1R,-8,Wed Jul 15 15:56:48 2015 UTC,if budget was still excuse then flash would not have been a tv show on cw . arrow would only be it and there would have been no flash show. if you consider budget as a parameter then even in movies first part gets less cost for effects then second gets more and so on. look at marvel IM 1 has descent to good cgi but nowhere near IM3 . it implies to tv shows as well. u mean to say that grant knew about jay garrick and not hal jordan THE LINE WHICH HE SPOKE . plus he reads flash comics for his role do u really think he would not know about GL how many times hal jordan has shown up in flash comics . hal jordan and barry allen lay the groundwork for each other's mythos so it is necessary to introduce hal but i agree full blown gl can wait.  it is as if henry cavill would not know about batman because he is playing superman come on
FlashTV,3dds70,M1M1R,3,Wed Jul 15 16:06:50 2015 UTC,"Probably shouldn't bother beating this dead horse, but here goes.  1) While it is true that CG gets easier to do the more of it you have already done for a show, it's still a giant leap from making fire come out of a guy sometimes, to having a guy constantly sheathed in green energy who can construct hard light objects with his mind. The amount of tech work needed to pull Green Lantern off well would be enormous.  2) Of course Grant knows who Green Lantern is, but that's not what I was saying at all. A fan asked him if Jay's Helmet was an easter egg. Grant said that they ""don't do easter eggs."" If you take Grant's answer literally, than of course we are eventually getting Green Lantern. That being said, the newspaper references Bruce Wayne, and Gideon referenced the Justice League in a tie in preview comic, so we know that they do do easter eggs. It's more likely that Grant was speaking figuratively; of course they do easter eggs, but the one the question was specifically asked about (Jay Garrick) was a plot point, so he exaggerated his answer.  Again, anything's possible, but it's highly unlikely we get light wielding space cops any time in the near future."
FlashTV,3dds70,suss2it,-4,Wed Jul 15 16:26:07 2015 UTC,i think that you r beating a dead horse bcuz you repeat what i say everytime . multiverse introduces space travel so it does not relate to aliens but realistically they can be introduced organically bcus space is a big firld so if u touch one aspect it gives you the freedom to do more easily and I M SAYIN THAT HAL JORDAN CAN B INTRODUCED  early and related characters like carol ferris  so that we don't get ridiculous amounts of easter eggs and from there we can start discovering aliens then GL groundwork is fully laid cuz hal is a pilot and he via ferris can come across aliens and THEN BAM abin sur
FlashTV,3dds70,thoughts-from-alex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:23:29 2015 UTC,Superspeed is way easier and cheaper to show than Green Lantern's powers.
FlashTV,3dds70,brazil201,3,Wed Jul 15 21:45:21 2015 UTC,"I wrote this a few months ago, about how to introduce Green Lantern into the show. It addresses your second point, about introducing aliens.  I think you're probably right about the budget - or, at least, partly. While people are right that GL would be a huge drain on resources, I think there are probably ways around that. For example, you'd definitely use a physical suit, rather than a CGI one, like in the Ryan Reynolds movie. GL could glow when flying, but they'd leave it the rest of the time. I think they also might be able to use some clever green tinted lighting and physical green props with CGI touch ups to alleviate the budgetary strain as well. If they used the same constructs, like a fist or what have you, over and over, they can reuse the CGI assets, which would save cash. Some combination of all three might help with that.  Something else I've been thinking: It might help to depict the powers in slightly more abstract ways. Like, Yellow Lanterns work on fear, right? So maybe you could play up the ""inspire fear"" aspect; Yellow Lantern can fire a yellow ray in a quick, cheap, zapping effect, and then you get lots of quick, jumpy close ups on the victim, maybe intercut with them screaming, with some yellow lighting and atmospheric music.  It's a little hard to explain, but I think that's probably a very good way to depict the Yellow Lanterns cheaply. Not sure how you could apply that to the Green Lanterns though."

I could understand why he would keep a secret such as ""I could go to prison someday"". But he has no reason to think Caitlin will be evil, right? The white eyes are scary yeah but Firestorm has them too so he can't really judge her by her looks. For all he knows she just becomes a metahuman and helps him. Anyway, I hope he tells them. Cisco will be dealing with Eobard's revelations and his powers, it could be nice to see Caitlin fear/try to prevent becoming a metahuman.

FlashTV,3dbxfu,Skajuan,6,Wed Jul 15 01:59:55 2015 UTC,You don't have to watch Arrow but it's recommended you do. Barry and some of the other Star Labs crew made their first appearance in season two of Arrow so you might want to start there.
FlashTV,3dbxfu,DavidR525,2,Wed Jul 15 02:15:26 2015 UTC,Nope. Flash is fully accessible on its own. Some Arrow characters do show up from time to time but the show adequately explains them. Besides based off the ratings there's a decent amount of people who only watch The Flash.
FlashTV,3dbxfu,suss2it,-3,Wed Jul 15 12:15:39 2015 UTC,"This is not 100℅ true. Yes, it is true that the show is largely accessible on its own, but you may have a headache when Deathbolt shows up randomly after his tussle with Ray Palmer in Starling.  Why am I being down voted? He just appears in the penultimate episode for about ten minutes and then dies unceremoniously. If you don't watch Arrow then you'd have no idea he was there."

FlashTV,3d7aki,DoctorSteve,6,Tue Jul 14 02:47:10 2015 UTC,"So I have major questions.   Where is the funding coming from? I was kind of hoping they'd go low tech for Season 2 since they have literally no funding now. No way to pay for the villains food either! Does Martin Stein come onboard the team full time? He was great in the finale, and it only makes sense to add a scientist since they are losing one. Does Caitlin leave? I mean, it's in the Sizzle trailer!   They seem to be confirming things won't ever go back to the usual, but I really don't want them to go back to the usual. Arrow's ""business as usual"" in Season 3 was a nightmare for me, and that was just a city under siege and Oliver losing his money. The Flash has, well, major changes at the end of Season 1! I would hate if they did an ""Episode 2, everything is fine now!"" thing."
FlashTV,3d7aki,Somnif,6,Tue Jul 14 06:20:20 2015 UTC,1) I just assumed the lab held patents for whatever future tech Thawne/Wells made and the money came from there. And Thawne-Wells was pretty wealthy on his own past that.

When they put an easter egg on the show it means they will use it eventually, (same thing they did with Jay Garrick's helmet who is now a confirmed Season 2 character).  I wonder what's going to happen with all the Green Lantern easter eggs. He was asked to give Ezra Miller an advice but he said that Ezra is a terrific actor who will do his own thing & it's going to be great.  He will use the white emblem suit later in Season 2 but in the first episodes he still uses the one with the red. Barry will be a lone wolf this season, he feels bad that Eddie was the real hero who stopped the Reverse Flash & The Flash is the one who takes credit for it."

If Tom is still around as The Reverse Flash, and with Barry... we will have four. As much as I would love that at some point in the show (add Impulse, why the hell not), I thinks it's too early in season 2, or at least the first half of the season. Barry is still learning to control his powers and should fight his battles alone/with a tech team. One speedster mentor as Jay Garrick, yep cool. But a team-up with another Flash on top? Nope, especially if Wally is coming from wherever Zoom is coming from and is already an experienced superhero. But that's just my opinion, and I would still love to see Wally appear as a regular young man (boy?) who can't run fast and knows nothing about the speedforce. It could be nice for Iris' character to have a cousin or something like that around, who could also look up to Barry."
FlashTV,3d71uq,Airsay58259,10,Tue Jul 14 02:10:36 2015 UTC,Maybe have him be something like Roy in season 1 of Arrow?

Probably more of a nod to the fans, doesn't make much sense to have yet another Flash (especially if we're already getting Jay) unless of course there are plans to send either him or Jay to Legends of Tomorrow (or Teen Titans assuming they decide to link with the DCCW-verse)."
FlashTV,3d71uq,Jaliu,3,Tue Jul 14 06:36:32 2015 UTC,I feel like it would be cool for them to make wally get his powers similar to how Barry did in the comics. Something like at the end of season 2 Barry gets trapped in the speed force and becomes the lightning bolt that strikes wally. Then have Barry missing for most of season 3 and wally somehow gets him out.

They have made multiple characters on Arrow have very different identities to their comic counterparts while still maintaining the same basic character and same motivations as the comics.   As people have said repeatedly in other posts, Eddie is a PERFECT fit for the Zoom character after everything that's happened. He was involved in a time travel accident, he's a friend of the flash, he has a strong sense of justice making his motive of making the flash a better hero make sense, and he harbors some dark feelings for the flash (Because of Iris in Eddie's case and because of Wally not time travelling to help him in Hunter's case)"

FlashTV,3d9j57,Element1232,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:02:16 2015 UTC,"Grant Gustin's Barry is an amalgamation of Barry and Wally from the Silver Age.  Thus, we can see why we could have a Zoom-esque character and Eddie was pretty much set up to be a pseudo Hunter Zolomon.  The writers making a Cobalt Blue/ Zoom hybrid character is more likely then just introducing Iris' brother from out of nowhere.  Plus Zoom only refers to Hunter Zoloman, not Daniel West or any of the other Reverse Flashes."

FlashTV,3d61s4,Abigail_Rose,2,Tue Jul 14 01:43:53 2015 UTC,"It's definitely Zoom, but Zoom didn't have a Black Suit and Blue Streaks in the comics. Also while Harrison Wells was Eobard Thawne, they actually did give him some of Hunter Zolomon's traits in the show so they might be changing things up from the comics and Zoom might not be Zolomon.   Some of my theories are: - Wally West: Even though he is a hero in the comics, I think for this show he would be good as a villain cause of the whole Iris/Joe thing.  - Harrison Wells as Hunter Zolomon: How do you make Tom Cavanagh the villain again but not as Eobard? You make him Hunter Zolomon. I have no absolute clue as to what kind of story they would spin as to why Wells is Zolomon in a different universe, but it would sure be a lot of fun.  - Eddie: A lot of people are speculating he will eventually be Cobalt Blue, but CB wasn't a particularly huge character in the comics so fusing him with Zoom would be a pretty good idea IMO. It would also explain the blue streaks in the video. Again like with Wells, I have no idea how the writers will turn Eddie into Zoom, but it will be a lot of fun. I just don't know if they'd bring Eddie back this early.  - Future Barry Allen: This is the one I want to see the most. This was a storyline in New 52 comics and he also had a Black & Blue suit like Zoom does in the video. And obviously they're going to have to change some stuff up from the comics since it appears Zoom will be from a different universe. They called him Future Flash in the comics but they may just cut out Hunter Zolomon completely and make Future Flash be Zoom.   There are also people saying that they might be giving Zoom some of Black Flash's traits due to the Black Suit, but I'm not sure. It would make sense though because Black Flash would be a really hard character to pull off on it's own so blending him with another character is a logical conclusion."
FlashTV,3d61s4,TrippyTippy,4,Tue Jul 14 00:59:31 2015 UTC,"Also while Harrison Wells was Eobard Thawne, they actually did give him some of Hunter Zolomon's traits in the show    I've heard people say this before but I really don't see it. ""Wells"" was pushing Barry to get faster, he didn't give a damn about him being a better hero and even originally attempted to discourage him from being a hero at all. And the wheelchair thing was just a lie."
FlashTV,3d61s4,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Tue Jul 14 02:29:06 2015 UTC,"He only wanted Barry to go faster. That was his whole play. He didn't really want Barry to become a better hero. He didn't even do it through tragedy. He wanted Barry to create more speedforce. That is all. He wanted his speed back. Barry was the source of that speed. Without Barry, there is no reverse flash."
FlashTV,3d61s4,Aw35omeAnth0ny,2,Tue Jul 14 08:13:23 2015 UTC,He had the wheelchair?
FlashTV,3d61s4,Conbz,2,Tue Jul 14 09:27:42 2015 UTC,"Zoom? Yeah, he was paralyzed before getting his powers. That plays a big part in his origin."
FlashTV,3d61s4,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:32:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah and I meant that Wells had the Wheelchair part. Seems obvious that Eddie is going to be Zoom, right?"
FlashTV,3d61s4,Conbz,2,Tue Jul 14 09:48:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, I assumed you were asking about Zoom because you had to know about ""Wells"" I guess I don't understand exactly what you were asking me there.   That's my thought. Eddie getting sucked in the wormhole seems like a good way to do the displaced from time origin in a universe without the cosmic treadmill."
FlashTV,3d61s4,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:05:42 2015 UTC,Alternatively to Wally it could be a Daniel West style character who in the comics has Red and Black. Keeps the whole Iris/Joe thing that you mentioned while not making the favorite incarnation of the flash for a large number of people a villain.
FlashTV,3d61s4,MordorTroll,2,Tue Jul 14 07:33:51 2015 UTC,It's Barry Allen from the future. It was a event that happened in the new 52 comics

FlashTV,3d6f14,BrightDarkness16,3,Tue Jul 14 06:38:04 2015 UTC,"I think firestorm will play more of a supportive role in both shows (ronnie in the flash and stien in LoT). I think later they are going to explore killer frost becoming enemies to Ronnie. We will only get to see a few episodes of firestorm (with stien) on both shows, sorta like they did in the Flash.  I like the idea of snow trying to remove firestorm from ronnie by trying to remove his heat but ends up absorbing it, freezing over and becoming killer frost, losing her mind. Ronnie call stien back and they go head to head with killer frost till they were able to nutralize her frost with their heat bringing her back to her sense. But this is only a temporary fix, so cisco creates some warming device, and snow desides she cant be at star labs anymore...  Drops mic"

FlashTV,3d741w,sammylaco,3,Tue Jul 14 02:57:18 2015 UTC,"It didn't sound like Jay to me either but often those audition lines are just filler and not actual lines that will be used.

That would make so much sense with Hunter Zolomon's backstory, and he was quite a good actor when written well."
FlashTV,3czeu2,TheAmazingSpiderLin,125,Sun Jul 12 04:54:23 2015 UTC,"I think you're exactly right. They're gonna take the idea of Hunter Zolomon but do it with Eddie instead.  Of course making it a blue streak like Cobalt Blue just to make it badass. And I expect they'll probably play up the mystery of who ""Zoom"" is and have an amazing reveal.  Maybe even say ""It was ME Barry, it was me all along!""...  Season 2 just got even more awesome.  Edit: If I end up being right I'll cry"
FlashTV,3czeu2,ThatDerpingGuy,38,Sun Jul 12 05:06:42 2015 UTC,"It sorta works extremely well if that's the route they're going with Eddie. He could have all the combined resentment and hatred of both Malcolm Thawne and Hunter Zolomon.

FlashTV,3czeu2,TheAmazingSpiderLin,25,Sun Jul 12 10:50:17 2015 UTC,If I had to guess that's probably just a placeholder for the reel since the show started filming like a week ago. I think that shot was in Season 1 but of Barry.  Plus it says Zoom at the end.  Edit: Actually looking at it again all of the footage at the end seems to be repurposed CGI.

FlashTV,3czeu2,overkill136,9,Sun Jul 12 08:52:18 2015 UTC,Can anyone tell me a quick backstory to this blue flash?
FlashTV,3czeu2,kabeard,19,Sun Jul 12 08:53:08 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I read it, but as Barry uses his speed force powers, he slowly starts losing time. Like, he will have to meet up with someone at 7:00, runs there super fast to get there on time, but he will be a few minutes late because he lost time. This causes a future Barry, who by losing so much time couldn't save some key characters from death in his time line, you come back to the past where current Barry is and take out bad guys before they kill people in the future, hopefully saving the people he couldn't because of the lost time. Shits really hard to explain cause time loss and time travel lol,  but if you have any questions feel free to ask. Also if anyone can add or better explain please do. You would be helping me and everyone else out"
FlashTV,3czeu2,LTman86,16,Sun Jul 12 09:45:58 2015 UTC,"Basically the Blue Flash is Barry from the future. He travels back in time, fixing some mistakes, trying to repair the damage to the Speed Force. Anything more would spoil the story, but if you really want to know...    Spoilers  At some point, presumably Barry or someone else ripped a hole in the Speedforce. I'm assuming the latter since they never really specified who but in the chapters leading up to this Future Blue Flash Barry, there was the Reverse Flash, the shenanigans where Iris and a bunch of other people got pulled into the Speed Force, and that Tornado guy who got pulled into the Speed Force causing a bunch of trouble trying to get home which resulted in all the people getting pulled in, so on and so forth. I'm guessing the tear started somewhere there, but like I said, nothing specific was mentioned.  Anyways, Present Barry, whenever he uses his super speed, starts loosing bits of time. A minute here, a minute there, seems trivial at first but it accumulate. So while he and his watch thinks only 5 minutes have passed while running around, the world time probably passed 10, 20 minutes. Makes keeping dates hard when both his watch and sense of time is wrong. This leads to bad consequences when trying to get to crimes on time. Those missing minutes cost lives, which Future Barry keeps a record of and vows to fix because one of the lives was someone close to him.  So Future Barry builds a device that can track the damage to the Speed Force, and is running backwards in time to find a point where he can ""fix"" it. Basically finding a point in time where the tear isn't too big so it can be fixed.  /End Spoilers    Anyways, tons of shit happens, Future Barry is a dick, time tomfoolery screw plans up, and the Speed Force really is a messed up place."

Edit: People seem to be throwing the idea around of Eddie/Hunter mixed into one character to create Zoom, that might be it also."
FlashTV,3czeu2,GloriousGe0rge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:22:46 2015 UTC,"It just seems stupid to be Zoom...  His entire character's backstory is that he's a friend of the Flash, who mentors him, who then is revealed to be evil, with super speed.  Doesn't that sound familiar? And come on, another guy faster than Barry...are we at the bottom of the villain bucket already?"
FlashTV,3czeu2,KingoftheAnimus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:29:37 2015 UTC,"I see your point, even though I think it's pretty cool. I always liked Zoom as a character. I don't know how they'll handle the backstory though, because Zoom is Wally West's enemy and not really Barry's.   I don't think this is bottom of the bucket though, the ""reverse flash"" characters are always the big baddies to the flash characters. The thing is, the flash overall as a character is fucking OP as shit. And the only way to create an effective rival is someone who is just as fast or faster than him. Zoom is much much faster than Wally which probably mean he's ridiculously faster than Barry. I want to see how they handle that, because I'm pretty sure Zoom died because inertia fucked him over or something and Wally never actually ended up taking him out. Could be wrong there though."
FlashTV,3czeu2,GloriousGe0rge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:12:43 2015 UTC,"First, Wally isn't faster than Barry...no way. Barry's been outrunning death for 25 years. Barry broke time, and gave birth to the speedforce...no one is topping that.  Why I see it as the bottom of the bucket is that it's the same as last season...Why not get the Rogues together? Or a return of Grodd? Or the antimonitor?   Instead it's just Zoom? Really?"
FlashTV,3czeu2,KingoftheAnimus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"A difficult encounter with a particularly vicious foe, the first Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawne), also served to increase the speed of the character, forcing him to push past a psychological block he had placed on his powers. To prevent himself from truly ""replacing"" Barry, Wally had subconsciously limited his speed so that he could never become his mentor's equal, but Thawne's bragging that he would become the true Flash forced Wally past this block, as he feared Thawne replacing Barry more than he feared himself doing so.[9] After this encounter, he was Barry Allen's equal in speed, and eventually became even faster. Though he still had not been able to recover Barry's vibrational/phasing abilities (he could vibrate through objects but they would explode instead), he gained several new powers that Barry never had. He was able to share/steal speed,  use his speed to kinetically upgrade his attacks, and super heal others.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_West  There have been many debates regarding whether Barry or Wally was the fastest. I've heard both, but people seemed to agree that Wally was the fastest over at /r/DCcomics on some threads that I've read. There's probably just as many people saying Barry is faster though.   I'm also wondering what they are going to do with Grodd lol, seems like he was there for a split second and that was it. I honestly suspected season 2 to be about Grodd, Zoom was a surprise. Might mean the introduction of Wally? Or maybe not if it's this morphed version of Eddie and Hunter that people are suggesting.    Edit: Here is more discussion regarding Barry outrunning death, if you'd like to read up on it. I thought it was pretty interesting what people had to say.   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/2wou5y/dcthe_flash_how_does_barry_allen_end_up/"

Since Barry's creation, he has either been on an alternate world called Earth 2, or as a mentor figure to the Speedsters. Seems like this will be a mix of both.  Patty Spivot was a recent creation, and in the current New 52 comics, she was actually a really close lover for Barry--she knew the identity and everything. But things got terribly awkward when a crazy version of Barry from the future took over Barry's identity and started killing villains before they could do their wicked deeds. As it tends to happen."

FlashTV,3czeu2,Tal9922,7,Sun Jul 12 06:17:49 2015 UTC,"It could be Cobalt Blue, it's more likely than other options (Blue Lantern, Black Flash, hella-future Flash) but keep in mind that in the comics, Jay Garrick couldn't access the Speedforce until he met Barry. Only Speedsters who tap Speedforce trail yellow lightning. The Reverse/time-manipulators trail red. Garrick could be trailing white/blue when he first arrives because he's not using Speedforce. That could be used as a plot device later, too: Barry sees the blue-white and thinks it's just Jay, then BAMF Surprise, mothatrucka!   Plus, since they're introducing Multiverse and have shown they're willing to wiggle on canon characters, they could cast Malcolm Thawne as Cobalt instead of using Cosnett [sidebar: He left the show for personal reasons? Anyone know more about that?] as Eddie/Cobalt. Nora didn't have to give birth to twins in every 'Verse, after all. Infinite variety in infinite yadda yadda. It'd be fucking boss imho if they could get Cosnett to come back as Eddie/Cobalt to help Barry fight Zoom. Everyone is happy to see Eddie again, they defeat Zoom, and then Eddie goes grodd-shit on Barry saying that no one gets to kill Flash except for him. Whatatwist.   I am both unsurprised and sad that Shipp isn't going to be Earth-2 Garrick or suiting up soon (as far as we know now, anyway. I live in hope!) for the fanservice scenes that would cause tumblr-level fansploding. I don't know how psyched I am about Wally showing up this season, but it could just be out of concern that the CW/DC is moving really fast (ha, ha) on all of this. Barry showed up in 2x08 of Arrow, after just one good season of that show. Hype let them give Flash it's own pilot & opening budget rather than backdooring it through the end of Arrow S2. Then they announced Legends and now the CW Seed show Vixen. AND they'll be spliting duties with Supergirl over on CBS, too. It's a lot of everything to have happened in 3 years. Season 1 of The Flash was great: great casting, good use of Rogues, well-done arcs and weeklies and a Finale that created rivers of manly feels tears. For real.  I'm really hoping they'll be able to hold it all together, make the Flarrowend-Verse mesh well and have a year of triple-threat action. I'm just afraid it could end up with the whole thing collapsing. I want to see how they develop Cisco into Vibe, handle the Killer Frost plot and see if they go for the Trial storyline as shown in the Speedforce Vision. Mostly Vibe tho. Cisco is awesome.  Finally, I like that Barry is starting out in the way described. Regardless of it all, Eddie saved everyone*. I'm digging on the lightning skillset tease. Flash has used static electricity in the past, and has channeled energy into lightning to jump Cisco post-bee in S1. I think the constructs are too complex at this stage, but I can see him making charged cyclone blasts.   Anyone else want to see a scene where Barry (not as Flash) gets angry and does lightning eye unaware or get his hackles up and crackle? If he's going to be stretching his Speedforce Conduit status, I can see where that could cause him to focus on the mental/emotional side of his power. Honestly, I just really like the eye FX they use now. /shrug   *Yeah, his suicide is what caused the paradox and reopening of the singularity, but if he hadn't done it he knew Eobard would kill Barry, Iris, Joe, all the S.T.A.R.Labs people, Henry and anyone else who got in his way. Eddie also didn't know that he'd be causing a paradox or that it could be dangerous to do so, so he chose swift action because that's who he is."

FlashTV,3czeu2,HAshtagNOSWAG_UMAD_B,11,Sun Jul 12 04:44:57 2015 UTC,"It easily could be. I think the line could imply that the ""thing"" Barry hates is himself or some facet of his personality, like his own weakness."

FlashTV,3czeu2,Gamegomusic,9,Sun Jul 12 05:20:09 2015 UTC,"Eobard is Professor Zoom. Zoom is a guy from Wally's era who believed that Wally, to be a better hero, needed a Reverse Flash to inflict tragedy in his life. He has time based powers rather than speed based."
FlashTV,3czeu2,cyberine,3,Sun Jul 12 05:23:29 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that thinks Zoom is going to be Future Barry? It would be a nifty way to not piss off WarnerBros by using Hunter Zolomon. Plus, it'd be original."

FlashTV,3czeu2,Aretsu33,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:11:34 2015 UTC,It looked like straight yellow beams and as Garrick isn't connected to the Speedforce it would make sense that his 'trail' looks different
FlashTV,3czeu2,Bozo31215,3,Sun Jul 12 11:06:31 2015 UTC,I don't know about the show. Jay has always used the Speedforce(he like Barry and others didn't know it at the time). Though Jay is a natural speedster meta so if the Speedforce vanished he'd still have his powers and only go at the speed of sound.  Again not sure what route the show may take.
FlashTV,3czeu2,Theniallmc,2,Sun Jul 12 12:56:52 2015 UTC,He did connect with the speedforce later on! I think the show will have him already in possess of speedforce powers

FlashTV,3czeu2,MightyGreenPanda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:03:19 2015 UTC,Almost definitely. All his other interviews yesterday he expressed his lack of desire to play real Wells and excitement about continuing to play RF.  The only person who commented yesterday about the real Harrison Wells was that moderator who also had to be told Jessie L Martin wasn't actually sitting at the table.   Link to IGN interview where TC says he's not interested in playing real Wells  Link to interview where he says the thing he is most looking forward to in Season 2 is putting the RF costume back on
FlashTV,3czeu2,Aw35omeAnth0ny,3,Sun Jul 12 18:28:44 2015 UTC,If you pause the video at the right time. You can see the blue speedster with a white emblem on his chest. I think it's Barry.  http://imgur.com/r7e3IUb
FlashTV,3czeu2,neoblackdragon,10,Sun Jul 12 08:50:03 2015 UTC,All of that was just scenes from last season but blue instead of yellow.
FlashTV,3czeu2,Harddaysnight1990,7,Sun Jul 12 09:31:38 2015 UTC,Maybe it's just a CGI placeholder and/or they just don't want to show Zoom's appearance yet.

FlashTV,3czeu2,TheTidalTrickster,4,Sun Jul 12 05:06:36 2015 UTC,"Since the letters in ""Zoom is coming"" are also blue, I'm guessing it will be Zoom in a different costume than the comics."

FlashTV,3czeu2,Bozo31215,2,Sun Jul 12 05:27:27 2015 UTC,They'll probably try to make him look different than Eobard.  I doubt he'll be yellow so blue seems as good a colour as any.
FlashTV,3czeu2,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Sun Jul 12 14:17:46 2015 UTC,"Do you think they'll actually combine Cobalt Blue and Zoom into one character, or you think they'll just go with a different costume for Zolomon and keep Cobalt Blue for later?"
FlashTV,3czeu2,Bozo31215,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:19:32 2015 UTC,"I think they will combine the two. Eddie getting sucked into the wormhole, seems like a great way to do the displaced from the timestream story for Zoom, considering we don't have a cosmic treadmill. But that's just my speculation."

Can anyone get a screenshot of when he gets up close, it went too fast for me.  Edit: I'm probably wrong. Pause at 5:28 it looks like a yellow suit."
FlashTV,3czeu2,Felderburg,2,Sun Jul 12 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, Eobard says that he's not the ""thing"" Barry hates. I don't think he's actually talking about Zoom there.   To your overall point, I could see them making Zoom Future Barry, but I hope they don't. I'm not a fan of actors playing off themself; it usually doesn't come off well. I'd rather a unique actor be cast as Zoom."
FlashTV,3czeu2,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:38:50 2015 UTC,Good catch. I jumped aboard the hype train when I saw the blue lightning and must have misheard it. If they went that route they would probably cast another actor since it was 20+ years in the future.

Geoff Johns did a few about Batman's first forays into crimefighting, Grant Morrison has one on Wonder Woman due in November, and JMS (who's writing Flash) recently released his third Superman E1 book.  EDIT: Not sure why I'm being downvoted... I thought this was of interest to r/FlashTV."
FlashTV,3d11ri,vidiyan2857,2,Sun Jul 12 17:09:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The Earth One books are more like different takes on the characters, seeing as we don't know anything about the book itself it could vary incredibly from the source material. And imo the best part of the Earth One line is seeing the differences between the main continuity and this universe.   Also this book will probably only get 1 more volume which won't lead into the wider universe. New readers are much better off starting with New 52."
FlashTV,3czdxb,Deka145,104,Sun Jul 12 04:08:41 2015 UTC,"My one worry here is that Zoom is too similar to good 'ole Eobard. I mean, ""Reverse-Flash"" is his synonym too.."
FlashTV,3czdxb,ContinuumGuy,49,Sun Jul 12 04:12:19 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that too but I think as long as they give him a different suit in the comics, it won't be as big of an issue. His powers and motivations are different enough."

FlashTV,3czdxb,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,11,Sun Jul 12 05:19:22 2015 UTC,For a moment I thought the blue streak was future-Barry/Blue Lantern Barry

FlashTV,3czdxb,guccigoogle,24,Sun Jul 12 04:50:46 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that at all. Zoom is faster but Eobard is just as menacing. They served the same role for their respective archnemesis. That was Zolomon's whole point, he felt Wally needed a Reverse Flash."
FlashTV,3czdxb,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,15,Sun Jul 12 05:18:46 2015 UTC,The reason I say more menacing is because he literally believes that ruining the Flash's life will do him good. Whereas RF knows he's the bad guy.    Also the speed makes him much more threatening. Flash can keep up with RF. Not with Zoom.
FlashTV,3czdxb,guccigoogle,3,Sun Jul 12 05:22:27 2015 UTC,"Is it because he manipulates time, instead of tapping into the Speedforce?  Or do I have the wrong understanding of his abilities?"

FlashTV,3czdxb,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:50:12 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but I meant as a series regular. I didn't think that was necessary to explain"
FlashTV,3czdxb,Zoso-Overdose,2,Mon Jul 13 08:28:33 2015 UTC,"Ya, but them saying he's not a series regular followed with ""for personal reasons."" doesn't really prove anything.    First, ""for personal reasons"" is the standard ""We don't want to tell you the truth"" excuse, which is highly suspicious.     And second, he doesn't have to be a series regular to end up being Zoom.    In fact, it would be smart to remove him as a series regular to help hide the fact that he's Zoom.    First half of the season, they can do Zoom scenes with CGI and stunt actors so he's not seen anywhere near set, making it so people like us (people that follow all the news about it) don't suspect him.    Especially if someone like... Jay Garrick... already knows enough about Zoom that we can get character info about Zoom from Jay instead of directly from Zoom.  Then half way, three fourths of the way through the season, we're all wondering who Zoom is, suspecting 'series regulars' to be him.... Cosnett comes back and we forgot that he should be the prime suspect.  We think he's just showing up as a ""guest star"" for an episode.  edit: and lemme just point out, I don't want you to take it the wrong way, I only corrected your statement because not everyone follows everything and if they see someone saying producers said ""Eddie won't be on the show anymore."" they think that's accurate.   And that's not what was truly said.   So... I was just clarifying, to look at it positively... or I was being pedantic if you want to look at it negatively."
FlashTV,3czdxb,AREYOUSauRuS,2,Mon Jul 13 11:50:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, don't get me wrong, my personal theory is that Eddie will be Zoom. that's the most obvious course for the show to take. They did that with Wells being Eobard, but everyone thought there was more to it (all those ""Wells is future Barry"" theories etc) when really there wasn't. It's really me hoping that Zoom will be someone I'm not expecting it to be. They've set up Eddie to be a player in Season 2 with him disappearing into that vortex, that much is obvious. I also personally wasn't a fan of Cosnett's acting until the end of the season, so I'm worried that he won't be able to live up to Tom Cavanagh"

And when he went to Wally to ask him to go back in time and save him Wally refused because he knows he shouldn't mess with the timeline and that led him to recreating Wally's accident?
FlashTV,3czdxb,xHovercraft,31,Sun Jul 12 16:50:07 2015 UTC,Isn't Zoom just a nickname for Reverse Flash or are they two different characters?
FlashTV,3czdxb,itshotinjuly,44,Sun Jul 12 04:44:34 2015 UTC,Zoom is basically the Reverse-Flash of Wally West who's real name is Hunter Zolomon.

FlashTV,3czdxb,nerfAvari,4,Sun Jul 12 09:18:25 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I was thinking. Eddie could theoretically exist outside the time line due to wormhole shenanigans.

FlashTV,3czdxb,TweetPoster,12,Sun Jul 12 04:09:14 2015 UTC,Twist: What if Zoom is the police captain (Captain Singh). Barry's wormhole puts him back in a timeline where the police captain is paralyzed (like in the original timeline on the show). He asks Barry to travel back in time to save him. Barry refuses because he knows what happens when you mess with time now. I know that's basically Wally's origin with Zoom. Or maybe Barry is just in the future now.  Either way I'm excited.
FlashTV,3czdxb,dunnweb,3,Sun Jul 12 05:21:46 2015 UTC,"Possible, but I feel like Eddie is more likely."

FlashTV,3czdxb,_JustToComment,0,Sun Jul 12 05:32:27 2015 UTC,Zoom is wallys villian... This coupled with the Intel that patty is coming and flash will have relationship drama isn't giving me good confidence for the show
FlashTV,3d0z2e,moffatt123,7,Sun Jul 12 16:45:28 2015 UTC,They just took scenes of the flash from previous episodes and colored them blue.

FlashTV,3d0z2e,CannibalIowa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:39:39 2015 UTC,Could be although Blue Flash guy had more of a streak than Lightning and if you remember how Zoom's powers worked it would make sense for it to be him.

FlashTV,3d0r7w,babypoodle,10,Sun Jul 12 16:20:40 2015 UTC,John Wesley Shipp played a version of the Flash in the 90s and he could play a version of the Flash from an alternate universe.

FlashTV,3d0sef,sonofodin25,8,Sun Jul 12 17:05:30 2015 UTC,Tom Cavanagh is playing Harrison Wells   I don't know where you are getting that from.  That would contradict everything Tom Cavanagh said yesterday as well as the tone/words of the voiceovers on the trailer. The only person who commented about the real Harrison Wells was that moderator who also had to be told Jessie L Martin wasn't actually sitting at the table.   Link to IGN interview where TC says he's not interested in playing real Wells  Link to interview where he says the thing he is most looking forward to in Season 2 is putting the RF costume back on

FlashTV,3cz3bo,MrDTD,10,Sun Jul 12 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"I know, but I dont think it's a good idea. Having Wells on even more only prolongs Barry from going solo like he should be. Learning to solve problems on his own without a guy behind the mic. Having Wells back as.. Wells would just cheapen the show too especially with what happened last season."
FlashTV,3cz3bo,Capt-Murphy,6,Sun Jul 12 04:03:20 2015 UTC,"The Arrow writers and showrunner fall in love with actors and actresses, so they write ways to include them instead of what is best for the overall story.  I hope The Flash showrunner and writers do not make the same mistake."

It'd be a good way to foreshadow future enemies, but also a great way to incorporate her (they started doing that for one episode).  She could provide information on their powers, a few images, where they've been seen, and any known crimes. Cisco and Caitlyn could figure out their powers from there."

We're going to get the perfect villain, more speedsters, a new love interest, through this love interest we're finally going to start seeing Barry's CSI side (like the first scene of the pilot where text pops up while he investigates the crime scene and such), Tom Cavanagh as Harrison Wells (though he won't be interacting with Barry for a while), more crossovers, and probably much more!"

FlashTV,3czi80,Cavmo,0,Sun Jul 12 18:35:12 2015 UTC,The Trap didn't have  RF until the last ten minutes iirc. The first thirty were just watching Cisco relive E15 or something like that.
FlashTV,3czi80,Cavmo,3,Sun Jul 12 18:33:41 2015 UTC,Cisco reliving E15 was directly connected to the reverse flash storyline. Who would the freak of the week be anyways? The only villains seen in the episode were RF and The Everyman.
FlashTV,3czi80,Flgibson97,-1,Sun Jul 12 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"Everyman was. I mean, sure it had RF in it, but only a small part of the episode was dedicated to him. The other part was just Cisco preparing to look into his memories or something, I forget."
FlashTV,3czi80,sonofodin25,4,Sun Jul 12 21:45:03 2015 UTC,Everyman wasn't the main villain; he was just Eobard's pawn. Cisco looking into his memories and stuff was all in preparation for catching the reverse flash.
FlashTV,3czi80,kah43,3,Sun Jul 12 21:49:45 2015 UTC,"oh whoops I had it confused with another episode, the one where Everyman was the freak of the week.  I mean, it's hard to argue that Wells played a big part in that episode til the last ten minutes. I mean, sure, the episode was about him, but the plot really didn't go anywhere until the trap was sprung. The part before that was testing the machine and stuff iirc.  But I kinda missed your original point. You're right, it is not freak of the week. I just thought it had significantly less time dedicated to Wells than it should have."

Why are you opposed to being considerate? It's literally that simple. It takes almost no effort to be considerate to everyone, which also means you're following the rules, so why choose to do it any differently?

FlashTV,3cwrpy,sabin357,3,Sat Jul 11 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"The point is to make sure people realize they are breaking a rule, because I doubt they intended it when they posted.  I actually just mentioned to the mods about using automod like we do in some of my subs. That way it catches stuff like this, without mods even needing to be online. It enforces the rules automatically for things like that or can post to remind the user to mark the spoiler."
FlashTV,3cwrpy,BoiledPNutz,-2,Sat Jul 11 19:08:30 2015 UTC,I agree about auto mod. And honestly I feel for the mods on this. I get it's a rule but those are mostly meaningless. On mobile you have to go out of your way to see the rules. And there's still people who either don't care or are for whatever reason lacking the intelligence to not spoil. But it's also comic con and here people come to flash sub to what? Not see information that might be revealed about it at comic con? It's like perusing the night a new episode debuts and you're behind. It's insane yet in every post there's people crying. It brings nothing to the table and it's their own fault.

I mean, it seems they're the minority wanting the entire community to bend to their incessant need for their type of information the way they want it. I see ""spoiler"" stuff every day in every dedicated sub. I think we all need to accept the risk and not bring the sub down to kindergarten complaining."
FlashTV,3cwrpy,sabin357,3,Sat Jul 11 19:08:33 2015 UTC,"why don't the spoiler free people just make their own sub?   Because they are already following the rules, the ones shared by almost every place on the internet that does TV/Movie discussion. The ones spoiling are the minority.   I think we all need to accept the risk and not bring the sub down to kindergarten complaining.   Just follow the rules is all we have to do. Just like everywhere else in life. You'll continue having rules when you graduate kindergarten."
FlashTV,3cwrpy,BoiledPNutz,-4,Sat Jul 11 19:11:30 2015 UTC,"I do follow them. And every day there's numerous ""spoiler"" posts.  What's the point? Seriously?"

So don't be a dick and keep spoilers out of titles and tag them properly according to the rules. That's all we ask. No drama, no rants anymore. It doesn't even take any effort, just the will to not ruin it for other people, who like to be surprised. Just be considerate of other subscribers, even if it doesn't affect you."
FlashTV,3cwrpy,Karisma_not_Karma,2,Sat Jul 11 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"I'm already finished with the show so now I come here for the discussion, spoilers or no, but there was a time when I came to this sub just to read the synopses posted by /u/theawesomebla and the FTCN series by Mr. Owl. So I appreciate the spoiler tags."
FlashTV,3cwrpy,sabin357,-1,Mon Jul 13 02:31:08 2015 UTC,The entire spoilers debate really just comes down to being considerate. How do people not get that? Have they never been considerate in real life before?
FlashTV,3cwrpy,wellbluebanana,-3,Sat Jul 11 18:40:11 2015 UTC,I'm on your side. It is a shitty rule that will prevent practically no one from finding out about official announcements. No other superhero sub does it and no one remembers to follow it.

FlashTV,3cwrpy,ajcrossing,8,Sat Jul 11 17:25:01 2015 UTC,Well it's fan made and the panel hasn't even happened yet for the flash. Sooo there's nothing wrong with it lol
FlashTV,3cwrpy,JoeyPantz,2,Sat Jul 11 17:38:01 2015 UTC,Hasn't he been confirmed anyway? So its still kinda a spoiler.
FlashTV,3cwrpy,ajcrossing,2,Sat Jul 11 18:29:51 2015 UTC,Nope no confirmation
FlashTV,3cwrpy,wellbluebanana,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:47:58 2015 UTC,Wrong. His confirmation is part of the reason this thread was created. People put the announcement in the title of a thread.

FlashTV,3cszz0,TakeOutTacos,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:44:33 2015 UTC,That makes that ad break longer if you have Hulu plus I will have a shorted break when I disable Adblock.

But their ads are like 30 seconds and three or four times an episode.  It's really no big deal at all.    The reason they have them at all is because it's expensive to host all of those shows and I can't physically DVR all the shows I would want to watch, nor do I really want to torrent 3 or 4 HD shows per day depending on the time of year."

FlashTV,3cuoxg,kacman,19,Fri Jul 10 22:43:58 2015 UTC,Not that it really matters but I'm pretty sure that comic panel of Grodd and Flash was Wally.
FlashTV,3cuoxg,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,5,Fri Jul 10 23:15:48 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it was Barry. They eyes on the Flash costume weren't white. You could see the eye holes.
FlashTV,3cuoxg,walterpinkman45,3,Sat Jul 11 03:04:05 2015 UTC,Wally didn't always have white eyes. I'm pretty certain it's Wally's in his early stories when he was still wearing Barry's costume.   Edit: I will add that I'm positive it is from a Messner-Loebs story but there is a slight chance it's depicting a flashback to Barry fighting Grodd. I doubt it though.
FlashTV,3cuoxg,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,15,Sat Jul 11 03:07:48 2015 UTC,This trailer was so well put together. Love the new logo!

FlashTV,3cuoxg,Thegreen_flash,5,Fri Jul 10 23:16:03 2015 UTC,Still don't understand how whoever Jay Jackson is will fit into all this. He probably won't be part of the main group of legends since he hasn't been shown even once. Maybe he's just a placeholder for Savage?
FlashTV,3cuoxg,TheAmbitious1,8,Fri Jul 10 23:19:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe he'll be Stein's other half now that Kreisberg confirmed Ronnie isn't going to be in Legends while they still tease Firestorm in the show. Jason Rush recast, who knows. I dont see where Jay would fit as a regular otherwise (except as the villain as you said)."
FlashTV,3cuoxg,Airsay58259,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:27:40 2015 UTC,"Why would they suddenly recast Jason? Also, if it was actually him, I don't think there would be so much secretism."
FlashTV,3cuoxg,MightyGreenPanda,3,Sat Jul 11 08:42:56 2015 UTC,"They'd keep it secret because it would mean something happens to Ronnie at some point in Flash before LOT starts in january and they wouldn't want to admit it (""There's a reason why only Stein is going to Legends"", meaning Ronnie either stays in CC or...). As for the recast, don't know I'm just throwing out ideas for Jay. Maybe they didn't know they would need Jason again and the actor is unavailable, like Sara Lance S1 in Arrow. But I'm just saying this because of the big Robbie Amell mystery while they teased Firestorm in LOT. I really hope it's not true though, I love the Stein/Ronnie dynamic and if/when Caitlin becomes Killer Frost it would only get better."
FlashTV,3cuoxg,Airsay58259,3,Sat Jul 11 09:00:28 2015 UTC,Was that a new theme at the end?
FlashTV,3cuoxg,Ngiole,3,Fri Jul 10 23:01:26 2015 UTC,Not a single frame of that was new footage.  Everyone involved in production must be really annoyed that SDCC is happening before any of the shows start filming... all the trailers are rehashes.

FlashTV,3cvqar,ShadowSlayerX,19,Sat Jul 11 04:22:46 2015 UTC,I can't understand how anyone has watched Smallville and Flash/Arrow would think it would be possible for Tom to reprise his Clark without some serious multi-verse travel going on.     If Superman does ever appear on the show it should be someone new.
FlashTV,3cvqar,Rek07,5,Sat Jul 11 07:17:45 2015 UTC,They were very clear that they were going to be heavily exploring the multiverse and multiple timelines in season 2 so it's completely possible we travel to the smallville universe for an episode.
FlashTV,3cvqar,LaLa1234imunoriginal,4,Sat Jul 11 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"Since Tom is a bit older and is growin' a few grey hairs here and there, maybe he can play like an older Superman on the Justice Society if they ever do the justice society thing?"
FlashTV,3cvqar,13goingondaniel,8,Sat Jul 11 08:16:05 2015 UTC,"They could, but there will be peoole that will get confused and assume since it's the same actor playing the same character that it's got to be the same continuity.  I don't know if bringing Tom back is worth that.  I mean they did it with The Trickster, but  given the passage of time and the low ratings of the old series I don't think they had to worry about it too much. Mark Hamil was also totally worth it.    If Tom ever appears in Flash or Arrow I think it would be someone else entirely. Maybe a villain even like Dean Cain in Smallville. A scene alongside The Atom seems mandatory regardless."

FlashTV,3cvqar,pm_me_taylorswift,0,Sat Jul 11 17:15:35 2015 UTC,"I see your point and how easily people could get confused. I mean you said it yourself in the original comment, ""multiverse travel"". This is the best way to do it, basically every modern DC show that isn't directly connected to the Flarrowverse, is another universe. So you have the Smallville universe and the Constantine universe and the Supergirl universe. I feel like if they explained clearly enough on the show, people would be able to follow along. The writers are fantastic so I feel like it's something they'd be able to achieve."

FlashTV,3cn1xo,neoblackdragon,2,Thu Jul 9 19:50:15 2015 UTC,I am guessing it is detachable because of where the zipper is on the suit. I would love to see a blooper video of all the times it has probably fallen off.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,exozeitgeist,2,Thu Jul 9 19:33:50 2015 UTC,Well set photos show the construction. Grant takes the symbol off. It splits with one side taking the whole circle. The cowl is this huge thing that covers his chest underneath. That has got to be terrible for breathing.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,neoblackdragon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:49:44 2015 UTC,Makes sense now why they always cut away as he is putting it on his head.

FlashTV,3cn1xo,TweetsInCommentsBot,7,Fri Jul 10 10:08:19 2015 UTC,Nice little Jay Garrick helmet there too!
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Kyoraki,34,Thu Jul 9 14:54:04 2015 UTC,Are we sure this is the season two suit?  It looks the exact same besides the white emblem.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Lyle91,26,Thu Jul 9 06:04:30 2015 UTC,He's just assuming because the white is there.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,superduperfastguy,34,Thu Jul 9 06:15:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's more likely the suit they used for the ""Future Barry"" shots."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Spitfire221,4,Thu Jul 9 06:53:02 2015 UTC,"The scene where he gestures to present Barry? Probably, considering that was basically just the normal suit with white slapped on (like this). It's just odd that they'd use a white emblem on what seems to be the only Flash costume on display.  Although considering the pace this show moves at, I think it's fair to say we'll be getting the white emblem in Season 2 either way. Probably with some costume updates."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,superduperfastguy,2,Thu Jul 9 07:43:07 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the future Barry suit a bit brighter red, though?"
FlashTV,3cn1xo,BigBassBone,6,Thu Jul 9 20:43:52 2015 UTC,Future Barry was always CGI though.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,17,Thu Jul 9 09:57:05 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the shot of him telling present Barry to stay put wasn't?   Either way, this suit is too similar to be 'the' S2 suit, its exactly the same as the S1 one except with the white emblem, that's hardly an upgrade and I'm sure they wouldn't be showing the new one off at ComicCon"
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Spitfire221,-3,Thu Jul 9 10:59:21 2015 UTC,"I definitely think it was. I think they made him vibrating the whole time to hide that a bit.   Yeah I don't think this is the season 2 costume either for the reasons you stated, but putting the white emblem on the old suit might be an indication of where they are planning to go this year."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,7,Thu Jul 9 11:04:08 2015 UTC,"No, it wasn't. Most of the Future Barry stuff was CGI but the moment when he stops running and tells Present Barry ""no"" was not CGI, it's the same effect it's always been when Barry vibrates to hide his identity."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,ultrasargent,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:11:37 2015 UTC,The costume's a totally brighter red though.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Trainer_Kevin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:38:15 2015 UTC,"It's really not. Like, not even at all.  Comic con  Season 1"
FlashTV,3cn1xo,ultrasargent,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:08:37 2015 UTC,"Dude, I was referring to Future Barry in comparison to the main Barry. It's obvious the suit has remained the same shade of red, however there's no dying how bright red Future Barry's suit was in the finale compared to main Barry. Don't downvote me for that."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Trainer_Kevin,-2,Fri Jul 10 22:54:06 2015 UTC,Grant Gustin may have been standing there acting out that scene but I think his suit was altered with CGI.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:37:40 2015 UTC,"Hm, I doubt it. From the looks of the photo, that looks to be the suit he was wearing. Especially seen as how shoddily put on the white symbol is. They most likely just slapped on that white symbol because they knew the shot wouldn't be clear enough to see it properly, as he was vibrating. If he gets a new suit for S2, it'll be noticeably different."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,ultrasargent,-1,Thu Jul 9 12:57:52 2015 UTC,"Hm, I doubt it. From the looks of the photo, that looks to be the suit he was wearing.   I don't know, I think the suit was a brighter red in that finale shot. This comic-con photo looks more like the present Barry suit from season 1 with a white emblem on it."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,-1,Thu Jul 9 13:07:32 2015 UTC,Future Barry's suit was too bright red to look like this
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Trainer_Kevin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:37:39 2015 UTC,Don't forget about the photograph in the newspaper though!
FlashTV,3cn1xo,hiroshi51,3,Thu Jul 9 14:20:03 2015 UTC,I accidentally put my cursor on your flair and it vibrated! I had no idea this was a thing. That is so cool. Thank you based mods.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Durzo_Blint,14,Thu Jul 9 13:19:14 2015 UTC,Barry's really pale in that photo.  Guess the first thing a black hole drains is the color from your cheeks.

FlashTV,3cn1xo,Dark_Pinoy,5,Thu Jul 9 04:58:03 2015 UTC,"At the speed this show is moving, I would not be at all surprised if we get it by the Season 2 finale or Season 3 premiere. Even though a lot of shit has happened, it's still early as hell, give it time."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,drchasedanger,9,Thu Jul 9 07:44:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's moving at about Mach 2."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,MightyGreenPanda,8,Thu Jul 9 11:22:23 2015 UTC,It's never ran that fast before

FlashTV,3cn1xo,gadgetguy03,2,Thu Jul 9 17:43:07 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't let my ""meh"" feeling of a joke keep you from it if you like it!"
FlashTV,3cn1xo,TheAnthoy,3,Fri Jul 10 02:21:03 2015 UTC,"For serious tho, one season in and we already got time travel multiple times, Grodd, a Jay Garrick tease, hella Reverse Flash, the beginnings of Vibe and Killer Frost, like half the major Rogues, and a tear in the universe. I think we're good."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,drchasedanger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:25:05 2015 UTC,"That kinda has me worried though. This season has been so fucking good that I don't know what will they do on the next ones. I still have  a lot of faith in this show though, and I know that things will start to get flashy when we get a snippet of Jay Garrick or Wally West."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,MightyGreenPanda,2,Fri Jul 10 06:26:01 2015 UTC,"Luckily there are still plenty of good things they can do from here, though I hope they don't spend too much time on Killer Frost if they go with that next season since she's technically mostly a Firestorm character and too much Caitlin focus could be a bad move. The black hole will probably open up a lot of doors, possibly with Jay and/or Wally, and I highly doubt we've seen the last of Thawne. At the very least, they still need to bring in Mirror Master, which is what I'm most excited to see hopefully soon. I'm not sure how they'd integrate it with show Grodd's origins, but I'd love to see some Gorilla City stuff as well."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,drchasedanger,6,Fri Jul 10 19:01:53 2015 UTC,That looks like a pretty cool costume behind the Flash suit.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Turbotottle,3,Thu Jul 9 13:44:14 2015 UTC,Your pun seems to have left the audience cold.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,FnTom,5,Thu Jul 9 15:52:52 2015 UTC,I think this is probably just a placeholder since they're filming S2 now? I hope so because based on other pics it is still the same maroon.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,anthonyongg,2,Thu Jul 9 06:35:42 2015 UTC,"Whatever, you're the maroon."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Toxyoi,6,Thu Jul 9 13:34:11 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else feel like Grant Gustin should get a little buffer? Not a whole lot, but I feel like his suit would fit him a littler snugger if he did. It has always seemed a little too lose to me."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,jianthekorean,10,Thu Jul 9 10:03:00 2015 UTC,"He actually mentions that he'll be adding weight and working on filling out slowly over time so it seems like a natural progression. He spoke with the PTB prior to filming S1 and they told him to not gain too much, just to get defined, specifically because he doesn't look like a superhero. I had the impression that if we get into S3, you'll be able to see a clear change but not a drastic one."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,PurplePint,2,Thu Jul 9 10:46:08 2015 UTC,Well they have to make the suit loose so he could actually move around. Though he's not exactly filling space.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,neoblackdragon,8,Thu Jul 9 15:05:45 2015 UTC,DAT EMBLEM
FlashTV,3cn1xo,hardgeeklife,3,Thu Jul 9 05:15:02 2015 UTC,"I like the lighter color choice for the red, and HOLY SHIT that white logo!!!, but I'm going to need to see it on Grant before I pass too much judgement."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,N0_PR0BLEM,9,Thu Jul 9 05:38:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, technically you've seen it. 15 years ago."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,MightyGreenPanda,5,Thu Jul 9 11:22:54 2015 UTC,I'm disappointed that's exactly the same except for the white emblem. My biggest issue with the suit was the brownish-red and the lack of yellow
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Hechmaturgic,2,Thu Jul 9 09:13:05 2015 UTC,"Duller colors are much easier to light on-set. In everyday life, people rarely wear 'true' red, 'true' yellow, etc. We usually wear darker or pastel shades. If the suit was brighter, it would complicate things. The designer mentioned that in interviews. It's also supposed to have a practical lean to it, so having the mustard piping/bolt accents is already pretty bold considering it's original all-dull turnout replacement function."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,PurplePint,2,Thu Jul 9 10:49:31 2015 UTC,"Well I think a superhero can wear true red and true yellow. They aren't everyday people. Though yeah lighting is more difficult with these bright colors. By going ""duller"" they have more control and can use more diverse shading."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,neoblackdragon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:23:22 2015 UTC,Its a superhero costume. He wears lightning stickers on his temples. I think they could do a little better job and not have the realism excuse.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,BTennant1234,2,Thu Jul 9 16:08:41 2015 UTC,I could be mistaken here but another reason is also that red is one of the hardest colours to get right on film especially as it gets brighter. I remember watching the first Transformers special features and they give that as the reason as to why they went with darker red flames on Optimus Prime rather than the usual solid bright red he usually had.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,neoblackdragon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:50:02 2015 UTC,"Darker and more muted colors are fine, but I personally think they could do a better job with the suit they have in display."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,scclarke90,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:08:07 2015 UTC,Well bright red can turn to turn with enough light. It's a very strong color. Even neutral it's pretty bright and over powering as well.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,stationtracks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:48:19 2015 UTC,"maybe they will make it a brighter red later on. They would need to make a whole new suit for that, where as with this i'm guessing they just removed the symbol from the original suit and added the white and gold one."
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Quilled,2,Thu Jul 9 17:24:57 2015 UTC,It's perfect.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,Chewy453,2,Thu Jul 9 06:26:27 2015 UTC,I wish they'd fix the helmet a bit. The way the eyes slant down makes him look dope-y. The way they had it in the first ep was the best.
FlashTV,3cn1xo,PhD_in_internet,2,Thu Jul 9 10:55:13 2015 UTC,YYEESSS SO GOOD
FlashTV,3cn1xo,neoblackdragon,2,Thu Jul 9 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"Now, I'm assuming our timeline Flash had a red logo because, while he is the Flash, he was a little different from the original timeline Flash.  Does this mean we'll be watching a different timeline's Flash next season?"
FlashTV,3cn1xo,_orion,3,Thu Jul 9 17:11:31 2015 UTC,Well the real question is where did original timeline Flash get his suit? Cisco made his suit. Either Thawne made sure the suit was made or Original Flash may have actually had a totally different suit.

FlashTV,3cpfde,BrightDarkness16,5,Fri Jul 10 15:18:51 2015 UTC,He must not have listened to the Flash TV Talk podcast where they literally referred to him as H.G. Wells in every episode until it was confirmed he was Eobard Thawne after which they referred to him as H.G.obard.

FlashTV,3cn28q,Macrador,30,Thu Jul 9 04:33:29 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand all the Iris hate. I mean, yeah, she was an annoying bitch for some of the season. But, towards the end of the season she was good IMO. I can understand why she was the way she was. Everyone around her was lying to her and she was sick of it. The main thing that pissed me off about her was her trying to ruin Barry and Linda because she was being a jealous brat. Besides that, I didn't mind her."
FlashTV,3cn28q,walterpinkman45,12,Thu Jul 9 11:48:20 2015 UTC,I blame it on too many teenage fans. For the second half of the season her motivations and actions were very much understandable.
FlashTV,3cn28q,thabe331,5,Thu Jul 9 17:55:22 2015 UTC,"Anyways,Barry didn't tell Iris how he felt for over a decade. So Iris didn't know and fell in love with another man. Sure it's understandable he is jealous, but I don't feel sympathy toward his unrequited love at all.Iris is alive and happy, Joe is supportive of his love for his daughter.  It's also understandable that Iris was jealous too, because unrealized love crap. But in the end it still doesn't make it right. Barry was not ""wrong "" to be jealous, there are emotions we simply cannot control, but that doesn't mean they are admirable or completely immune to criticisms and judgements. I personally think Barry's obsession toward Iris is a character flaw,no amounts of downvotes is going to change that. It never was Eddie's fault to fall in love with Iris, even less Eddie 's fault for Iris to love him back. Barry is not a saint when it comes to romance, his jealousy shows that. There are so many unrequited loves out there,and not all chasers deserves a thumb up.if a person refuse to move on, it's his/her own problem. Luckily for Barry,  he will end up with Iris."
FlashTV,3cn28q,thenottoserious,2,Thu Jul 9 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly though, Barry was a jealous dude too. He constantly wanted Eddie and Iris to break up. Even after Eddie was rescued, instead of helping and worrying about Eddie, Barry was shown to be jealous."
FlashTV,3cn28q,thenottoserious,6,Thu Jul 9 14:38:35 2015 UTC,But Barry wasn't in a long term relationship. Iris was jealous of Barry and Linda while she was dating Eddie. Barry has loved Iris since they were kids. Of course he's gonna be jealous of her boyfriend.
FlashTV,3cn28q,walterpinkman45,0,Thu Jul 9 14:46:12 2015 UTC,"The reason why I'm bothered about Barry 's jealousy is because Eddie is a very good person in his own right, plus Iris is obvious happy with him. Barry is obsessed with Iris, not simply love, which depending on who you are,could find it to be annoying.  As a straight male myself, I don't think I can tolerate Barry if I put myself in Eddie 's shoes, while Eddie was always reasonably chill and civil about it. I totally think Barry deserved that punch. Plus Barry 's jealousy made him apears to be a very selfish person while Eddie was abducted, especially that ""Iris,  you do love me, you weren't honest either "". That felt so out of place and desperate, I'm glad Iris rejected him there."
FlashTV,3cn28q,thenottoserious,2,Thu Jul 9 15:00:21 2015 UTC,"If I had a girlfriend and she had a friend like Barry, who is obviously in love with her, I'd be on edge. But, Eddie trusted her. Eddie is a good guy and put up with a bunch of shit, but I can still understand Barry's jealousy."
FlashTV,3cn28q,walterpinkman45,2,Thu Jul 9 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"It's understandable for sure, we all loved someone at some stages of our lives. But I think it's pretty safe to assume most of us learned to move on if it doesn't workout or she/he is taken (depends on your preference ). While Barry just couldn't let go. Especially with this ""they are destined to be together "" thing, it's like the writers are telling us ""I don't care about your preference, this is the end game either way""."
FlashTV,3cn28q,thenottoserious,21,Thu Jul 9 15:13:23 2015 UTC,MRW people dont realise Iris isn't that bad
FlashTV,3cn28q,Theniallmc,0,Thu Jul 9 16:11:54 2015 UTC,ikr felicity is much worse
FlashTV,3cn28q,ladleo,5,Thu Jul 9 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"I'm torn about Iris. I didn't like her at first because she didn't seem to respect Barry at all (she mocks him for being a nerd in the first episode). Then she revealed that she is blogging about ""the Streak"" for Barry's sake. My opinion of her improved after that. The scenes with her and the Flash reminded me of Superman and Lois Lane in the original Superman movie, and I thought their chemistry was good in those moments. There are also other little moments that show how much she cares for Barry - she noted that Barry's much loved mug is broken, she visited Barry in the hospital, etc. All of these ""show"" moments as opposed to ""tell"" moments contribute to the aspects of her character I like.  Then she tried to sabotage Barry's relationship with Linda and it was so cringeworthy. Then she drug her relationship drama with Eddie out in front of Felicity and Ray, which was painful. Before that, she whined about how her coworkers didn't take her seriously at her new job when she is a complete newbie. Of course they don't take her seriously, she hasn't proven herself yet. She does later on, and that's when she rightfully earns the respect of her mentor at work, etc. She also gives Eddie that dumb ultimatum, AFTER Barry gives a pretty good reason as to why Eddie is acting the way he is. Thankfully Eddie is honest with her soon after, but it was so immature of her.  I think Iris was pretty justified in being upset with Barry, Joe, and Eddie for hiding who the Flash was from her. She's not a kid, she's an adult woman and keeping her in the loop would have been safer than keeping her out of it.  I think the biggest problem with her characterization is that we don't see her much outside of the men in her life. Where are her friends besides Barry? Especially her girl friends (I don't really count Caitlin yet)? What are her hobbies? Sure, she blogs and then works at the news station, but all of that started because of the Flash.   So that leaves me wondering why Barry and Eddie are both madly in love with her. Sure, she's beautiful, but what about her do they love? We're running into the problem of being told that Iris is so wonderful and great but having not nearly enough to convince us this is the case. At least not yet.  Also, why does Barry in particular like her? She makes fun of his ""nerdy"" interests. What do they have in common? What do they talk about when it's not about their relationship? It just makes Barry seem kind of pathetic for refusing to move on and instead pining over someone who is happily in a relationship. It also strikes me as disrespectful, because Iris has told him multiple times that she does not want to date him, yet he still keeps nagging her about it. I don't care about her subconscious feelings or alternate timelines, until she realizes her feelings and chooses to tell them to Barry, he shouldn't bug her about them.  Also, I think the writers have done a great job of convincing me that Eddie and Iris are an awesome couple. So much so that I'm having a hard time imagining Barry and Iris together. For the canon comics couple, that's a bit of a problem. I shouldn't be rooting for Eddie and Iris to be together (for Eddie's sake, not Iris's), I should want to see Barry and Iris together. I also preferred Barry and Linda together while that was a thing. Heck, I think I would prefer Caitlin and Barry to be together over Iris and Barry at this point, and I don't even really like them as a romantic pairing (I think their friendship is great and that it should stay like that). What happened? Unless Iris gets some really awesome character development during the next season, I'll probably cringe a lot while watching any Iris-Barry romantic interaction. Unless they manage to capture the same magic that happens in the early Flash-Iris scenes.  I think a lot of this is just personal preference. If I know that Character X and Character Y get together in the end, I don't want to watch them date every other eligible character on the show before they end up together. It just seems like a waste of time, and I get tired of all the dumb drama that (almost) inevitably results. I want to see a compelling, romantic, healthy, long-lasting relationship between Character X and Y instead. Is that so hard to do?  I don't think any of this is Candice Patton's fault. She does what she can with what she has to work with, and I think it's her natural charisma and charm that make Iris bearable at all. Iris could have turned out much worse than she did, but she has her good moments, and I think that's mainly because of Candice's performance and the ""show"" moments instead of ""tell"" ones."
FlashTV,3cn28q,Sunset_Tea,3,Fri Jul 10 04:09:29 2015 UTC,My reaction when Iris is on screen.
FlashTV,3cn28q,CreepyClown,7,Fri Jul 10 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"Both Flash and Arrow has this issue of excessive ""modern strong women vibe "". I do understand it's very important to respect women and not treat them as merely servant / inferior to the male characters. But I think the writers went to the wrong direction. For example felicity in season 3 of arrow seems to be manipulative and plays ""chose the man "" way too often, she breaks up with Oliver / ray whenever she feels like it and in the same time could easily hook up with either of them, the guys has no say or control over it whatsoever. And Iris is the same way,she is allowed to meet the flash in secret, act immaturely, Sabotage Barry and Linda but in the end, the men in her life must be the ones that apologizes."
FlashTV,3cn28q,thenottoserious,5,Thu Jul 9 14:51:36 2015 UTC,I think CW writers just struggle to write a decent love interest.
FlashTV,3cn28q,thabe331,3,Thu Jul 9 17:56:31 2015 UTC,"Not just the CW, too many shows/movies nowadays put too much emphasizes on the main character earn the love of someone. But in reality sometimes the most important part of a relationship is when you decide to break up/move on/decide it's not worth it. ""One and only true love"" is complete bullshit, it's just sex hormones+fantasies+wanting someone."
FlashTV,3cn28q,thenottoserious,3,Fri Jul 10 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"It's more than that. On CW shows it feels like too often they make the love interest of the main character someone to just bounce things off of to challenge the protagonist. For the first quarter of Flash this was how Iris felt, like she didn't really have her own motivations and that she was just there to challenge Barry."
FlashTV,3cn28q,thabe331,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:27:23 2015 UTC,Then in the second half she suddenly changed her motives and started to challenge Eddie. Maybe that is how she shows she loves someone?
FlashTV,3cn28q,thenottoserious,2,Fri Jul 10 15:02:09 2015 UTC,"In the second half she began having her own motivations, it started when she began working for the newspaper. It was at that point when I stopped loathing her character because she had something happening within the story. She started off investigating the Flash and then began looking into Mason's disappearance and the cause of the metahumans. Which oddly enough she seemed to be the only character on the show outside of the main cast doing that.  Her anger at everyone hiding barry's secret from her was justified too"
FlashTV,3cn28q,thabe331,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:05:53 2015 UTC,"The whole lie to Iris thing is annoying too,it's understandable she is mad.the only time she pissed me off in the second half was when she ruined a fancy dinner and didn't even try to falter her irritability in front of ray and Felicity (both of whom that has nothing to do with the drama she started )."
FlashTV,3cn28q,thenottoserious,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:12:05 2015 UTC,Oh yeah that scene was annoying. Also because it felt like the writers didn't come up with a believable reason for why she's so irritated even at the end of the episode
FlashTV,3cn28q,thabe331,2,Fri Jul 10 15:19:29 2015 UTC,"If I'm Eddie I would literally be so pissed at Iris and break up with her right after leaving the dinner. That was a great turn off,especially Iris was the one being rude and irrational, I feel so sorry for Ray,Felicity and Barry, especially Ray.... he is rich and all but that was still a respectable amount of money spent just to see his new ""friends "" leaving early and throw tantrums."
FlashTV,3cn28q,thenottoserious,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:29:13 2015 UTC,Eddie was way too good of a person. I'm wondering if he'll return some point in the future or not.
FlashTV,3cn28q,thabe331,3,Fri Jul 10 16:03:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like the writers failed to write strong women-Iris and Felicity (who used to be awesome many seasons ago) are constantly crying and whiny and bitchy and demanding and irrationally emotional given the circumstances-stereotypical ""female traits"". Both characters were so out of line so many times. When Iris dumped Eddie because he couldn't share the details of his police homicide investigations with her, a civilian, I was like, COME ON. And if someone has to go off and save the world, it's pretty darn selfish to be like ""No, don't go, I'll never forgive you for leaving me."" Also the fact that both characters' arcs were defined by their love lives, which was really disappointing esp for Felicity, who used to be a badass member of the Arrow team in her own right, to go from being defined by her own talents to getting demoted to a ""girl whose destiny rests on which guy she chooses."""
FlashTV,3cn28q,introverted-mess,3,Thu Jul 9 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"I think they confused strong women with teenage girls, strong with selfishness and independence with indifference. I mean instead of working with Oliver and Barry like they were supposed to, felicity and iris sometimes straight out work against the heroes. For example Oliver: ""I want to save my sister, we have to do this"", Felicity : ""NO,NO,I break up with you and NO"", Barry:""I know you are angry with Eddie,but this is why he was acting weird"", Iris:""DON'T CARE, ultimatum"". I mean when Oliver and Barry are being jackasses it's completely alright to call them out,but as a ""love interest"" they can be alittle more sympathic and supportive. Instead of being a drama queen about dishonesty, iris might try to understand all the dangers Barry and Joe put themselves through just to keep her and everybody safe, same with felicity,instead of being self righteous all the time she should actually just trust Oliver every now and then. Daredevil did it right with Karen Page."

FlashTV,3cqqsd,Biggorons_Blade,3,Fri Jul 10 04:30:27 2015 UTC,This feels extremely uncomfortably like she's hinting at the Flarrow directors to play the live-action version of Vixen on the shows. Mostly because I've never heard of Vixen being a part of the Suicide Squad. I could be wrong though.
FlashTV,3cqqsd,xHovercraft,6,Fri Jul 10 04:15:12 2015 UTC,"Well they've already casted a Vixen VA, I assume she'll be Vixen in any live action appearances in the DCW."

FlashTV,3ckxi9,TheAkashicRecord,3,Thu Jul 9 02:26:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because they're using the current one since filming JUST started. If it's like the Arrow costume, the leather loosens up over time so it probably wouldn't look right if they used one of Grant's older worn out costumes. And the current one would be used for filming. They probably had the white one lying around so they put up for display. I'm just grasping at straws here."
FlashTV,3ckxi9,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Wed Jul 8 22:21:45 2015 UTC,"A decent theory but they have most of the shows costimes on display(firestorm, malcom, Rf, arrow, arsenal, black canary, and cold) and I honestly think they're just replicas."
FlashTV,3ckxi9,mmemmetee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:25:23 2015 UTC,ah they do make many copies for the show. because they get trashed or fall apart.
FlashTV,3ckxi9,neoblackdragon,2,Thu Jul 9 04:20:25 2015 UTC,"They probably had the white one lying around   Why would they have a white one lying around though? He's never actually worn one on the show, it's only appeared in CGI."
FlashTV,3ckxi9,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:02:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, was it? I didn't know that. I've only watched the season through mediocre live streaming.

FlashTV,3ckxi9,Karisma_not_Karma,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:46:32 2015 UTC,The symbol is not permanently attached to the suit. It's like the first episode. They can easily make a white circle and stick it on. It's possible that they created one but didn't like it for shooting. Fast forward to this con and they stuck it on.  OR  Since they are filming again. They had the new symbol made and stuck it on the display.   Point is it's not a difficult part to add and remove.
FlashTV,3ckxi9,MainlyPardoo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:52:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was hard to add/remove, just that they likely wouldn't just have one lying around because it was never used in filming. At least not in Season 1. I don't think they would have had one created last year either as the initial draft of the pilot script described the differences in the suit between what he wears and what's in the newspaper photo."

FlashTV,3ckxi9,pic2022,0,Wed Jul 8 22:27:03 2015 UTC,It makes more sense they are displaying a suit/suits that have few scenese as they are starting to film season 2 right now... which means they probably weren't willing to ship off the costumes that they need for production.

FlashTV,3cpo9a,Momo0503,4,Thu Jul 9 19:48:58 2015 UTC,The real Harrison Wells also created a particle accelerator in 2020. It's implied that it accidently exploded and caused The Flash.
FlashTV,3cpo9a,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,5,Thu Jul 9 19:59:00 2015 UTC,Actually I think Eobard said that the original PA launched successfully.
FlashTV,3cpo9a,TheChaosController,3,Thu Jul 9 20:46:05 2015 UTC,"He did say that and I believed until the finale that the PA served another purpose and Barry originally got his powers from just lightning/chemicals but nothing ever was said to indicate that. Maybe ""success"" has a different meaning for Eobard as it helped create the Flash."
FlashTV,3cpo9a,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,6,Thu Jul 9 20:49:07 2015 UTC,I think it was successful. Eobard made it fail the first time. I think Barry always becomes the Flash on that night and Eobard had the accelerator go off at the exact same time to get an insert into Barry's life.
FlashTV,3cpo9a,neoblackdragon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:18:52 2015 UTC,That was my initial theory as well and what I still want to be true but they made no indications that was the case in the episodes after ep17.
FlashTV,3cpo9a,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:03:26 2015 UTC,Honestly we know next to nothing about the original timeline.
FlashTV,3cpo9a,neoblackdragon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  Its too coincidental that Thawne could set it off 5 years early and unsuccessfully, yet still turn Barry into the Flash.  Logic dictates the accelerator and Barry's powers be seperate events that simply happened at the same time due to Thawne's involvement."
FlashTV,3cpo9a,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:55:42 2015 UTC,I think the 'successfully launched' line just  meant that the original Harrison Wells just got the Accelerator built and managed to turn it on or the PA exploded at a later date after the launch. Either way the Accelerator launch had to have caused the metahumans in both timelines otherwise Eobard wouldn't have been so set on it.

FlashTV,3cm9r3,Aexil,6,Thu Jul 9 11:28:12 2015 UTC,It's possible Gideon didn't know who he was...  After the DNA switch Gideon may have only known him as Wells and may have only known of his plans what he told her.

FlashTV,3cihx8,bcheetz,-9,Thu Jul 9 01:09:15 2015 UTC,That's just the armored suit for when he fights superman for some stupid reason they are going with the idea that armor can takes supes punches and survive but he'll probably have a non bulky traditional bat suit for the team up part of the movie.
FlashTV,3cihx8,ProstetnicVogon,16,Wed Jul 8 06:21:25 2015 UTC,"If you have ever read ""The Dark Knight Returns"" it made a lot of sense. His armor took some blows but Batman usually avoids and counters Supe's attacks."

FlashTV,3cihx8,TripJammer,14,Wed Jul 8 06:42:51 2015 UTC,He does use kryptonite. Watch The Dark Knight Returns animated movies if you don't want to read the comic. The movies are phenomenal.
FlashTV,3cihx8,NK1337,3,Wed Jul 8 07:03:25 2015 UTC,"All gadgets aside, the main reason batman stood a chance against superman is because Bats knows superman doesn't want to kill. That means he pulls his punches and holds back in general.     Batman exploits this by using the armor that can absorb more damage than superman expects, so when supes throws his punches Batman can actually take a lot more punishment that superman was expecting.     With that in mind, batman uses a lot of dirty tactics that catch superman unaware. But don't Be fooled, if superman were actually out for blood he could just as easily year batman apart like paper. But even until the end, superman holds back for fear of hurting someone. It's a fact that batman exploits."
FlashTV,3cihx8,HighRulerStarch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:28:47 2015 UTC,"In this movie though, does Batman see Superman as someone who doesn't kill?  He killed thousands in the last movie.  Batman can't exploit that if he doesn't know for sure."
FlashTV,3cihx8,Vwyx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:14:50 2015 UTC,"I think in the movie Batman sees Superman as somebody powerful but careless. I think he still knows that Clark wants to be the good guy and is probably banking on him pulling his punches again, especially after what happened. But it probably will come down to Bats thinking Superman has TOO much power, and no control."

FlashTV,3cmjb9,pwrusr,10,Thu Jul 9 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"Debatable.  Recorded by Star labs? Mach 3  But the first time he time traveled he went at LEAST that fast.  There's also the time he pulled Joe out of the car before the lightning traveled 2 feet... Which would require some math, but is DAMN fast."
FlashTV,3cmjb9,Todrick,8,Thu Jul 9 02:05:28 2015 UTC,"Ok well according to google, the average lightning bolt travels at 224,000 mph.  Converted to feet per second, that would be 328,533.33 ft/sec, let's round that down to 328,533 ft/sec.  Barry grabs Joe when the lightning is about 2 feet above him, and gets him about 20 feet away from the car in the time it would have taken the lightning to kill Joe.  Moving at 224,000 mph, the lightning would travel 2 feet in approximately .000006 seconds. So in .000006 seconds, you can say Barry traveled 20 feet. This is ten times faster than the lightning, which would put Barry at having moved 2,240,000 mph. The speed of sound is about 761.21 mph... Putting Barry at Mach 2942, or 2942 times the speed of sound.  Compared to what Barry normally runs, this seems RIDICULOUSLY fast, but compared to how fast Barry can technically run (because of SpeedForce or some shit) in the comics, it is only scratching the surface.  I get this because Barry can run faster than the speed of light in the comics, which, according to Google, is approximately 671,000,000 mph, which is about 299.1 times faster than what Barry ran.  So I think this is the fastest Barry has run in the series, the only time I can think of him possibly running faster would be when he went back in time while trying to stop the tsunami, but that isn't something that can be calculated.  If there is anything wrong with the math feel free to correct me I just went through this quick because I was curious.    TL;DR: Barry ran DAMN fast when he saved Joe from the lightning."
FlashTV,3cmjb9,Ackerack,2,Thu Jul 9 16:50:52 2015 UTC,"Hah!  Thanks... I knew that scene meant he traveled WAY faster than they had said... I was just too lazy to do the math.  Mach 2,942  That's the new benchmark  LOL"
FlashTV,3cmjb9,Todrick,4,Thu Jul 9 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, going through that actually was really fun as I knew it would be fast, but when I got that final Mach number I had to go back and double check because it seemed out of control.  And then realizing that he travels hundreds of times faster than that in the comics?   What the fuck Barry?   http://i.imgur.com/A6YZX82.gifv"

FlashTV,3ck2tb,SleeplessNightz,20,Wed Jul 8 15:03:01 2015 UTC,"I always thought that scene was fucking stupid. There was no reason for Clark's dad to go do it, Clark could have easily went, released the dog, and came back at a normal human speed without looking spectacular. And Clark could have easily went and picked up his dad and came back at slightly more than normal speed, but no one would have really noticed.   I get why it happened, and get his dad's ""THE WORLDS NOT READY"" mindset, but this was just a pointless death for the sake of a tragedy."
FlashTV,3ck2tb,epraider,5,Wed Jul 8 15:46:32 2015 UTC,"I actually love MoS, but it's definitely the worst scene in the movie."

FlashTV,3ck2tb,xx420-3Kush5Me-420xx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:43:30 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on it are that if Clark did go instead of Jonathan the dog still would have been spooked and hid under the seat, except when the tornado blew the car on top of them I don't think Clark would have instinctively acted in fear and jumped down like his dad did, because he knew he couldn't be harmed so there's a good chance he'd use his powers there in some form whether on purpose or just taking the hit of the truck. And the only reason his dad went was the chance of that happening (likely during a storm but worth the risk for you son) and everyone seeing. And also John couldn't have known that the dog was going to be scared or the truck would come down either, he wasn't going in to sacrifice himself that's just the way it played out. Having him walking over slightly faster than normal to pick him up would be a ""fucking stupid scene"". You have to realize that these aren't parents that are raising superman, not to them, they make it very clear that he's their son to them in the human sense and want to protect him from the bad in the world, because ultimately Clarks life isn't something they can really grasp or control, all they can do is love him like he's their own."
FlashTV,3ck2tb,GreenBlueSeduce,0,Thu Jul 9 14:10:20 2015 UTC,"Careful with this logical and poignant way of thinking; I called this out on a MoS thread in /r/movies and was downvoted into oblivion for saying this was complete BS on the writing. I get that this is Synder's version of Superman and that he is allowed to take some liberties with his story-telling; I get that, but what I don't get is why they didn't go the traditional route and have Clark save his dad; only for him to still die. THAT is supposed to cement the fact that no matter how fast or strong or smart Clark is; he can't save everyone.  I would have loved it if Clark used his super-speed; saved his pops from the tornado, and still had to have him die in his arms from a heart attack. Again, some things just can't be saved and this would have established that."
FlashTV,3ck2tb,name-classified,3,Thu Jul 9 17:10:06 2015 UTC,"Beautiful scenes... I could see another parallel scene one day: Clark and Zod in the train station and, ultimately, Barry killing Eobard. Barry would realise it's the only way to stop him. He'd need a lot of character development first sure but with the glimpse of future Barry in prison in the S1 finale, it could actually happen. Comics agree too."
FlashTV,3ck2tb,Airsay58259,2,Wed Jul 8 15:45:21 2015 UTC,That would actually be incredible
FlashTV,3ck2tb,TheMurderCapitalist,3,Wed Jul 8 23:27:27 2015 UTC,"I think people give MOS too much flack. Sure the death scene could have been way better but people need to remember this is a ""realistic"" portrayal of superman and his mythos. Jonathan was being the best dad he could be and didn't want his son to be some kind of hero he just wanted him to be happy and was torn because there isn't exactly an instruction manual for raising a super kid. Also in that scene Clark is a teen but they didn't use the teen actor for some odd reason which takes away from its effect as he didn't have his super speed yet."
FlashTV,3ck2tb,strongandweak,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:49:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I'd like to think that Clark would have had the initiative to run over at normal man pace, pick up the dog and his dad and run back over at normal man pace.  He's already built like a brick shithouse. It's not too far a stretch that he could manage helping his dad and a dog back to the overpass.   I do love Man of Steel, this scene just really bothered me."
FlashTV,3ck2tb,XMenOrangesTangerine,9,Thu Jul 9 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS, I GUESS: Sorry, but there's nothing heartbreaking about Jonathan Kent's death in Man of Steel. Kent was a misguided fool. He gives Clark bad advice every time he speaks. ""Don't use your powers. Let people die. Go be a good person, but don't be a hero."" What kind of father says that? Also, his death was totally avoidable. A human life is more valuable than a dog's life. Don't risk your life to save a dog so you can just give up and let a tornado eat you! Ya bloody idiot! Clark could've saved him easily and yeah, his cover would've been blown, but he didn't seem to mind keeping a secret identity at the truck stop diner or the oil rig. Yeah, those were a little more discrete and not around people he'd grown up around, but why do it like that, Supes? The best Part Kent death is one that makes Clark realize that he isn't all-poweful and that he can't save everyone. Look at the Christopher Reeve Superman. He couldn't save Pa Kent because he had a heart attack. Supes can dodge bullets and catch planes, but has no power to stop a heart attack. Man of Steel Kent sucks and is an awful person and probably just used a tornado as an excuse to not deal with the responsibility of being Father of Superman. Rant over."
FlashTV,3ck2tb,BoqRottom,10,Wed Jul 8 15:43:59 2015 UTC,"He never said let people die. He said maybe. That's important. Because he's not sure about what Clark should do. He knows Clark is doing the right thing but he wants to protect his son. He knows that once the world finds out about him, his life will pretty much be over. People are going to be terrified of him and they're going to try to hurt and kill him. And some day someone is going to succeed. You say he's an awful person but is there something wrong with wanting to protect your son at all costs (even if that means other people might have to die)?  And the reason why he didn't save his father but saved the people on the oil rig is because the oil rig was much later. He didn't save his father because he wanted to honor his wishes (not because he was scared). But later on he realized he couldn't live his life like that."

Honestly, though, outside of the mild continuity issues imposed by their appearance in Blackest Night, I honestly kind of liked their appearance in the series, but only because we actually got to see them together again. However, I was NOT happy that they didn't bring them back as White Lanterns. Seriously. WHY NOT??? Easy way to fix how badly their lives were messed up by Identity Crisis! Ugh. I really hate Identity Crisis for what they did to them. And for other reasons.  I'm really hoping that, in Legends of Tomorrow, Hawkgirl makes a reference to the in-universe movie Nighthawk and Cinnamon. In the comics, the latest incarnations of Hawkman and Hawkgirl sometimes remember their past lives with each other, so hopefully she has some opinions on the movie in the show.

FlashTV,3cd2hh,HollowmanNapkin,11,Tue Jul 7 15:00:34 2015 UTC,No clue. Just speculations but something about the actors needing to look younger would be my best guess. Most of the actors on CW tend to be attractive and look young.
FlashTV,3cd2hh,Rwings,8,Tue Jul 7 15:05:28 2015 UTC,Except when you are playing the King of Hell. See Mark Sheppard's beard for when he plays Crowley.
FlashTV,3cd2hh,thesequimkid,6,Tue Jul 7 18:20:31 2015 UTC,He wasn't added to the cast until 5 seasons in and it was a minor reoccurring role. I think the beard rule was for main cast first season kind of thing.
FlashTV,3cd2hh,Rwings,10,Tue Jul 7 18:23:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I think CW should really scrap the rule. Sometimes a beard adds more personality to a character."

We don't know if it's the same universe (based on certain things in Supergirl, it would probably require some retconning / writing around some conflicts for it to be the same, or making use of the multiverse concept).  There was some speculation about some things that may or may not have been in Berlanti's contract saying that crossovers can happen, but none of that is confirmed or even solid (despite some sites presenting that almost as fact). The source on that speculation was this interview with Guggenheim http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/agent-carter-showrunners-grilled-by-759932, where I think a lot of people may have took the ""It's possible"" as, yes, that's definitely possible / allowed and can / will happen, when in reality it was more of ""it's a possibility, that maybe it could happen, depending on certain things"", and then the reporter saying they have ""heard"" it's in Berlanti's deal, which seems kind of flimsy, but could turn out to be true (but that would be weird considering that CBS seems to have control over whether or not that can happen)."

FlashTV,3chtoo,Flarow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:17:43 2015 UTC,"There is nothing in this article that sources anything solid at all. Most likely the article that they are using as a source (http://heroicuniverse.com/rumor-mill-superman-speeds-onto-the-flash-next-season/) are basing their speculations on the earlier rumours about Tom Welling appearing as Superman that are almost for sure false (source http://www.kryptonsite.com/that-tom-welling-on-the-flash-story-not-true/).  If any show was going to have Superman on it, it would be Supergirl (and he is briefly mentioned but isn't really going to be on that show). I don't think WB would even let them use Superman on The Flash (unless Supergirl does for sure end up tying into the CWverse, and they loosen up allowing superman on TV, and they do it in a way that makes sense, which may be hard considering in Supergirl Superman already exists and is established and has obviously never been mentioned in the CWverse).  Plus, ignoring all (true or not) rumors, am I the only one that thinks it would be really weird for Tom Welling to reprise this role, in a completely different universe? I liked him enough, but it would take me completely out of it, and I don't want that (and I really think WB/DC probably feels that way as well).  Maybe if they do it using the Multiverse, I would be ok. But I still don't see this happening any time soon (as much as I'd like all the big DC characters to show up in this universe, if it made sense)"

FlashTV,3cdn9b,Pwnagez,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:06:34 2015 UTC,"He's most certainly talking about the cowl coming up to the chin. It's the first thing I noticed too. Look at any of Cap's suits from the other movies. Then look at the one from The Avengers that Coulson designed. It has a neck like Barry's suit unlike the others.   It looks a little strange, but if you see him with the cowl drawn back (like in the I Understood That Reference/Galaga) scene, it looks fine.  People usually chalk it up to poor costume design but it's intentional. The people of New York need a symbol, not just a soldier."
FlashTV,3cay5b,Conbz,132,Mon Jul 6 14:16:17 2015 UTC,"Realistically I don't think it can happen. With characters like Superman, Flash, Green Lantern it's really hard to do because of how much power they have.   The only way I could see it going down is similar to the TV show.   Flash starts with not a ton of power and maybe over time you build a speed force meter that let's you tap into it and use his full powers."
FlashTV,3cay5b,the_oogie_boogie_man,70,Mon Jul 6 15:15:32 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. The same formula that makes the Arkham games and Shadow of Mordor works would be great for either a Daredevil or Arrow game, but I think the superpowered superheroes are tough to do in an action game.   With The Flash, either the character would have to be so fast it'd be unplayable, or the action would be so slow it wouldn't feel like he was fast at all.   Maybe throw him in to a game where you plot your actions in advance and then see them play out, similar to Transistor?"
FlashTV,3cay5b,troytleart,53,Mon Jul 6 15:23:36 2015 UTC,I'd love a Daredevil game like this. Detective mode is just his super senses. Literally just re-skin Arkham City into Hell's Kitchen.   But yeah with super super powered people either you destroy everyone or you just feel unpowered.

FlashTV,3cay5b,ReverseFlashBot,5,Tue Jul 7 02:34:17 2015 UTC,"Shadows of Mordor could be reskinned to be a green arrow game, the arrows would have different versions and you would use a system to how in the witcher 3, how Geralt switches his signs for the trick arrows, have an explosive arrow, Flash bang type arrows, tracking arrows, which those arrows have a certain amount of so the character doesn't become too OP. Then have unlimited arrows for the normal ones. Have the skill trees focus on types of arrows, how long time will slow down when initially  shooting the arrow,  (Like how shadows of Mordor does it) strength s of attack depending on what bow is used, drawback time depending on what bow is used. Instead of a grappling hook, have grappling arrows, and have the buildings in most areas close enough, that parkour could be done to keep momentum. And story could follow something close to season 1 of arrow, when it was more focused on the List, so similar to the nemesis system, you have your 5-6 different people at the top, and then have the street level gangs replaceable with someone. That's how I think a  Green Arrow game could work.  daredevil is more tricky cause the main thing about him is that he's blind, and very aware of his surroundings. What it could do is have the world be views as normal, because the blind radar like system (idk what to call it)  that Daredevil has, is hard to portray in a fast paced action game. The Detective mode could be used for when enemies are behind walls and you would use it similar to how the last of us used its enhanced senses. It could also be used to help decide if info people he interrogates is truth or not.  Those are just some ideas I have on a daredevil game. Because you don't want him to just be a carbon copy of the Arkham games.   The Flash could use movement similar to Infamous: Second Son or Infamous: First Light with the Neon powers, and it could have a skill tree that you can use to increase you speed. And maybe some moves would be unlocked via a skill tree.  And for the more powerful moves they could be tied to a combo meter and you would have to use certain buttons to execute them. Maybe even have a ""speed force meter"" you have to fill up and when you do it acts similar to what the force unleashed did where you become immensely overpowered for a short period of time."
FlashTV,3cay5b,Darkenedsilence,4,Mon Jul 6 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"With The Flash, either the character would have to be so fast it'd be unplayable, or the action would be so slow it wouldn't feel like he was fast at all.   It would be like Arkham during a free flow combo only faster. Might as well be hitting dummies."

FlashTV,3cay5b,ButtnakedSoviet,3,Mon Jul 6 18:36:11 2015 UTC,Thats ridiculous. Theyd just have to make bad ass bad guys. I would love a flash and or lantern game. Green lantern would be so good for games because you can go anywhere and have real unique level design. Dc universe showed in a small way whats possible. Take that mixed with the production of arkahm and im sold.  Video games are the perfect medium for exploring crazy powers.
FlashTV,3cay5b,Thanos821,3,Mon Jul 6 23:18:18 2015 UTC,That's why no game will ever have a good magic system. GL can make literally anything he can think of. How do you code that? Any sort of open ended magic system will never live up to the expectation because of the work needed to plot out the possible actions. The closest you'll probably ever get is something like Magicka where you just get a lot of spell combos.

I'd liked I see the Flash's combat similar to the Spider-sense in the Amazing Spider-man games. Slightly fast punching, with a little speed force pop up warning you of incoming attacks. They did that in the Arkham games, but I don't think the enemies slowed down when it happened."

FlashTV,3cay5b,JusticeLeagueThomas,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:38:52 2015 UTC,"This isn't necessarily true. Envision this. A Large full scale game with the scale of a Grand Theft Auto/Spider Man 2 game city.  The game is given to you in first person in a similar fashion to Dishonored. You are given a limited skill wheel that allows you to fire off rather specific flash skills or even slow down time as your reflexes speed up so that you can do really cool things. Perhaps save people from a car crash, or catch someone falling from a building. Etc etc etc.  Your speed doesn't actually have a cap. The longer you are moving, the faster you climb in speed. The further you are into the game, the more precise you can control that speed with the triggers. One of the outside of story game modes will be Barry on the race strip with an obstacle course set up with a never ending strip of obstacles, and Barry has no brakes(Testing your reaction speed as Barry's speed scales infinitely outside of player control).  The game then becomes one about skill and being able to control Barry's speed. Then with managing Barry's max speed, on his speed wheel as he moves faster and generates more speed force he has a limited amount of times where he can slow down time to react quicker to oncoming obstacles.  Then finally place in the game a complex physics system that keeps in mind the speed Barry is traveling at, and his surroundings, then allow the player the freedom to figure out how to handle the encounters (Like Dishonored). However then have challenges similar to Dishonored such as (Beat the game without injuring Civilians. Apprehend every criminal. Etc etc etc)  On another note, I have not played Dishonored personally, I have merely seen a bit of gameplay. However what I have seen is that it is a game that very adequately displays a difference between capable mechanics, and individual player skill.  Some players will struggle and will skate by on Barry's speed and barely defeat his enemies as he is continually hit by Captain Cold's beams. Then there are other players out there who will truly embrace the speed and the mechanics to run circles around his opponents while saving a girl falling off a bridge.  Then inevitably with a game set up in that fashion we will see the true experts come forward whose reaction speeds are truly great and they will showcase a speed run of a game that truly encompasses everything the Flash is really about.  This is what I would love to see from a Flash game. A game with limitless gameplay/skill potential if you practice your abilities. This to me is what sums up Barry Allen. With a great physics engine and an awareness of surroundings. (EX: Breaking the sound barrier in densely populated areas can be detrimental to the civilian population. Or perhaps trying to run across the city at near infinite speeds end up creating a Barry VS Lex Luthor level fissure across the streets of Central city.)  Now finally. I am not an advocate of DLC. However if there were going to be a DLC, I would make it that the game records your movement just like Mirror's Edge time trials. Then you play as Zoom trying to sabotage Barry's plans, and perhaps save the villains and defeat your shadow before Barry can do that. (Perhaps you could be the Black Flash instead. Either or)  I believe laying down good ground work for a first game will then allow a second game to be developed that will really get to abuse the character's speed by doing something similar to The Crew where the game's environment spans the United States.  Although this is just simply ideas, and by no means a definitive game."
FlashTV,3cay5b,Dreamlancer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:41:45 2015 UTC,If anyone have played the viewtiful joe games. Joe (the main character) He can speed himself up (faster punches/kicks/special move) while he slows down time both at once to beat the enemies. So yeah..it can work.  Give it to Platinum Games since they are the king of action games. Any game made by that team gives crazy action/combo orientated game. Platinum Games can handle the combo/fighting system while WB do the writing of the story.
FlashTV,3cay5b,hellsbellltrudy,162,Tue Jul 7 02:22:28 2015 UTC,It would involve running

FlashTV,3cay5b,actuallychrisgillen,11,Mon Jul 6 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'd love it. Arkham Knight already has a faster travel with the Batmobile and DC Universe Online has a super speed option, so it can be done. Also the super speed translating into slowing down time would work really well. Perhaps have speed force be a rechargeable bar that allows you pop into and out of in combat.   Of course, I'd hope tonally, they'd follow the lighter sillier aspects of the Flash as opposed to turning him into the Dark Knight with super speed."
FlashTV,3cay5b,level32,11,Mon Jul 6 16:53:58 2015 UTC,"I had a Flash-like character on DC Universe Online. It was pretty fun. I haven't played in a long time though. I could run up buildings and stuff. When running on the streets, if you jumped on an overhanging traffic light, you'd run around the pole. If timed right, you could launch off it very far. Sometimes I'd fall through the ground into oblivion though. I think it would be doable... just need to adjust some of the physics so you don't break the environment colission.

FlashTV,3cay5b,MordorTroll,2,Tue Jul 7 20:32:56 2015 UTC,I'd be down for that. Have some sort of solar energy bar that you have to charge up to use your abilities. It drains as you use abilities and charges in sunlight. Then add in some lex contraption blocking out the sun in most areas except some (cloud cover?) and you got yourself a pretty cool game.
FlashTV,3cay5b,JHowrd13,4,Wed Jul 8 00:33:37 2015 UTC,I think the hardest thing to do would be balance making him feel fast but still slowing him down enough to be controllable while still not making everything too slow.

FlashTV,3cay5b,Ungreat,5,Tue Jul 7 03:13:42 2015 UTC,"Flash is 'depowered' and defenceless in some way in an area with tons of bad guys. He gains powers as he goes but must use them sparingly, things like running so fast all enemies freeze or phasing through certain objects.   These powers only last for short bursts as the connection to the speed force is limited and unlocking them allows you to complete the various puzzles to unlock newer areas of whatever place you are in.   The enemy is someone siphoning off speedforce and this is why your powers are broken."
FlashTV,3cay5b,SirBenfro,3,Mon Jul 6 21:07:56 2015 UTC,"I always imagine having a similar free-running experience to Prototype, which, if you've never played it, basically involves holding a button to automatically vault obstacles, or run up walls. It'd be interesting to see how fast you could make it while still having control, but you could have a few layers of speed, so that you could go for max speed, but less control, or more control but less speed.  I think it might just be feasible for an Arkham like combat system, where instead of countering, you focus more on evading punches, so you'd basically mash x, but enemies tend to swing wildly, requiring you to maybe consider not attacking someone, or moving round to a new angle to attack them."

There'd probably need to be a plot device, like your connection to the Speed Force has been limited, so you'd start out only being able to move moderately faster than everyone else, and have a Speedforce bar that you need to fill up.  But basically, all combat would start off as melee, with the Speedforce in effect showing as everyone else slowing down.  Then you'd unlock abilities as you go.  It'd have to be a real colorful game to contract with the Arkham series.  With lots of insane levels (like travelling through the Speedforce, through time to the future and back, Mirror Master's universe, etc).  Third person would work well also.  Kind of like the Spider-man games with a free roaming city.  Ability to run up buildings.  Combo chain attacks.  Lots of Speedforce powered enemies.  And of course, random citizens in trouble that need The Flash to save them (using the slow down/Speedforce ability to pull them out of crashing cars or stop a bank robbery, run someone to the hospital).  I think it could be a lot of fun with unlockable costumes of various Speedsters."
FlashTV,3cay5b,macklemold,2,Mon Jul 6 17:30:01 2015 UTC,"basically you'd have to do it from the Flash's POV so you wouldn't actually see him as a steak like we are used to  I imagine it would be like this, you press a button and and basically time stops or turns into a crawl and you can walk around and interact with things and re-arrange things while everything else is just hanging in the air. like that scene in the newest X-men film/  the challenge might be more around saving people in the middle of something happening   When you are experiencing time at the normal speed you might see a yellow streak going by, kick yourself into hyperspeed mode and the streak will now appear to you as the reserve flash running at normal speed while everyone else around is now pretty much frozen as you chase him and fight him"
FlashTV,3cay5b,munsosl8,2,Mon Jul 6 19:05:34 2015 UTC,"Lots of bullet time in which you move at normal speed.

Here's my pitch (tell me how good it is:)  --The title would be ""The Flash: Year One"". (If they made any sequels they could be ""Year 2"", ""Year 3"", etc.) It would follow Barry during his life as a CSI in the Central City police department. You'd come across villains such as Captain Cold, Mirror Master, Heatwave, and others, but this would be before the Rogues were formed.  --His ring, like New 52, would shoot out pieces of his suit, and you could go from Barry to the Flash in a snap, and vice-versa (ala ""Amazing Spider-Man 2"")  --Why would you need to turn into Barry? To help solve crimes as a CSI. Using something along the lines of the Arkham trilogy's detective mode, you could spot clues and use science to solve crimes that would eventually lead you to the Flash's villains (whom he'd be meeting for the first time).  --Along the way you could stop pety crimes and bank robberies to earn XP and upgrade points. You could also stop villains seperate from the main story (ala ""Most Wanted"" from the Arkham series).  --Because the Flash doesn't use stealth, but rather speed and efficiency to stop crimes, you could have a ""Speed Takedown"", unlike Batman's ""Fear Takedown"".  --Like Infamous: Second Son/First Light, you could slow down time around you to determine your next attacks.  --And like DC Universe Online, your super-speed would be very poweful, but not completely OP, so you could still stick to walls and jump off of buildings.  So there's my Flash video game pitch. How does that sound?"
FlashTV,3cay5b,Keegman_99,3,Tue Jul 7 21:28:30 2015 UTC,"If you ever played Red Dead Redemption, Barry could have a ""dead eye"" mode that marked enemies in a group and super speed takedowns them."
FlashTV,3cay5b,moelester518,2,Tue Jul 7 21:33:17 2015 UTC,That's a cool idea!
FlashTV,3cay5b,moelester518,2,Tue Jul 7 21:55:23 2015 UTC,"This is so late so this post will probably get barry-ed but I think it should take cues from bayonetta. Just over the top storyline with over the top fighting. Like the Arkham games Bayonetta has tight controls and a fun combat system, but Bayonetta also scores you on those fights. Things like combo length, not spamming moves, weapons used, damage taken, damage dealt, etc. Flash should be about style and chasing that high score. A lot like racing games actually.  As for combat I think there should be a varying amount of speedforce and scaling the levels of speedforce using the left and right triggers/R2+L2. More speedforce means time moves slower, and less speedforce means time is moving closer to real time. The pros of time moving slower is reacting to everything better, but the downside would be not being able to do speed related fighting combos and traversing would be basically walking everywhere.  More speed means more prone to error, but more access to combos like wind tornadoes and vibrating through walls. It's all about using various amounts of levels to react and play. Also traverse related stuff be little mini games while freeroaming. Like vibrating through walls would be like the hacking device in batman, running on water is like the revving engine in arkham knight, etc."

For a justice league game,the protagonist should be a less superpowered hero while different abilities/heroes can be used every now and then depends on the situation, with different characters eventually beat their respective villains.

First thing he sees is Wells, and he punches him in his smug time-travelling face. Except wait! We hear Tess flip out in the background when Barry hits Wells, and they’re trying to figure out why Barry is behaving so violently. Must be lightning psychosis.  Overall Story or Major Points/Acts & Ending I think the story will probably pick up exactly where the last one left off, and Barry will enter an alternate timeline where things are just the teensiest bit different because of some major event never having taken place – maybe Eobard Thawne had never come back and taken Dr. Wells’ identity. Maybe the lightning bolt killed Barry. Maybe the accelerator was delayed some, or maybe everything is dramatically different. Oliver is goofy and has that killer goatee, and Batman actually exists.   Cisco After the particle accelerator exploded in this world without Barry as the Flash, Cisco maybe wandered off and joined a gang, like he does in some comics? Maybe he takes up breakdancing? Idc, he just needs to breakdance. He’s starting to remember another life, and at first he thinks they’re fantasies of a straight life in another world where things had been different, but then he sees Barry for the first time and that changes everything. Maybe Barry had begun to forget his timeline too, replacing it with fake memories from this strange new place. But then Cisco reminds him of Iris, who he personally had never met.  Cue montage of Iris stills.  New Powers   Two days ago I discovered that my mind could tap into the speed force just as my body does to run fast. With this ability I could practically stop time and see every variable and calculate every course of action before it happened.   From The Flash #5 2012   Flash Fact! Altostratus clouds are composed of ice crystals. By vibrating his feet in such a way as to extreme, localized updrafts, Flash can attract enough of these crystals to provide just enough substance to run on...for a very short time! [[(Flash can run in the air).]]   From The Flash #26 2014  New Characters Probably not this season, but I would love to see Solovar in whatever season Grodd becomes a big deal. And we need Mirror Master. And Abra Kadabra. And Black Flash.  Miscellaneous I think endgame, I'm holding out hope for a big showdown with the anti Monitor and Barry's sacrifice, looping back into him becoming a lightning bolt and striking himself.  I also hope they tackle the thing where when Barry uses his powers, he loses time. There's an issue where he's zipping around doing his normal hero thing for about an hour, and he loses two minutes, and it starts adding up."

Flashback to the blackhole mess and the entire episode is about explaining how everything is back to ""normal"" with flashbacks and present scenes.  Edit: I know they said S2 would start right where S1 ended but since Arrow will have a ~5 months jump and there will be crossovers, I assume we'll have a time jump as well. Flashbacks are my hope to deal with the blackhole because if it's not I'm afraid they do it quickly (like stopping a tornado?) and then move on to the new stuff.   3) - S2x01 New Character(s) : Patty who sadly will only be there to form a new love triangle while Iris is grieving.  4) - S2 Fall half (Ep 01-10~) arc: I have no idea what the season arc will be so my theories about the characters' arc: Cisco learning more about his abilities (maybe in secret, it depends if they decide they love secrets as much as Arrow does), Barry getting more confident as himself and as the Flash, Caitlin worrying about her future (again, if Barry tells her about it...) and maybe trying to prevent it somehow, Iris' blaming Barry for Eddie's death and growing as a journalist. And of course, Barry's love life. Ronnie? No clue but there's something fishy about him.  6) - Next skill we'll see Barry learn onscreen? How to stop a blackhole.  8) - Anything on crossovers/tie-ins with Arrow or LoT. LOT's villain will come from the blackhole.

Please^please^plz^plz^plz          - I'm curious as to Henry's dialogue in context, because it sounded to me that Dr. Allen is again          on the bubble, potentially out of Iron Heights and therefore both he and Barry are getting          media attention.**_   2) - S2x01 Overall Story or Major Points/Acts & Ending:  Y  -Multiverse confirmed  Y -Multiple Speedsters confirmed     -Barry has some kind of residual issue from time in Speedforce.    -Cisco does some MacGyvering to the visor/equip and Hartley's gloves in an attempt to find Barry.    -Ronnie finds that his Firestorm matrix connection isn't working like it should due to the shock from the        generators in 1x23.     -A clear statement on how timelines =/= universe. (I don't think that people are 100% clear that all of the        timelines that Barry participated in during S1 were all on Earth-1)   3) - S2x01 New Character(s)  Y - Patty, Joe's new partner/Barry fangirl  Y - Jay Garrick (and Joan, his wife)   - Grant Emerson/Damage   -Jason Rausch (Firestorm Matrix, potential recasting)   -Firehawk.   4) - S2 Fall half (Ep 01-10~) arc  Y - Suffering and result of the Loss of characters from S1  - Citywide Anger at S.T.A.R.Labs again, closure of facility.   - Transfer of Team Flash HQ to Mercury Labs at invite of Tina.   Y   - Dealing with knowledge and info about timelines/multiverse, morality of moving                 between them/allowing traffic between, etc.  Y    -Upgrade/rebuild costumes, tech, HQ.  Y/N   -Learn about Vandal Savage and his allies. Garrick brings warning of Bads.  5) - Tom Cavanaugh's S2 character?  ~~ -Dr. Wells, no Reverse Flash or deceit.~~  Y    -Eobard Thawne from Earth-2 / Paradox version, no Dr. Wells, again Reverse Flash.   6) - Next skill we'll see Barry learn onscreen?   - Speed Mirage and Probability Filtering are both ones I can see coming in to play this season.       - I'll add Any-Finger Death Wiggle (mini-tornado creation and/or Phasestrike) to the pot, too.   -After further thought and watching all the SDCC stuff I could, I'll go ahead and toss out Give/Steal Speed             on the table for the back half of the season.* .*  In an interview, Gustin mentioned that the new abilit(ies) Barry learns are lightning-based.  -The cast also mentioned the 'Sherlock-vision' that appeared in 1x01 and 1x02 was something they liked           and want to see return. I'd previously wrote about this in another thread, saying that the text/line overlay           (or CSEyeTM) could be a great lead-in to show 'Flashsight' in which Flash determines dangers,            probabilities, etc. CSEye could be plain white, serif-typeface and Flashsight could be a few colors to            differentiate between People, Weapons, Projectiles, Action Set or even do a fade with only the dangers           remaining in bright color, possibly outlined. I'm really hoping they work this back in..  7) - Anything directly with a current character.  Y  -Cisco's discovery of his meta-abilities will be private and frightening. He won't talk to Team Flash          about what Thawells told him until it's way serious and/or they see him do something Vibe-y. His           abilities might be depicted like Skye/Quake's on AoS (visually as distorting ripples emitted from his hands)          and he may adapt Pied Piper's gauntlets to be more helpful for his condition. The biological changes they          referred to at SDCC sound like it's more of a mental confusion, but a physical aspect could appear with           his projections. No confirmation on breakdancing, but considering Vibe's agility, I could see an intro of           some kind of 'dancing' or footwork (boxing, fencing, something more martial artsy) to help in the field.    8) - Anything on crossovers/tie-ins with Arrow or LoT.   -Phantom Stranger.    9) - Misc. speculation on anything you'd like, but please specify.  Y/N     - Vandal Savage is on Earth-2 when Barry arrives. When Barry moves to return to Earth-1, Vandal is                      able to replicate the technique or put a 'doorstop' in whatever portal is formed between Multiverses.                 **Sounds like Jay Garrick will warn Barry about the Big Bad/Bitty Bads, is aware that they Bads are                    from Earth-2/Multiverse^Random^Earth and aware that the Bads are or will on their way.**     Y/N     -Henry Allen is released from prison.                    Sounds like Henry will be released this season, but it hasn't been hard confirmed.    ****Depending on what we hear/see from SDCC, I'll update or edit my post accordingly.  Edited post SDCC with several things."

He hasn't been mentioned since then that I remember. Canon-wise, the best person to teach him Speedster stuff would be Max Mercury or Jay Garrick. Otherwise, I can see them just writing in lines that mention Barry going to Starling City to train/spar with Team Arrow.   7) was just a 'fill in the blank' so people could write about whichever Team Flash/CCPD/Rogue character they wanted, instead of me typing out all of the names (and risking forgetting someone). :)  8) - Afaik, they've planned to do a 2-part crossover each Season, but now with Legends of Tomorrow starting in the Spring, I see more show interaction (cross-dialogue, phone calls, name drops) and expect a surprise announcement for a second-half crossover with all three shows blending together."

FlashTV,3cfdtp,DuEbrithil,6,Tue Jul 7 15:19:05 2015 UTC,"No way - what about all of the people Eobard kills? He's giving those people chances to have babies and grandbabies too.  And what about Barry's babies and grandbabies and so on? Just in that room he saved Barry, Cisco, Caitlyn, etc.  It's difficult to think of his sacrifice as anything but noble. He had a way to stop Eobard's rampage and he did it at great cost. Even if it did open a singularity that threatens to crush all of Central City. XD"
FlashTV,3cfdtp,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,8,Tue Jul 7 16:58:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think that killing and preventing from existing is the same thing. To give an extreme example: In this moment, you (assuming you are male) could rape women and some of those women might keep the eventual child. So are you a murderer for not doing that and therefore preventing these children from existing? [To clarify: This is NOT a call to action, this is meant to be rhetorical! You're not a murderer for not raping, that would be fucked up.]   It's not really murder if they never exist. Sure, they existed in the future since we know Eobard existed,so I can see where you're coming from, but at that moment in time, they didn't exist. You also don't call someone a massmurderer for killing a single person, just because he would have had children. It's a weird case since we know that Eddie would've had children which makes this so complicated, but if you compare it with other situations with similar effects, you can see that killing and preventing from existing are two different things."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,DuEbrithil,-4,Tue Jul 7 14:40:08 2015 UTC,"If I knew that person was going to have a child, I think it would make sense to be called out for killing at least two people. Kind of similar to how if a pregnant mother is killed, that perpetrator is charged with double homicide. By knowing the future, I know that if I kill someone, it isn't just one life that is being prevented from continuing."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,SockPenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"So basically every woman that is not constantly pregnant is a murderer? Out of ""killing=preventing from existing"" could also be followed, that every woman is a murderer - even if constantly pregnant, since she could've been pregnant with another child if she had chosen another man, which now doesn't exist. Women prevent all those kids from existing, so they are all murderers, right?   Yes, this is extreme, but it describes the flaw of ""killing=preventing from existing"" pretty well IMO.   [The same thing can of course also be applied to all men, but it's a bit easier to explain with women]"
FlashTV,3cfdtp,Airsay58259,8,Tue Jul 7 15:03:57 2015 UTC,"OP is slaughtering thousands everytime he ""takes a long shower"""
FlashTV,3cfdtp,DuEbrithil,-2,Tue Jul 7 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about maximizing the lives that could possibly come into this world, I am talking about preventing ones that were on track to be born until I interfered. The former deals in possibilities, the latter in what we know is going to happen."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,Airsay58259,2,Tue Jul 7 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the children of women were on track until they interfered and chose to not get pregnant [assuming the woman is fertile etc]. When talking about the future you're always talking about possibilities. Even in this case due to the fact, that different decisions cause different timelines. You don't actually know that it WILL happen, you only know that there is the possibility that it happens. Eddie demonstrated that by killing himself, but there might also happen other things that alter the timeline. There are still too many open questions in the show to analyze that in depth, but we can already see that your assumption that it WILL happen is false. Also if a woman get's pregnant, she get's pregnant (duh) and you said that killing that baby is already murder. Therefore by not becoming pregnant, she murders the baby. It's got nothing to do with maximizing lives, it's just the logical conclusion out of your thesis. Either you consider women to be murderers or you consider preventing from existing to be something else than killing. Both doesn't work. I get why you think that, but once you get away from the Thawne-example and think about it more generally, you should have an easier way to understand where exactly the flaw in your thinking is. Time travel just makes is unnecessarily complicated."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,DuEbrithil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"We don't really know what is going to happen though; we only know the outcome of one possible future. The course of history can be changed, as Eobard and Barry (and technically Iris with her decision to stay with Eddie instead accepting her fate of being Iris West-Allen) had already demonstrated. It's all possibilities until the event comes to pass. Eobard's birth/Eddie having children just appeared set in stone because Eobard was back in the past, but Eddie pulled a reverse Marty McFly which made Eobard's birth decidedly less certain."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,SockPenguin,5,Thu Jul 9 01:39:02 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying but the future can always change, as we've seen when Barry lost his powers or anytime Eobard was worried about the future. He existed in the present but everything happening after the present moment wasn't set in stone. No one was erased except for Eobard because he existed in the present as well.   IMO the real morality issue in that episode is Barry's decision to change 15 years of history. He was basically going to ""kill"" everyone existing in the present with the excuse that they wouldn't remember their old life anyway. Who knows what would have happened to everyone without Eobard's actions ever since he killed Nora. He said he hand-picked Cisco and Caitlin so there's a strong possibility real Wells wouldn't have find them (it's my personal theory that Eobard was talking about their metahuman future when he said he chose them and not just because of their intellect), so maybe they wouldn't have met, same goes for Caitlin and Ronnie and so on for every character. Those people did exist and Barry was going to erase them (with their blessing, that's even more disturbing). I get why they did that (Barry deserved a chance at happiness etc) and that Barry realised later on he didn't want to, but he still ran back in time with that goal in mind."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,introverted-mess,3,Tue Jul 7 14:58:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think we got information that clarifies how exactly time works in this universe, so I just assume that it's the old ""alternate timeline""-theory. In this case Barry wouldn't change 15 years of history, he would create an alternate timeline. This would explain why RF was confused to see Barry back, since he expected him to go into the other timeline. Or did I miss anything?"
FlashTV,3cfdtp,DankDan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:58 2015 UTC,"I assumed time worked that way as well but the finale messed with that theory. If Eobard came from another timeline then he wasn't Eddie's descendant in our timeline, but since he was erased when Eddie shot himself... he was in fact his grand grand (...) son. With that I understood that there's only one timeline that Eobard and then Barry changed. Honestly I feel like they have different rules because if you look at the tsunami time travel, the finale paradox and the time travel during Nora's murder... different rules seem to apply."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Tue Jul 7 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"I guess we can only wait until next season and hope they clarify that. I does seem a bit messy right now. Cisco remembering also indicates timelines, but you are right, Eddie shouldn't have erased Thawne, unless it's something like a ""primary timeline"" from which you can't differ too much or Thawne became part of the timeline by merging with the real Thawne just enough to link their existence. It is really confusing right now... :D"
FlashTV,3cfdtp,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, there is one timeline that speedsters occasionally fuck with. Any time someone goes back in the past the timeline basically resets to that point only the speedster(s) now has/have knowledge from the previous timeline/future. This is why Eobard knew where to find the original Wells (and already knew the 'destinies' of Cisco, Caitlin, Iris, Eddie, and probably Ronnie among others) and Barry was able to stop Weather Wizard before he did much damage (RIP in peace coroner) the second time around."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:47:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think we've seen alternate universes on The Flash yet.  Alternate timeline is not the same as alternate universe. So far all the time travel we have seen on season 1 has been in the same universe, and all the alterations and consequences have erased and replaced the previous timeline in this universe.  Otherwise Reverse Flash wouldn't have died after Eddie shot himself, because the Eddie from RF's timeline would still be alive. This, and the fact that when Flash went back 2 days in ""Out of Time"" he basically overwrote 2 days instead of popping up in an alternate universe while the catastrophic 2 days (and the Barry/Iris kiss) still happened in the original universe, shows that all the manipulations and changes have been within the same timeline, same universe-just each change overwrites the previous timeline.  They DO plan to introduce the multiverse, but it's important to know the distinction between alternate timeline and alternate universe."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Thu Jul 9 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"But he did it to save Iris mainly, he was going to kill her and he wanted to stop him.  I get what you're saying but it's pointless."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Tue Jul 7 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"I'd like to hear you expand on how killing people isn't different from causing people that don't exist yet to not exist in the future. To me, they're extremely different and really any steps you take in your daily life could change what will or won't happen in the future."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,SkillfulDunce,-1,Tue Jul 7 14:17:19 2015 UTC,"Because they kind of already did exist, just not in the current time. Its kind of timey wimey, but Reverse Flash existed in Eddie's time. He may have come from the future, but he was actually present in Eddie's time. Wouldn't it make sense that all of the family in between Eddie and Reverse Flash exist as well then?  Edit: Also, the only way one could alter the future is to either know what is going to happen or to be able to change the past. The only reason Eddie could alter the future is because of what Eobard told him."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,Flarow,2,Tue Jul 7 14:32:36 2015 UTC,I still don't think it's the same. Eddie's future wife probably still had children with someone else and so on and so on. Eddie's suicide just changed how things happened relative to Eobard's perspective.
FlashTV,3cfdtp,SockPenguin,-1,Tue Jul 7 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"That is a major change to a family line though, to the point where the other children Eddie's wife has will be very different people compared to the ones she would've had with Eddie."
FlashTV,3cfdtp,introverted-mess,2,Tue Jul 7 15:37:35 2015 UTC,Right but what makes family A's lives intrinsically more valuable than Family B's?
FlashTV,3cfdtp,SuperNJGaming,-1,Tue Jul 7 15:41:02 2015 UTC,Family A was already set to exist until Eddie messed with the timeline. I don't think the idea that they might get replaced in the world really makes up for them getting erased.
FlashTV,3cfdtp,SockPenguin,2,Tue Jul 7 15:45:34 2015 UTC,"I still don't see how this equates with murder though. Every choice we make on a daily basis changes a potential future, Eddie just directly saw the impact of his choices directly because a man from the future was there."

FlashTV,3c5u3f,russcass,2,Mon Jul 6 00:21:40 2015 UTC,"I thought so at first, but I had talked myself out of that theory....  If future Barry has his identity found out and changed his name to be similar to his favorite author, Harrison (H.G.) Wells. Then Eobard found this out and decided to steal his identity and go back in time to kill Barry's mother... because that would be insanely crazy... Eobard as future Barry (aka Harrison Wells) killed his own mum as The Reverse Flash. Then Reverse Flash, aka Harrison Wells, aka future Barry, aka Eobard Thawne gets trapped and has to help current time Barry become the Flash. It even kind of makes sense that if Eobard steals future Barry's, aka Harrison Wells, identity that the newspaper would say that the Flash has disappeared. But then I thought the Flash came back in time with Reverse Flash to stop him. Maybe he's also trapped in current time but hasn't come out of hiding yet, which is why the newspaper says he's missing.  It's all well and good, but the newspaper says Barry married Iris. If Harrison is future Barry, not sure why he's with the other lady unless Iris was killed or something.  Too many holes to fill and too many aka's.  ....although this would make sense as to why Harrison would have access to Gideon in the scenes as the Reverse Flash coming back to kill Nora and inside current STAR Labs, since Gideon said Barry created her/it."

Each year is a combination of those two so you have A1, B2, C1, A2 end so on. So if you go to the masses during weekdays you hear the same reading every two years, if you go only to Sunday Masses you will hear the same reading every 3 years and the exact same combination of weekday and Sundays readings hppens every 6 years.  Also you won't hear the whole bible, ever. The readings are picked fragments from the bible and no cycle covers the whole things. At least that's how it is in the Catholic Church."

FlashTV,3c3ybo,DSEthno23,11,Sat Jul 4 16:50:56 2015 UTC,You can probably google Rebirth* pdf download or something to that effect. Although comics are even better when you read them on the page.  Edit: changed Flashpoint to Rebirth
FlashTV,3c3ybo,8eat-mesa,-8,Sat Jul 4 17:27:21 2015 UTC,"But then you'd read Flashpoint, which sucks, instead of Flash Rebirth, which is good."

FlashTV,3c3ybo,Metzky,0,Sun Jul 5 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"He isn't lying, the actual book sucked."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Metzky,4,Sun Jul 5 06:16:55 2015 UTC,It really didn't.. It has the same rating as rebirth on most sites
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Metzky,0,Sun Jul 5 06:19:14 2015 UTC,"Oho, it really did. The animated movie cut the crap and gave you a focused, concise story. The comic itself was mediocre. Just ask around Reddit, or look up interviews by authors who worked on tie ins, and ask people who were reading it when it came out. The movie was far better than the book."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,kuhanluke,3,Sun Jul 5 06:21:53 2015 UTC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/20cot9/rdcs_book_club_flashpoint/ all pretty positive reviews  https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/15ac8c/as_promised_the_first_rdccomics_book_club/ some mixed reviews, but nothing negative  Those were the two discussions i really found on dcomics, but as we know redits search engine sucks so i probably missed some"
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Metzky,-9,Sun Jul 5 06:35:55 2015 UTC,"If you were to Google and download Flashpoint, you would end up reading Flashpoint, which sucks, instead of Googling and downloading and reading Flash Rebirth, which does not suck."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,kuhanluke,2,Sun Jul 5 00:24:24 2015 UTC,"Lol Flashpoint is good, sort of a reason it got an animated movie"
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Metzky,-3,Sun Jul 5 00:32:23 2015 UTC,Flashpoint got an animated movie because it was big and because it was written by the Chief Creative Officer of DC Entertainment. Flashpoint the comic was terrible.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,kuhanluke,0,Sun Jul 5 00:53:46 2015 UTC,Both of them are written by the same person..
FlashTV,3c3ybo,UtterFlatulence,-4,Sun Jul 5 00:57:03 2015 UTC,Yes and M. Night Shyamalan wrote both The Sixth Sense and The Last Airbender. Even good writers write bad storylines and some good writers run out of good ideas. Or just write something bad.  Geoff Johns wrote my favorite and least favorite Flash stories of the last twenty years. Same with Green Lantern. Tends to happen when someone is so prolific.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,kuhanluke,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:04:42 2015 UTC,"I liked Flashpoint better,mainly because Rebirth marks the beginning of the end for Wally West."

FlashTV,3c3ybo,kacman,191,Sun Jul 5 06:40:52 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Flash would be pretty pointless if he wasn't faster. That's his main thing, if Superman can go as fast and do more then there's no need for Flash."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Royal_Robin,126,Sat Jul 4 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"Thing is, flash isn't just faster. He's got an entire power set based around speed that superman doesn't have, like the ability to phase through things, resistance to possession and mind control, universe jumping, and time travel."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,kacman,21,Sat Jul 4 16:23:35 2015 UTC,"The basis of his powers is still speed though. If the guy who specializes in speed isn't the fastest then there's a problem. It's like if Batman picked up a bow and was better than Green Arrow. Sure Green Arrow still has other skills, but that's his main thing and someone else would be doing it better as just one side thing."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,AKACherry,2,Sat Jul 4 17:54:09 2015 UTC,Given knowledge of origins and skillsets I imagine batman is pretty much the same at archery as green arrow. He just doesn't use weapons.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Royal_Robin,22,Sat Jul 4 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"I would assume he is proficient at archery, but not the same as someone who uses a bow every day. Definitely not better than him."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,neoblackdragon,9,Sat Jul 4 18:13:42 2015 UTC,Hasn't Batman admitted before that GA is way better of an archer.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,suss2it,6,Sat Jul 4 18:43:20 2015 UTC,I dunno. Does that seem like something batman would do?
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Royal_Robin,21,Sat Jul 4 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"Actually yes. He's not really that prideful except with certain writers. He recognizes the skill and openly admits it. Hell the outsiders are basically his recognition.   Batman doesn't specialize in archery. He knows this because his tools aren't based around archery. Sure he can hit a target and has the strength to use a bow frequently. But he certainly knows he's not Mr Trickshot.   Of course Ollie's problem was that his hand to hand fighting was ""subpar"". Which he recognized and spent a year on an island fighting assassins for training."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,suss2it,11,Sat Jul 4 19:32:24 2015 UTC,"He spent a year on the island training with a master assassin and as a final test a bunch of other assassins were released on the island with the goal to kill him. He didn't actually spend an entire year fighting assassins on a island, as awesome as that sounds."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Royal_Robin,2,Sat Jul 4 20:53:13 2015 UTC,You don't have to be prideful to not admit someone is better than you. I just thought it wouldn't be something that came up too often.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,jayseedub,3,Sat Jul 4 19:35:28 2015 UTC,Batman definitely uses weapons. He just doesn't use guns.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Royal_Robin,2,Sat Jul 4 20:51:52 2015 UTC,"He uses batarangs and exosuits and stuff but I can't really think of a time that he isn't mostly using fisticuffs. Not like Red Hood with the guns, Nightwing with the escrima, or Robin with the bo staff."

FlashTV,3c3ybo,FoxTrot1337,3,Sun Jul 5 13:28:38 2015 UTC,Yeah. Batman is even a firearm expert.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Bruce_Wayne_49,22,Sat Jul 4 18:11:48 2015 UTC,Can't superman phase too? I might be wrong but I think he has. Of course he still can't do that other stuff.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,rootyb,144,Sat Jul 4 16:32:48 2015 UTC,He does phase through things. He just breaks it in the process.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Bruce_Wayne_49,16,Sat Jul 4 18:26:51 2015 UTC,Well that just seems silly.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,MechanicMonkey,87,Sat Jul 4 18:31:22 2015 UTC,I think the joke was that Supes just smashes through things.

FlashTV,3c3ybo,Royal_Robin,22,Sat Jul 4 17:08:45 2015 UTC,Supergirl is specifically more powerful in general because her ship orbited the sun for a couple extra days supercharging her. she is just inexperienced.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Patius,19,Sat Jul 4 18:01:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah. She was in a cryosleep capsule that blasted her with high intensity yellow sunlight for the entire trip to earth. A trip that took twenty some odd years where she did not use any energy at all. That sunlight comes with a few extra powers, such as:   increased speed, which lets her do some of the stuff that the flash can, like phase and beat superman at races.  this crazy explosion ability, although superman got a weaker version that depowers him recently.  generally stronger than superman kryptonite resistance    She still can't do most of the stuff as the flash though, like time travel unaided."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,suss2it,5,Sat Jul 4 19:16:16 2015 UTC,And she's a red lantern now too right?
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Patius,16,Sat Jul 4 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"Was. She was infected by some kind of mechanical parasite trying to take over her mind, so she flew into the sun to kill it (she thought she'd die too.) She got a massive power boost, the parasite died, and her red lantern ring was destroyed.  She then went back to earth, started dating a handicapped black dude she met half an issue earlier (and the issue took place in the course of a single day) and got into some romantic tension with Jason Todd, and then I stopped reading because of school."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,youkaime,12,Sat Jul 4 19:36:25 2015 UTC,You stopped reading right before she went to a superhero school in space and then the book got cancelled.

FlashTV,3c3ybo,genchris,3,Sat Jul 4 19:43:29 2015 UTC,Yes he can. He once phased through Doomsday's punches.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,wiccabilly,3,Sat Jul 4 19:05:31 2015 UTC,Superman can do anything the writer needs him to do at the time.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,cesclaveria,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:46:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that is true of a lot of superheroes, Marvel or DC."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,TheNittles,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:35:07 2015 UTC,I'm not as good with the comics but I remember he did it once in Lois and Clark.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,cesclaveria,10,Sat Jul 4 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"Yes he did in that series. Supe's other powers tend to vary a lot in different interpretations (the movies invented several powers) and even different comic writers/versions have different powers.  Superman was even able to travel to different dimensions by ""punching"" open the fabric of time and space and then basically just walking into another Universe."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Patius,12,Sat Jul 4 17:42:54 2015 UTC,"Still not as bad as Silver Age Supes, who would basically pull new powers out of his ass whenever he needed.  Or didn't.  Like the time he could shoot rainbow beams from his fingers that made a smaller Superman."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,trickyd88,7,Sat Jul 4 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"yeah, nothing is going to compare to that age of Superman where everything was possible, even super ventriloquism."

FlashTV,3c3ybo,trickyd88,3,Sat Jul 4 19:20:00 2015 UTC,There was that time he flew around the Earth to reverse time or something like that.   http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/24116/how-did-superman-turn-back-time-in-the-first-movie
FlashTV,3c3ybo,AREYOUSauRuS,6,Sun Jul 5 12:16:25 2015 UTC,"The visuals were just that.... visuals for the movie audience.  The implication is that he's flying so fast that he breaks the time barrier and goes back in time.  He doesn't actually reverse time or the rotation of the earth.  But that guy wants to prove it's impossible to reverse the rotation of the earth, so he refuses to believe a movie filmed in 1978 might have taken some liberties with visualizing time travel."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Patius,2,Sun Jul 5 13:24:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, to clarify, I meant Superman travelled back in time, not the Earth."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,dafood48,2,Sun Jul 5 13:32:15 2015 UTC,"My ""that guy"" comment wasn't aimed at you, just for clarification, it was about the guy in your link that went to all the trouble to deny the time travel so he could prove earth's rotation can't be reversed."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Patius,2,Sun Jul 5 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's silver age superman. Who had the power set of ""whatever the writers came up with""   Remember the cellophane S attack from the sequel?"

FlashTV,3c3ybo,kacman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"The flash can travel between universes by one of two ways: cosmic treadmill or vibrating to a different universe's vibration frequency and phasing to that different universe.  Basically, speed based molecular-phasing on steroids. Not that the speed-based phasing is a common power (literally the only DC hero I can think of with that power that's not using the speedforce is Supergirl)  That's how they found out about the universes during the silver age."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Swahhillie,16,Mon Jul 6 04:11:15 2015 UTC,Superman isn't the best at any of his powers. What makes him so scary is that he has all the powers
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Theculshey,8,Sat Jul 4 18:00:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, that's how it should be. Once he starts beating people at a power they specialize at then it would become a problem."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,TheFinalStorm,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:09:04 2015 UTC,Except strength?  I can't think of any heroes that may overpower him strength wise. Maybe supergirl...
FlashTV,3c3ybo,kacman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:39:55 2015 UTC,Captain Marvel/Shazam has been said to be on equal/slightly higher strength than Supes. Martian Manhunter can also overpower him with his strength combined with the whole telekinesis thing.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,SlapMyCHOP,14,Sun Jul 5 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, a number of heroes are pretty pointless with Superman around. Of course it depends on how overpowered he is written to be at the time."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,n60storm4,16,Sat Jul 4 16:13:28 2015 UTC,"True, but Flash is one of the big Justice League members and basically has one power with everything else being an extension of that. He better be the best at it. Smaller characters it's more acceptable to overshadow, although I still don't love it."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,StellarNeonJellyfish,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"That's one thing I seriously dislike about superman. He's SO overpowered that nothing can beat him. It's boring. I know it varies between how he's written at the time, but still."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,n60storm4,6,Sat Jul 4 21:14:42 2015 UTC,Flash could probably beat him.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,serosis,3,Sat Jul 4 22:06:06 2015 UTC,"Since they can both time travel, wouldnt the closest fight just be like, whoever could murder the other as an infant?"
FlashTV,3c3ybo,kacman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:00:51 2015 UTC,That would work too. In a one on one fist fight Flash would win as well.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,Copper_Coil,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:19:16 2015 UTC,Superheroes do not cancel out if they have some of the same abilities. Just means they have one more guy available if they need someone fast.  That would be like only having one construction worker because he is extremely good at his job and having anyone else would be pointless.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,guccigoogle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:35:27 2015 UTC,"From an in universe perspective you're absolutely right, an army of superheroes is great even if they all just have varying levels of super strength. But from a reading perspective there's only so many comics or shows out there, and each one should be special.

FlashTV,3c3ybo,Supertrinko,-8,Tue Jul 7 14:18:03 2015 UTC,"By all reason, in the '60s, Superman should have been faster than the Flash. Superman could go so fast that he broke the time barrier and could travel to any time period of his choosing (past or present). Flash could also travel through time but needed his cosmic treadmill to do so with accuracy.  Moreover, Barry was supposed to be mortal but for his speed power. He wasn't supposed to be invulnerable, or super-strong or have any of those other attributes that made Superman so powerful. Therefore if tested to their very limits, the Flash would die before Superman.  Which is good. You don't want a Flash who is too powerful. And you don't want a Superman who isn't super.  In the modern era, with Superman de-powered and Flash having this thing called the Speed Force, I would take it that Flash is faster. But it's a cheat--if you ask me. The Speed Force essentially takes the Flash and makes him into a Superman--because the Speed Force is like a cosmic deux ex machina or a hand wave--whatever you want Flash to do, just invoke the Speed Force and he can do it.  So yeah, I guess the Speed Force beats Superman's yellow sun, now."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,SuperCosmicNova,3,Sun Jul 5 21:35:01 2015 UTC,So you are  not a flash fan I take it.
FlashTV,3c3ybo,brasco975,0,Sat Jul 4 19:25:42 2015 UTC,"I am a TV Flash fan--I don't read the comics anymore, though I used to. I just don't want the character to become too powerful. He should have some limits. This my hero can beat up your hero mentality is not the true test of fan loyalty. Each character has his or her own merits and it's not good to sacrifice those just so said character can dominate everybody else.  Back in Superman 199, when they had their race for charity, Superman agreed not to fly, but Flash was still allowed to use his powers to run on water and run through walls. Seems to me once Superman can use his flight, then he has an advantage because there's less friction in air than on land.   So let's say both heroes agree to run on land, not go through the time barrier, not use any extra abilities--like running on water or flying. In that kind of race, I think the Flash should win. Especially if it's a sprint and not a long distance run. But in a test of endurance--which is what long distance races become--then it makes sense that Superman should win, because he has extra reserves thanks to his ability to store solar radiation."
FlashTV,3c3ybo,SuperCosmicNova,2,Sun Jul 5 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"What you're saying is, back when Superman was better, everything was okay and it made sense. But now, Flash is faster, and that just don't make sense."

FlashTV,3c6kd8,The_RTV,3,Sun Jul 5 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"The wrist bomb is a bit plausible but you have to be really really unfocused to not notice a man approaching you in such a dangerous situation..seriously, that kind of lack of awareness would get him killed in 1 day with or without superpowers.

However,  it's actually so over the top that it's hilarious. It definitely has it's serious moments, it was made in the aftermath of the popularity of Tim Burton's Batman, so it shares some aesthetic with that. There is no overarching plot for the season but there are returning characters and plot lines here and there.  I'd say it holds up.

FlashTV,3c4cc0,SuperCosmicNova,12,Sun Jul 5 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"Barry can go as fast as he wants. Literally. The issue is that he has a mental block about it. Wally had the same thing, more of a case of the yips than anything, but basically any Speedforce-tapping Speedster had no limit on speed. In those instances, as well as when he saves Wells from Blackout, Barry moves 100% on instinct without thinking how fast he is actually going. :)"
FlashTV,3c4cc0,PurplePint,5,Sat Jul 4 17:51:35 2015 UTC,"Or when he moved faster than the lightning striking Joe's car, and pushed Joe out of the way."
FlashTV,3c4cc0,Keegman_99,4,Sat Jul 4 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"When Wells is giving the speech to help Barry phase through a truck in the Tricksters episode, he says, ""You're no longer you now. You're part of something greater - you're part of a speed force. It's yours.""  And I could just be crazy, but when he pauses, closes his eyes, then says ""It's yours. Now do it,"" it's almost like he's giving him access to some of it. Like he's letting Barry use enough to do the phasing thing."
FlashTV,3c4cc0,Karisma_not_Karma,4,Sun Jul 5 06:02:40 2015 UTC,"And I could just be crazy, but when he pauses, closes his eyes, then says ""It's yours. Now do it,"" it's almost like he's giving him access to some of it. Like he's letting Barry use enough to do the phasing thing.   I actually really like this theory. Like Wells/Eobard is acting like a filter (or a leach/parasite as I prefer to think of it) between Barry and the speed force. Barry's speed is inconsistent because Wells/Eobard is limiting his access to the speed force; hence why Reverse Flash is faster. Reverse Flash is literally holding the man down!!! :P"
FlashTV,3c4cc0,BrentEdwards,2,Sun Jul 5 18:49:21 2015 UTC,This actually happened in the comics so it totally works.
FlashTV,3c4cc0,tucker42,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:56:53 2015 UTC,"Really??? Well... there you go then. Karisma_not_Karma, not being crazy, confirmed!!! LOL!   I just recently got into comics. Been reading mostly New 52 Wonder Woman, Superman, and Justice League. I've read Flashpoint and Rebirth but been meaning to read more Flash comics. Tell me... did it backfire on Reverse Flash when he limited The Flash's access to the speedforce? What I mean is... did the Flash's connection to the speedforce grow stronger because he was being held back?   I would like to see a story like this where Wells/Eobard's attempts at limiting Barry's access to the speedforce only acted like strength training for Barry. Kind of like when a runner puts weights on his-or-her legs when they train, they get stronger the more they run with the weights. That, once the weights were removed, the runner was faster then they were before. I think this would make for a great episode... or a great fanfic... which I just might write... :P"
FlashTV,3c4cc0,BrentEdwards,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:15:32 2015 UTC,"Ah well actually you mentioning Flashpoint made me realize my error.  It was actually in the Flashpoint Paradox movie where the Reverse Flash was limiting Barry's connection to the speedforce, but it's not part of the comic's story.  I get the details of those two mixed around sometimes.  But even so, the idea has been explored before so it certainly seems like a feasible idea for the show."
FlashTV,3c4cc0,tucker42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:07:13 2015 UTC,It kinda happens in Flash Rebirth. Thawne has a negative speedforce that corrupts the normal speedforce and makes it harder for other speedsters to use

FlashTV,3bxkdl,FriendlyBatman,6,Fri Jul 3 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"It's a very frequently quoted line from Wicker Man, I have never heard someone say it who wasn't quoting the movie and even doing the voice."
FlashTV,3bxkdl,OK_Soda,2,Fri Jul 3 02:22:47 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to watch that movie, I feel like I've been missing out on so much now.   To clarify, all I was saying was that the kid has either seen the movie or the dad makes references to it that the kid picked up."
FlashTV,3bxkdl,FriendlyBatman,2,Fri Jul 3 03:56:31 2015 UTC,Or has an awesome kid.
FlashTV,3bxkdl,Terakahn,2,Fri Jul 3 03:41:37 2015 UTC,Maybe it was on an iPad? Tons of kids play/draw on those
FlashTV,3bxkdl,Psychomatix,2,Fri Jul 3 06:57:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize that was a Nicolas Cage reference. I imagine he/she could've just wanted the Flash to be saying that. As for the program, I'm sure the kid could've drawn it on some tablet app or something."
FlashTV,3bxkdl,TrueJudgment,2,Fri Jul 3 01:34:29 2015 UTC,But it looks like it was made to seem like a kid did it.
FlashTV,3bxkdl,8eat-mesa,3,Fri Jul 3 05:29:43 2015 UTC,"...or an actual kid did it? I get having a healthy dose of skepticism on Reddit/the internet, but not EVERYBODY has to be making stuff up, do they?"
FlashTV,3bxkdl,TrueJudgment,-3,Fri Jul 3 16:48:34 2015 UTC,I think I shouted that at some point during the show because I'd heard it before and it sounds funny. Didn't know what it was from. But I saw the original Wicker Man and now I absolutely must see the Nicholas Cage version.

FlashTV,3bxkdl,TheJoshider10,2,Fri Jul 3 07:48:06 2015 UTC,Literally it's really not that hard. Maybe OP did fake this but I was drawing stuff like this at that age. Plus OP may make the quote a lot and therefore the kid picks up on it.

FlashTV,3bxkdl,drproximo,5,Fri Jul 3 14:29:35 2015 UTC,That's a fantastic idea. We love projects. I'll make a note to do that starting in October. Right now we've moved on to the Justice League cartoons because they love the Flash so much.

FlashTV,3bxkdl,Svoboda1,-8,Fri Jul 3 12:10:23 2015 UTC,This is the best post in the history of this sub
FlashTV,3bz4u9,BaRKy1911,103,Fri Jul 3 09:24:08 2015 UTC,"Vote no.  While a sub in the offseason wouldn't be hurt too much by a blackout, I'm not really in favor of fan-dedicated subreddits locking down. It just negates the fans from reaching the communities they enjoy. Not everyone who comes onto this sub cares about the Reddit meta-politics.  However, I'm no mod, so I don't know how you guys feel about this thing with the lack of communication and whatnot. Just my two cents."
FlashTV,3bz4u9,silverinferno3,7,Fri Jul 3 09:33:56 2015 UTC,You are completely correct withing the last few hours this sub has only had 126 visitors.  Blacking it out would do next to nothing
FlashTV,3bz4u9,call_the_eagles,14,Fri Jul 3 14:04:44 2015 UTC,I don't see how this will stick it to the reddit admins. Feels more like a disservice to us redditors and fans of flash. Please no.. I love this sub.
FlashTV,3bz4u9,FoxTrot1337,45,Fri Jul 3 14:33:29 2015 UTC,"No, please no. Most of my favorite subs are blacked out right now, my front page is full of bullshit from subs I rarely frequent. Let me keep Flash"

FlashTV,3bz4u9,Future_Vantas,5,Fri Jul 3 16:49:32 2015 UTC,I don't think we should personally. The major subs with more number will have a bigger impact I think we should just stay clear.   And how can we get affected by blackout if Barry defeated him? :P
FlashTV,3bz4u9,Jezamiah,8,Fri Jul 3 14:42:00 2015 UTC,"no, this whole thing is stupid and its going to blow over just like any other thing that happens on reddit."

FlashTV,3bz4u9,Dont-quote-me,2,Fri Jul 3 13:15:17 2015 UTC,Horrible idea. It's too small a subreddit to matter. Nobody in reddit corporate will give two shits if we shut down.
FlashTV,3bz4u9,TheWanderingN00b,2,Fri Jul 3 17:48:20 2015 UTC,No. Damaging reddit is not fixing the problem. Killing a site you love rather than finding an alternate solution really pisses me off. And I've been pissed off for centuries.
FlashTV,3bz4u9,KernalBacon,2,Fri Jul 3 18:03:58 2015 UTC,"No. The other subreddits are being babies about a temporary issue and the userbase is the one who's being damaged the most, not the admins."
FlashTV,3bz4u9,MMX2,8,Fri Jul 3 18:16:02 2015 UTC,No. I think the subreddits that have nothing to do with AMA or Victoria have no reason to go private.
FlashTV,3bz4u9,ThomasSirveaux,-6,Fri Jul 3 12:48:02 2015 UTC,"The problem is, it wasn't just /r/AMA. Take a look around, more mods were fired. She was just the one that blew up first and biggest."

FlashTV,3bz4u9,PQ6,7,Fri Jul 3 10:31:18 2015 UTC,"Yes.   My reasoning being, The Flash wouldn't stand idly by while a train wreck happens. He'd speed force the shit out of the situation."
FlashTV,3bz4u9,Imbillpardy,2,Fri Jul 3 11:39:16 2015 UTC,I think you just convinced me the subreddit should go dark for now.

FlashTV,3bz4u9,TotallyNotKanye,3,Sat Jul 4 07:34:14 2015 UTC,"Seems that the smartest move is to leave the subs open & let those that want to protest do so, by staying off reddit. That doesn't punish the normal people.  Also going dark is beyond stupid, as these subs should instead be used to coordinate an actual protest for those that wish to make change. Get a few hundred thousand people all emailing a few key people/sources, & blow up twitter to demand the firing of the CEO. These protests are poorly thought out, knee jerk reactions with no real plan. They also encourage damage rather than change."
FlashTV,3bz4u9,sabin357,6,Fri Jul 3 13:32:24 2015 UTC,I vote yes. Solidarity.
FlashTV,3bz4u9,Eastergecko,10,Fri Jul 3 09:26:04 2015 UTC,Solidarity for a situation we know nothing about?

Unlike the admins, the mods let the community know what's going on.  I vote yes, go dark. I wish it weren't off season so it'd be a bigger statement but we play the cards we're dealt. Look at /r/fallout. All the shit they've got going on? Dark. Fan based subs are where it really counts, even in the off season. No one can make a difference like a horde of angry fanatics."
FlashTV,3bz4u9,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,12,Fri Jul 3 10:50:08 2015 UTC,"This horde of angry mods blocking off the content is hurting this site more than the admins. We don't even know why this girl was fired yet, and Reddit has no obligation to disclose why they terminated her. It would be unprofessional to do so."
FlashTV,3bz4u9,DownbeatWings,-1,Fri Jul 3 12:24:24 2015 UTC,"The problem doesn't reside in that they fired her it resides in their non-communication to Mods that coordinated with her. Plus with her firing and no contingency they destroyed the current process for AMAs which helped make sure the person talking was the person who said was talking. I personally don't think this sub should go dark, but the reasoning behind the major subs doing it is 100% justified."
FlashTV,3bz4u9,Alecrein,3,Fri Jul 3 15:43:46 2015 UTC,Pretty sure a communication line would've came sooner or later. Just because they didn't notify the mods asap doesn't mean they weren't planning something out. It's of no concern to ANY user what was happening and for the select few mods of each subreddit to make that decision for everyone else was just plain stupid

FlashTV,3bz6x6,SleeplessNightz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:42:52 2015 UTC,"Probably because he needed Barry's cooperation to make the time vortex.  No Barry, no time travel, no going home. And that is after all, all he wanted."

FlashTV,3bz6x6,heath_parker,3,Fri Jul 3 12:34:42 2015 UTC,"At the beginning of the episode Eobard told Barry two things that I think influenced his decision to not change the past/stop Eobard. The first was that Eobard hates Barry and the reason why doesn't really matter. He has hated Barry for centuries a long ass time, still does hate Barry even if they now have this weird mentor/student aspect of their relationship, and will in all likelihood always hate Barry. The second is Eobard saying he traveled back in time to kill kid!Barry pretty much the moment he learned Barry would one day be the Flash. This makes Barry (probably) feel responsible for his mother's death (not only was he not fast enough to save her, she wouldn't have been in danger at all if it weren't for Barry's Flashing (phrasing?)), and it also puts the idea in Barry's mind that he's probably never going to be safe if Eobard is free. Sure he might just want to go back to his time now, but what if down the road his favorite coffee shop closes and Eobard- who has repeated whatever process gave him Speedforce access in the future- decides to take this out on Barry? And now not only does he know Barry is the Flash, but he also spent a year working with Barry (and several more years hardcore creeping on him) and knows every person Barry is close to and exactly how to fuck with each of them. Letting Eobard go is basically subjecting all of Team Flash to constantly looking over their shoulder, hoping Eobard hasn't come back to express his rage at not having Big Belly Burger in the future.  Plus, Barry just watched his mom die again because the universe loves to make him suffer. He probably just wanted to punch the dude responsible."
FlashTV,3bz6x6,SockPenguin,2,Sat Jul 4 07:12:35 2015 UTC,A lot of people ask why they let eobard out but my biggest issue is why they let him out with only 20 seconds left to get home. They could have let him out as soon as Barry went back and that would've been enough time to get back without all the drama. But the finale was awesome obviously but there were a copious amount of flaws.
FlashTV,3bz6x6,platinumrug,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"it looked to me  like Barry didnt actually plan on destroying the machine, he was just going superfast through the Speed Force and since the time machine was just about to go into it, it was destroyed."

FlashTV,3bwn33,Kaiyedy,33,Thu Jul 2 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"I could be completely mistaken, but in Young Justice, the metagene is explained as sort of this genetic predisposition to be able to adapt in extreme ways to survive. The powers developed are ""opportunistic"", as one character describes it - they take whatever the metahuman is exposed to and base its powers off of that.   It makes sense for most of the metas we've met so far that they got powers ""from"" the particle accelerator, as it would have killed a lot of people and 'triggered' the metagene, but the character doesn't have to have been involved in the particle accelerator explosion to have gotten powers.   So yeah, I agree with /u/SquirrelDragon that it was probably Cisco's death that triggered his metagene (Vibe powers of vibration from being vibrafisted through the chest?).   Don't forget that there's laser beam eyes guy from Starling City who wasn't even in Central City when the accelerator exploded, yet he's a meta (this guy was better explored in Arrow).   Just found this on a wiki:   [In the Invasion! miniseries,] one of the Dominators discovered that select members of the human race had a ""biological variant"" he called the meta-gene (also spelled ""metagene""). This gene often lay dormant until an instant of extraordinary physical and emotional stress activates it. A ""spontaneous chromosomal combustion"" then takes place, as the metagene takes the source of the biostress – be it chemical, radioactive or whatever – and turns the potential catastrophe into a catalyst for ""genetic change,"" resulting in metahuman abilities."
FlashTV,3bwn33,Karisma_not_Karma,6,Thu Jul 2 20:12:55 2015 UTC,vibrafisted   LOL
FlashTV,3bwn33,bigalsjams,11,Thu Jul 2 22:26:56 2015 UTC,Yeah... I never actually put together that them actually dying triggered it...
FlashTV,3bwn33,Karisma_not_Karma,18,Thu Jul 2 20:31:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think they actually died, but getting the powers last second saved their lives.   Except Cisco. He died. Except he also lived. XD"
FlashTV,3bwn33,Karisma_not_Karma,2,Thu Jul 2 20:35:31 2015 UTC,"But wait, does that mean that everyone who was exposed to the blast (aka pretty much everyone in central city at the time on the explosion) who doesn't die naturally will become meta-humans? Because if you become a metahuman if you die ""horrifically"" (poison gas, struck by lightning, ect) and were affected by the blast, and if Cisco's powers got triggered by getting killed by Wells then anyone could become a metahuman, right?"
FlashTV,3bwn33,Karisma_not_Karma,5,Thu Jul 2 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, the blast didn't give them the metagene. You're born with it (doesn't mean your parents have to have it). Laser eyes guy wasn't even in the city when the blast went off, but he still manifested powers.   And it's entirely possible people with the metagene still died. I mean, Cisco still died in that timeline.   But not everyone has the metagene in Young Justice, for instance. And it didn't necessarily have to be how that person was going to die that determined the power. There was a kid whose dad worked on teleportation experiments, and when he manifested his powers, he got the ability to teleport short distances, even though that had nothing to do with his torture.   It does make me wonder though how there aren't a few metahumans out there with like, gun related powers, or cancer or MRSA 'powers'. XD  Edit: I admit though, that with this theory of how the metagene works based on Invasion! and Young Justice, I'm confused as to why Eobard needed the accelerator explosion to happen sooner. Especially if Barry Allen was the lightning bolt that hit himself that night. Unless, I guess, he needed Barry to have villains to fight against so that he could get faster, so Eobard could get home."
FlashTV,3bwn33,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,2,Thu Jul 2 22:12:13 2015 UTC,"I think Eobard just wanted to get home asap. He didn't need to, I guess... Or it could be that the longer the stayed in that timeline the more he could F*** things up in his present."
FlashTV,3bwn33,Karisma_not_Karma,3,Fri Jul 3 03:02:17 2015 UTC,"I have a ridiculous probably completely implausible please don't stampede me theory that Eobard's plan was for Barry to change the timeline while he was travelling in the wormhole/timestream.   In the comics, Eobard struggled with being able to kill Barry because it would erase him from existence. One day, Barry traveled back in time and saved his mum while Eobard happened to be in the timestream, and somehow it freed him from his bonded destiny with Barry. That was Flashpoint, and we all know how much of a fuckin disaster that was.   I think that's why Eobard was so pissed when he realized Barry both hadn't changed the past, and stopped him from going home."
FlashTV,3bwn33,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,2,Fri Jul 3 03:06:48 2015 UTC,"The accelerator explain explosion might act like a lightening rod for future lightning speed force Barry to find his former self.

FlashTV,3bwn33,AREYOUSauRuS,2,Fri Jul 3 10:56:41 2015 UTC,"Eh, different places I read say that he is a metahuman, and some places make no mention at all. I personally can't find a source right now that directly refers to him as a metahuman, but there's no reason the act of him getting hit with his own lightning couldn't have activated the metagene in him, even if it does loop with him hitting himself with lightning, if that makes sense.  Though +1 for the lightning rod idea. That's what I believe in now. (:"
FlashTV,3bwn33,Karisma_not_Karma,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:00:52 2015 UTC,The big seven are usually considerred to be unique. The metagene is DC's more generic power source. Flash would be less powerful if he were a metahuman.

Besides, Barry was in a coma for 9 months after the lightning strike and I'm pretty sure some of the metahumans they've encountered were presumed dead."
FlashTV,3bwn33,Karisma_not_Karma,3,Fri Jul 3 00:41:47 2015 UTC,"Personally I assume he's dead.  When Barry vibrafisted a dude in one of the more recent issues,  it literally pureed his heart.  I don't think Vibe has regenerative powers.   Edit: Also in episode 18, Cisco says, ""Dr. Wells is The Reverse-Flash. And... he kills me."""
FlashTV,3bwn33,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:56:19 2015 UTC,"But here's why I disagree:   We're saying the metagene manifests itself when you're literally moments away from death/are in the process of dying. For the metahumans whose near-death experiences we have details from, their ""cause of death"" is linked to their powers now.   So, we have Cisco, who's moments away from being vibrafisted. His metagene goes ""shit shit shit!"" and manifests itself in a way to protect Cisco from the attack. As a side effect, Cisco gains other powers like detecting other timelines and stuff."
FlashTV,3bwn33,SuperCosmicNova,2,Fri Jul 3 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, at this point I'm gonna say there's definitely something fucky going down. I still have my doubts because Cisco's power is vibrations.   In the '85 Crisis, the veil between the different realities is described as a vibrational energy barrier, and the barriers start breaking down/the worlds start merging because those vibrations slow down. To me, this is why Vibe is able to sense/remember things that happen in other worlds, like him dying.   I don't know if that power reverberates through his other selves once it's activated in at least one world. Honestly I don't know, and I feel like this show is going to introduce something new about it. I think this is as far as I can speculate. Tbh I don't know that much about our loveable nerd."

FlashTV,3bwn33,PurplePint,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:52:46 2015 UTC,I don't think it is from that. The only reason I think is because Eobard said he wasn't sure if he had gotten affected meaning he knew about it before he killed him.
FlashTV,3bwn33,maxyyb99,7,Sun Jul 5 01:44:40 2015 UTC,"Well he was in the explosion, just not as directly as Ronnie. Perhaps the vibrations form the earthquake, and/or the sound of the blast?"
FlashTV,3bwn33,SquirrelDragon,8,Thu Jul 2 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"Ronnie told Cisco about the changes he'd made in order to vent the explosion up and not out. Cisco said he had to ""change  the particle parameters"".  That change would likely have been done by use of electromagnet to adjust magnostatic fields in the Accelerator. It gets complicated here, but basically if Cisco had been interacting with the electromagnets, he'd be affected by their proximity. Scientifically, we could mention Hillbert Spaces,  Heisenberg Effect, quantum entanglement and any of the top three Multiverse theories that are supported by Hawking, Tyson, Feynman, et al.    In short, Cisco was hit by the Wave as he was messing with very large, very powerful electromagnets and those are what gave him his Vibe powers in the TV-verse.  Edit: Correct about the metagene being opportunistic in nature. It explains why Girder/Tony was able to shift into steel, why Mist turned into gas and why Barry is lightning* fast. However, an untriggered meta doesn't have to die or come into direct contact with whatever causes their gene to activate. Say an untriggered meta sees their child in danger, trapped under a boulder. The intense emotion and need to save their child could potentially trigger, giving the parent strength to lift, force enough to destroy by punching, cause control over minerals or even a telekinetic ability. YMMV.   Edit 2: I'm thinking the particle accelerator explosion triggered metahuman gene in an unknown amount of potentials whether they were in immediate danger or not and that could account for other as yet to be named metal and ones like Cisco and Caitlin. They (C&C) were also the closest metas to the explosion, so the intensity there could have been much stronger than other places and that could explain their triggering, too. In their instances, the gene was triggered by the blast and then 'panicked', not finding an immediate danger, so it chose what seemed to be the strongest possibility of physical or emotional threat. In Cisco's case (electromagnets) it chose physical. In Caitlin's case (cold, empty despair) it chose emotional."

FlashTV,3bwn33,trbond62,2,Thu Jul 2 19:41:48 2015 UTC,"He was there the night of the explosion, so he definitely would have been exposed. I'd say getting killed/un-killed via temporal shenanigans is the best way to trigger temporal powers"

FlashTV,3bwn33,Semmlbroesel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:52:47 2015 UTC,"My theory is that the explosion acts as a catalyst for the meta gene. The people that changed already possessed the necessary gene but the particle accelerator activated that gene quicker and gave them powers. It is possible that Cisco's genes were modifying but nothing had really triggered his evolution. So, we know that Vibe exists between two dimensions. I believe that the actual event that triggered his powers was Barry's time travel creating two distinct timelines, one with living Cisco and one with dead Cisco, and that divergence of the timelines resulted in Superpowered Cisco."

FlashTV,3c0txv,DarthTauri,7,Fri Jul 3 20:09:34 2015 UTC,It's not just about her anymore really. The entire website and mods are fed up with how the website is being run.
FlashTV,3c0txv,Keyboard_Key,11,Fri Jul 3 20:12:11 2015 UTC,I might just be a person who doesn't get affected by this alleged mismanagement but I never have a problem with how reddit works or anything.
FlashTV,3c0txv,DarthTauri,-7,Fri Jul 3 21:24:50 2015 UTC,Right so just because it doesn't affect you it doesn't matter? If it did affect you or the communities you visit wouldn't you want others to support you?
FlashTV,3c0txv,Keyboard_Key,7,Fri Jul 3 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"You don't throw a public tantrum just because stuff isn't going your way, do you?  That's what this situation is, except now it's a global sized tantrum because it's on the Internet.  If you don't like how reddit functions, leave.  If you're a mod, unhappy with the how your treated by the admins, quit being a mod.  I don't have problems with the site as it is, so I'll stay.  Since I don't own a piece of the site or work for the company the inner workings are none of my business... So, again, I'll stay."
FlashTV,3c0txv,DarthTauri,-4,Fri Jul 3 23:07:16 2015 UTC,How is it a public tantrum? You're completely dismissing what they're fighting for. These people have built strong communities over the years. It's THEIR subreddit.  Reddit does nothing but host subredits the reason reddit is succesful is because of the mods of the subreddits and the users that post content. They don't get paid or gain anything from it yet they do so because it's what they like. Calling them whiners or saying they're throwing tantrums because they fight against censorship and being treated poorly is an insult.
FlashTV,3c0txv,Keyboard_Key,7,Fri Jul 3 23:15:45 2015 UTC,"I really don't care about the censorship that happened. Based on the info is have to say closing those subs was for the better(not saying it's right).  Today's problem amounts to a bunch of children throwing a fit because their favorite storyteller isn't going to be around anymore.  We don't know why, maybe she stole from the company or something. Maybe it was a business decision, which sucks but is not unreasonable. We may never know the details, but it's none of our business in the first place.  Should the admins have warned those most affected? Yes, but (essentially) bringing the site down is just selfish."
FlashTV,3c0txv,DarthTauri,-6,Fri Jul 3 23:52:40 2015 UTC,"What do you mean their favorite story teller? She was practically in charge of organizing and making sure amas even happened. The mods were completely left in the dark. It also isn't just about subreddits being removed. Which is kind of funny being that they don't remove way worse subreddits. They only remove anything they don't agree with, including deleting posts and banning people."
FlashTV,3c0txv,Keyboard_Key,6,Sat Jul 4 00:36:34 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to be reductive just less wordy as to Victoria's job(and fit the metaphor).  As the ownership of this site, the administration of reddit has a right to protect itself and its interests from any threats... That includes any possible backlash from not removing hateful subs and comments that are creeping into the public consciousness."

Batman never kills, but he is more capable of doing so than most - so can you call him deadly? I don't think so. I would say that a willingness to kill is a prerequisite for being considered ""deadly"" - neither Strange nor Who are willing to kill when it's not necessary, so I don't think they should win.

Venom was not an accident, it was  derived from Miraculo in an attempt to increase the time limit past an hour.  MGH was 100% about activating and enhancing mutant powers in people. That's not up for debate. That was Hank's entire goal and he succeeded. It's literally his origin story.  Dibny was obsessed with contortionists and isolated a compound to increase the elasticity of his body.  Oscorp intentionally engineeredthe Goblin Formula.  Clavin just made strength formula. That's it. MGH, Exogene, Amazo, Goblin do that at their base and then some.  Hell, if you're a scientist in a comic book and haven't made a strength serum, you might as well not exist.

He can extend it to those he's carrying but as seen in the show it's an unreliable thing at the moment. The field is always around him, but normally is very close to his body. Since we don't see heat being forced off in all directions when he's running on the show, we can guess that he has the same properties as the DCU.  In short, Barry can give the Speedy-D to whomever he wants and they won't risk skin grafts."

It's a low quality post that the people of this subreddit don't think belongs here - so it was (appropriately) downvoted.  Now people are explaining this to you in the comments (/u/cayal3 may have been a bit sarcastic in his initial post, but I don't believe he meant any offense by it) and you're throwing a bit of a hissy fit.  These people are all actors - looking at Tom Cavanagh's wiki page he has been in 37 films and 27 television shows (not including The Flash).  We simply don't need people to make a post for every role every actor has ever been in.  We'd have over 50 for Wells, nevermind all the other characters on here.  P.S.

FlashTV,3bngat,lastkid13,11,Tue Jun 30 23:57:34 2015 UTC,"Had Batman? Sure. But we don't really need him to do the main Identity Crisis storyline. In fact, Batman and Robin's part could theoretically be done with Arrow and Arsenal, if they introduced Spoiler. The part is small enough that Colton could come back to guest star on a few episodes.

FlashTV,3bngat,pimpintuna,13,Wed Jul 1 01:09:35 2015 UTC,While I think the whole concept of is it right to wipe a villains mind is interesting I feel they through that all away when they did it to Bruce because when that happend they went from being morally ambiguous heroes to doing stright up villainous acts so they had zero sympathy from me. I'm also not a fan of how the whole rape was sort of brushed aside as a plot device for the heroes to use to mind wipe doctor light. The reveal of who the real killer is comes right out of left field and thats probably because fans guessed the actual killer early on and so  Meltzer and DC made a quick change. Also the deathstroke fight Pisses me off because of how unrealistic it is I mean he out wills kyle ring and that's not even how green lantern rings work. All in all if they ended up doing it its not like I'd stop watching the show but they probably wouldn't be my favorite episodes. Sue Dibnys death also rubs me the wrong way and just sort of seems unnecessary.
FlashTV,3bngat,Tyster20,2,Wed Jul 1 01:25:09 2015 UTC,"Personally I thought that the thing about wiping people's minds was a good bit of moral ambiguity. And Batman is just an exploration of those heroes as people. Flawed people. They had just had the worst time trying to decide what to do. And they finally come to a conclusion, when all of a sudden, Batman, who obviously won't approve and who is perceived by these people as having a ""high and mighty"" attitude, comes along. I mean, what would you, as a person, do at that point?  Their intention obviously wasn't malicious. They were doing what they thought was the right thing to do. Batman finding out about changing Light's personality would lead to him learning about them wiping minds, which he may take issue with. And they felt that the wiping of minds was integral to the safety of the Justice League.  It really shows that the Justice League is not as infallible as they're often portrayed, and how they're not all ""one big happy family"" and that not everyone has an overall positive image of everyone else.  Also, I don't think the killer came out of left field. It only makes sense the way they did it. As I was reading it, I was wracking my brain trying to figure out who it could've been. But it wouldn't have made sense for any of the suspects I had in mind. It only made sense for the final reveal.  Further, I really, really liked the Tim Drake and Digger Harkness arcs, which I felt did really well developing relationships between those characters and other characters, as well as being an emotionally compelling tragic story."
FlashTV,3bngat,TheExtremistModerate,2,Wed Jul 1 06:19:41 2015 UTC,"While I think the story was emotionally, I hate how the writing essentially friged Sue to make it work. Not only was she surpise raped for a new compelling backstory, she was later murdered while pregnant! I mean, seriously?  The killer also came out of literally nowhere, and the motive didn't make much sense. The murdered brought a flamethrower ""just in case."" Really."

FlashTV,3bngat,TwelfthCycle,4,Wed Jul 1 02:15:38 2015 UTC,Ya Identity Crisis is both amazing and fucking dark.  It's one of the most interesting arcs out there.  But I think they need more time.

FlashTV,3bngat,m0rfeas,8,Tue Jun 30 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"I agree about the reference but John Clark is probably a fake name, the same thing happened with Patty Spivot. Before the audition tapes were leaked they said that her name would be ""Wendy"" but in the leaked audition the girl introduces herself as Patty Spivot & not Wendy. She has one scene with Joe & another one with Barry. About the John Clark character, I watched the leaked videos & I thought that he might be Hal Jordan, he reminded me of him a lot but other fans think that he might be Jay Garrick & I kinda also agree with that too. He has one scene with Barry -he calls him 'kid'- & another one with Caitlin - I think.  The only sure thing that we know about him is that they described him as a ""cynical hero""."
FlashTV,3bngat,air_jordan1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:30:11 2015 UTC,Interesting. Do you think they're doing the same thing with that James Jones (or whatever they called him) character on LoT? He seems to be Victor Stone from his background on imdb.

FlashTV,3bngat,Airsay58259,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:19:37 2015 UTC,"Robbie Amell hasn't been announced for LOT (and for only one episode of the Flash so far). Every time someone asks the questions to the producers or the actors, they say something along the lines ""no comment"" or ""it will be explained in the Flash season 2"". In the LOT trailer, you can't see Firestorm's face at any moment (except the Flash footage) and Stein only refers to ""his other half"". So there are many theories: Ronnie dies/disappears and Stein merges with someone else, Robbie Amell will be a guest star again for some reason, but in the Flash finale he's saying that he stays in Central City so he should be a regular... Anyway, big mystery but it could just be the shows trolling us or waiting for Amell to sign a contract."

FlashTV,3bq2va,kaybeesee,11,Wed Jul 1 13:05:05 2015 UTC,I think now that he has some closure on his mother's death he will visit at some point next season
FlashTV,3bq2va,hmpsnj,6,Wed Jul 1 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"Those scenes are usually when the hero is trying to make a decision on how to handle something, but this Flash has a large group of close friends throughout season 1 who know what he's dealing with and most are very intelligent... so no real reason to go ponder it over a gravestone when you can go actually get some outside insight.  It could've fit in when he was pondering on whether or not to save Nora in the finale..... but do you really need to see him visit her gravestone right before we see him go back in time to her actual death?  And I think there could've been room for one at the very end... if there wasn't a blackhole destroying the city.  But even that's not needed because he got his closure with her right before she died."
FlashTV,3bq2va,AREYOUSauRuS,6,Thu Jul 2 00:51:29 2015 UTC,"Because Barry Allen isn't Bruce Wayne.  The death of his mother is important as a starting point of his drive, but visiting her grave was never important to the plot, so it didn't happen on-screen. But we also don't see EVERYTHING the characters do, especially a Speedster like Barry might very well visit her grave every week, or even every day, without us noticing as viewers.  A Batman show would have more of such scenes, because brooding is more part of his character."

FlashTV,3blyvn,8eat-mesa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"This is the superhero dilemma that every hero has to face, period. The question is would you save the one person you cared about if you knew it risked others.  Peter, would you go back and save Uncle Ben?  Bruce, would you save your parents?  Barry, would you save your mother?  The answer is of course. But, the question is never posed that easily for our heroes. The question is often.  ""Bruce, would you save your parents if in doing so you would never go on to become batman?""  Where in Bruce decides to not do so, because ""Gotham needs me in that mask.""  Barry tries to save his mother and starts an apocalypse, something he finds himself desperate to change."

Barry was already introduced pre lightning on Arrow, where he met Team Arrow. That's basically most of it. Other characters from Arrow will also appear, so you might have open questions here and there or wonder who the hell that guy on your screen is, but you should get through the series anyway. I highly recommend watching Arrow though, the crossovers are really great, when you know both shows. Flash will spoiler quite a bit of Arrow though, so you might want to catch up on Arrow first if you plan on watching it sometime in the future (unless you are good at forgetting stuff, then it should work)."

You should give Arrow a chance for yourself instead of not liking it because someone told you not to. If it wasn't for Arrow we wouldn't have The Flash."
FlashTV,3br3cx,wjkovacs420,3,Wed Jul 1 18:39:59 2015 UTC,Except the show Arrow is just Green Batman and not really Green Arrow.
FlashTV,3br3cx,TheCrimsonCritic,3,Thu Jul 2 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"Not really. Oliver as a character becomes lighter as it goes on, but the world was in an 'emo-superhero' phase back when they tried to get it picked up first, so they had to make him darker to get started.  But the Batman comparisons have always been really unfair. Batman doesn't like working with a team, and he certainly never gets close to them intentionally. Oliver is the opposite, as he actually acknowledges that he isn't skilled enough to do it alone. Oliver is a different character to both Batman and the comics Green Arrow. He's his own character. They say 'based on' at the end instead of 'ripped from the pages of' for a reason."
FlashTV,3br3cx,ScarletSpeedster17,3,Thu Jul 2 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"Arrow is 100% a clone of Batman and anyone who says otherwise have never read a Batman comic in their life. Examples:  1) The delivery of Team Arrow is a direct ripoff of the Batfamily. Felicity=Barbara Gordon (Oracle)/Lucius Fox, Diggle=Alfred, Roy Harper (Arsenal)=Jason Todd (Robin II), and not to mention Detective Lance is obviously Arrow's version of Lt. James Gordon. Arsenal is the only one who existed before the show but even then, he's still more Jason Todd than Roy Harper.  2) The entire Ra's Al Ghul & League of Assassins plot was ripped straight from Batman.  3) The ""No Killing Rule"" wouldn't be as big of a deal if Arrow didn't already take some many things from Batman.  4) The Arrow's ideals and actions are identical to Batmans. So much that the only difference between the 2 currently is their costumes.  5) Stephen Amell himself looks closer to Bruce Wayne than Oliver Queen and i'm pretty sure this wasn't a coincidence.   Arrow is a good Batman show, a decent Green Arrow show and a great TV show on it's own terms. Season 3 took it way to far into Batman territory."
FlashTV,3br3cx,SleeplessNightz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:23:42 2015 UTC,"Merlyn is affiliated with the LoA in the comics, and the only reason the League was even a huge plot was because of Merlyn. Other than that, it was just some assassin group that Sara joined. Also, Black Canary has ties to the LoA as well. So the Sara/Nyssa and Laurel/Nyssa scenes were a nod to that."
FlashTV,3br3cx,TheCrimsonCritic,0,Sun Jul 5 03:48:19 2015 UTC,"You're stretching those roles a bit. Diggle is not Alfred and you completely forgot to include Laurel or Thea. The character of 'computer whizz' is necessary in this kind of show because otherwise it becomes ridiculous how skilled the protagonist is. Except in the comics Batman never actually became Ra's al Ghul. But I will agree that this plot point is stolen from the source material (like the majority of fiction these days). Batman never killed while Oliver did so for a whole year. And the no-kill rule is shared by almost EVERY superhero. This point is invalid. Once again, every superhero follows these ideals. This point is also invalid as it is a trope, not a character trait. This is just plain wrong. Stephen Amell does not look like Bruce Wayne. He looks like a more adult Oliver Queen.    Do you have any more points that you made up off the top of your head? I'd be happy to discredit them."
FlashTV,3br3cx,ScarletSpeedster17,2,Fri Jul 3 10:48:45 2015 UTC,"1) Diggle is Alfred. Diggle was hired to watch over Oliver, Alfred was hired to help the Wayne's and later on Bruce. Both men stuck around when they found out about their late night vigilante activities. Both men became fully functional parts of the team. Both men are Army vets. Both men are the glue to the team, without Diggle or Alfred the whole operation would most likely fall apart. Black Canary exist in the comics but if you want to compare, her father being a cop is obviously based on Barbara's & Jims relationship. Thea is the only original character of the bunch.  2) It's still lifted right from the Batman comics.  3)Batman did in fact originally kill. It wasn't until the 1940's that his ""No Killing"" rule was put in place and it was only done because the Comic Code Authority wanted comics less violent. As usual, comics get retconned every few years so his murdering days aren't cannon anymore but him killing/changing his ideals was still cannon for a long time.  4) You left out the part about his actions. If you had a room full of villains, Green Arrow would jump into the middle and crack jokes immediately initiating a fight. Batman and his team would scope the place out, find out everything they can through any means and then attack. Which one sounds more like the Arrow?  5) You're trying to telling me brown haired, blue eyes, no facial hair Stephen Amell looks more like blonde haired, blonde goatee, green eyed Oliver Queen than black haired, blue eyes, no facial hair Bruce Wayne?  I'll be happy to discredit you anytime junior. Maybe I'll recommend you some comics so that you can actually have knowledge instead of what you read on wikipedia."
FlashTV,3br3cx,TheCrimsonCritic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"You're stretching the facts to fit your analogy, even if they may not be strictly true. I already conceded that. Anything before 1940 is not fair game. Everything was different back then. But Oliver ISN'T the Green Arrow. He's trying to be Batman. That's part of the point. The other part of the point is that he continuously fails to so. He will inevitably become the former, but he definitely isn't totally the latter. Stephen Amell has dirty blond hair. It's cut short. Blond people with hair that short will look brunette. Stephen Amell also has a beard and yeah he has blue eyes. Finding a decent actor that fits the image and has green eyes is bad casting. Blue is close enough."

Felicity makes regular visits to Central city to visit Barry while he's in the coma, which is how she knows everyone.  The Flash takes place in the same time line as Arrow Season 3, so there are regular crossovers between the two shows like that."

FlashTV,3bjtlm,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,23,Mon Jun 29 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"It could be as simple as him being experienced and knowing it's a bad idea and then ""remembering"" young Barry doing it and telling him not too.

FlashTV,3bjtlm,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Mon Jun 29 23:02:53 2015 UTC,"I actually think this is what happened. Eobard, as the Reverse Flash, told Barry ""it was your mother's destiny to die that night."" in 109. With that in mind and the finale's revelations, I understood that Eobard killed her in such a way that it would change Barry's life entirely, by framing his father (why else use a knife and not his hand?) and thus having him live with the Wests, while being haunted by his mother's mysterious murderer ""inside the lightning"". Nora, in the original timeline might have been killed by some burglars or in an accident, leaving Barry with his father and a death he could understand and accept, eventually at least.

Third original future flash, (there to stop himself from saving his mother having undergone flashpoint). Our Barry flash, that apparently never saves his mother and never goes through flashpoint.   And isn't future flash altering the timeline by stopping our Barry from saving his mother? That way, he wouldn't go through flashpoint and would never come back to stop another flash from saving his mother?  o_0 Haha I'm confused lol!"
FlashTV,3bjtlm,slodderkid,2,Tue Jun 30 12:56:11 2015 UTC,Your second flash is the third aswell he is the one who caused flashpoint and went back in time to stop it
FlashTV,3bjtlm,slodderkid,2,Tue Jun 30 13:36:39 2015 UTC,"Okay so if I understand this correctly, it means that if Flash travels back in time, he replaces himself if there's another version of him in the past from the same timeline? But if there's another version of him there from another branch of the timeline, he won't replace that version?  EDIT: But wouldn't that mean that there's still 3 Flashes present there that night? Unless the first 3 flashes are from the same timeline.. But then again, isn't Flashpoint considered a new timeline? :S"
FlashTV,3bjtlm,cmmgreene,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:53:33 2015 UTC,"I myself do think there were 2 flashes the moment eobard ran out of his speedforce Powers meant that there were  no flashes left, the flash that stopped our barry was the same one that saved his younger self. And about the timeline thingy Barry creates a different timeline everytime he changes the past."

FlashTV,3bjtlm,summitorother,3,Tue Jun 30 12:59:24 2015 UTC,This is my theory as well. Original Future Flash probably went back in time and saved his mom and then had to let her die after seeing the horrible world of Flashpoint.

FlashTV,3bjtlm,zoneluke,2,Tue Jun 30 13:47:32 2015 UTC,"The simplest explanation.    That's him from the future, he remembers being there before, he remembers future Flash stopping and waving him off, so he stopped and waved him off.  Why would he listen to future him?  wouldn't you listen to your future self?    After they clear up this black hole mess that the season finale ended with, he's gonna end up meeting Rip Hunter who will inform him of the importance of maintaining the integrity of the timeline, which would let him know in the future that when he goes back, he needs to prevent himself from saving his mom.    Flashpoint doesn't necessarily have to happen for him to learn about the integrity of the timeline.  I know you didn't mention Flashpoint, but everyone else seems to be responding under the assumption that Flashpoint has to happen for him to learn to not change the past."
FlashTV,3bjtlm,anotherDocObVious,4,Tue Jun 30 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"But in the interviews we've heard the directors and actors say that we'll see Caitlyn as Killer Frost next season.

FlashTV,3bjtlm,wolstonc,2,Tue Jun 30 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"We technically saw Killer Frost in the last episode in the speedforce.  I'm sure we'll see her again next season, but the possibilities of where she comes from is endless.  Could be our Caitlyn, could be a Caitlyn from the future, a Caitlyn from Earth 2, from Flashpoint Universe, from the moon.  Maybe not the moon.  Just gonna sit here and wait."
FlashTV,3bjtlm,BotBoyFM,2,Tue Jun 30 14:14:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you guys are getting some of this info from.  For starters, White Emblem Flash didn't go back in time specifically to save his mother.  He had no idea she was going to be killed by Eobard.  He went back in time because he was chasing the Reverse Flash who had just found out who Barry was and was going to use that against him.    The scuffle happens, White Emblem Flash gets Boy Barry out of dodge so Eobard doesn't just kill him right then and there, erasing White Emblem Flash from existence.  Just before he whisks Boy Barry out, he notices Season 1 Barry sitting in wait, and realizes he's there to interfere with something.  He's not sure what, because none of this happened to him.  He's just giving him a generalized ""seriously dude, don't fuck with the timestream"" warning, not a specific ""don't save mom"" warning.  There was only two Flashes there.  S1 Flash and White Emblem Flash.  White Emblem Flash was there to stop Eobard from fucking things up in the past, not specifically from killing his mom.  White Emblem Flashs' mother wasn't killed by Eobard when he was a child, so he wouldn't have any memory of knowledge of it happening.  They're clearly two separate instances of Flash, as he didn't merge into himself like he did when he traveled through time the first time during the Weather Wizard 2.0 episode.  It's that simple.  Or you know, not simple, but no where near as confusing as some of you think."
FlashTV,3bjtlm,morvis343,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:19:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, this seems the simplest explanation. But I don't understand the alternate timeline saga.. Sorry if I sound like a noob.   You said:   White Emblem Flash was there to stop Eobard from fucking things up in the past, not specifically from killing his mom. White Emblem Flashs' mother wasn't killed by Eobard when he was a child, so he wouldn't have any memory or knowledge of it happening.   So if Eobard killing Barry's mom creates a different timeline (our S1 timeline), and White Emblem Flash has no memory of it, then why does White Emblem Flash care what Eobard does in the past. Any change Eobard makes in the past will just create a new timeline wouldn't it, and not affect White Emblem Flash's memories? Even if Eobard does kill young Barry, wouldn't that just create an alternate timeline? Which would mean our S1 Barry would never exist, but White Emblem Flash would still be there in another timeline?"
FlashTV,3bjtlm,MaulerX,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:11:55 2015 UTC,Well as we have seen Barry can time travel and exist in a new timeline with his memories intact.   Of course in the end more could be going on.

The third is our Red logo Barry who just entered into the ""save my mom"" timeline, but is stopped by the first Barry.

FlashTV,3bkfet,FrozenRaider,3,Mon Jun 29 23:48:21 2015 UTC,I just watched it for the first time yesterday.
FlashTV,3blbxq,AreYouDeadYet9,5,Tue Jun 30 03:48:16 2015 UTC,"First off, you have to know that there have been four people that have taken on the mantle as The Flash. They are Jay Garrick (40s-50s), Barry Allen (50s-80s, 2010-now), Wally West (80s-2010), and Bart Allen (06-07).  The two that get the most recognition are Barry Allen and Wally West. Here are some recommendations:   Barry Allen: Most of his stories are from the 50s-80s and I haven't read any of those. Just know that he sacrificed himself during Crisis on Infinite Earths and go from there.   Flash: Rebirth: This is the reintroduction of Barry to the DC Universe. It's a fantastic story and I highly recommend it. It features the Flash Family (Jay Garrick, Wally West, Bart Allen, Jesse Quick, and Max Mercury).  Dastardly Death of the Rogues: This comes right after Rebirth and Blackest Night(Green Lantern story) but it is still a Flash story. Rogues from the future come back to try and arrest Barry. It's a very fun story and I recommend it. Flashpoint: Probably the best Flash story I've ever read IMO. Major time travel consequences. If you watch the show, then you'll understand this story.  New 52 Flash series: After Flashpoint, DC did a reboot on a majority of the characters, and The Flash was one of them. This will retell the origin story of Barry Allen and explore his time as The Flash. It's a great story, and the artwork is phenomenal.   Wally West: Former Kid Flash, turned The Flash. He becomes The Flash right after the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.   Read this list in order to get a good taste of Wally West. I read a good majority of that list and got a good understanding of the character.  You could read Wally's solo run before you get to Flash: Rebirth if you want. Rebirth is one of the last stories you'll see Wally West as The Flash.  I hope this helps! Have fun reading!"
FlashTV,3blbxq,walterpinkman45,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:15:04 2015 UTC,Wow thanks! Would of probably been confused not knowing that. Do Barry Allen and Wally west have the same suit?
FlashTV,3blbxq,walterpinkman45,2,Tue Jun 30 18:28:21 2015 UTC,"They're very similar. Wally's Flash suit is darker than Barry's and also has white eyes. Barry's suit doesn't have the white eyes, so you can see his eyes."
FlashTV,3blbxq,Deadstarone,2,Tue Jun 30 18:43:29 2015 UTC,Oh I see now! Just googled it and the eyes are the biggest difference. Thanks again
FlashTV,3blbxq,walterpinkman45,3,Tue Jun 30 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"Their belts are also different.  Generally, Wally has two lightning bolts that meet in the middle and curve downward.  Barry, traditionally has one solid lightning bolt that wraps around his waist in a circle.  Fair warning because Wally eventually drops the white lenses and looks a lot more like Barry's costume."

As long as you know the Flash basics (who the Rogues are, Speed Force, etc.) you should be fine. They explain stuff along the way, too, but if you have the basics then you'll be fine.  tl;dr: Flash New 52 vol. 1 is a nice point to start."

FlashTV,3bioag,Theculshey,5,Mon Jun 29 21:57:57 2015 UTC,"The plan was never to confine them for the rest of their lives, it was to rehabilitate/depower them. Hartley was a genuine danger who was out to kill Wells and Barry and possibly Cisco and Caitlin. Not to mention way too intelligent for the regular police to handle.  They reached an ultimatun with cold agreeing never to kill anyone again. And again, Cold is too well connected to have been kept in regular prison anyway.  As for Oliver?

WAIT ONE FUCKING SECOND.   what if Barry and reverse flash go fighting off in the distance. It seems off if reverse flash just goes and runs away. And when Barry (4) tells Barry (1) to stay then Barry (3) disappears and eobard returns because the Barry he fights vanishes because that time line wouldn't exist. So he comes back by himself to kill Barry's mom.   Oh wait... I don't think that's how it works... Am I wrong?

I'd need to rewatch the scene but it could make sense actually... Only 2 adult Barrys means that white logo Barry is the one fighting Eobard and also the one telling our Barry not to save his mother, but why would he bother fighting Eobard if he didn't want to save Nora? (it may be obvious but I just woke up so be nice)"
FlashTV,3bgqfp,MainlyPardoo,7,Mon Jun 29 11:53:27 2015 UTC,Because eobard came back to kill young Barry. He only took his mom as a consolation prize
FlashTV,3bgqfp,khilbery,2,Mon Jun 29 13:36:47 2015 UTC,"But white logo Barry apparently knew that it was a very bad idea to save Nora, implying he had done it before and knew what was best. I don't think any Barry would accept Nora's death without a very good reason (seeing the consequences himself, a future Barry telling him not to...), especially since she died instead of kid Barry."

This is part of the reason Amanda Waller was worked out of Arrow this last season, and also why the Arrow writers had Deadshot killed off. It's not like they wanted to do these things, it's just the bigwigs at DC/Warner Bros didn't want these villains in both the shows and the movies."
FlashTV,3bey7f,Greyhound272,6,Mon Jun 29 07:21:32 2015 UTC,"That's not true. The Producers already discussed those rumors. They couldn't use Waller because the actress had other projects, and nothing has been said for Boomer.  The Deadshot one is true though."
FlashTV,3bey7f,danielr1341,8,Tue Jun 30 16:57:18 2015 UTC,I must admit to not being that versed to the Flashs Rouges gallery but how many are even left and how many could be a season long threat.    It can't be another speedster since it'll be too similar to RF. Grodd is too budget heavy and I don't think they'll do all the Rouges.    I wonder if they'll do an Arrow and borrow from another hero or if now since there world is getting so big they'll stick to Flash.
FlashTV,3bey7f,mflbatman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:06:29 2015 UTC,I'm thinking a Superman villain if they go down that route. Lex Luthor?
FlashTV,3bey7f,danielr1341,19,Sun Jun 28 17:59:52 2015 UTC,Probably not lex for a few reason.   1) He'll be part of the DCU  2) Too big a superman villain and it doesn't make a lot of sense for him to hate the flash like he does Superman.   Ras made sense and although it was a similar story to batman still makes sense with Oliver. Lex however wouldn't because Flash is human and most of Lexs hatred of Superman comes from the fact he is an alien.
FlashTV,3bey7f,regendo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"Well it could be that he doesn't really have anything against the Flash, their objectives just happen to be different. But yeah, I'd prefer someone who has a reason to be a Flash villain."
FlashTV,3bey7f,danielr1341,7,Sun Jun 28 18:52:01 2015 UTC,"But it would be a waste of his character to do so.   A good villain should have more than just their goals being different.   Merlyn, Slade and RF were all great because of that."

FlashTV,3bey7f,Dreamlancer,13,Mon Jun 29 03:32:43 2015 UTC,"Day late to this, but I would love to see the Black Flash introduced, but in a similar fashion to Smallville.  The first season had a running theme of Barry isn't fast enough to stop the man in yellow. This theme is great for the series because it makes the fastest man alive not fast enough to protect the people he cares about.  Well the way the Black Flash worked in the Smallville comics was the Flash could run as much as he wanted, but the faster he ran and the more often he did it, he would see this black speed demon catching up to him threatening to end his own existence.  A death via the speed force.  If I were a writer for the series, I'd make the overarching story for season two is in an effect the opposite/a combination of the idea for the first season.  Barry has now gotten too fast and found the attention of the Black Flash/Speed demon. As consequence, Barry believes that he must be faster, just as he has solved all of his problems before in the past.  However Barry finds that no matter how much faster he gets, the Black Flash is always right there behind him as if he is growing in speed the faster Barry goes.  The midseason finale or ideal will be a minor crossover with Arrow as Barry struggles with his plight and the speed demon's appearance nearly ruin's his mission with Oliver. Barry feeling guilty over the near death of a friend realizes that he can't hope to save his own city if he first can't save himself. He then resigns himself to no longer using his speed until he can find a way to combat this speed demon.  The end of that episode will be Felicity doing some computer magic cross referencing speed and energy generated like Barry's over a period of time over the globe. She is looking for any particular spot that would prove to be a viable area for Barry to generate enough speed where he couldn't hurt people that is also a viable blah blah blah blah.  However the midseason finale reveals that Felicity found another energy signal that reads similar to Barry's, but not identical in Utah's outskirts.  The season then picks up with Barry leaving Central City to go check out this energy reading.  The city is in chaos. The tagline reads, ""Flash disappears in Crisis.""  Barry is in Utah and tracks the signal to a single house. Opening the door is none other than Jay Garrick.  Jay's character explains why he is there, who he is, and why he stopped running and secluded himself to the outskirts of Utah. He stopped using his speed for the same reason Barry stopped.  Barry says he needs his speed back because his city needs him.  Jay fires back if saving his city is worth his own life.  Barry convinces Jay that it is. The two then decide to work together. They believe that if they both run together, they will generate enough speed force(Explained to Barry for the first time by Jay) in order to combat this speed demon.  The two have an epic moment where the run across the united states with the demon following them as Barry tries to pull along the slower but more experienced Jay Garrick who is trying his best to accomplish this so that Barry can go on to save his city.  It's here they fail, and nearly lose their lives in the process.  ""Even the two of us together aren't fast enough kid."" Jay claims, ""We've got no way to slow the thing down, it will just feed off our energy til it drops.""  Barry has an Epiphany, but also a morale cringe. ""I have an idea.""  The remainder of the season is Barry brings to his team the idea of harnessing the negative speed force like Dr. Wells was able to. Using the negative speed force to slow the speed demon down.  This ingenuity goes on for a bit until Cisco reveals that they would need someone as a conduit for the negative speed force, and Barry would need to go into another speed force tunnel to find one.  More morale and ethical questions are presented on how much Central City needs to flash, as this is their last shot. The demon will catch Barry if they fail.  Barry does it. He rushes through the speed force, the demon is on his heels. He is pushing it faster and faster seeing potential futures just like the end of the first season. Great things he could accomplish if he lives. However then gradually the images begin turning dark. His future becomes bleaker. Cities ruined. Chaos in the streets. A destroyed central city. All of these continue to appear as Barry begins to outrun the speed demon.  Then the image of a dead Iris is too much for Barry as he skids to a halt out of the speed force, realizing that the price to pay for the city to have the flash at it's possible destruction is too much.  He turns around and the speed demon is barring down on him, but also significantly behind in this speed force tunnel.  Although just before the demon reaches Barry, It's torn asunder as something bursts through the demon running straight through it and dispersing it into black ink/smoke.  Then behind our hero we hear,  ""Well well Mr. Allen. We meet again.""  Anyways I feel that overall this wraps of the season in a meaningful way. Arrow's season two was great. However is was largely great because of Manu's incredible portrayal of Slade, a friend turned villain.  We saw portions of that near the end of season one with Wells, and it's why the dynamic between the team and Wells over the course of the season was so great.  This brings back that theme of having an overarching story and a minor villain that represents a theme. (EX someone saving the glades) before bringing in the true villain that really just wants revenge against our hero.  However now our hero isn't this rookie that the mentor once fought. The hero has gone through hardship, training, and has fought things equally skilled as his opponent now, and it proves to be just what he needs to fight our villain.  Here is Harrison Well's return as Zoom.  Now you can end the season there if you wish."
FlashTV,3bey7f,Saif-pineapple,4,Tue Jun 30 10:20:07 2015 UTC,"Wow. Brilliant. Although this might be hard to pull over 20 episodes if the villain is being introduced early on. There could be hints all season, little visions, and at the mid-season finale we end on Barry turning around to find Black Flash.  Your writing is amazing though. Truly worthy of a flash movie."
FlashTV,3bey7f,TheMurderCapitalist,3,Tue Jun 30 22:02:21 2015 UTC,"The Black Racer? I'd actually love Mirror Master, he's got such a unique ability but I don't see him as a season long villain. The only other obvious choice would be Grodd"
FlashTV,3bey7f,m0rfeas,3,Sun Jun 28 23:02:21 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Daniel West but this might not happen yet since season 1 had a RF already & Eobard's story is not over so maybe season 2 will have Mirror Master, Killer Frost or Grodd. We'll might get a Vandal Savage easter egg too that will lead us to The Legends of Tomorrow."
FlashTV,3bey7f,closetsquirrel,2,Sun Jun 28 18:33:31 2015 UTC,My guesses would be:   Mirror Master Doctor Light The Outsider Ma'alefa'ak Crime Syndicate Maxwell Lord
FlashTV,3bey7f,TheSemaj,5,Mon Jun 29 02:10:07 2015 UTC,Ma'alefa'ak without Martian Manhunter and Maxwell Lord without the Justice League would be weird. The others could br pretty cool though.

FlashTV,3bey7f,gaensblogger,0,Tue Jun 30 00:38:49 2015 UTC,"If it's not Mirror Master, my next guess is Caitlin Snow as Killer Frost. She's not the most significant villain in the comics, but the show deviates from the comics, and Caitlin already has such a big role in the show. I can't find the link now, but I remember reading an article or two a couple months back some EP from 'The Flash' saying they're thinking it's Mirror Master. Grant Gustin not implying it's Mirror Master could be a sign the writers are back to the drawing board, and it might not be Mirror Master. We only saw Gorilla Grodd for one or two episodes in season 1. Obviously, the depiction of Grodd we saw near the end of the season didn't do justice to what Grodd is like in the comics. His representation on the 'Justice League' cartoon from a few years back made him one of my favorite characters on that show. Anyway, they left a cliffhanger for Grodd making it seem clear he'll be at least a minor villain in future seasons. What I think the writers could do with Grodd is run with the idea of his growing intelligence, and as he grows smarter and smarter he becomes an ever greater threat to the Flash. I'd like that, but a psychic gorilla as a main character might be too much for live, prime-time television. I don't think Captain Cold will be the Big Bad. As Captain Cold might be the greatest Flash adversary, or at least equal to Reverse-Flash, he needs to be in the show. I think he'll keep being a minor villain, but as a recurring character every season from now on. Like, Cold and his Rogues will plague the Flash for half a dozen episodes each season. However, the last episode with Weather Wizard and Captain Cold teased the Rogues pretty heavily, and they didn't develop it enough. Captain Cold's villainy will take a backseat to his transition to antihero on Legends of Tomorrow. I think The Flash writers, having come from a great show like Arrow, are learning even more about refreshing conventional plot tropes by changing up pacing. The storyline from Season 1 isn't wrapped up yet. It could take a few episodes into Season 2 to finish. Eddie Thawne could come back as Cobalt Blue. Tom Cavanagh is confirmed to reappear as Harrison Wells and/or Eobard Thawne. Caitlin, Cisco, and Wally West might all become metahumans in season 2. The Flash series breaks the mold a bit by not having only one major antagonist each season, and could keep going in that direction. Maybe the Flash will need to develop as a real superhero, and the conflict of Season 2 will be him learning to juggle facing multiple Little Bads all at once."

FlashTV,3bc1z2,shaunsanders,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:08:49 2015 UTC,"Blueshift:       A blueshift is any decrease in wavelength, with a corresponding increase in frequency, of electromagnetic waves; the opposite effect is referred to as redshift. In visible light, this shifts the color from the red end of the spectrum to the blue end. The term also applies when photons outside the visible spectrum (e.g., X rays and radio waves) are shifted toward shorter wavelengths, as well as to shifts in the de Broglie wavelength of particles. Blueshift is most commonly caused by relative motion toward the observer, described by the Doppler effect. An observer in a gravity well will also see infalling radiation gravitationally blueshifted, described by General Relativity in the same way as gravitational redshift. In a contracting universe, cosmological blueshift would be observed; the expanding universe gives a cosmological redshift, and the expansion is observed to be accelerating.

By comic-book-cosmic-law he has to get some superpowers out of it if he comes back and Cobalt Blue would kinda fit.  But I personally see one huge problem with it and sadly a pure technical one. If they make his powers like the comic version it would be like having a second Flash on the show CGI wise and I don't think they have the budget for that.

I don't really want to have yet another RF-focused season, having Mirror Master be the main villain instead of being with the Rogues would be strange, and I imagine that Vandal Savage would spend most of his time over on LoT.  As for the theory /u/Anubissama mentioned I feel like having Eddie be the main villain would be corny. Just crossing my fingers that they give us Grodd. :("
FlashTV,3bb1wp,Capn_C,20,Sat Jun 27 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"I would prefer to see no Grodd this season. Give him time to come up with a plan and then let him blow us away in Season 3 or 4. Don't get me wrong, I love Grodd and I really want a whole Grodd-centered season, but I feel like having him as the big S2 villain would be too soon."
FlashTV,3bb1wp,DuEbrithil,2,Sat Jun 27 18:42:20 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, but on the other hand they gave us Reverse Flash in the very first season so I think they could easily make a Grodd-centered S2 work."
FlashTV,3bb1wp,Jz23210,3,Sat Jun 27 18:50:10 2015 UTC,"If they decide to go for Grodd, I'd be happy. I trust the writers to get it right. But I do think that this season was only the first one about Reverse Flash and that Grodd will only get one major story arc (I'd love more though), so my guess (and hope) would be that it comes later. I think it would be cooler to have the Flash fight him, when Barry has full control over his powers. But if the writers think it's already Grodd-time, it's Grodd-time!"

Don't think it will be Grodd either as Grant mentions ""introduced"" and we all know we have seen Grodd already. Can't really imagine it being another speedster/reverse flash so to me Mirror Master is one of the biggest villains not yet introduced in the universe so my money is on him."
FlashTV,3bb1wp,drproximo,3,Sat Jun 27 19:41:24 2015 UTC,Mirror Master or maybe an introduction to Vandal Savage?

We could easily end up in another timeline where Wells-Thawne is still alive and kicking, or maybe he will be the real Harrison Wells.

FlashTV,3bexhw,Patius,3,Sun Jun 28 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"And no not really. CW aren't great with relationships.   It's not so much this as romantic drama in comic books/comic book shows can basically be boiled down to 3 different ways of creating conflict/drama (sorry for the long post in advance:)   Hero's girl get's kidnapped/or killed. This damsel in distress or girlfriend in refrigerator trope is unpopular to use now, as it has been abused to death in the past and can be disrespectful towards women by treating them more like objects, and has fallen out of use. Create drama between the characters due to misunderstandings,  characters being stubborn/stupid, or through character flaws. This causes issues with DC superheroes because, usually you have two flawed characters, so you don't end up hating one of them. But a few of the big DC Superheroes (especially the Flash and Superman)  are just upstanding nice guys, so you're stuck making the woman the flawed character every time (it's happened in the comics too; Lois Lane ended up acting like a total idiot/bitch to poor Clark in the mid 1990's right before the wedding album because they ran out of good excuses to delay the wedding so that Lois and Clark could have their TV wedding first.) You have bad stuff happen to the main hero outside of the relationship. This generally works really well (see Death of Superman, which was the first way they tried to delay the Lois & Clark comics wedding so that the TV show couple would get married first,) but sometimes doesn't (see Arrow S3 and the olicity trainwreck). Even when it does, you can't use it in the first season.    Personally, the Flash did a good job of using 2 compared to other stuff. Iris was stupid sometimes, but it was never like ""holy shit this character should be killed off because she's extremely annoying."" (Incidentally, that's how i felt about Felicity by the end of S3.) Like Laurel, there's a bit of character growth that I assume will happen that will make her better."

FlashTV,3bexhw,Airsay58259,3,Mon Jun 29 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"She was kinda okay before the big love confession IMO, not relevant to the plot sure but she was at least her own character and had some stories (like when she shot the Clock King), but ever since the mid season finale... All her scenes were about the romance and love triangles (I can't believe we got TWO of those in one season). Her behavior with Linda was childish. Barry around Iris is like an excited puppy who suddenly has no morale and it bothers me a lot (but don't blame Iris for that), he looks more obsessed with her than in love... Anyway, the romance doesn't get better but Iris in the very end of the season is kinda okay. Hopefully they keep the good writing for S2.   About her relevance to the plot though I wonder if they'll ever manage to include her entirely into it. Basically all the metahumans cases involve science, it's like CSI: The Flash (even though the actual CSI of the show, Barry, isn't the one doing the scientific stuff). Sure she can provide some infos but be a full time member of the team? I don't see how if she has a full time job as a journalist and they won't give her career enough screen time without Barry. It's funny how the writers for The Flash 1990 didn't even try to include Iris, they shipped her off to France and used the Star Lab doc as a partner for Barry and his love interest. Maybe it's easier to write these stories when the pair works together (like Clark and Lois) because they share a lot more screentime.   Edit: what a rant, sorry."
FlashTV,3bexhw,Capt-Sunshine11,4,Sun Jun 28 17:29:15 2015 UTC,Nah I agree with you  Maybe they should sent her to France too in S2 lol  The rest of the show is just so great (especially the last episodes have been awesome) that Iris and the romance subplot just feel out of place

FlashTV,3b77bi,ReverseFlashBot,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:16:00 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the Marvel shows (which I love) didn't stand the test of time compared to Batman TAS. A lot of it has to do with Marvel's 90s visual style that didn't age well, but also I personally think the writing/storytelling was more memorable and the attention to detail was deeper on Batman and Gargoyles. I still vividly recall Gargoyles' Phoenix Gate and Avalon sagas, as well as its multiples Whovian and Shakespearean nods. So many layers. And the pervasiveness of the occult/supernatural on this series was just fascinating. As a New Yorker, I also loved that they depicted in detail many NYC landmarks like the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Coney Island or Central Park (complete with the Bethesda Terrace and the Alice in Wonderland sculpture!). Batman TAS was and still is in a league of its own. What sets it apart from the other animated series is not the hero, but the villains. It has the best villains in any animated series in my opinion. Also it introduced us to one of the most recognizable characters in pop culture: Harley Quinn. If I had to rank all these shows I would put the Marvel series not far behind Batman and Gargoyles."
FlashTV,3b77bi,ssup3rm4n,2,Sun Jun 28 09:11:42 2015 UTC,"Never really watched gargoyles but I still hold Batman as the best animated show of all time, but I think you're discounting shows like Spiderman which in a lot of people's opinion was incredible and X Men which is one of the best and most faithful adoptions of a comic series ever. Yeah the art style may not have held up but the stories were great."

FlashTV,3b77bi,THEMESSlAH,17,Fri Jun 26 18:19:15 2015 UTC,Stephen is 6'1 so they're pretty much the same height.
FlashTV,3b77bi,mmemmetee,21,Fri Jun 26 18:33:11 2015 UTC,Yeah but on the show Barry just seems shorter. Maybe it's just because he's so much skinnier I just get an optical illusion that he's smaller.
FlashTV,3b77bi,NewToBikes,32,Fri Jun 26 18:41:06 2015 UTC,"a speed mirage, if you will"
FlashTV,3b77bi,davanillagorilla,14,Fri Jun 26 22:11:38 2015 UTC,He's really only 6'0 because Stephen Amell is an inch taller than him.  I've noticed that they do a lot of camera tricks on Flash to make Grant look shorter. They rarely show Candice standing next to Grant because she's barely 5'4. I'm also pretty sure she stands on a box sometimes in close up scenes with Grant just to be shoulder level to him. Danielle is always in heels around Grant so he doesn't seem tall around her so that puts her at at least 5'9 from her 5'7 height. Everyone else is taller than Grant on the show except for Rick and Carlos. I always forget how tall Grant is until I see him off the show. He also has that boyish look to him and slouches so everyone else just seems bigger.
FlashTV,3b77bi,mmemmetee,3,Fri Jun 26 19:36:37 2015 UTC,"He's actually 6'2"" according to google which would be an inch taller than Stephen  I never noticed those camera tricks but that's an interesting point. Whenever I watched the show it always struck me how tall he was compared to everyone else. I didn't know his height before but I always just assumed he was over 6ft."
FlashTV,3b77bi,vultureslayer,6,Fri Jun 26 20:09:53 2015 UTC,"I know he's listed at 6'2 but if you look at the videos and any event pictures, he's clearly shorter than Stephen. Which is why I think he's really only 6'0. If you look up Brandon Routh who plays Ray Palmer, he's listed and confirmed to be 6'2.5 and he is clearly taller than Grant. Actors lying about their height isn't new. But Grant is still tall regardless of that two inch listed difference."
FlashTV,3b77bi,mmemmetee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:28:54 2015 UTC,"Fine, then Stephen is 6'4"".  /s"
FlashTV,3b77bi,NewToBikes,3,Sat Jun 27 03:57:38 2015 UTC,"Dude, Grant looks shorter in both of those pictures.. And I think it's much easier for a celebrity to lie about their height than you think. It's even hard to find accurate heights of professional athletes."
FlashTV,3b77bi,OK_Soda,5,Fri Jun 26 20:35:52 2015 UTC,"Actually, celebrities lie about their heights all the time. No one measures the actors when they go for screen tests because no one really cares unless the person is a foot shorter than said. I used to visit a site that's sole purpose is to determine a celebrity's real height. The owners verify the heights by actually meeting the celebrities at events and take footwear into consideration.  Here is Brandon, Grant, and Stephen Grant and Stephen are very similar in height. But most of the time Stephen is taller than Grant unless Grant has his hair up and is wearing sneakers compared to Stephen's dress shoes. Brandon is verified at 6'2.5 and Grant has never looked only half an inch shorter than him. Grant is still a tall guy regardless of those two inches. He looked taller on Glee than on Arrow. It's just the setting and the camera angles. Not a big deal.  Edit: By the way, just found out that David Ramsey who plays Diggle is 6'2. Grant is definitely not as tall as him. Still tall nonetheless though."

Though there is a problem with that cause every time he would vibrate his face so people don't recognize him, it would take really long for him. Also, if he's talking while running, he would have to talk in slow-motion to keep up with the pace of speech of the rest of team flash."

But the standard is that he doesn't speed everything up equally.  He can make just his arms move super fast, just his legs, or just his perception.  So there's no reason to assume everytime he moves super fast, everything is slowed down."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,AREYOUSauRuS,16,Sat Jun 27 16:10:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's a given that everything slows down for him. If he didn't perceive at a faster rate, he'd be crashing everywhere.  Imagine you're traveling at the speed of sound, you wouldn't be able to register a wall coming at you with regular perception."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,CarrotcakeSuperSand,7,Sat Jun 27 16:34:52 2015 UTC,"he'd be crashing everywhere.   Which he had done a few times in the beginning episodes, showing that he was moving fast but not perceiving fast."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,AREYOUSauRuS,7,Sat Jun 27 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness though, Barry's powers aren't constant. They depend on many factors, like Barry's emotional state. That's why he could travel back in time during the Weather Wizard attack, but on the treadmill. Wells explains it in the episode after Barry travels back.  TL;DR http://i.imgur.com/P8tJImV.gif"

FlashTV,3b9zz2,LambentEnigma,8,Sat Jun 27 20:15:20 2015 UTC,I believe that's how we first meet Barry's powers.  He's at Jitters and sees things in what we'd call slow motion.
FlashTV,3b9zz2,bontesla,6,Sat Jun 27 16:09:32 2015 UTC,"He isn't trained in martial arts, but he's able to grab a bullet before it goes inside of him. He's extremely fast, when Shawna teleports behind him or someone throws a punch, why can't he just move super fast? What's the difference between someone swinging a baton at you from behind and someone shooting you? Except the shooting one is a million times faster."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,TheChaosController,15,Sat Jun 27 05:51:32 2015 UTC,"I imagine the sound of a gun going off is many, many times easier to react to."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,Trolley33,16,Sat Jun 27 05:55:46 2015 UTC,"Just nit-picking, but there is no way to hear a gun go off before the bullet hits you, since bullets travel faster than sound."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,Prodigy195,8,Sat Jun 27 12:26:35 2015 UTC,There is subsonic ammo though. .300 blackout and .45 ACP is often subsonic...not that it mattered for the show purposes.

FlashTV,3b9zz2,FusedIon,2,Sat Jun 27 16:15:27 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what sound is. And if you're talking about the little pocket of air pressure atound the bullet, and him feeling that, I suppose that is possible."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,Spizard,-6,Sat Jun 27 19:45:42 2015 UTC,"Than the poof she makes when she teleports? Or the dozens of noises she makes while swinging a baton? It just doesn't make sense. If you're able to slow down time, why not slow it down for the entire fight?   Don't see Shawna? No problem! I can slow down time and check my surroundings.  I'm getting thrown around by Girder? Hey! I can slow down time and just crawl away!"
FlashTV,3b9zz2,TheChaosController,33,Sat Jun 27 05:58:20 2015 UTC,Because in the end its a tv show and its sole purpose is entertainment.  Barry winning every fight instantly is not entertaining.
FlashTV,3b9zz2,MeloneGuru,15,Sat Jun 27 06:02:23 2015 UTC,"The answer is simple, we simply wouldn't have any conflict. The Flash is extremely powerful and therefore as fast as the plots demands. It has also been addressed in the show, once Barry got his powers he became reckless and threw his observational/situational skills to the wayside."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,TheChaosController,3,Sat Jun 27 06:02:37 2015 UTC,"And that right there is the inherent problem with speedsters, they're only fast when it's convenient to the plot. That's not smart entertainment, that's bad writing that too many people simply accept in my opinion."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,ConcordApes,10,Sat Jun 27 06:55:18 2015 UTC,"It's not like it's a problem exclusive to speedsters however, many superheroes are too powerful for lower level  situations. I mostly chalk it up to the fact that coolness takes priority over realism because....well, comic books. Just like it can be hard to make the stakes for Superman mean much when he's nigh immortal. Really the only thing I can think of that'll fix it is upgrading villains  (obviously), and having more and more civilians in the way."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,TheWanderingN00b,3,Sat Jun 27 07:01:24 2015 UTC,"His brain can speed up to digest a lot of information all in one sitting. But his brain isn't always running that fast, just as he isn't always running at supersonic speed.  I would suggest that he doesn't always have his brain sped up to react.  That is why a bullet being shot, gets him to react fast in a flight or fight mode, but someone coming from behind with a baton does not illicit the same reaction."

FlashTV,3b9zz2,SockPenguin,34,Sat Jun 27 11:19:33 2015 UTC,I believe one of the main subplots of episode three is that Barry needs to consume a massive amount of calories or he'll suffer from hypoglycemia. Cisco made him a compact super energy bar.
FlashTV,3b9zz2,agreedis,2,Sat Jun 27 05:47:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, I kind of remember that. Thanks."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,blockpro156,15,Sat Jun 27 05:50:01 2015 UTC,"They cover the caloric intake in the second episode. Barry keeps getting dizzy/fainting because he wasn't eating enough, so Cisco made special protein bars to keep him on top of it. They also make a point of Barry eating absurd amounts of food on a few occasions too.  As for the combat stuff, part of it is Barry's speed working as the plot demands (i.e., fast enough to react to a bullet piercing his skin or lightning about to strike but not fast enough to dodge a fist) and part of it is just Barry not really having any fighting skills."

FlashTV,3b9zz2,platinumrug,7,Sat Jun 27 08:25:51 2015 UTC,"Barry has extremely fast reflexes, that's how he caught the bullet. But he can't fight someone purely with his reflexes, he doesn't know any good fight moves so that's why he sucks."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,lame_corprus,2,Sat Jun 27 16:35:54 2015 UTC,"That's the argument everyone uses, but it makes zero sense. Why wouldn't he be able to move super fast when he doesn't see Peek A Boo? Fighting literally is your reflexes. No one should ever be able to hit someone who can always be moving at the speed of light. Makes literally no sense."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,JumpingCactus,2,Sat Jun 27 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"Unconscious reflexes don't always kick in though, no matter how fast you are. So when he needs to consciously react to something in a fight then he still has to rely on his skill, even if it's enhanced by his speed.    (His speed is also a skill, he's nowhere near his top speed yet. Even though they did show him getting faster throughout the season, they still only measure his running speed. His fighting speed is completely different and probably takes a lot more control.)"
FlashTV,3b9zz2,lame_corprus,2,Sat Jun 27 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"Barry doesn't ALWAYS move at the speed of light. People need to understand this, he moves fast but not all the time."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,FloatingEyeofDeath,-1,Sat Jun 27 22:01:02 2015 UTC,Like when he was fighting Oliver? And Oliver couldn't touch him? Did he lose his ability to move super fast fighting Peek A Boo?

FlashTV,3b9zz2,melibelli,8,Sat Jun 27 13:32:02 2015 UTC,"Aw yes. But it'd cost a bunch of money. It'd also be a bit weird to say, ""I'd like 100 large pizzas, please."""

FlashTV,3b9zz2,IAmFern,10,Sun Jun 28 20:40:27 2015 UTC,"Because he's a 25 year old nerd that only got into a few fights when he was a kid and got his ass kicked in every single one of them.  If you woke up with superspeed and powers like the Flash, would you instantly be a master in Martial Arts?"
FlashTV,3b9zz2,JumpingCactus,-2,Sat Jun 27 17:09:53 2015 UTC,Seriously? Have you read a single word I've said? He has SUPER SPEED. If someone is trying to do some crazy MMA shit on me I'd go super fast mode and tie them up. It's not difficult. You don't need to know how to fight when you move faster than sound.
FlashTV,3b9zz2,matrixdune,3,Sat Jun 27 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, tying someone up while moving at super speed =/= being adept at hand-to-hand combat."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,randomlightning,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:55:10 2015 UTC,Being adept at h2h is irrelevant when we are talking about the ability to slow down his perceived time to the point where everything is basically frozen.

Except, his can do it at superspeed. There's an issue where a bullet grazes Barry's temple, the only reason it didn't kill him was that his brain detected the slight change in air pressure right before the bullet hit him and made him move his head."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,JumpingCactus,3,Sat Jun 27 12:18:55 2015 UTC,"I mentioned in another thread that it's a bit silly when he gets into conversations with the villains.  Just speed punch em into unconsciousness, lock em up, and then have the conversation.  I still love the show though."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,quontemplation,6,Sat Jun 27 14:02:18 2015 UTC,/u/theawesomebla made fun of this in his early episode synopses. If I can find a pic then I'll edit it in to the comment.  EDIT: Here you go.
FlashTV,3b9zz2,Neocarbunkle,3,Sat Jun 27 15:15:04 2015 UTC,"I'm reading most of the comments here, and I can understand OP's frustration with some of you guys.  We are talking about a guy that can basically stop time (relatively speaking), to the point where the person he is fighting, unless if they also have super speed, would not be able to react. At all. Which means, at that point, fighting ability is thrown out the window. Whether or not barry can fight is irrelevant. That's not the point of the question. The point is, HOW is he having a hard time with fights on the show when he has the ability to avoid fighting all the same?   That ends my rant.  Now to the question  Personally, I think it's psychological. When he goes up to a person, he freezes, sort of like stage fright. Because he's going up against a person that could actually kill him. He gets tense. And because of that, it makes him lose focus. Making him have trouble with maintaining his speed. That or lazy writing.."
FlashTV,3b9zz2,level1gamer,2,Sun Jun 28 09:04:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I recently rewatched a couple episodes that I wasn't really paying attention to my first time around and I think it was episode 8 where Barry gets all fucked in the head and fights Oliver and Oliver can't even come close to hitting him, meanwhile Barry is throwing literally hundreds of punches. Then a few episodes later he's completely unable to fight.   I don't even care why anymore, it's just amazing that people are trying to say it's because he isn't trained or that he's not used to his powers. You can't destroy one of the best fighters in the world, then get shit on a few episodes later. It just doesn't add up."

Why not allow Barry to be consistent and make the villains fit into that?  Peek-a-Boo (Worst name ever) could have been able to teleport faster and use tricks to try to beat Barry, rather than having a fight scene which rivals of the Cringe Snakes.   Or have Girder land one devastating punch rather than throwing him around the room like a rag doll where anyone with super speed could just move.

It's weird that he has his own lab but I guess it was needed for the plot. Or the CCPD is really generous (it is a huge building from the outside after all)."
FlashTV,3b9kz6,Airsay58259,6,Sat Jun 27 03:26:29 2015 UTC,"Or,  he's in charge of running analysis on all evidence gathered, so his station I simply placed where it's convenient. If they had every single CSI running their own prints, running chemical analysis, etc. it could get crowded fast."
FlashTV,3b9kz6,PurplePint,2,Sat Jun 27 06:35:36 2015 UTC,"Oh. I have no idea how CSI works, so I don't know how it would normally run. I would think that even with that, he would be shown interacting with other CSI's, but he collects evidence sometimes and seems to receive orders from normal cops or Captain Signh.  I know in a scene on Justice League, Wally is shown in an even larger room with his own table along with (presumably) several other CSI's. Maybe CCPD is much larger in that cartoon though, and Wally is only one of the scientists needed to do what Barry can do by himself."

In whic eobard is never born so he doesnt kill barrys mother and Barry has two parents then he doesn't become the flash and central city is destoryed. Eddie is the destroyer

FlashTV,3b48hr,PurplePint,15,Thu Jun 25 20:59:19 2015 UTC,One I recently caught on a rewatch was when Barry and Linda were getting ready for their date and he was telling her what they were going to do. Mal Duncan was D.J ing at a club. Mal Duncan was one of the incarnations of Guardian.
FlashTV,3b48hr,tinadavisxxx,5,Fri Jun 26 04:08:59 2015 UTC,I think that was more of a reference to the fact that he also used to be Vox. As Vox he used Garbriels Horn giving him the musician connection as a DJ
FlashTV,3b48hr,donredd,-12,Fri Jun 26 18:31:03 2015 UTC,"When I say ""less obvious"", I mean it. The Flash loves to drop '52' everywhere it can and include the names of other comic characters, writers and artists as streets/places or off-screen people, and there are already things dedicated to mentioning those more obvious references. What have you noticed?"
FlashTV,3b48hr,suss2it,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:10:52 2015 UTC,Honestly you're nitpicking.
FlashTV,3b48hr,Starboy11,37,Wed Jul 1 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"Started watching the season again a couple days ago. Watched episodes 2 and 3 today, and the ones that stood out to me most were Dr. Wells saying he feels like he's been waiting to turn on the accelerator for centuries, and Caitlyn told Barry that Ronnie used to say that they ""were like fire and ice.""  Furthermore, after Barry beats The Mist in episode 3, he's speaking with the STAR Labs crew (Wells, Cisco, and Caitlyn) and he tells them that ""It wasn't just me that was struck by lightning that night. It was all of us.""   Edit: I realize now this probably isn't the kind of references you mean, but back when I first watched these episodes I was totally unaware that Caitlyn Snow would eventually be Killer Frost, and Cisco eventually Vibe. I had been pretty unaware of most Flash lore."

FlashTV,3b48hr,Taconinja007,-17,Fri Jun 26 02:45:09 2015 UTC,Killer Frost and Vibe aren't part of Flash lore anyway.
FlashTV,3b48hr,suss2it,2,Fri Jun 26 06:09:17 2015 UTC,Yes they are...
FlashTV,3b48hr,JumpingCactus,-6,Fri Jun 26 18:21:58 2015 UTC,"Before this show how exactly were they? Vibe was created for Justice League Detroit, which Flash wasn't a part of and Killer Frost was a Firestorm villain. If you only ever read Flash comics you'd never come across those two. You still wouldn't in fact."
FlashTV,3b48hr,suss2it,2,Fri Jun 26 18:36:26 2015 UTC,Yes you would. Barry has fought Killer frost before and knows of her. Vibe is connected with the gosh darn speed force.
FlashTV,3b48hr,Starboy11,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:31:42 2015 UTC,"Vibe being connected to the speed force is a New 52 addition and that being said Vibe still never actually shows up in the Flash's book. And you're right Killer Frost does show up in a single issue of The Flash #290... in the back up Firestorm story that is. So yeah, I'm not seeing how Killer Frost or Vibe are part of the Flash lore (at least before the show)."
FlashTV,3b48hr,suss2it,7,Wed Jul 1 21:53:02 2015 UTC,"There are over 100 easter eggs/foreshadowing throughout the show.  Such as, In Ep 2, Wells says ""we have no idea what or who was affected by the particle accelerator"" Looks directly as Cisco"

FlashTV,3b4t11,commendatore,6,Fri Jun 26 10:01:26 2015 UTC,Sigh ... Felicity was my favourite character in the whole Arrowverse before season 3. At least I have Cisco to take that place now.
FlashTV,3b4t11,commendatore,7,Fri Jun 26 11:15:25 2015 UTC,"I feel ya. S3 was overcrowded, so inevitably some characters were poorly written. For instance, I don't like what they did with Ray. I hope he doesn't come back on Arrow, not because I don't like him, but because he's a better fit for Flash and LoT. Same with Felicity, she's so enjoyable to watch on The Flash."
FlashTV,3b4t11,Airsay58259,5,Fri Jun 26 14:06:39 2015 UTC,Every Arrow character was more enjoyable in Flash this season. Laurel in 19 was adorable and Quentin finally reconsidered his relationship with her thanks to Joe. Relevant

FlashTV,3b4t11,thabe331,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:01:25 2015 UTC,Daredevil would probably round out the top 3 for me. I'm just more of a Marvel guy so AoS holds a special place.

FlashTV,3b4rzf,DuEbrithil,5,Thu Jun 25 23:34:43 2015 UTC,"Barry Allen never officially appears in the DCAU series of animated projects by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini.   Source: http://dchallofjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Barry_Allen_(JLU)  Also:   Since Wally West's DCAU occupation is that of a police scientist, it is possible that the characters have simply been merged, with Barry Allen never existing in the DCAU at all.    Source  I haven't seen every episode yet (currently working on it), but so far I haven't heard anything about Barry... So I think there's a pretty good chance that you and both of these wikis are right."

FlashTV,3b3xt5,hugorz12,3,Sun Jun 28 00:31:31 2015 UTC,According to the techno-babble from the show she is exploiting quantum entanglement. Taking the science-free writers at their word that would require a transit entangling particle from point to point. Consequently she cannot teleport based on a photo unless you accept complete determinism. However as we see here use a telescope she probably could teleport to space. If she can carry enough equipment for EVA and sight she could hop to any open point on earth in a few jumps.

It's the thing captured in that moment. If she attempted to teleport somewhere in a photo, there's no knowing if there is a wall there, a sinkhole, a fire or even other people in that exact spot. If her abilities don't have a natural ""oops"" default that keeps her from getting trapped inside of walls or reassembling inside another person, trying to use a photograph as an anchor point could be a fatal disaster."
FlashTV,3b3xt5,PurplePint,2,Thu Jun 25 20:44:59 2015 UTC,If only we had the technology to see live pictures of a certain place. /s

FlashTV,3b3xt5,LockeNCole,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:49:38 2015 UTC,That'd be a crazy power.  Teleport back in time by teleporting into photos.

FlashTV,3b3xt5,Runethomas,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:16:32 2015 UTC,I would think she would have to actually see the place just in case she might teleport into a person or a small change within the world.
FlashTV,3b3xt5,armbitter,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:34:16 2015 UTC,"Can she teleport into the air and continuously teleport to get places? Or do you think it would be the ""Mist"" idea that she would run out of juice trying to teleport in mini steps to Paris."

FlashTV,3azln2,TheAmazingDurp,3,Thu Jun 25 03:18:50 2015 UTC,"I love this idea, and my boned is full staff for GL coming to the small screen, but the green lanterns are basically space cops. A black hole isn't an intergalactic criminal, it's more like a natural phenomenon. The corps can't really do shit about that."

FlashTV,3azln2,KernalBacon,33,Wed Jun 24 23:57:30 2015 UTC,Is this a different suit? It looks brighter.
FlashTV,3azln2,Avagantimos422,15,Thu Jun 25 00:13:42 2015 UTC,"Thought the same; could be the brightness of the pic, though."
FlashTV,3azln2,Keegman_99,11,Thu Jun 25 03:34:08 2015 UTC,The lightning bolt on the side of his head is different.
FlashTV,3azln2,teh_snorlax,6,Wed Jun 24 20:44:05 2015 UTC,I think it's just the picture.
FlashTV,3azln2,tardis27,4,Wed Jun 24 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not. It just looks different from that angle. If you compare it to the picture in the banner, you can see they're the same."

FlashTV,3azln2,PurplePint,4,Wed Jun 24 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yes but they look much more curved now. In the same vein as the wings. Granted it could just be the angle of the picture, which would be unfortunate."
FlashTV,3azln2,TheChaosController,3,Wed Jun 24 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"It's more brightly lit than the past promo stuff. To me, it looks like it could be a little bit brighter, but is still an oxblood rather than true red. The costume designer said the suit is toned down to fit in more with all surroundings while filming and so they don't have to light Flash differently than other actors in scene."
FlashTV,3azln2,PurplePint,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:00:01 2015 UTC,"This is the first suit, the one used during the first ten episodes of season one, so it looks different than the one we're used to."

FlashTV,3b1niv,SuperNJGaming,28,Thu Jun 25 06:25:06 2015 UTC,"At that point when Barry's mom is killed, everything is in tact. When Eddy kills himself, there is essentially a paradox of sorts that happens. Since Eddy dies, Eobard is no more, Eobard can't kill Barry's mom, but she's already dead. In a way, the circular structure of time is ruined and as a result that worm hole opens up. Hope this kinda helps. This is the way I see it."
FlashTV,3b1niv,DucksGoMoo1,11,Thu Jun 25 06:28:07 2015 UTC,"I believe this is the case. The first opening was stabilized once Barry returned from the past, as nothing changed and so nothing would have been altered in the present. But after he returned and Eddy sacrificed himself, it created a paradox in time, where it affected not only the future but the current timeline's past as well. I see the second black hole as essentially the space-time continuum saying to itself, ""This isn't right. Does not compute. Self-destruct imminent.""  Plus, like everyone else says..."
FlashTV,3b1niv,thorsdisciple,7,Thu Jun 25 18:08:45 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/TcwG5uP.jpg
FlashTV,3b1niv,PurplePint,0,Thu Jun 25 18:10:45 2015 UTC,I don't think that is why the black hole opened.  They said there was a risk of opening one with going back in time the way Wells came up with.
FlashTV,3b1niv,1live4downvotes,6,Thu Jun 25 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"Worm holes and risk are related to different aspects of time travel. Wells I think was speaking of risk in general. For instance you can drown in 3 feet of water or 100 ft , risk is the water , the situation doesn't matter. ... Ahem = SpeedForce"
FlashTV,3b1niv,jquest23,0,Thu Jun 25 17:15:13 2015 UTC,"No, the reason the singularity/black hole opened, at the end, is because they basically created a paradox.  The risk that you're talking about is if they didn't shut down the wormhole in time it would've created the singularity/black hole. They shut it down in time. But Eddie, sadly, killed himself to save Barry. Eddie killing himself should've, not just erase Eobard Thawne, it should've erased basically everything. Everything would be just fucked up. Eddie killing himself screwed up the entire timeline, therefore creating a paradox, which leads to the singularity/black hole opening back up."
FlashTV,3b1niv,Vaccino,7,Sat Jun 27 03:15:11 2015 UTC,"It's just your run of the mill fictional time travel issue.  In theory a paradox was created, in the show Wells just disappeared but everything he did still happened.  Don't bend your mind on it to long, if it makes you feel any better...just say it's Speed Force that keeps things how it is."
FlashTV,3b1niv,1live4downvotes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:36:14 2015 UTC,"Wells disappeared and now the timeline is pissed off and trying to correct everything. Thus, wormhole."
FlashTV,3b1niv,LockeNCole,5,Sun Jun 28 09:52:14 2015 UTC,Paradox. Thawne goes back in time and kills barry's mom. Barry becomes Flash. Eddie Kills himself. No more Thawne. No more Thawne means he never went back in time to kill Barry's mom. If Thawne never went back in time to kill Barry's mom then Eddie would have never killed himself. If Eddie Doesn't kill himself then Thawne still lives. If Thawne still lives then he goes to kill Barry's mom. You see the problem?  It's a circle and there is no clear answer for this because time travel gets mucky. That's why the wormhole opened. Time was trying to correct itself.
FlashTV,3b1niv,somefuzzypants,11,Fri Jun 26 02:59:53 2015 UTC,We hadn't had one of these in two days. I was begining to worry
FlashTV,3b1niv,Hpfm2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:11:28 2015 UTC,"You guys are assuming that there is only one timeline here. From what we know from what Eobard in the show has said and the comics, everytime someone makes a decision it creates an alternate universe. When Barry or Eobard goes back in time, they are, but they disappear from their universe creating an alternate one due to any decisions that were changed in the past. Once they return though and change the decision they become part of the timeline (As long as only one version of the person is there, or they become a time anomaly, then one will disappear , like in the new 52 flash), and that alternate universe will continue despite their deaths just as their original universe where they first went back in time and disappear from does. Tl;DR they essentially created a new universe based on the decision of whether Barry's mom lives or not. Previous universes still exist but past remains the same as others  up until that point that, then it splits based on the ramifications of that decision Edit: this is the way I see it at least."
FlashTV,3axmch,PhD_in_internet,9,Wed Jun 24 09:06:48 2015 UTC,"The speed force creation in the comics is described as moving through time both forwards and backwards from the moment of its creation. Since he had gone back and changed things I think he made an alternate line where the speed force had been non present and had to be reintroduced. Barry himself is directly linked to it so this wouldn't spread from him with such a short visit just yet(had a justice league aged barry done so, it may have been different). Years later thawne would start to get bits and pieces of his power back as he got closer to the moment that Barry opened those floodgates, allowing him those short touches of speed before Barry was able to tap into it for the first time."
FlashTV,3axmch,Happy_Mask_Salesman,6,Wed Jun 24 10:58:15 2015 UTC,I think you just need to assume that Thawne losing his connection happened after our Barry left.
FlashTV,3axmch,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,4,Wed Jun 24 10:42:35 2015 UTC,"Thawne and Barry fight in his childhood home, in the fight, Thawne loses sight of both Barry's.  Thawne then looks for Future Barry after he has saved his younger self, Barry then almost immedietly goes back to his time, and Thawne proceeds to kill his mom while still vibrating (keep in mind, Future flash is no longer there). Thawne then runs out of the house, down the street, and then collapses just as our Barry goes back to fight his Thawne.  TL;DR  I beleive this all happens while Future Barry is gone, yet Thawne is still using his powers.  Then Thawne runs out of the house, and down the street, until he collapses, because our Barry just left"

FlashTV,3auxfx,heath_parker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:44:17 2015 UTC,I think the hard part about making a video game about the Flash is that he is so creative with his powers at times. It's hard to program for that kind of spontaneity. Just like its hard to make a realllly good star wars Jedi game. You always feel restricted because you think of things that would work but the game won't let you do.

Fun fact: Jesse Martin is Original Cast of 'Rent', Carlos Valdez was on Broadway right before starting on The Flash, which is something he shares with Grant Gustin: Iirc, Carlos was in 'Jersey Boys' and Grant was in 'West Side Story' prior to being cast in their respective first TV roles.  John Wesley Shipp is also a great singer and can play the piano, he's done multiple musicals and sang in other TV roles. Tom Cavanaugh sings and plays guitar, too! With a cast of trained singers/musicians, I can't imagine them passing up the chance to incorporate that somehow in a future episode."

It's called 'The Letter Carrier', it's set in 1860s rural Appalachia and is told entirely thru music. Joss Whedon donated to their Kickstarter and as thanks they sang 'Firefly' (link in previous comment) for him. I also think it's pretty awesome that for their Stretch Goal, they were dividing the money up between the volunteer crew."
FlashTV,3au383,BecauseIWantPokemon,2,Tue Jun 23 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, I love Starkid. They have (had) a good history of making parody musicals.

For anyone interested: I recommend that you start with their old stuff (A Very Potter Musical) and work your way to present day. Great for anyone who loves Harry Potter, mature (sex) jokes, and awesome singing talent."

It's impossible to reach up to the standard they left with the Very Potter trilogy, that was both hilarious and weirdly endearing and emotional. I love that series. They characterised the characters in such a fantastic and loveable way, I actually felt more deeply for their renditions than the HP film versions, especially with characters like Ron.  Carlos wasn't in Twisted unfortunately, he only sings this version of the song (I think it's played in the ending credits)."

FlashTV,3atkzb,Keegman_99,4,Tue Jun 23 22:19:13 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of some free world stuff/sandbox for Central City, but considering Flash's Rogues Gallery it would make sense to have it be a multi-world/level game. Start out in CC with standard quest/mission objectives, as you level Team Flash starts mentioning future level stuff (""Barry, that's where those lenses and mirrors were stolen last month!"") and then you make your way to and through Gorilla City, Mirror Universe, etc and face the appropriate Rogue/Rogues.    I think you'd have to lean more comic book and eliminate the Particellblock so the Rogues could escape for team-ups or final battle. Using more comic lore, you could include James Jesse's flying boots, Golden Glider's skates, whatever would work level/world-wise. That would also mean that the Cosmic Treadmill could be used instead of the Accelerator, Green Lantern/Green Arrow could be earned Allies and Barry's job as a CSI could help facilitate clues or be included as quests/missions.  I can see a game developer flurbing by including caloric intake, or by requiring Flash to disguise himself while interacting with certain characters (if you forget to initiate Blur or Vibrato, they start to suspect) and even developing a skill tree where you could choose Speed, Dexterity or Mental abilities."

FlashTV,3atkzb,PurplePint,3,Wed Jun 24 01:12:54 2015 UTC,"Think environmental factors.   Mirror Master could rig up moving reflective surfaces, inhabit multiple shards upon shattering, even a few false 'ceilings' that would fall during the fight, allow him to bounce around while creating hundreds/thousands of projectiles. He could even tag in Golden Glider, maybe outfit her with a silver gun to create more mirrors.  Captain Cold could force the fight through progressively colder rooms/tunnels that sap Barry's speed/HP/etc  and even involve black ice that causes a loss of purchase, falls, etc.  He could tag in Heatwave and trigger an insta-boil of all the ice, creating rooms full of steam that again cause difficulty due to burning lungs, vision issues, blah blah.    Boomerang rigged his house with gas in Arrow, so any disruption would cause an explosion. Fix that so anything over x-speed triggers detonations, blah blah.  I think they could also include some angry/compromised heroes as Bosses, too. Why not turn it on it's head, have Flash get whammied or misled by evidence and in a twist have him be the 'bad guy' for a level, but have the goal of that fight not to be a beatdown but a ""now that you've smacked some sense into me...."" and while we're at it, let's not forget to mention the Rogue's aversion to killing civvies. Unexpected ally Snart could show up to fight another Rogue for breaking the rule."

FlashTV,3atkzb,Butter_Is_Life,3,Tue Jun 23 16:12:20 2015 UTC,The same kind of speed you get out of the Unleashed/Generations formula would fit Flash pretty well. Just think it'd need a little more structural realism to it and it could be a cool base!
FlashTV,3atkzb,MiddleClassAsian,3,Tue Jun 23 19:27:44 2015 UTC,"A game where you're actually overpowered, but the enemies are also really hard. The bosses are super overpowered, and the thugs are actually a whole group and don't fight one by one for once. You can run around Central City as a freemode map really fastly, and there are different buttons for Flash's different abillities, like Vibrate, Hand vortexes, making a tornado, and stuff like that. The bosses (captain cold, heat wave, etc) can use their abillities to debuff you.Like Captain Cold can slow you down so you can't use super speed, the Reverse Flash will basically equal your skills so you have to react really fast, stuff like that and each boss level will debuff one of your abillities. You can also, like in every lego superhero games, can save random people in distress. And in the end, maybe there will be a gorilla grodd scene, that builds up to Flash 2."

The city should be massive so we can easily dree roam without getting bored. no electricity of any sort should cover the corners of the screen. i mean i get why someone would want that but i dont think a speedster ever gets disturbed by it so neither should the players. arkham games combat but ten times as fast and more unique. cut scenes (not action scene from boss fights) should be filled with qtes (were talking about the fastest man alive here and his reflexes should be near-impossible). Alfred= Patty Spivot (if were talking about the comics and not the show). Wayne Industries tech/Lucius Fox= Cisco Ramon. Super fast healing but as the game progresses in story, eiling steals deadshot's curare bullets and distributes to his armymen. our healing will stop until we gather enough speedforce energy to vibrate the poison out of our body (Flash vs. Arrow). thats all ive got"

It would be just straight storytelling, no stretching to make the episode quota. Heroes is the only super hero show I've seen that was able to do that many episodes without the filler, maintaining quality throughout, and that's mainly because of the sheer amount of characters the show had, even then they were only able to do it for one season. Now you see the reboot doing 12 episodes. I think 12 is much better quality wise, by I do enjoy having something to watch for 21-24 weeks."

It doesn't even seem like they have rights to all the big heroes. Like Supergirl and Young Justice live action series are on other networks and same with Gotham. It seems like to me, with the Flash being such a success, as soon as a semi-interesting character or actor appears, they want to immediately want to give them a show and hope for a network full of The Flash's.

FlashTV,3am3wl,mmemmetee,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"I don't see this working out. They need to fix Arrow first after abandoning it for Flash. And it's really hard to create something great with another less popular superhero like they did with Arrow. If they do make the show, it won't reach how great Arrow was because they're still going to devote most of their resources and talent into Flash. There's too many shows. They should see how popular her character becomes before committing to a show. It's like Atom, his introduction and development has been lackluster at best."

During his first tour, Hal was severely injured and was promptly discharged. Diggle stays in touch with Hal and convinces him to follow in his fathers footsteps and become a test pilot. As time went by, they lost touch. Due to this, Diggle is unaware of Hal's disappearance.   Hal returns to earth and crosses paths with the Arrow & Flash, Diggle not being an idiot instantly recognizes Hal due to his mask only taking up 1/4th of his face. They catch up and as in Ollie fashion, doesn't trust Hal at first. On the other hand, both Hal and Barry hit it off right off the bat.   Easy peasy lemon squeezy."

Green Lantern opens up a whole new aspect of the universe, pun intended. You have to do a little legwork to introduce aliens and the Lantern Corps and things like that.   I think to spread the introduction out like this, drawing on different elements across the three shows, works far better than a simple expository speech. It's also more fun, to be honest, and I think it'd create better stories as well.  That's my fifty pence, anyway."

I doubt the producers want to deal with anything beyond Earth, and it may be that DC has reserved all that stuff for movies.  It just changes the scope of the shows too much.  We'll continue to get references/nods to many things, but nothing appears on screen randomly.  Any character that appears on screen is a commitment to a plotline.  UNLESS Hal Jordan is saved for the last season of Arrow, and continues the DCU where Arrow leaves off."

FlashTV,3aov8o,quontemplation,5,Mon Jun 22 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"Barry disappeared in 2024 before he ""died"" so his identity never became common knowledge. Thawne knew when the arrow died which means he knew who Oliver was after his natural death at age 84."
FlashTV,3aov8o,tysonmoorewood,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"We don't know either of those. It's very possible that the day Flash disappeared was important but doesn't mean it was the end. He probably came back the next day. It's likely though he took his secret identity to the grave and it was preserved via a new Flash taking his place.   I assume Olivers identity was revealed in the future and or Wells observed Barry in Starling and thus came across his interaction with Oliver Queen.   At 84, Oliver probably gave up his quiver many years before."

I thought (before the finale, which complicates matters somewhat) that at different stages throughout the next few seasons that we'd have appearances by both the Tom Cavanagh Reverse Flash (taking place after mentoring Barry) and the Matt Letscher Reverse Flash (taking place before killing Barry's mother) which would then develop their relationship in something of a non linear fashion - not dissimilar to River Song in Doctor Who, I suppose.   I always thought it'd be interesting to see some of the early meetings between Barry and the Matt Lescher Reverse Flash, because Barry would have a significant amount of foreknowledge about him - in what some would call the reverse of Wells' position throughout series one."

However, Barry has already dealt with Wells RF and loathes Eobard, and he assumes the Letscher RF that came back to meet him is already his nemesis, recognizing him from Eobard's dying moments. In an ironic twist, Barry's actions towards Letscher-Thawne  lead Eobard to hate Barry and become the Reverse Flash we all know."
FlashTV,3aksug,DownbeatDinosaur,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"That could be pretty interesting, actually. Nice sort of time travel tragedy.  On a somewhat unrelated note, but I think this is the right general area to ask: what is the reason that Thawne hates Barry so much? I've looked it up a few times, and I know the general obsessive fan concept, but I'm sure at some point or another I read that Barry killed Thawne's wife? Maybe I've confused myself thinking about Barry killing Thawne, and Thawne killing... lots of people, really, but I've still got that nagging thought that at some point Barry did something along those lines?   Can anyone help me out with that?"
FlashTV,3aksug,thoughts-from-alex,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:00:00 2015 UTC,"Eobard has changed his own history several times but in short His rivalry with Barry started because Barry stopped him when he finally achieved his dream of having superspeed. In his original origin he was using the speed to commit crimes, after drastically altering his own past, the meeting happened as Thawne was attempting to be a 25th century Flash but was putting people in danger to save them. There's also a story from Wally West years that expands of the fan concept, but that one didn't actually involve Barry.   To your other question, Thawne never had a wife but did often attempt to take Iris for his own in his early apperances."

FlashTV,3ajoez,ReverseFlashBot,2,Mon Jun 22 08:21:11 2015 UTC,"I heard that the necklace was from Pyrrha, which is shop located in Vancouver. Their products are pretty amazing, so regardless of any tie-in importance with the character, they should get credit for making the pendant.  What follows is a bit of thought on this piece of potentially important bijoux, fair warning.   Vous êtes prêts? Allons-y!  From all of the screenshots people have put up, it looks like it's an uneven circle or rounded octagon, with no crystal or colored area visible. No blue anything.  I suppose if they have him wear that same pendant in any future appearance, he could flip it around to reveal a set blue stone. If at any point Eddie had been wearing anything that even looked like it could be a blue necklace, I'm sure that the fandom would have screamed a (literal) blue streak about it.   Here's what I remember from the episodes: S1x08 - 'Flash v. Arrow' - Bedroom scene with Iris and Eddie. Its outline is briefly visible hanging from his neck before Iris flips him unto his back. As he is getting dressed after she remarks that mentioning her father is a sexytimes buzzkill, it's clearly visible on top of his sleeveless undershirt. As he's putting on his buttonup, you can see the the pendant is the only thing on the chain, with no additional pieces or charms next to it. Since the lighting has him backlit the entire shot, it's not in focus enough to determine any writing or much beyond a general roundish shape and silver/silvery-metallic make.  The chain is long enough that even with the top buttons undone, it wouldn't be visible.  S1x23 - 'Fast Enough' - Obvious scene is obvious. Right before The Hoovering, it falls into the hollow of Eddite's throat for just a moment. The pendant is visible, again roundish & silvery, so it's likely the same pendant from S1x08. Again, no blue anything is visible on the pendant or hanging on the chain. Again, it's not shown with enough light or focus to clearly make out any kind of inscription, design or setting. It does seem darker in the center, suggesting it is concave, and there may be a raised or shinier bit dead center. No blue anything is shown around it.   Interestingly enough, it's not worn by Eddie in S1x06 'The Flash Is Born' during the punching bag/sparring scene. Eddie is not wearing his buttonup and has nothing around his neck at all. If he wears it while sleeping (which the scene in S108 suggests) and while on shift (as S123 suggests) there wouldn't really be a reason for him to remove it while throwing a few punches at a sandbag or a bit of light sparring with Barry.   Cobalt as a solid metal is one of the 'whitest' metals. It is brighter than silver, titanium and platinum. It's extremely hard and difficult to scratch or bend out of shape once it's been cast/molded. We can assume that the pendant is meant to be made of solid cobalt in the show. The heat of the accretion disk during the forming of the singularity would be more than enough to cause changes of the metal into gas and/or react with other factors the writers will include in the future. They'll be able to include natural factors that would arise when discussing the black holes, and they'll be able to include anything sucked in either with Eddie (Time Sphere parts, various debris from S.T.A.R. Labs, etc) as well as potentially including a meta-gene angle, either from the Allen line or from whatever line the writers are setting Eddie in.   All of this, however, assumes that we'll be meeting the same Eddie as was in this timeline, which could get very interesting indeed."

FlashTV,3aj8xb,burgundyblue,8,Sat Jun 20 18:58:19 2015 UTC,I hope the first Ep picks up on the cliffhanger and either jumps 6 months mid-episode or between episodes whichever suits the story better.    The timelines need to sink up pretty quickly as they are going to do a lot of crossovers in the first 8 episodes setting up Legends. Source: Q&A with Danielle Panabaker

Maybe they sped up the whole ""Flash vanishes in crisis"" headline and he'll show up a few months later in their time. Regardless I'm interested to see how it pans out."
FlashTV,3aj8xb,Janival,5,Sat Jun 20 20:10:36 2015 UTC,"I think S2 will start months after the end, featuring the return of The Flash in Central City. Additionally, we'll have flashbacks (maybe in the whole season) showing where was Barry (Earth 2!)."

There are already different versions for Batman and Superman if you haven't seen that yet. Here is the official list bei Schleich (It's German, but I guess that doesn't affect pictures.

FlashTV,3air99,ShadowSlayerX,5,Sat Jun 20 16:16:21 2015 UTC,"1-X means Flash S01EX, 3-X means Arrow S03EX:  ...  1-8  3-8  ...  3-15  1-18  3-16  1-19  3-17  ...  3-22  1-22  3-23  1-23  I think it should be this. Dots indicate that it doesn't matter in which order you watch it until the next fixed episode, as long as you watch everthing between them. But to be honest, just watch   1-1, 3-1, 1-2, 3-2, (continue like this) , 1-21, 3-21 and then 3-22, 1-22, 3-22, 1-23   (so in the order they aired in until the finale) because it doesn't matter too much. There are only a few scenes that feel out of place because they should've happened earlier, but when you know that the timing is a little bit messed up, it doesn't really matter. This way it's a bit easier to keep track and the timing issues are easily fixed like this by watching 2 arrow episodes at some point (I suggested it right before the finale in the second list above).  Edit: Formatting"
FlashTV,3air99,DuEbrithil,2,Sat Jun 20 16:26:53 2015 UTC,"The detailed list above is completely wrong. Because the shows aired out of synch after the winter break due to an error by the network.  So, the simple answer is:  Watch them in number order, Flash then Arrow  EXCEPT, when you get to Arrow 22, watch Arrow 23.... Then Flash 23.  ---more info---  There's some other ones... but if you just follow this simple numerical idea, you'll survive. Because unless you stop the show part way through, Arrow 17 to watch Flash 18 for example, they are not going to be right no matter what you do."
FlashTV,3air99,Todrick,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:34:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what I meant when I told them to go for the second list, which is basically yours - with one exception: I put Arrow 22 BEFORE Flash 22 because Flash 22 spoilers Arrow 22 a bit IIRC. The middle part of the first list fixes a few issues with some dialogue, but it isn't really necessary like I already said. You understand what's going on anyway, it's just timewise out of place."

So this is gonna be confusing for anyone not intimately familiar with these episodes, cause I'm going to do my best not to spoil anything LOL  22:  This is a result of the network error and the producers adjusting for it  Flash shouldn't have spoiled Arrow, BUT because of the scheduling screwup by CW, the producers adjusted by moving the reveal of that info to Arrow 23....  But that leaves the issue of how did he ever end up there to spoil anything.... But that's because of the original scheduling error, before the producers adjusted... He went in episode 21, while he was away from that place doing the other thing.  So... Long way of saying...  You have a point... But the events of Arrow 22&23 obviously have no gap"

I can't do this without spoilers.... lol  But the only time he could have been there is when he left that place to do that thing in 21... Otherwise that other guy would have noticed he was gone.  I don't think this is much of a spoiler:  Arrow 22 ends with Oliver heading to the plane, 23 begins with him on the plane.... There's no gap."

He has that conversation in Flash 23  This is actually the rewrite the writers did that screwed everything up and removes the flash, Arrow, Flash, arrow order.  Because of that line... That means arrow 23 happens before Flash 23 but after Flash 22 when...  Uh... OK.... The last 4 episodes are a mess no matter what. There's either a spoiler or there is going to be a weird gap.

FlashTV,3adztn,ssup3rm4n,31,Fri Jun 19 12:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. Even in the comics, it is a red streak with some small yellow lightning. And I noticed that as the show progressed, that it became more and more yellow lightning, and less red blur."
FlashTV,3adztn,remhawk99,22,Fri Jun 19 16:13:03 2015 UTC,I think that was intentional.
FlashTV,3adztn,Devinm84,30,Fri Jun 19 16:41:17 2015 UTC,Most likely to make a greater visual distinction between Barry and Eobard.
FlashTV,3adztn,Sick_Boy_Paddy,7,Fri Jun 19 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, the lightning becomes more and more prominent as Barry becomes more used to accessing the speed force directly. You'll notice before the speed force is mentioned for the first time, the lightning is actually pretty rare, we really only see it when Barry is accessing it involuntarily, usually during a heightened emotional state."
FlashTV,3adztn,Jackifier,5,Fri Jun 19 21:51:02 2015 UTC,Because Barry became faster.
FlashTV,3adztn,SirJerrico,16,Fri Jun 19 20:16:36 2015 UTC,"I frankly prefer the trailer lightning, the actual show lightning is just a bit too much I feel"
FlashTV,3adztn,grim_melee,24,Fri Jun 19 13:45:41 2015 UTC,"I think as the Flash has gotten stronger the lightning has gotten more pronounced, so there was a point to it being more understated in the beginning."
FlashTV,3adztn,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,8,Fri Jun 19 13:43:18 2015 UTC,"I like that the lightning is more pronounced. If it looked more like that with the red, there might have been less confusion about the red blue with yellow lightning vs yellow blur with red lightning."
FlashTV,3adztn,SuperBattleFranky37,7,Fri Jun 19 12:00:13 2015 UTC,"the trailer one has a more 'mystical' effect to it, I like it."
FlashTV,3adztn,redditorrandom,4,Fri Jun 19 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"We definitely polished Flash's effects as the show progressed and found a standard. However, due to shots where we see him in ""Flash time""( when we see him move at a slower speed) the effect can seem different than when he's racing past in real time. We of course always integrate the red streaks, but depending on the environment and lighting he is in, sometimes it reads better than others."
FlashTV,3adztn,Anivair,3,Sat Jun 20 22:04:56 2015 UTC,"I think I prefer the trailer, but I think they changed it to differentiate barry from wells in a way that was obvious."
FlashTV,3adztn,Kel6126,3,Fri Jun 19 13:06:18 2015 UTC,I am not sure i really like the lightning at all. I prefer a blur of color alone personally. It seems silly that he has yellow lightning and reverse flash has red lightning whether they are in their costume or not.
FlashTV,3adztn,TheChaosController,7,Fri Jun 19 15:13:49 2015 UTC,"Well the lightning comes from them, not the costume. It's literally Speedforce."
FlashTV,3adztn,Kel6126,5,Fri Jun 19 15:33:46 2015 UTC,"Is there anywhere that explains the difference in the color? They both use the same speedforce no? I always thought calling himself ""reverse"" was more of a philosophical thing point of view type of thing vs. anything based in actual speedforce."
FlashTV,3adztn,TheChaosController,6,Fri Jun 19 15:54:42 2015 UTC,"Well I believe since The Flash: Rebirth it has been explained that Eobard uses Negative Speedforce, which eats away at the normal Speedforce like a disease. Someone who has actually read it could probably explain it better, but that's the gist of it."
FlashTV,3adztn,TheChaosController,2,Fri Jun 19 16:06:19 2015 UTC,"He always had red lightning, negative speed force was introduced in Rebirth.  And when the flash runs in civil clothes, sometimes the artists don't draw lightnings, there are lightnings only where he's suited up."
FlashTV,3adztn,Anivair,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, I'm just saying in the case of the show, since Geoff Johns helps write, it could be Negative Speedforce. Otherwise it's just to differentiate like before Rebirth."
FlashTV,3adztn,platinumrug,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:19:56 2015 UTC,"Doesn't negative speedforce sound like... Slow? Like,  in what way is the opposite of the speedforce ALSO super speed?"
FlashTV,3adztn,Anivair,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:35:11 2015 UTC,"Because instead of being generated like how Barry's positive speedforce is, his negative speedforce (Wells) has to siphon off of Barry's in order to actually perform. It's similar I would say to having a negative a positive end on a magnet. Both charges are still incredibly strong, despite being opposites."
FlashTV,3adztn,crashmd,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:40:05 2015 UTC,"Right, but the speedforce makes someone really fast and the negative speedforce .... seemingly does nothing unless in the presence of the speedforce.  that's a ripoff. I'd want my speedforce money back."
FlashTV,3adztn,Anivair,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand. There isn't a ""Positive Speedforce"" and a ""Negative Speedforce."" There is just the Speedforce. As Barry runs, he strengthens the Speedforce. Wells can't do that, so he steals Speedforce for his own use.  Barry creates Speedforce and uses it to run fast.  Thawne steals Speedforce and uses it to run fast."
FlashTV,3adztn,linke92,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:58:50 2015 UTC,Not according to the comics.   The negative speedforce is the opposite of the speedforce and negates it.   (at least if the Wikipedia entry for speedforce is to be believed).
FlashTV,3adztn,TheJoshider10,3,Sat Jun 20 03:30:14 2015 UTC,"I think the trailers one didn't have enough electricity, while the actual series one seems a bit too cluttered. A nice balance in between would've been nice, but I didn't really think twice about it until now, because it still looks amazing."
FlashTV,3adztn,neoblackdragon,2,Fri Jun 19 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't even notice a change, so I guess that shows how little it bothered me. Either is fine."
FlashTV,3adztn,atc593,2,Fri Jun 19 17:02:31 2015 UTC,Well the issue here for me is two different type of scenes.
FlashTV,3adztn,Ososoulo,2,Fri Jun 19 20:35:36 2015 UTC,"I like series because it reminds me of speed travel in DCUO, where I got most of my Flash exposure."
FlashTV,3adztn,redditorrandom,2,Fri Jun 19 21:12:11 2015 UTC,Noob question regarding the show.  How come Flash leaves a yellow/orange trailer and...  Reverseflash leaves a red trail? In the animated series flash had a red trail..and it just makes more sense to me red goes with red etc.  Did I miss an explanation on this??
FlashTV,3adztn,darrienjwoods,2,Sat Jun 20 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"Flash's streak is red, and his lightning is orange/yellow. Reverse Flash's streak is yellow, and his lightning is red."
FlashTV,3adztn,cocoram,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:06:56 2015 UTC,"Now that i've re-watched the teaser, I can honestly say that I prefer the first one. I'd say that they should've added more lightning to show is increase in speed."

FlashTV,3adztn,HPSpacecraft,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:40:26 2015 UTC,"I really preferred the first effects. It looked less like lightning, but I guess that's why they changed it."
FlashTV,3adztn,Lucarai,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:28:00 2015 UTC,"I really don't like how much lightning there is when they run, especially in the midseason finale picture.  There should be maybe a bit more lightning than there was in the trailers when Barry runs, but then once he stops the lightning shouldn't just stop, it should crackle around him a bit or something."
FlashTV,3adztn,Tgage,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:58:46 2015 UTC,The first two I like better but the third is good for scenes like what is pictured. The focus is better character wise but in fights or anything else it distracts from the running image too much imo.

FlashTV,3adztn,CHE6yp,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:28:59 2015 UTC,"Originally the speed lines were in keeping with Infantino's style to show rippling bands of colour that were the yellow and red of Barry's suit blurring as he travelled at super-speed.  Other artists have taken to making those rippling lines look like lightning. But I don't think that should be a literal thing--it's just an artistic flourish.  When you make it actual lightning on a photo-realistic TV show, then you're suggesting there's another power that Barry has which is the power to create lightning at high speed.  That invites the question, Why doesn't Barry use those lightning powers to combat his foes? So something that was just supposed to decorate an effect now becomes a hard concept in the series."
FlashTV,3adztn,BigBassBone,0,Fri Jun 19 21:04:49 2015 UTC,"From those two i'd choose the one from tha trailers. But honestly i'd prefer no lightning at all, like X-Men DoFP style."
FlashTV,3ahhnj,Troyabedinthemornin,6,Sat Jun 20 05:46:09 2015 UTC,"Arrow and flash have different writing teams and only Andrew Kreisberg and Greg Berlanti went over to the flash, and they still wrote a season 3 episode."
FlashTV,3ahhnj,arsenal1224,9,Sat Jun 20 07:21:30 2015 UTC,"Yes people like to ignore the fact that they are still executive producers for Arrow and wrote not only the finale but also supervised the season direction... Arrow S3 may have sucked but it's not because of the Flash. All shows have their own writers room and the same executives producers. I'm not really worried about season 2.   My only concern is about the romance drama... they basically took Ollie/Laurel/Tommy from Arrow S1 for Flash S1 (one could say Arrow took it from Smallville S1's Clark/Lana/Whitney...) Seriously it's not just the love triangle, the storylines are similar. Now if Flash S2 takes the same road Arrow took... ugh. Laurel's character suffered a lot from it, even if she had every right to feel the way she did and it took a superhero arc to redeem her character with the audience (I personally always liked her). We already know Barry is gonna have a new love interest (remember Sara?) so my hope is that they give Iris a really interesting arc and not just use her in an angsty love triangle + blame game about Eddie for 75% of the season."
FlashTV,3ahhnj,Airsay58259,5,Sat Jun 20 08:20:24 2015 UTC,but it's not because of the Flash   Soooo... Can I say that it's the reverse?
FlashTV,3ahhnj,CIearMind,3,Sat Jun 20 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about Legends of Tomorrow taking any writers, it's a midseason show so it'll be during the Flash's break"
FlashTV,3ahhnj,MisterrAlex,2,Sat Jun 20 23:00:01 2015 UTC,"LOT will have 16 episodes, that's a lot for just the hiatus. I think it will be like the CW shows starting at mid season (iZombie, the 100, Hart of Dixie). They start during the other show's winter break but then continue when the shows are back too."
FlashTV,3ahhnj,Airsay58259,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:16:12 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that, since Arrow and Flash are both on break, they'll double-run the show, meaning a new episode on Tuesday and a new episode on Wednesday. 16 episodes would therefore only run over 8 weeks. Perfectly within mid-season."

FlashTV,3accmx,Papasimmons,4,Fri Jun 19 03:52:42 2015 UTC,"A reflective visor would probably cause production problems. In every shot you'd also have to make sure that the reflections were clear of crew, cameras, lights, etc. It's bad enough when you have a static mirror on the wall of a room, but a mask in motion would be even more troublesome and hard to block.  It's a great idea, but I don't think it'll work for the show."

He's not really supposed to be body-builder fit, but more farmer-fit. Kara landed as a teen, and wasn't exactly a warrior or laborer on krypton, so it makes sense that even though she has the same powers and similar strength as clark, she wouldnt be as ripped since most of that strength is just from the yellow sun. Now Wonder Woman on the other hand..."

FlashTV,3aa1i7,jamiestewart48,16,Thu Jun 18 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"I would have to say that Eliza Taylor is not stick thin.  Don't get me wrong, beautiful woman, but one thing I really like about her is on The 100 she is meaty.  Does using the word meaty make me sound like Buffalo Bill??  Anyway, it might be the way they outfit her on The 100 but she seems to be a more natural looking woman than some of the normal CW 0% body fat ladies."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,noodlescb,15,Thu Jun 18 13:45:25 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. Eliza has a little something that makes her beautiful in her own way and not a ""CW way"". About her body, yep she's ""meaty"" (lol) and it's nice. Danielle is kinda meaty too and definitely doesn't look like most of the CW ladies, in her acting as well. She's not afraid of making funny faces all the time even if it means she's not aaalwaays looking flawless. Eliza and Danielle are like the underdogs for the SciFi tv actress TCA but they both deserve it a lot more than both Vampire CW Girls or, IMO, Emily Bett Rickards.

I know when I started it I rolled my eyes a bunch of times at how everyone was hot and it seemed anytime there was welding or construction to do the ladies wear tank tops... but the show really does deliver as it goes on.  Really one of the better scifi shows on tv and actually quite violent for CW... like brutally violent."

FlashTV,3aa1i7,electricblues42,6,Thu Jun 18 14:35:37 2015 UTC,That's not what I mean by comic book characters. The character of Mei wasn't originally drawn. Mockingbird in the comics as a face just like everyone else in superhero comics. There's a reason why they all wear different bright colors with different symbols.

FlashTV,3aa1i7,Vinnie_Vegas,2,Fri Jun 19 00:17:33 2015 UTC,I think Ming Na is just distinctive cuz shes the only Asian TV star.

FlashTV,3aa1i7,yuloforce,2,Fri Jun 19 03:45:39 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to think about now. At the time NBC passed on it because it was going to be too expensive and they were more concerned with chasing broad comedy than action drama. 4 years later look at the television landscape and we have two successful DC shows at CW, with a third on the way, and Supergirl coming up over at CBS, while ABC have managed to turn Agents of Shield into a successful event series. I wonder if the show could have survived had NBC gone ahead with it or was the climate just not quite right yet? Would Adrianna Palicki be a big name action hero now? Would the DC movie universe still be all dark and Snyderey? We'll never know, but I find it fun to think about."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,CamaroM,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"That pilot was awful - The only thing that would be different if it'd gone to series is that it would have set the entire comic-book adaptation TV landscape back a fair way, meaning we might not have such a promising, high-quality set of shows on the air right now."

FlashTV,3aa1i7,CamaroM,4,Fri Jun 19 22:25:18 2015 UTC,Exactly why she makes me feel better about myself and she is weird and wears glasses and I will always love her no matter how much she annoys me when she gets whiney.
FlashTV,3aa1i7,falcon4287,10,Thu Jun 18 15:22:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume you're female, and I don't have any female friends who watch Arrow, so I'll ask you because you like Felicity:  Do you think her and Oliver, uh, make sense?  When they first debuted her character, I'd yell at my screen at Oliver whenever he'd have some goofy falling out with Laurel because he had a hot, quirky, smart chick that was into him--right there!  Then shit got weird...  It's as if they almost seemed better for each other when they first met, but after the year or two of awkward flirting, friend zoning, platonic(?!) ""I love yous,"" and general bipolar behavior from everyone, I didn't like seeing them together at the end.  I dunno, I just get the feeling they put Felicity and Oliver together because CW wants (or at least wanted) to be a female oriented network and obviously Felicity represents the normal girl getting the hot billionaire playboy fantasy (hmm that reminds me of another recent story).  Anyway, sorry you got the brunt of that little rant on Ollicity, but I'd like to know a female's opinion."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,anecdotal,11,Thu Jun 18 17:35:50 2015 UTC,"I am an Arrow-watching female, and I used to love Olicity. I'd read the fanfiction and everything. Then season 3 happened, I really liked Ray, and Felicity got annoying. She lost the things I loved about her. I think whatever this current Olicity is doesn't make sense. They rushed into it and it just didn't work.  I love Felicity mostly out of nostalgia. As the nerd girl who wears glasses and neon lipstick, I related. Now that she's the constantly crying love interest, and I don't."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,TwiZtah,3,Thu Jun 18 20:09:46 2015 UTC,"See, I'm the opposite... Season 3 happened, and I hated Ray. His character seemed so forced that I just couldn't get into him."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,Trainer_Kevin,2,Thu Jun 18 21:41:01 2015 UTC,Finally fucking someone who hates Ray in the same way. I freaking despised that character.
FlashTV,3aa1i7,electricblues42,2,Thu Jun 18 23:08:12 2015 UTC,"He just felt like a shitty bootleg version of Robert Downie Jr.'s Tony Stark. By far my least favorite character in CW's DC universe. I'm hoping he just needs to grow on me, like the guy who played deadshot, but I have never enjoyed Brandon Routh's acting, so I have my doubts."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,Trainer_Kevin,3,Fri Jun 19 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"I hated Laurel until a bit after Sara died. And I loved Felicity because she is my type of girl. But the Olicity thing is really getting on my nerves since the mid season finale. I almost do feel like Laurel and Oliver deserve another chance with each other especially since in the comic, world they belong together.   So basically I want Laurel with Oliver now(Unless they fix Olicity next season), and I want Felicity with Barry or Atom.  But Felicity is still my favorite character."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,terraburn,3,Fri Jun 19 11:56:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like they made Olicity happen just for the fans. The real problem with the show is that every woman who comes within 10 feet of Oliver falls head-over-heels for him, and he's such a nice guy that he never wants to hurt anyone but he's such an idiot that he always makes thing drastically worse by being his normal, secretive self. That leaves underlying sexual tension with just about every female he talks to in the entire show, which lends itself to major fandoms for certain relationships to happen.    Everyone on that show needs some counseling on communication skills and so much of this would be avoided. People are dying because one person is afraid of hurting another person's feelings. It's like the moment someone puts on a mask, they become completely socially inept- and this criticism is coming from a traditionally socially awkward IT guy."

FlashTV,3aa1i7,j1mmm,8,Fri Jun 19 22:00:10 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the addition of another character, but why does Barry need another love interest? It's this kind of thing that ruined Arrow."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,falcon4287,6,Fri Jun 19 02:55:02 2015 UTC,"But Oliver didn't hook up with someone that looked like THAT!  Besides Patty is an actual character and love interest of Barry's in the Comics... not fan fiction like Felicity.  Olicity is purely female, CW fan service.... this is male, comic book fan service."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,JustinC00,6,Fri Jun 19 14:57:21 2015 UTC,"Originally, though, Patty Spivot was just a one-off character who had a crush on Barry, but Barry had no interest in her at all.  If they were going to develop some sparks between Barry and another character then I would rather it was Caitlin. This just seems like Caitlin.2.  But really I don't want the series taken over with the hero's love life, like it was with Ollie and all his bed-hopping. At least there's some basis for Oliver being a lothario. Barry is supposed to be more steadfast than that.  If they want to do some soap opera plots, they can always use Cisco or Joe for those. But I want the Flash to be focused on his mission. Otherwise I'm worried that the show will end up like Arrow, whch I've no intension of watching anymore."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,neondemon,4,Thu Jun 18 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"You're worried that the show will devolve into a soap opera, but you want Barry to develop sparks with a woman who was engaged to a guy who died but is now alive again and has super powers? No, certainly no possible drama there! /s      Over the last season, Barry has cared about one woman. Everyone else he's dated or had any interest in has been either a conscious or subconscious choice to avoid Iris. That's fairly straight forward character development for him and I would like the show to either keep that dynamic or move things forward with Iris."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,Sparkvoltage,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:06:50 2015 UTC,Did you forget that they CAN'T put sparks between Caitlin and Barry because Caitlin is married to Ronnie now?
FlashTV,3aa1i7,DMPunk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:18:06 2015 UTC,Barry is steadfast but is he supposed to be stuck on Iris for the eternity of the show? Especially when she's not interested in him?
FlashTV,3aa1i7,DandelionHearts,2,Fri Jun 19 09:04:05 2015 UTC,"That suggests that the whole show is all about Barry trying to get Iris. To me that's the least interesting part of the show. So if there's another love triangle (mirroring the one with Eddie, Iris and Barry in the first season), then that's another season with more of the show devoted to stuff that doesn't interest me--leaving less of the show for the stuff that does interest me. If that keeps up, my interest could dwindle to none."
FlashTV,3aa1i7,falcon4287,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:52:50 2015 UTC,I guess I was wrong in my assumption that the show was about Barry's super powers and his attempt to save the world.
FlashTV,3aa1i7,anroroco,4,Thu Jun 18 17:22:38 2015 UTC,Rule of thumb is if the audition video gets leaked it means they didn't get the part.

FlashTV,3ad66s,DuEbrithil,2,Fri Jun 19 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"A full Flash game would be incredible. Until then I can recommend trying out DC Universe Online for those that don't know about it. Haven't played it too much yet, but I had a lot of fun running around at superspeed so far (sadly you need level 9 first for maximum speed though). No clue if it's good for playing it over a longer period of time, but it's free, so if you just want to run around a bit, you can just do it."

FlashTV,3ad66s,Sick_Boy_Paddy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:34:17 2015 UTC,"DCUO is one of the best free MMOs I've played. When games advertise themselves as ""free"" I have this weird determination to not spend money on them, but I liked DCUO enough to get a membership to get the extra features. For the amount it adds, the price wasn't too bad. Some of the later (level 30+) quests are kinda lazily put together, but there are some very good ones, and they're packed with references to classic DC stories, and some actually decent bits of voice acting, and other cool DC fandom easter eggs, but the combat, the movement, and powers are a lot of fun to play with. Sometimes I just log on to fly around and clear my mind for a few minutes with some music on, maybe rain arrows down on some unsuspecting low-level NPC. It's probably the best free game you can get on PS4, not counting the monthly Plus deals."

FlashTV,3a7s1m,TheAmazingSpiderLin,46,Thu Jun 18 00:18:31 2015 UTC,Well this actually makes me optimistic about her.  She'll be Joe's partner rather than Barry's assistant so hopefully that means that she'll stand as her own character rather than just be a distraction like Linda.
FlashTV,3a7s1m,incredibleamadeuscho,4,Wed Jun 17 23:03:36 2015 UTC,Linda Park was such a waste. They could have used any other interest besides Linda Park. Hell. They could have used the same actress and name her Marianne or something.

I am a big fan of yours! Uh of your work I mean. I've read all your reports. Scientifics reports."" Awkward girl who babbles nervously (and is apparently blond), meh... déjà vu. Same with her speech to Joe. Sounds like McKenna Hall mixed with Felicity."
FlashTV,3a7s1m,Keegman_99,2,Thu Jun 18 03:27:26 2015 UTC,I really hope not. They could actually make her character not as annoying as Iris or Felicity.  Who am I kidding? It's the CW; they're going to make us pull our hair out.
FlashTV,3a7s1m,Airsay58259,2,Thu Jun 18 17:51:00 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling she will be very much likeable like Eddie, or Linda at first. We will all love her and then the CW will happen: Barry & Iris drama ruining things, something happening to Patty... We just know before it even happens that things won't end well with these two. I hope they can give us good writing for her until the end though, not like they did with Linda's last scenes (or Felicity season 3 for that matter). Really these writers can apparently only write good female characters when they are not involved in a (dramatic?) relationship with the hero, like Laurel S3 or Caitlin."

FlashTV,3a7s1m,Devidose,9,Thu Jun 18 00:08:00 2015 UTC,So a similar reason to why Eddie dumped Iris; because of potential future events and people accepting that to be pre-determined.

FlashTV,3a7s1m,ajroarlions,4,Thu Jun 18 02:32:43 2015 UTC,I interpreted it as her breaking up with him because she was tired of being in the middle of superhero/speed force stuff.

FlashTV,3a7s1m,platinumrug,12,Wed Jun 17 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"Pointless if it's the only thing her character is going used for is being Barry's love interest. I hope they do more than that, I get she'll be Joe's new partner but like come on, I hope there's more."
FlashTV,3a7s1m,Sudocremed_Myself,13,Wed Jun 17 22:59:08 2015 UTC,"I think he meant pointless because we know that Barry will eventually get with Iris. So her being a love interest at all is pointless. I don't know, maybe they'll do something interesting and new with that love triangle troupe. Maybe Barry will get with Iris and Patty never confesses her feelings, then on Barry and Iris's wedding day, Bart Allen comes back from the future but instead of being Iris's grandson, he's Patty's, and that's where the drama comes from. I just really don't want another ""Oh I got in a fight with the girl I like, so I'm going to get with this other girl who likes me, only she knows I'm meant to be with the first girl so she breaks up with me in a totally undramatic way because she understands I will never love her like the other girl"""

FlashTV,3a7s1m,platinumrug,2,Thu Jun 18 02:33:43 2015 UTC,I know he meant that but it bothered me mainly because if pattys character only role to be the flashs love interest then she will be less interesting because of that. We shall see though.

Eobard was offering him the chance to undo 15 years of emotional and psychological trauma, get his father out of prison, bring his mom back to life, and possibly land him the girl of his dreams. There's also the possibility that stopping Eobard that night could save the lives of Harrison and Tess, along with keeping Ronnie from getting Firestorm'd and all the other crazy shit that came from the particle accelerator.

The first video makes it sound like Jay Garrick: he makes a comment about making decisions fast, and on the fly, and it sounds like he's talking to Barry. The second video, however, seems like he's talking to Cisco close after getting his powers, which doesn't line up with Jay already being active (helmet in the season finally), and experienced as a speedster.  Other then Jay: It's probably not a recasting of Jason Rush or a casting for Wally, since both of those characters are African American.  Honestly, it might be Mirror Master? Make him a meta, start him off as an ally, ends up as Barry's nemesis?  Or I could be reading to deep and it's just Jay."

John Clark's casting didn't include anything about a military background, which is pretty crucial to Captain Atom's character. His containment suit would also be problematic: Captain Atom is a being made of pure energy, so they would have to cover his entire body at all times whenever he's on screen. Either they'd have to alter his costume, which could be uncomfortable for the actor and potentially upsetting for fans, they CG everything, which would be expensive as heck, or change Captain Atom's origins and power set, which would definitely anger fans.  Not to mention that we already have The Atom. Non-comics-reading audience members would probably be a little weirded out by two characters with completely different abilities with names so close."
FlashTV,3a80lm,rush247,4,Wed Jun 17 23:30:10 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't they do Captain Atom though? Eiling was involved in the project wasn't he?  It makes sense to me that they'd add him to the roster.

FlashTV,3a80lm,Todrick,5,Fri Jun 19 01:25:25 2015 UTC,Jesus jumped up and played the fiddle. This sounds so much like Hal Jordan that I might have an erection.
FlashTV,3a80lm,MothaFuckingSorcerer,5,Thu Jun 18 00:37:17 2015 UTC,It didn't at all... This guy has powers.  Not a gadget.
FlashTV,3a80lm,az4z3l,13,Thu Jun 18 00:51:28 2015 UTC,I meant the delivery and attitude of this actor.
FlashTV,3a80lm,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,0,Thu Jun 18 00:59:31 2015 UTC,This is a casting tape though. How he behaves means nothing about what character it is
FlashTV,3a80lm,az4z3l,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:44:09 2015 UTC,"Opposite. The content of what he says doesn't mean shit. By this I mean that just because he says he's more experienced or he got his powers from the particle accellerator it doesn't mean that's true. It's just scenes written to see how the actor would portray the character in that type of scene.  The words the character uses indicates to the actor how to play the role. Given certain words in the dialogue (such as calling Barry kid, asking out Caitlin) indicates a cocky attitude. This is all very Hal in terms of character word choice."
FlashTV,3a80lm,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,0,Fri Jun 19 01:51:14 2015 UTC,....so it's about the dialogue and not how the actor behaves.
FlashTV,3a80lm,az4z3l,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:23:47 2015 UTC,"It's about stylistic dialogue, which is what the actor uses to determine how he plays the role.  Calling barry ""kid"" is important, saying he got his abilities from the accelerator is not. Asking Caitlyn out is important, saying he's more powerful than Barry is not."
FlashTV,3a80lm,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:14:33 2015 UTC,I like how you continue to down vote and argue against me saying it's about dialogue and in the same breath say it is about dialogue.
FlashTV,3a80lm,az4z3l,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:31:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't voted once, nor have I argued (except now). I've stated that it's not about what is written, but how it's written. Hue it's written plays a large role in how the actor plays it. Focus on how the actor says his lines, if not the way he says them them the phrasing he uses, but don't pay any mind to the plotline behind his words. That's irrellevant."
FlashTV,3a80lm,OmegaX123,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:34:58 2015 UTC,My point from the beginning has been the actor didn't necessarily get the role so how he behaves is irrelevant. It is how the character behaves in the dialogue... How he interprets the character doesn't provide us with any additional information beyond what the script provides.
FlashTV,3a80lm,az4z3l,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly what the other guy said. Some auditions don't even use dialogue relevant to the series/movie/play, let alone to the character they're reading for. I've heard of people auditioning for a movie, and being given lines from a Broadway play to read (with the movie definitely not being a film version of the Broadway play)."
FlashTV,3a80lm,bobafoot17,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:11:58 2015 UTC,But this guy didn't necessarily get cast as the character did he? So he isn't necessarily doing the character correctly
FlashTV,3a80lm,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:29:05 2015 UTC,"The first one does for sure, but the second, not so much. I lost all hope for Hal on the second video in fact."
FlashTV,3a80lm,MainlyPardoo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:18:19 2015 UTC,"None of these scenes are guaranteed to be in the show. They are written to see how the actor would portray the character in that scene. The actual plot details in the dialogue don't matter. Rewatch the second video, don't try to figure out the plot, just figure out if it seems like something a person with Hal's personality would say."
FlashTV,3a80lm,technopear,4,Fri Jun 19 01:57:32 2015 UTC,Maybe it's Atom Smasher?
FlashTV,3a80lm,chowder7116,2,Thu Jun 18 03:44:26 2015 UTC,His powers scare himself. Maybe Atom Smasher or Damage?

FlashTV,3a80lm,sonofodin25,2,Fri Jun 19 12:33:53 2015 UTC,"There are a couple things to keep in mind when it comes to audition tapes like this.  First, the dialogue usually isn't an exact match of the lines, but either from an early draft of the script or a piece that is similar to what the character would say or do.  If you're looking for a gritty tough guy, you'd have them read lines from another gritty tough guy.  Second, the actors are usually coming in cold.  They get the lines when they show up at the audition, so they have little to run with.  They have a few minutes to memorize these sequences, and add what they can to the performance.  The actor is still fleshing out the character.  You won't normally get a Christopher Lee level performance out of an audition like this.  Third, these are looking more for look than performance.  If they've got the right look for the character, and they can show some range, then they might either be brought back for another audition or a warm read where the actor will interact a little more, perhaps move some more and can get to the base of the character.  Overall, not bad.  The lines sound like a gruff badass who's still unsure of himself.  The first video sounds like it was shot first.  He came off as more of an adversarial hard-ass than in the second one, where he let a small pang of fear and doubt creep in."
FlashTV,3a80lm,demosthenes718,2,Fri Jun 19 15:03:59 2015 UTC,"Dialogue sounds like Green Lantern, but he wouldn't get his powers from the particle accelerator...."
FlashTV,3a80lm,xpoz,2,Fri Jun 19 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"I don't see how this could be anyone but Hal. They'll just change the lines about his powers to talk about the ring.   Seriously, it fits the character, and GL's been teased several times (Ferris Air, Coast City, the ""missing pilot"" line from Rogue Air)."
FlashTV,3a80lm,martyoz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:13:48 2015 UTC,"the ""missing pilot"" line from Rogue Air   they waited a long time to pull that one out. it was in the original pilot script but it didn't make the final version that ultimately aired. i was happy to see it reappear when it did"
FlashTV,3a80lm,ram-a-gin-satan,5,Sun Jun 21 05:06:54 2015 UTC,Could be Metamorpho.   They could be prepping the cgi for future Green Lantern contructs by using their episode budgets on Metamorpho's similar shapechanging.  I notice his wiki mentions Arrow has referenced his character multiple times already.
FlashTV,3a80lm,ShadowSlayerX,2,Wed Jun 17 23:54:02 2015 UTC,Maybe it's Hawkman?
FlashTV,3a80lm,13goingondaniel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:12:12 2015 UTC,It would tie in to Legends with Hawkgirl. The character may have powers but they don't have to be from the accelerator :)
FlashTV,3a80lm,MainlyPardoo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:06:01 2015 UTC,Maybe he's trying out for multiple parts here? Or is it just an audition for 'John Clark'?

FlashTV,3a80lm,Todrick,2,Thu Jun 18 03:00:23 2015 UTC,You think they'd seriously have him say in an audition that his powers came from a ring and then risk that leak getting out? That line means  little as to what his identity is.
FlashTV,3a80lm,demosthenes718,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:33:56 2015 UTC,"You think they'd bother putting a line in either way if it mattered?  If it WAS Green lantern... why go through he trouble of putting in a fake line like that... why not just have him read a line that doesn't make mention of his powers origin or the effect on his body.  Especially since aliased reads are not divulged to the actor either.  The lines are usually accurate.  One of my daughters friends read for a role and it was obvious from the Dialog that it was Zoolander 2... this was before it was confirmed that the film was happening and the role and movie as described to him were definitely hush hush and definitely not ""Zoolander 2"".  Spoiler: Derek has a son, who's not exactly model material.  It's common to read for an aliased role with real lines... even if those lines give away who the character is or what the role may be."

FlashTV,3a80lm,frozensponge,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:09:43 2015 UTC,You didn't read the rest of my post did you?  They don't do that for aliased reads.  They use real lines with aliased character names.

Labs inventories in that city. They talk to Felicity and Barry's status - in coma - is mentioned.

FlashTV,3a474c,suss2it,3,Wed Jun 17 16:43:52 2015 UTC,"That would be a stupid argument to make. Beyond the ridiculousness of arguing about the powers of a fictional character, there is a physics/chemistry explaination for that power. Speed/temperature causes molecules to separate from each other, as The Flash phases through an object he's speeding up his molecules enough to pass through the spaces between the molecules of the object he is phasing through."
FlashTV,3a474c,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,-3,Wed Jun 17 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"That's assuming that Flash also somehow has the power to control his molecules. I mean yeah there's pseudo-science to support any power, that's the whole point of suspension of disbelief, but I don't really see phasing has one of his most relevant powers and it contributes to him being OPed as fuck, so if they don't introduce it in the DCCU, I won't be mad."
FlashTV,3a474c,suss2it,3,Wed Jun 17 17:12:50 2015 UTC,"Having fine control over his molecules has been one his powers since the silver age. I would be dissappointed if it wasn't one of his DCCU powers as it is the cool speed tricks like that that separate him from just being ""the guy that runs fast."""
FlashTV,3a474c,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,-2,Wed Jun 17 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think the DCCU is really going for a Silver Age feel tho. If that were the case we would've seen Superman's super-ventriloquism, his ability to shoot out a smaller version of himself from his hand and a myriad of other random powers. And there's so much you can do with just being ""the guy that runs fast"" before you even get to molecule control. Just look at Quicksilver in Days of Future Past and Age of Ultron."
FlashTV,3a474c,suss2it,2,Wed Jun 17 17:37:30 2015 UTC,I don't think the DCCU is really going for a Silver Age feel tho   That's not what I said at all. I was elaborating of the fact that the specific power we are discussing has been a part of The Flash mythos for 6 decades.
FlashTV,3a474c,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,6,Wed Jun 17 17:43:44 2015 UTC,One can also argue that a notmal human who dresses up as a bat and fights crime is stupid as fuck yet they kept that in the DCCU
FlashTV,3a474c,Theniallmc,2,Wed Jun 17 16:45:22 2015 UTC,"True... I guess it all depends on how powerful they want to make Flash. I can see them not including that or the vibrating things til they explode like he's Gambit either. As long as he's faster than Superman I won't mind if they don't throw in all of his little extra powers like phasing or ""speed-lending""."
FlashTV,3a474c,suss2it,0,Wed Jun 17 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"They did get rid of all the ""Batman is a supergenius at every form of engineering and personally created all his gadgets"" and the Sherlock Holmes level of plot-driven detective skills he has in the comics. You can keep some stuff and get rid of some stuff."
FlashTV,3a474c,latticusnon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:18:43 2015 UTC,The speed at which he goes makes the material semi irrelevant. It wouldn't impede him.   Also the problem with phasing is that the Flash needs to know when to phase. He's not omnipotent.

FlashTV,3a474c,Lildrummerman,0,Wed Jun 17 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you're going 8,000 times faster than the next guy until 10,000 times faster, does it matter?"

FlashTV,3a474c,Wheres_Wally,4,Wed Jun 17 13:13:28 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I think the guy with hardened speed force is the reverse flash (Daniel West I think). Flash has a type of metal."
FlashTV,3a474c,the_dharma_bum,2,Wed Jun 17 13:24:15 2015 UTC,Daniels suit was made out the shrapnel from the speedforce monorail that crashed on him and have him his powers. Barry's initial New 52 suit is made out of bits of light weight metal that attracted to his connection to the speed force.

He's certainly got phenomenal cosmic power, but it also seems to have some limitations. Veidt was able to limit his omniscience, for instance, and even (very) temporarily destroy his body. I'd say if Manhattan existed in a normal comic universe with other cosmic entities, he could potentially be outmatched.  And, on occasion, Doom has proven himself to be on par with such entities.  EDIT: In fact, I'd say Wells in particular is fully capable of defeating Manhattan and doing more damage.

FlashTV,3a3yxy,walterpinkman45,-7,Thu Jun 18 12:34:41 2015 UTC,"no, not right now, but I was most of the time I watched it which made it more acceptable.  Dodgy story lines, terrible acting, I probably shouldn't be saying this on a flash sub I guess. I still watched it, but mostly because once I start watching something I like to watch it all."
FlashTV,3a3yxy,threepwood82,7,Thu Jun 18 12:43:33 2015 UTC,"The acting wasn't terrible at all. Grant Gustin, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin killed it in every scene. Sure, there were a couple bumps, but it was a show in its first season. The actors had to build the chemistry. Also, it's a superhero show. Gotta suspend disbelief."
FlashTV,3a3yxy,walterpinkman45,2,Thu Jun 18 12:48:20 2015 UTC,"I remember watching Smallville in the beginning, and actors aside (sicen I can't remember performances as well from that far back), the first season wasn't as strong as Flash season one, and definitely fell prey to the monster of the week format and romantic melodrama more than Flash has in the same number of episodes."

Angels and demons storyline is my absolute favourite. But Season 10 just felt lacklustre to me so far.  I only saw up to episode 12 or so

Back in the day, when I didn't really used internet for anything and I didn't had Cable, I'd watch whtever was on. Supernatural was one of those things, but I didn't really liked the whole ""monster of the week"" thing. Only when the angels showed up, that's when I started paying attention.  Cass's reveal is still my favourite monent on the whole show."

FlashTV,3a3yxy,DrBodyguard,12,Wed Jun 17 01:23:54 2015 UTC,YAY! =D
FlashTV,3a3yxy,Dark_Knight_Reddits,10,Wed Jun 17 01:31:10 2015 UTC,"Yup! If they continue the trend, the second season should premier sometime early October 2015. (Season 1 premiered on Oct.7, 2014)  So in 110 days or so. Around the exact same time the 4th Season of Arrow will premier as well (Season 3 opener was the day after Flash Oct.8). Legends of Tomorrow, the third show in the same universe looks to premier sometime early January 2016 from articles I've read. Maybe they'll push back Arrow and Flash's season opener to premiere around the same time. But they might want the two shows to setup a stronger lead in for LoT. Currently it's a guessing game, but around October is probably the best bet for The Flash and Arrow until otherwise said.   The Flash had a very successful first season for a CW show. So a second season was everything but guaranteed.  Once the season opener is set in stone, I'd love this subreddit to setup a countdown timer. And because there's many little breaks, having a countdown till the next episode would be nice too, IMO. This subreddit is well done, it's just something I personally would like. /r/Formula1 has something similar to what I'm talking about. Doesn't need hours and minutes, just days."
FlashTV,3a3yxy,TB97,2,Wed Jun 17 08:30:55 2015 UTC,Its definitely in October like you said. The guy who plays Dr. Ravi on iZombie said that's when both The Flash and iZombie would be returning
FlashTV,3a3yxy,Airsay58259,2,Wed Jun 17 09:06:28 2015 UTC,"The Arrow is something I've been avoiding, mostly because he's now a very serious character and I've never seen him as too serious. Is he as dark and brooding always as he was in the Flash vs the Arrow?  Or is it okay to watch them separately?"
FlashTV,3a3yxy,Dark_Knight_Reddits,3,Wed Jun 17 13:14:43 2015 UTC,"I guess you can watch them separately but season 1 of the Flash is full of spoilers for Arrow season 3. At some point, for absolutely no reason at all, one character explains everything that has happened in Arrow that year... (episode 18)   Oliver is really that dark. In Flash VS Arrow he even smiles a few times, in his own show not so much... Well he has his moments and his own humor but mostly he's very serious."
FlashTV,3a3yxy,Hpfm2,3,Wed Jun 17 13:42:00 2015 UTC,"Yes he always pretty dark and brooding. If you aren't a fan of that I'd recommend skipping it. It's absolutely fine to watch them separately. If you're up to giving it a try it probably won't hurt. But if it's an area that you get stuck on (and people have), than it probably won't be for you. Arrow's approach is a lot like Batman in that sense. 95% of the time serious, with the occasional period of easy going. Though they have mentioned they plan to make Arrow less serious over time."
FlashTV,3a3yxy,Airsay58259,2,Wed Jun 17 13:44:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I probably shouldn't watch it then. I watch the Flash to cheer me up."
FlashTV,3a3yxy,Dark_Knight_Reddits,2,Wed Jun 17 14:11:03 2015 UTC,"Season 3 of the Arrow ended with a pretty ""Adn they lived happily ever after"" moment.  People are saying the arrow will be a more Happy character based on this, on the fact that the showrunners have said ""season 4 will have a completely new direction"" or some thing like that, and that in the comics Oliver Queen is not suposed to be brooding AT ALL.  Anyway, I'm not a big Arrow fan either, but due to this I'll probably give it a shot once season 4 starts.I also recomend watching the episodes that crossover. If you didn't know Barry was actually introduced in Arrow, on the 8th and 9th episodes of season 2. And it was a pretty good introduction."
FlashTV,3a3yxy,Airsay58259,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"October 6th was confirmed a few days ago for the premiere date.

(Dat save, Wells)  -About Cisco's weapon: ""You know how I feel about weapons, Cisco, they do not belong at Star Labs"" (The first time I watched this chapter I thought he said this because he was... well, a good guy. Now I'm thinking It is because he doesn't want any super-advanced weapons used against him.)   ""Don't you EVER do something like that again.

He is so convincing when he feigns concern, and at the same time he makes such a sinister, conniving, machevalian type villain that he manipulates time to his own means and basically becomes the world's first major supervillain,. His fight with the trio of heroes(flash arrow and firestorm) was fucking epic , the best fight scene in a super hero live action type media I've seen in a while.

And, admittedly, I haven't read the Nightwing comic, so I don't really know anything about this new Prankster past his redesign.

I have nothing against the revised New 52 character, as I haven't read him; I'm just not a fan of the costume for that character. Divorced from the Prankster, it's...OK. At least, in my opinion."

FlashTV,3a1z4s,The_Llamapocalypse,14,Tue Jun 16 16:33:19 2015 UTC,The black hole was caused by Eddie shooting himself.  I'm not sure how many people are aware of that.  I don't see it mentioned much here.  I know people are aware him shooting himself caused Eobard to vanish but I'm not sure how many realize the rest.  Eobard caused that version of reality to exist thus this alternate earth has to end.  The black hole isn't from the device they were using but instead because Eddie shot himself.  The only way to stop the black hole is to stop Eddie from shooting himself.    The writers mentioned we'd see multiple alternate Earth's this season.  So they'd mean it's likely the season starts out for a bit with Barry going into the black hole and entering these other alternate Earths.  Legends will likely be built up over time and won't flesh out until the show itself starts mid season or until the episodes of Flash/Arrow before the break.  Nothing they can do to that black hole can stop it.  Not even...the Speed Force.

FlashTV,3a1z4s,ShlubbyWhyYouDan,3,Wed Jun 17 13:02:59 2015 UTC,"No they've said it'd be a mid season replacement which means it'd be in the winter.  I just looked it up and ""In May 2015, Garber revealed filming would begin in August 2015, for a January 2016 premiere. ""  Source: http://screenrant.com/flash-arrow-spinoff-show-premiere-date-2016/  I've never heard anything any differently and there you have the creators themselves saying the same."
FlashTV,3a1z4s,brucewaynewins,2,Wed Jun 17 13:54:39 2015 UTC,"It's a mid-season show. So, if it were this season, it would air after ""Out of Time"" and ""The Climb"" respectively. It will be airing when shows take their normal winter break I believe. This is 13 episodes."
FlashTV,3a1z4s,gadgetguy03,-6,Wed Jun 17 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"The one hole in that theory is that black holes don't erase timelines. If they did, we wouldn't be able to detect when something went in a black hole. We also have footage of stars being pulled into black holes. If these black holes were removing them from time, we wouldn't remember it."
FlashTV,3a1z4s,Morsus98,5,Tue Jun 16 22:24:59 2015 UTC,Except legit science isn't used in every case of this show. This is about storyline first and science second and that's pretty much always the case even when the science is legit. This is a drama not a PBS documentary.
FlashTV,3a1z4s,brucewaynewins,-2,Tue Jun 16 22:54:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the Eddie-cause-the-Black-Hole is a fan theory. It has not been confirmed by the show afaik, and unless it does science is a valid counter to the theory."

FlashTV,3a1z4s,gadgetguy03,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:59:56 2015 UTC,Valid idea but I was thinking the whole Cold stopping the Black Hole with Ice Gun ... is kind of .... scientifically impossible and complete BULLSHIT!  I can see Firestorm helping out though and I don't think that Jay Garrick will show up but I'm not sure.. it would be awesome though.  More then likely Flash most likely just breaks maybe the SPEEDFORCE barrier again ... but this time goes FASTER then last time and just .... fixes it that way through the use of the MacGuffin-Force

Seriously ... there's only soooo much bullshit a writer can do before he's laughed at for being completely and UTTERLY retarded and incompetent ... before being fired.  The COLD GUN FREEZING A BLACK HOLE... is bar-none the DUMBEST fucking idea I have ever read in fiction ... ever."

FlashTV,3a55xu,devilmonk,6,Wed Jun 17 08:49:45 2015 UTC,"The reason I enjoyed the finale so much, is because it brought a close to the whole season arc of Barry's mother and him trying to save her.  He went from having a personal goal that turned out to be impossible, and he dealt with it the only way he could, and said goodbye to her one last time.  The arc of the story was completed in the finale.  The wormhole is very much opening up events to cover season 2.  It was the prime setup device to explain away any changes that are coming in season 2 between eddie being erased from history, to RF also being erased.  Jay Garrick's hat was a great way to hint at the multiverse being introduced.  I am so super stoked for season 2."
FlashTV,3a55xu,Element1232,3,Wed Jun 17 15:34:01 2015 UTC,Hell of a way to end a first season for sure. Big risk but I think it worked.

At the conclusion of the fight, Flash and Turbine both escaped from the speedforce, but Turbine was afflicted with amnesia(short term)."
FlashTV,3a55xu,AREYOUSauRuS,0,Wed Jun 17 12:08:24 2015 UTC,"It did end too abruptly. But I do like what that abrupt ending could mean though. If Eobad or however you spell his name is dead, then who makes the ""cure"" that takes away Slade Wilson's powers and the powers of his crew? Which means that the ending to season two of Arrow doesn't happen, which means season 3 never happened!   They now have the ability to wipe season 3 of Arrow off the map and start over again. Maybe even have Felicity die! So if that's what it takes, season ones ending of Flash can stay the way it is."

""N: What went into that design? It’s quite a new look for Caitlin.  DP: Oh yeah. So much went into it. Actually that concept and that idea was something that Andrew Kreisberg had come up with earlier in the season. I think he had originally planned it for episode 15. But it just didn’t work at that time with that script. So they waited and pushed it to the finale, which was actually great because it gave us some more time to finesse everything. That’s not the original Killer Frost suit and design. The first suit we designed was actually a one-piece. And Kate [Main], our costume designer, had a gut instinct that we should take it in a different direction. The suit you saw is actually two pieces. You really just see the top of it in the season finale. But it’s a pretty cool design. There’s a lot of leather. There’s a lot of blue. The costume itself took months to make. It was all custom. Then the hair and makeup was also a process as well. The original wig we started out with, a white wig, was very short. It was more of a pixie cut. And Sarah [Koppes], the department head for hair and Andrew and I just had some conversations, and Sarah is absolutely amazing. She [made] that wig basically from scratch. She got as much hair as she could and she sewed it. So that’s my very own special Killer Frost wig, which I love.The makeup too was a lot of trial and error. I felt very strongly that she should have navy blue lips, which you see. But we tried whiting her out a little bit more. I don’t know that you fully got to see how beautiful Cayley [Giene]’s, my makeup artist’s, job was. But I can’t wait for fans and the audience to see more.  N: Did you also have to wear colored contacts?  DP: Oh yes. Those are contacts. We ordered those contacts. I actually have terrible vision. So we tried on the contacts just with the color, without my prescription in them first. Then they specially made them. They’ve actually got more of a lavender, purplish hue to them… I’m really proud of that look. I’m really excited.""  Edit: I just realised the suit isn't a corset :o"

FlashTV,39uuzk,MiddleClassAsian,6,Wed Jun 17 22:42:50 2015 UTC,"This leads to my theory.  Gideon was only telling Eobard what future-Barry programmed Gideon to tell him, to maintain the integrity of the timestream.  The Barry that creates Gideon will have already experienced season 1, the singularity, and whatever resolution they come up with season 2.  He will have also have already met Rip Hunter and learned about the importance of protecting the integrity of the timelines.  With all this knowledge, Barry will program Gideon to help Eobard as much as necessary to protect the timeline.  Which means information Eobard learned from Gideon could be lies set up by Barry."
FlashTV,39uuzk,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:51:16 2015 UTC,Barry couldn't have programmed Gideon to provide Thawne with the info about the timeline that didn't exist prior to the murder of Barry's mom.
FlashTV,39uuzk,ThumperLovesValve,0,Tue Jun 16 13:13:06 2015 UTC,"So what's different between the two timelines?  The accelerator going off in 2020 instead of 2015.   How do we even know that's true?  Because Gideon said so?  Nora being killed?  How do we know that that didn't always happen?  Eobard went back in time to kill Barry as a child shortly after learning Barry's real name, he told us that.  He didn't necessarily know anything about Nora.  (And some have suggested Gideon's probably the one that told Eobard who the Flash was, which fits real nicely with all this)  All Barry would have to do is make sure that Gideon relayed a few falsities to Eobard, that Eobard himself revealed to them."
FlashTV,39uuzk,AREYOUSauRuS,2,Tue Jun 16 13:21:17 2015 UTC,"Well, if Eobard went back in time to kill Barry and ends up killing Nora, it means there was a timeline prior to his time-travel where Barry grew up with both parents still alive (or at least not killed/incarcerated due to Eobard). Regardless of when the accelerator went off, it is assumed Eobard learned Flash's real name in the timeline where they haven't crossed paths and interrupted it when he arrived at Barry's house that night.  That being said, where did older Flash come from? Eobard was born after Barry's death in the original timeline (as hes from the future further down the road), how did older Flash know of Eobard's plans? That Flash must have come further down the road from the timeline we're watching, but the question is why is he fighting Reverse Flash instead of our Barry? It is pretty illogical for him to go back to where he went back to again and fight Reverse Flash while a younger him, the one that came there prior to him, is saying goodbye. Shouldn't it be vice-versa?  Either way, I think the real question is what happened to all the cows in Thawne's time."
FlashTV,39uuzk,ThumperLovesValve,2,Tue Jun 16 13:37:39 2015 UTC,"it means there was a timeline prior to his time-travel where Barry grew up with both parents still alive (or at least not killed/incarcerated due to Eobard).    It doesn't mean that.  Eobard could always have been the killer and he just didn't know until he actually did it.   where did older Flash come from   From the future, obviously.  It could be our Barry from the future.  Which is why he knew our Barry was going to be peering through the crack in the doorway and he stopped and raised his hand telling him not to do anything.   how did older Flash know of Eobard's plans   Because he is our Flash in the future, he has experienced the Thawne/Wells stuff already.   Shouldn't it be vice-versa?   No... The future Flash chased Eobard back there as destined.  He knows all about it while fighting Reverse Flash which is shown since he stops in the middle of the fight and raises a hand to tell our Barry to stop.   Either way, I think the real question is what happened to all the cows in Thawne's time.   That is an important question.  I blame Damian Wayne."

Which is why he knew our Barry was going to be peering through the crack in the doorway and he stopped and raised his hand telling him not to do anything.   This doesn't make sense as Eobard ceases to exist 3 minutes after Barry returns to the LHC to stop Eobard's departure. If Eddie kills himself, Eobard is never born. If he is never born, he could never time travel to begin with, so the present Barry returns to should be fundamentally different (as if he had taken the choice of stopping his mom's murder), not to mention the fight in Barry's home never took place.   I think we're thinking this through a lot more than the writers have. Even if time is not linear, it is consistent while there are a lot of things that aren't really consistent here. I would understand if they had killed Eobard, but that was not the case."

If Eddie kills himself   Exactly why it has to be the same timeline.  If Eobard was from a different timeline, Eddie's death would not have affected him.  As for the singularity....  They have to solve that problem still, I assume they're going to solve it.  It'd be real shitty for season2 episode1, a black hole eats the universe and the series ends."

Regardless of whether it is all the same timeline or not, if Eobard doesn't exist in the first place none of the events he took place in should exist.   I dunno, they'll probably use the black hole as a deus ex machina to keep the story going, but its quite a mess they put themselves in."

There are infinite timelines he exists in, as even the most incremental change in one causes it to split to another. Maybe he blinked twice when he was born, maybe he blinked once, maybe he didn't at all (just an example). There is a timeline for each instance.  Eddie is the origin of Eobard. Eddie kills himself, Eobard ceases to exist. That is given, so we know Eddie is the focal point of timelines that involve Eobard.   If he never existed in the first place, none of the timelines that have Eobard in them should exist."

She's been in a couple tv shows since the 70's but very few episodes were Diana centric, and one animated movie to call her own compared to the literal scores of superman and batman shows, movies, and even episodes on other shows where they were guest stars. They maintain that she's one of ""the Big Three"" but she gets less attention than the flash."
FlashTV,39twf6,suss2it,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:36:05 2015 UTC,"That still doesn't translate to hate. Superman and Batman are some of the most massive pop culture characters ever. Superman's shield is on par with the cross as far as ubiquitous icons go. And the reason she didn't have as many guest appearances is due to a contract that stipulated she can't appear in shows in which she's not the star, hence why we got Big Barda in the Justice League episode of Batman Beyond and not her. That's since been cleared up and she's been in Young Justice and Brave and the Bold since.  Yeah, the whole big 3 thing is a marketing gimmick and I'm sorry you fell for it, but DC only really has a big 2 and that's Superman and Batman. Doesn't mean that they hate Wonder Woman tho, because again if they did, why would they give her own solo live-action movie? Why would they not just cancel her comic instead of giving her 4 ongoings (Wonder Woman, Superman/Wonder Woman, Sensational Comics featuring Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman 77)? Why would they even give her own animated movie to begin with, why would they have her co-star in the animated Justice League movies? These are not the actions of a corporation that 'hates' a certain character. Hell, they even tried to give her own TV show and cancelled it when the pilot turned out to be shitty, if they hated her so much A) she wouldn't even gotten a pilot in the first place and B) they would've just let the shitty thing go straight to TV to tarnish her reputation.  Nah, I don't think DC hates her, I just think you're salty that she's not the most popular character at DC and therefore doesn't receive as much attention."

When RF changes the timeline by killing Nora, he shuffles things around. This causes a universe in which (I believe) None of the Waynes died that night, or perhaps they did. Maybe all the Waynes died instead, and now Wayne Industries is owned and run by Lucius Fox.

Surely his success is due to Robbie Amell. Yes, he had a role on The Flash that was interesting, but for the longest time he was just a presence, not a fully developed character. And Amell scored all those roles before the Firestorm character got hot (pun intended).  The producers will probably work with him so he can make occasional guest appearances when his schedule allows it, but he won't be a series regular on either The Flash or Legends of Tomorrow.  Even as they left it on The Flash, it would be difficult to explain how Ronnie is on one show, while his wife is on another show--and difficult for the actors who do that crossing over. I don't think Ronnie will die--but he might spend a lot of time on ice (another intentional pun)."

A big close-up on his face when he tried to get up painfully, one on Caitlin's face when she saw him get blasted... The all thing seemed pretty intense to just be a boo-boo. I kinda expected him to pass out later or to touch the back of his head and see blood on his hand. Hopefully it was nothing and they won't use that as the LOT explanation."

Stein will have an another half and we will see his face, the only questions are: who's face is it and will he be a regular (probably not Robbie Amell then) or a guest-star (could be Robbie)? My money is on Stein being a regular as the team's scientist and his other half being a guest-star who comes around as the Deus ex Machina of the team. Let's not forget Heat Wave is on the team, two regular with fire powers/gun would be redundant IMO."

At least not in my part of the state (a more rural area). It's usually white girls with black guys or white girls with Mexican guys, and they get judged pretty harshly. It's so rare, so rare to see a white guy with a black or Mexican girl or black or Mexican girls dating outside their races. So rare in fact that one day I saw a white guy and a black girl couple and it made me double take. I wasn't judging, it was more like seeing a unicorn lol.   I will say this, though. The mixed race kids that come from these couples are never mistreated, and when they are, there's hell to pay. Example: there's a private ""community center"" with a pool that's open during summers. This place is where the richer, more well connected families take their kids to swim. Last summer, one of its members brought her granddaughter to the center to swim, only to get told she couldn't because she (the 4 year old granddaughter) was mix race. Yeeeeah. Nearly all of the members either pulled their memberships for the rest of the summer until they allowed the little girl to swim or pulled out all together saying they didn't want to be a part of a place that would treat children that way. It's just recent opened again and I'm hearing tales they've taken a hard hit in memberships this summer due to that fiasco."

Also can we just admit that ""diversity"" just means black. Adding ""diversity"" on tv doesn't mean adding actual diversity, it just means adding black people to the cast.  Because fuck hispanic, asian, and arab people I guess.  Let's see, what is DC's running tally so far...  Perry White: white > black  Jimmy Olsen: white > black  Walter Steele: white > black  Iris and Joe West (and Wally): white > black  Hawkgirl/woman: white > black  Deadshot: white > black  Ra's al Ghul(x2): arab > white  Bane: hispanic > white  Good job DC! Soo diverse!  There are almost 15 million more hispanic people than black people in the United States. Maybe someone should tell Hollywood.  lol and of course reddit's response: ""Oh no! someone is pointing out this is hypocritical, feelgoodery bullshit!

If we're talking the DC movies as well they have:  Gal Gadot - Israeli  Jason Momoa - Hawaiian  Dwayne Johnson - black/samoan  Ray Fisher - black  I get that we should have more hispanic, asian, and arabic characters/actors. But it's still better since a majority of  american shows/movies star straight white people.  Edit: if there's anything to complain about DC's diversity, it's the lack of LGBT main characters. But seeing as how there aren't that many in comics they'd probably have to change the sexuality of an existing character.  And I'm sure that would go over well with fans"

I'm from France and though we are definitely not perfect (our issue this decade is more with religions), we don't discuss people's ""race"" everywhere... The word ""race"" actually refers to the human race and it's considered racist to suggest white is one race, black another and so on. I mean I was there around the time X-Men DOFP was released and Omar Sy was described as a french black actor in every media. What the hell? Reverse example, in basically every American article about the Flash and Iris West, they talk about her skin color. Even now after a year. To talk about her great performance in the finale, they remind again people of her skin color. What did they say in our magazines? That Candice Patton had a little role in Grey's Anatomy and Castle (I think), she was really starting her career. That's it. Diversity is great but at some point we should be able to discuss an actor without mentioning their skin...   This is not me bashing the US, we have different cultures and histories, but I was definitely surprised by the importance of skin color.

It does show up on Urban Dictionary in that sense, so I'm sure you're right about that usage where you are, but it's doesn't seem to be something that's particularly widespread or well known. It's not in any dictionary sites that I've checked. For most people, tardy just means late.  And btw, 'retarded' is a perjorative in itself. It really isn't a word you should be using anyway, if you're trying to be sensitive towards people with mental disabilities."

FlashTV,39nybw,SunDragon1947,15,Mon Jun 15 17:08:24 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he just thinks that Barry is in contact the flash somehow.
FlashTV,39nybw,ProfessorEGadd,17,Sat Jun 13 03:46:47 2015 UTC,I think he has suspected something weird about Barry since the time he super speeded to a crime scene and changed into clothes from a store across the road in like episode 2.
FlashTV,39nybw,liamjesse,14,Sat Jun 13 03:11:32 2015 UTC,Could it be because he knows about Iris' blog and he assumes Joe and Barry know?
FlashTV,39nybw,HakatoX,6,Sat Jun 13 04:30:06 2015 UTC,"Singh's fiancee also mentioned that he speaks a lot about Barry. While that could just mean he appreciates Barry's help in the force, it could also mean he's got a pretty interesting theory..."
FlashTV,39nybw,silverinferno3,4,Sat Jun 13 12:00:00 2015 UTC,By now Singh realizes that Joe and Eddie seem to work a lot of Flash cases. So he just assumes Flash is in contact with Joe like how Iris was in contact.
FlashTV,39nybw,neoblackdragon,3,Sat Jun 13 16:20:33 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  Near the end of the season, the glances Singh was giving Barry while talking about The Flash, leads me to believe his character might have very high suspicions at the very least."

During their panel at PaleyFest today, executive producer Greg Berlanti revealed they’re leaning towards introducing another speedster, such as Wally West or Bart Allen, into the show when it returns this fall.  “That’s our hope,” Berlanti said when asked if one of the two might appear (via TVLine). “We’ve already been picked up for a second year. If we were going to do something like that, we’d do it next year.” from: http://www.superherohype.com/news/333611-season-two-of-the-flash-could-introduce-wally-west-or-bart-allen"

Perhaps Wally could exist as Kid Flash already in an alternate timeline, and somehow get stuck in our timeline. Plenty of character development to be had in terms of Wally getting used to his new world, and all the people he knows like Iris and Joe and Barry not being the ones he knew. And it doesn't even have to break continuity from the comics because it's already been said that this is an alternate timeline from that."

What you're referring to is called a 'paradox', and it's an inherent, almost unavoidable part of time travel friction. The few stories that kinda-sorta avoids paradoxes (although they often have A-causes-B-causes-A-paradoxes) are the ones that employ timetraveling within a single version of a single timeline (LOST, Primer, Looper, ...Back to the future?). Most other shows/movies just use a combination of ignoring paradoxes, employing multiple realities and generally just making stuff up as they go along (Dr. Who, The Flash, Fringe, Heroes etc.). The best, and only ""clean"" rules, IMO, are Star Treks' - whenever you time-travel you simultaneously travel to a parallel universe, and thus can never alter the past of your reality."

FlashTV,39l7x7,RevolutionDoctor,16,Fri Jun 12 14:43:24 2015 UTC,If Flash had gotten canceled this would have been the best mic drop of all time. Makes a perfect single season show of a hero finally putting aside his doubts and learning to believe in himself.

FlashTV,39l7x7,Th3Harbing3r,6,Fri Jun 12 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"I agree, and thank you! I didn't know how people would react, since I'm not an experienced video editor or anything."
FlashTV,39l7x7,This_years_villian,2,Fri Jun 12 22:05:13 2015 UTC,"I think if they want to go the way of the Flash legacy on the show they should absolutely do it like this, but we need to grow the Flash family more first, setting up the idea of a legacy that flows forwards and backwards like in the comics (Max Mercury, Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, Wally West, Bart Allen are all speedsters,) as in the comics there's this idea of there has always been a Flash, and that there will always be a Flash, which is really interesting imo. If they DO ever decide to pass the Flash mantle, the COIE ending is the way to do it."
FlashTV,39l7x7,This_years_villian,5,Mon Jun 15 02:38:35 2015 UTC,"Can someone quickly explain something to me? I know that during Crisis on Infinite Earths, Barry stopped the anti-matter cannon from firing but in doing so merged with the speedforce. His identity was erased but it was revealed that he was the lightning bolt that game him his powers (beautifully represented in this video by the way). But in Final Crisis Barry re-emerged from the speedforce with the black racer chasing him.   My question is, is Barry separating from the speedforce AFTER he hit himself as the lightning bolt, or is that how he's going to end up dying in the future, by giving birth to the flash?"
FlashTV,39l7x7,Th3Harbing3r,4,Fri Jun 12 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't read everything, but my understanding was that Speedforce-Barry hit pre-Flash-Barry with a part of the Speedforce. The spark that starts it all.  Speedforce is kind of more a place than thing.  So Barry enters it in C.o.I.E., realizes he creates himself or something, bolts his past self, and then reemerges with Black racer or whoever (didn't it turn out to be a reverse-flash that brought Barry back? or is that a Wally story line?)."
FlashTV,39l7x7,This_years_villian,5,Fri Jun 12 21:56:24 2015 UTC,"Comic wise, I believe that's what probably happened. But the showmakers may not decide to go with that, a lot of things get changed along the way from comics to tv. Comics to movies and vice versa. But if the Flash has proven anything, audiences can accept a lot of comic booky stuff..."
FlashTV,39l7x7,Th3Harbing3r,3,Fri Jun 12 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"I'd love for them to keep it beautifully written like this and full-circle.  I fear they'll want to lean into the ""nobody stays dead forever"" trope.    They'll probably have a season end with Barry running into oblivion and then striking himself just like you did.  After that, I'd like Barry to be gone for a whole season, just to watch how that effects things. But I'd imagine they'd only have Barry ""dead"" in the speedforce for 3 episodes or so, and then Jay Garrick and Wally would go get him.  Either way, the episode they get him back: cold open, have the same scene of Barry getting struck in the lab, then notice how the bolt keeps striking the ground for a second after Barry is thrown into the chemicals? So as soon as Barry goes airborne, have everything slow down/freeze and show Wally and Jay burst into the room and run into the lighting bolt before it ""closes."" Roll opening credits. Then have the three of them have a conversation ""explaining speedforce"", maybe even have Barry show he struck Wally with his lighting too, followed by the 3 of them busting out of the speedforce together back to wherever Wally and Jay started. In fact they should put that cold open as the season opener and then hype the timetravel/speedfroce travel for 3 episodes.    Edit: although I guess that overlooks Black Racer... maybe have him just pop out with them instead. Metaphor for consequences of bringing back the dead. Idk, this is why I rant on the internet instead of writing tv"
FlashTV,39l7x7,This_years_villian,3,Fri Jun 12 22:54:03 2015 UTC,"Personally I feel that if they do this ending to a season on the show they really gotta stick with it. IF they decide to give Barry an ending, then they should just go full on with Wally as the Flash. As a huge Flash fan, the idea of legacy is really present in the mythos, and it'd be a shame if they don't at least try. 4 seasons of Barry Flash and 4 seasons of Wally Flash I say."
FlashTV,39l7x7,Th3Harbing3r,2,Mon Jun 15 02:41:37 2015 UTC,Well yea it did turn out to be Thawne in Flash Rebirth but it was Black racer chasing him. It's speedforcey and deus ex machina-y and confusing so I just roll with it for the most part.

FlashTV,39l7x7,Spizard,3,Fri Jun 12 23:07:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's the latter, as much as I don't want Barry to die anytime soon (he's frickin' awesome!) Him dying by giving birth to the Flash, himself pretty much, would be a nice way to bring things full circle. And yes, while there might be a couple people not happy with it, because it essentially might put this show in a time loop or something. I think 5-10 years down the line, this would be the perfect bookend for the showrunners to leave such a fantastic show on.   And thank you for the feedback!

FlashTV,39l7x7,gattovatto,2,Fri Jun 12 22:03:46 2015 UTC,"I was choking up a little to be honest.    If I may ask, what was the music playing after Barry gets struck by lighting in the lab? the light piano keys, sounded so familiar."
FlashTV,39l7x7,bp83,3,Fri Jun 12 22:14:16 2015 UTC,"It's actually from the Flash soundtrack, the OST is called 'My name is Barry Allen' if you want to look it up! I'm pretty sure that's what it was anyways."
FlashTV,39l7x7,gattovatto,2,Fri Jun 12 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. It's a perfect way for the show to end. The only problem with the idea is that fans of JUST the TV series might feel like they've wasted their time. Because we knew it would be coming and we'd just be getting popcorn ready. They might think think those 5-10 years were wasted.   It's an incredibly well made edit and something to be proud of! The ominous feeling of the voiceovers, the change in music when he was hit by the lightning making it both heartbreaking and uplifting simultaneously, the editing in the clip of Barry going back in time was all very seamlessly done.

FlashTV,39qhen,Taconinja10000,6,Sun Jun 14 19:16:55 2015 UTC,"This season is about Barry learning to control his powers. The first few episodes are quite lackluster and slow and you can expect a few more things that will bother you when you watch it in the sense of ""how did that hit him, when he is that fast?"". BUT: This season has a main villain and he appears in episode 9 IIRC and then the show gets great and starts to get better and better. He will still have those moments, that don't make too much sense initially, but you have to remember, that he doesn't have his powers for long. He is still learning to think fast and to get better reflexes/reaction times.    TLDR: It's his first season with super powers, give him some time to develop them and try to look over some scenes that don't make too much sense (bees...). But outside of that the show gets pretty cool if you like comic book storys and has really great moments. Though if you want a super realistic and scientifically acurate show, this one isn't your show, since the thing that gave Flash such a huge fanbase is the comic book-ness. [Ok, that isn't a TLDR]  TLDR of the TLDR: It get's a whole lot better. If you like comic books, you'll love this show."
FlashTV,39qhen,DuEbrithil,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:45:01 2015 UTC,The first few episodes were amazing in my opinion. Way better than arrows first few.
FlashTV,39qhen,Keiigo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:52:49 2015 UTC,"True, but it's still the weak part of the season IMO."

It's not really his abilities or the science puts me off, it's mostly the moody teenager personality they slapped on him, I really hate the moody teenager tv trope."
FlashTV,39qhen,DuEbrithil,5,Sat Jun 13 20:05:55 2015 UTC,"Well, he has to deal with quite a bit of conflicts (especially emotional conflicts) in this season, but I don't remember him as a ""moody teenager"", since I could understand his conflicts. I haven't watched the first episodes for quite some time, so it might have gone away over time and I just don't remember it. I really enjoyed his personality towards the end of the season, his conflicts get way better once it shifts a bit away from his love life.   You don't have to read comics to like Flash. You should just be able to appreciate comic book-like logic. Some things are really crazy for a TV show but normal for comics, so if someone dislikes comics for having weird logic, he would probably dislike this show. Example (not from Flash to avoid spoilers): In some stories Superman moves an entire planet on his own. You wouldn't see this in a normal TV show, but The Flash has some crazy stuff like this (obviously not moving a planet, but different stuff happens).  All in all I would recommend watching it further, it honestly gets a lot better once the villain shows up."
FlashTV,39qhen,DuEbrithil,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"I do love and collect comics, though I'm mostly familiar with European stuff like Moebius, Jodorowsky etc... I have some Witchblade/Darkness and a little Spawn in my collection as well.   I'm familiar with both marvel and DC as well but mostly through tv/movies or games and not so much the comics sadly. I'm fine with comic book logic at any rate. :)  As I mentioned elsewhere in this thread, what bothers me most is the discrepancy between his professional and personal life. His strong analytical mind during work as opposed to his refusal to listen to advice or think things through outside of work.  As for the moody teenager impression, it probably comes from his whole ""You're not my real dad!"" 'stomping out of the room' temper tantrum he had in episode 2 i think."

FlashTV,39qhen,DownbeatWings,3,Sat Jun 13 22:21:27 2015 UTC,He's not a mood teenager. He's an adult who's understandably still a little torn that his mom was murdered and his dad is doing life in prison.
FlashTV,39qhen,quontemplation,-10,Sat Jun 13 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"It's been more than a decade since those events happened, you'd think he had time to process it. But when I call him a moody teenager it's more about the discrepancy between the strong analytical mindset he uses in his job. And the refusal to listen to anyone and rush headlong into trouble just to learn a life lesson in his off hours. It's like once he's no longer on the clock he just goes into emo kid mode."

FlashTV,39qhen,Keegman_99,2,Sat Jun 13 20:38:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, no, he doesn't grow up that much. There was a thread earlier this week about Barry's weaknesses, and OP pointed out emotional vunerability as the main one. He still struggles with being reckless and making bad decisions right up to finale (and arguably during the finale as well).  There continue to be a few scenes where he can be considered ""teenage/child-ish"", but he also gets great scenes with both of his fathers and even Eddie  . He also shows genuine caring for others as a vigilante, rather than being some glory-seeking ""hero"" out for himself.  It's a genuine complaint, but one that's kind of expected with a network that caters to teen romance. I think most of this sub hopes/expects him to mature as future seasons progress. Remember, he and his teammates are still in their early twenties."
FlashTV,39qhen,DarthTauri,2,Sun Jun 14 07:41:29 2015 UTC,"I know your feeling, I felt the same but then I gave this show a real chance, And after like 6-8 episodes I really started to enjoy it.

I think episode 9, ""The Man in the Yellow Suit"" was the episode where I thought, ""I need to stay with this show."""
FlashTV,39qhen,Macc14,3,Sun Jun 14 02:27:31 2015 UTC,"I remember reading an article some time ago, it was related to writing origin stories.   The basic idea is that origin stories are so hard to do properly due to the amount of exposition that needs to happen.  The everyday joe, who knows nothing of the character, needs the building blocks while the fans don't and it makes it real hard to make work for everyone at once.  If I could remember where it was I'd link it, but after reading that I've found if I go into a first season or initial movie with the expectation that it's going to be a bit funky to start then I end up enjoying it more and I'm able to stomach some of the ""lesser"" moments."

FlashTV,39j00b,PurplePint,19,Fri Jun 12 08:42:50 2015 UTC,"The first few episodes, the cowl was more rigid and had to be taped/glued to Gustin's face. The one crafted for the remainder of the season was more flexible and doesn't require any adhesives. It's not a helmet and never has been.   I actually like the oxblood/crimson rather than a straight red, it makes more sense filming-wise rather than having him stick out like a sore thumb and require more lighting/shot setup for color. I agree with adding the white logo, as it's supposed to have been alluding to the night lightning crossing the moon. Someone here recently did a mockup of new suit/new logo, new suit/trad logo, trad suit/new logo, trad suit/trad logo which really showed how cool it could look.  I think they could do a bit of work on the gloves and boots, thin 'em down a bit. One of the problems I think they Costumers have is Gustin's naturally lean frame. Shipp was much more filled out, and while Flash is normally depicted as having a ""runner's build"" (less bulk than Bats or Supes), he's not usually drawn as much on the skinny side. (I remember reading/hearing in an interview that the show asked him to gain weight between Arrow 208/209 and Flash 101, and he gained 15lbs)   The other thing is the challenge to realism. The 90s Flash was set in an much more 'comic book' world which was a cross between the future-mod 90s and Art Deco 30s.  Starling and Central City are both depicted as 'our world'-style, so having Barry's suit be a mod'ed version of Cisco's responder design makes sense. Straying too far from it isn't likely."
FlashTV,39j00b,Krakyn,32,Fri Jun 12 03:59:50 2015 UTC,"I've said this before earlier in the season, and got downvoted, but Gustin really does need to bulk up a decent amount if he wants to truly do the Flash some justice.  Sure, Flash has never been, and never will be as bulky as Batman, but he always had an elite sprinters physique.  Look at Usain Bolt for reference."
FlashTV,39j00b,AREYOUSauRuS,16,Fri Jun 12 07:48:21 2015 UTC,"Gustin really does need to bulk up a decent amount if he wants to truly do the Flash some justice.   I disagree.  Barry has never been show as buff or bulky.  Barry is lean, slender.    Wally is often drawn bulky... but that's cause Wally's a career superhero who grew up alongside Dick Grayson and Roy Harper, non-powered teens fighting crime, the type that would spend their off time at the gym."
FlashTV,39j00b,neoblackdragon,6,Fri Jun 12 11:57:21 2015 UTC,"Barry isn't exactly drawn like a skinny fellow. One issue I guess is because of when he was drawn, the detail wasn't as great until rebirth. But he is the size of Eddie Thawne. Barry had to bulk up due to his superhero activities(again he wasn't skinny prior anyway) so it's not out of the realm he would get bigger."
FlashTV,39j00b,TheRealDJ,7,Sat Jun 13 00:21:53 2015 UTC,I'd say he should have a swimmer's physique. Sprinter's physique might be a bit too bulky.
FlashTV,39j00b,Freddulz,10,Fri Jun 12 10:21:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on your definition of sprinter/sprint distances and what event you see as ideal for Barry.  Current WR holders for the sprint events include Usain Bolt (100/200), Michael Johnson (400, formerly 200), and David Rudisha (800). The general trend in body type is that longer distances require less bulk (Usain being an exception due to his length; if he were five inches shorter, he would be much more condensed like Yohan Blake).   I would personnally like to see Gustin move somewhere between the Rudisha and Johnson body type as I've always imagined Barry and Wally as sprinters that would double the 400m and 800m. Yes, the Flash is the fastest man alive, but he also covers a good deal of distance too."
FlashTV,39j00b,Krakyn,4,Fri Jun 12 14:23:57 2015 UTC,"Quality post, thanks for illustrating what I was trying to say.  Also, wow, I didn't know Blake was that big. He is a bit shorter than Bolt though, so that's probably why."
FlashTV,39j00b,TheRealDJ,2,Fri Jun 12 15:27:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah and its the bulk I was kinda thinking of avoiding. For comparison sake and swimmer physiques Michael Phelps and James Magnussen  (By the way, you're welcome women fans of this thread!)"

FlashTV,39j00b,danerber,2,Fri Jun 12 11:48:16 2015 UTC,I heard in an interview with Gustin that he initially planned to bulk up but the producers wanted him to remain slim.
FlashTV,39j00b,Tsorovar,2,Fri Jun 12 14:12:12 2015 UTC,"Super-healing should make it really, insanely difficult to gain muscle mass. The super-fast metabolism wouldn't help either. And, since his speed comes directly from the speedforce, you'd have to wonder how much bulking up would actually help him anyway."
FlashTV,39j00b,Krakyn,2,Sat Jun 13 10:05:54 2015 UTC,"True.  However, you'd think moving muscles at insanely fast speeds, plus the sheer volume of conditioning Barry's body would receive (specifically his legs), would result in some significant increase in muscle mass.  This would outweigh the healing factor."
FlashTV,39j00b,Tsorovar,2,Sat Jun 13 13:16:03 2015 UTC,"Well, the way I see it: You gain muscle by doing exercise to damage your muscles, and, because they don't like being damaged, they heal stronger. For normal people, lifting a weight once (or taking one step) does nothing - you have to accumulate an amount of damage by doing a number of repetitions of the exercise. But even this accumulated damage is an absolutely miniscule amount in terms of your whole body. The problem with super-healing is that it heals miniscule amounts of damage insanely fast.... so insanely fast that you'd never be able to accumulate damage from more than a couple of repetitions before you're back to fully healed.  Wolverine, certainly, should be absolutely incapable of muscle gain. He has really fast healing and moves at normal speed. Barry has superspeed as well, which means that maybe he'd be able to outpace the healing to accumulate damage. Maybe.  The other problem is that Barry got abs while he was in a coma (and his muscles ought to have been atrophying). And that Barry's feet aren't a giant mass of callouses. And that there's no scarring or anything when he gets wounded. These suggest to me that his body automatically heals to a 'default', rather than healing in a way to protect itself from continued damage (like by growing callouses or stronger muscles)."

FlashTV,39j00b,Sick_Boy_Paddy,4,Sat Jun 13 00:46:33 2015 UTC,I love the costume but the head looks egg shaped and it has bothered me a lot. I can't stop staring at the shape every time. It actually makes me take him less seriously. The rest of the costume and logos look great to me. Just that fucked egg shape man! You know what it reminds me of the old school football helmets. It just dawned on me. They looked stupid too. What ever keeps the flash safe though I guess..
FlashTV,39j00b,VEJJ2Freshness,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:15:11 2015 UTC,"The human head IS basically egg-shaped, though... Have you never taken an art class? It's one of the first things one learns about basic  portrait and figure drawing. Obviously, an actual human head isn't PERFECTLY egg-shaped, but if you lightly draw an egg shape on a paper, one can pretty accurately use that as a guide for actually drawing a head.  Granted, I know this is live-action and not drawn, I'm just saying, it isn't that weird for a person's head to be egg-like. Without hair, most of us look like egg heads, you just don't usually realize it, because unless you're bald, you probably don't see your own actual head shape often. And the cowl is supposed to fit his head more or less skin tight. So of course it's going to emphasize the egginess of Grant's head. I don't think you can blame poor costume design for the shape of the guy's head, is all I'm saying."

FlashTV,39j00b,thelongestshot,4,Sat Jun 20 04:12:27 2015 UTC,I don't know if we're going to get the white-background emblem.  They're changing the costume in the comic to have no white-background on the emblem.
FlashTV,39j00b,neoblackdragon,3,Fri Jun 12 11:58:25 2015 UTC,"I personally like the costume he had at the end of The Flashpoint Paradox, the one with the lightning all around the suit"
FlashTV,39j00b,Dagr303,3,Fri Jun 12 12:13:25 2015 UTC,I think we all you like a suit more like the comics. Not much debate there. I think everyone is on that same board.  Now personally I'd lose the mask and got for a Captain America age of Ultron cowl. It will provide the flexibility for the actors head. They would have much more control over the shape as well since the neck and cowl don't connect. Also Barry looks better when the mask is down and a separated mask would allow them to open it up but still close it off.   Personally i'd deviate her and give him a slight open neck version of Max Mercury's costume but still have the costume cover his neck. So something maybe more like Deadman but again slight and again the costume covers the neck.   Fix the damn belt. Lose that bulky thing and make it pop out and keep it simple. Adapt the new52 lightning bolt wrap around.  Armor that bad boy up in the shoulders and pecks but keep it slight. Do just enough to give him protection but not go hahaha fake muscles. Shoulder pads would really help because the actor sorta had a problem lifting his arms in the thing. Strong shoulders would pop out nicely for the running.   Yellow boots. The suit needs more yellow and now it should be more a costume then a convenient fire fighter suit.   Honestly they should take design cues from the atom suit. Structurally it has the changes the Flash suit can make. Hell they actually fixed parts of these issues in the reverse Flash costume as well with the shoulders.   Now I would like him to bulk up but really I need him to bulk up in the legs. I look at the suit and the legs are the weak link. They are so damn skinny. The man has no ass and thighs.   Look at the 90's Flash costume. Ass and thighs galore.   Lastly don't go Arrow season 3.
FlashTV,39j00b,CobaltMoon98,2,Sat Jun 13 00:34:53 2015 UTC,What episode is the suit you showed from? The original timeline one?

FlashTV,39j00b,Thejklay,8,Fri Jun 12 05:21:37 2015 UTC,"That picture isn't official and it's too clear to be a set picture. Besides, it's pretty obviously photoshopped. It's just a representation of what his may look like in the future. It's a mashup of his current suit and the Reverse Flash's, which makes sense considering RF's would be based off of Barry's future suit."

FlashTV,39gl2l,BallisticGE0RGE,2,Thu Jun 11 23:03:50 2015 UTC,Eh would be too much of GL imo. Just hal is more than enough to start with.

At this point Barry knew about metahumans and powers so to say to him ""things that you can't even fathom""... it has to be big. He wouldn't have had direct experience with superpowers, but definitely with something out of the ordinary and that could impress Barry. There are only two more years of flashbacks and we know Oliver still has to join the Bratva somehow, but one year is a complete mystery. I believe in Hal!"

If DC is still embargoing Ted Kord at this point, then he's going to be involved with some sort of movie property. We really don't know though if DC is still embargoing him. The casting of Rip Hunter which we already know might mean that Booster Gold (and thus Ted Kord/Blue Beetle) are back on the table again."

FlashTV,39gl2l,super_slayer,2,Thu Jun 11 16:12:27 2015 UTC,I think Hal is going to debut in Arrow if we see him this year. Flashback!Ollie was boarding a boat to Coast City at the end of this season and he still has to learn how to fly a plane; encountering Hal and bro-ing out while pretending he totally isn't that missing billionaire from two cities over seems like a logical direction to take that storyline and show how Oliver got one of the weirder skills he acquired while he was missing.

FlashTV,39gl2l,PurplePint,5,Fri Jun 12 09:42:17 2015 UTC,"jay garrick isnt really a cynical type of guy, and im pretty any green lantern isnt gonna be season long guy.   but didnt john clark do some stuff with the spectre before? and he shares the same initials as jim corrigan (although, thats a weak correlation). but with with eddie dead, joe's gonna need a new partner, so thats a pretty good way to introduce him."
FlashTV,39gl2l,oheyitsdan,3,Fri Jun 12 02:12:16 2015 UTC,"So assuming this is Jay Garrick, who would be a good casting for the role? I'd thought they would have Garrick show up in his 50s+, more of a 'father figure' to Barry than a simpler 'mentor' role, so I hadn't thought much about younger actors.   Good looking, 30s-40s with an edge, slightly cynical.....  Sam Witwer? Sean Maher? Aaron Paul?"
FlashTV,39gl2l,Misterbert,2,Thu Jun 11 19:01:18 2015 UTC,I would love to see Jay Harrington take on Jay Garrick
FlashTV,39gl2l,PurplePint,3,Fri Jun 12 08:46:57 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, didn't Sean Maher portray one of the Suicide Squad on Arrow? I think he drove off in a car on their first outing and his head went pop. I can't remember who he was supposed to be portraying though."

FlashTV,39gl2l,EtriganZ,3,Thu Jun 11 19:39:22 2015 UTC,"I think Team Berlanti is testing the waters where Hal is concerned, sneaking in references and seeing if they get in trouble, like they did with Ra's Al Ghul. If there's any chance they pull it off, it'll come from the possibility that DC is eyeing John Stewart for the movies.  But I doubt he'd be a full-season deal. If he shows up at all, it'd be more as many or slightly less episodes than Firestorm this year. Jay Garrick really feels like the answer, especially after the helmet."
FlashTV,39gl2l,DanScorp,2,Thu Jun 11 20:09:34 2015 UTC,Why do you say that? We're getting g a DCCU Barry.

FlashTV,39nrx3,ypatel94,6,Sat Jun 13 02:54:28 2015 UTC,"You just described the basic story arc for most non-procedural television. Movies are often the same way as well.   Meet hero  Meet Hero's new friends/mentor who have info  Hero discovers their power  Hero is told about/encounters their villain or challenge   Hero fails and/or watches his team fail   Regroup!!  Rah-rah you are the Hero, wow!!   Hero faces villain again  Triumph over adversity, often with loss of some kind  Swear to keep fighting/learning etc  Rah rah TEAM HERO GROUP SHOT!   Hit Netflix and pull up anything that's not clearly a sitcom or cop/medical show. Heroes, Smallville, Charmed, Hercules, Xena,  etc. You'll see your pattern repeated over and over."

FlashTV,39nrx3,sonofodin25,3,Sat Jun 13 02:51:00 2015 UTC,"The main difference is that The Flash had less typical CW romance and when they did it was bearable. The romance in Arrow Season 1 is what stops it from being ""great"""

FlashTV,39lbn4,danielr1341,20,Fri Jun 12 15:17:29 2015 UTC,Its time and space destroying itself because the world no longer makes sense.  No Rf> Nora alive> Flash> Rf > Nora death> Eddie Death> No RF  And it loops.  Massive paradox.
FlashTV,39lbn4,Wooden_hampster,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:21:49 2015 UTC,"So like, the flashes the point of the paradox?"
FlashTV,39lbn4,HappyBobunk,5,Sun Jun 14 03:49:07 2015 UTC,"It should alter the present, but it also caused a paradox, and this creates a black hole because time is collapsing.  Eddie killed himself to stop RF. If RF never existed, Eddie would have no reason to kill himself. Changing the past can't change anything in the present because otherwise these events would have never happened."
FlashTV,39lbn4,AREYOUSauRuS,8,Fri Jun 12 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, well i guess that sort of explains it.. If time and space is destroying itself then who am i to question it"
FlashTV,39lbn4,Hpfm2,5,Fri Jun 12 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"Think of it as if Time had a loop in it.  Eddie was integral to that loop and by killing himself the loop was broken, but it can't just reset(it's trying)...  if it resets, everything still leads back to that moment.   If Eddie dies, time resets, Eddie then has no reason to kill himself then he lives, Eobard is born, goes back in time, fights Flash, goes back farther kills Nora, Eddie then kills himself to stop Eobard....  time resets, Eddie then has no reason to kill himself then he lives, Eobard is born, goes back in time, fights Flash, goes back farther kills Nora, Eddie then kills himself to stop Eobard....  time resets, ....  Hence the blackhole.  It's trying to reset, but it always leads back to that moment."

When they went full time travel, I figured they would need a guy to explain everything so I figured he would end up being rip hunter in disguise or maybe a new character to explain the speed force and protect Barry from Eobard meddling in the time stream.  What occurred was extremely different. Some would say the reverse.  But it was awesome."
FlashTV,39hpus,Laconium,2,Fri Jun 12 04:26:32 2015 UTC,I thought  so to.  Like Wells was just using Barry to take out RF for his own sinister purpose.  I thought Wells was going to be Barry's Lex Luther a non powered Mastermind who would turn on Barry and set up the best made for tv non canon character since Harley Quinn
FlashTV,39hpus,TurnPunchKick,4,Sat Jun 13 02:56:15 2015 UTC,Yeah that was the accepted theory until we saw wells actually running at super speed (In episode 10? I think it was the one after the break?)

FlashTV,39hpus,BlackenBlueShit,29,Fri Jun 12 07:54:21 2015 UTC,I was convinced Wells used the tachyon device to travel back in time to beat up himself. But nah it was some speed trick.

FlashTV,39hpus,InfamousAmerican,6,Thu Jun 11 23:55:24 2015 UTC,I had a mad theory that the reverse flash went into hiding after killing barry's mom and waited gathering speed force until the night of the particle accelerator and sabotaged it by running the opposite way. Kinda though is was a Stein/Raymond type dealio where Well and Thawne get combined. Not insanely far off but still wrong.

The camera doesn't focus on him or draw any attention to him.  It's just him as an extra jotting down some notes.  It wont necessarily have to imply anything but it would be a great easter egg."
FlashTV,39h2ql,CharlieWins,4,Thu Jun 11 19:34:11 2015 UTC,"With Supergirl coming and the possibility of three-way crossovers, I'd say Superman being at least referenced is all but guaranteed.  The other two are probably less likely. For now."

FlashTV,39h2ql,Todrick,4,Sat Jun 13 08:51:05 2015 UTC,Well Greg Berlanti said that all things are possible if the show does well. Also FORSEEABLE FUTURE Arrow was originally not supposed to have and powers whatsoever now look at Flash.
FlashTV,39h2ql,_Wisely_,-3,Thu Jun 11 18:36:22 2015 UTC,Greg doesn't make this decision.

FlashTV,39h2ql,diamondDNF,-2,Thu Jun 11 18:49:39 2015 UTC,"Berlanti had this to say:   The network has said publicly at this point they’re going to keep her to themselves. I always approach the shows as a fan first, so I would love to see [a crossover]…I think in success, all things are possible. But there’s a lot that would have to happen before everybody might say yes to that.      From Day 1 CBS Chairwoman Nina Tassler has been pretty damn consistent:   ""Well, those two shows [The Flash and Arrow] are on a different network,"" Tassler said. ""So I think we'll keep Supergirl to ourselves for awhile.""       It's up to CBS but they haven't said ""The shows will never ever cross over ever ever ever. Ever""   Who would ever say that?  What if the Show tanks on CBS along with every other show on the network.... while Flash, Arrow and LoT are the #1,2 & 3 shows on television.  They'd have to Crossover to save the network and anyone who sounded like a child previously ""...ever ever ever. Ever"" would look foolish.  That's not how you do business. You never say never. Even if you mean never."
FlashTV,39h2ql,Todrick,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"that's what I mean, it would be dumb for CBS to strike down thoughts of a shared universe or crossover.

FlashTV,39h2ql,Todrick,13,Thu Jun 11 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"Not to be argumentative, but just for the sake of devil's advocate: isn't part of Batman's power the fact that in his early days, he was more legend/myth/horror story than truth? Maybe we have a Batman early in his career and he's not widespread and known."
FlashTV,39h2ql,spectrosoldier,9,Thu Jun 11 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"Not really, Batman already exists most likely. And Firestorm Arrow and Flash exist in the comics and they aren't devalued even with more heroes"
FlashTV,39h2ql,spectrosoldier,0,Thu Jun 11 17:58:11 2015 UTC,"well Batman could just be a low level vigilante at the moment, just how could Harley Quinn exist without a connection to Batman?"
FlashTV,39h2ql,united1020,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:01:19 2015 UTC,Joker is born because all that Joker needs is one bad day.  However without Batman to keep him entertained he stops trying to escape. Harleen meets him as normal and due to her obsession tries to get his attention by becoming Harley Quinn.  Waller picks her up for Suicide Squad but is deemed too unstable and isnt used much.
FlashTV,39h2ql,Todrick,2,Thu Jun 11 18:10:42 2015 UTC,that could be true but I think it's unfair to say that they don't exist just because of WB crap. As stated Smallville did the same thing. They didn't have Batman or Wonder Woman. Besides a few references but when the show ended they started a comic book with no limitations so they could use whoever they wanted.
FlashTV,39h2ql,Todrick,-1,Thu Jun 11 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"Several possibilities, just because Harley Quinn is connected to Batman in the lore doesn't mean she has to be in the show. It's the showrunners own thing.   But it doesn't matter because we won't be seeing her."
FlashTV,39h2ql,Colticus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:07:54 2015 UTC,I know it's just that even Marc Gugenheim said he wanted Batman so it's clear that they are referencing batman and he does exist in some form or another
FlashTV,39h2ql,Todrick,-1,Thu Jun 11 18:10:39 2015 UTC,They've never referenced Batman.  They are forbidden from doing so.  They can't even mention Gotham.
FlashTV,39h2ql,Colticus,2,Thu Jun 11 18:17:21 2015 UTC,"Wayne Tech is a reference to Batman  Harley Quinn is a reference to Batman  ""Ark Something"" is a reference to Arkham which is in Gotham"
FlashTV,39h2ql,united1020,5,Thu Jun 11 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"I think these are meant to just be fun nods, like a wink to the audience. Batman and Superman will never appear on the show, but the writers can have a little fun."
FlashTV,39h2ql,united1020,2,Thu Jun 11 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"yeah same. I don't think we'll ever see them on the show. But it's unfair to claim that they don't exist. It could be like what Smallville did, they exist but aren't doing what they'd usually be doing. Maybe Clark is still understanding his powers. Bruce could have just started out recently finished training with Ra's and needs equiptment. Diana is just being an Amazon... lol"
FlashTV,39h2ql,Todrick,2,Thu Jun 11 18:25:11 2015 UTC,"But like I said, it's their own show, yes the main ideas, characters, and some events are rooted in the comic world but it also doesn't mean that those ideas, characters, and events don't have to follow the source material to a tee. They could do different things with them.  Until they straight out establish that these characters exist, I'm going with that they don't."
FlashTV,39h2ql,CannibalIowa,-1,Thu Jun 11 18:34:19 2015 UTC,"OH... good point.  Ra's  Nope, Batman definitely does not exist. Bruce was the most talented pupil Ra's had... no way does he pass him up to offer Oliver the League."
FlashTV,39h2ql,Todrick,0,Thu Jun 11 18:38:07 2015 UTC,"Wayne Tech is a reference to the Wayne Family and a very subtle one that was simply fan service.  The company existed long before Bruce, and even if Bruce exists, doesn't require Bruce being a vigilante to continue operations."

Though Superman does seem pretty tight with the American government and is sometimes even portrayed as the president's personal super-soldier, like in The Dark Knight Returns, where the president basically straight-up asks him to kill Batman, and he agrees to.   ...though that isn't exactly proof either, considering in that story, there really is no league anymore, it seems they all went their separate ways at some point, and Superman's shift in loyalties seems to lie at the heart of that..."

FlashTV,39c7eq,TheTogfather,42,Thu Jun 11 18:03:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not enjoying the idea of another love interest for Barry simply because there are two glaringly obvious storylines that can come from it and probably won't:   Iris needs a friend. Yes, I believe they will give her time to grieve over Eddie, who she obviously loved very much if she were willing to discredit a future newspaper that said she and Barry were to end up together. She needs time to grieve and move on. However, she also needs a friend to have besides Barry. Barry has Iris as a friend and STAR Labs as his friends. Iris has Barry and STAR Labs where finding and fighting metahumans go hand in hand. So despite the fact that she will be part of Team Flash, she needs someone that will represent the 'other' part of her life like Iris was to Barry before she knew his secret. Making Wendy a love-interest for Cisco. Not only would this be Barry's fourth love interest (Iris, Felicity, Linda, then Wendy) but he has wayyyyy too much other stuff to worry about. Copying what a comment has already said: Barry watched a friend commit suicide, watched his mother die again, found out that someone from the future hates him and wants him dead, just entered the speed force (where he saw so many things from his past, present, and future within), and even after that there are probably still a hundred evil metahumans to stop, which is more than enough pressure (and interesting story plots) to put on him. Cisco, on the other hand, can have Wendy as his love interest as he deals with his slow turn into Vibe and the powers that come along with it. Cisco deserves some love his need to tell Wendy about his powers would probably play out in a great way.   I know, canonically in the comics that Patty Spivot (who Wendy is more than likely a codename for) is involved with Barry, but this way they can have the recognizable character and do the changes to her character that will keep new Flash fans interested."
FlashTV,39c7eq,Redemption11,4,Wed Jun 10 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed, these would be great things for the show. And imagine golden glider getting all jealous and becoming a Cisco stalker."
FlashTV,39c7eq,ItsThatAsianBoy,2,Thu Jun 11 13:36:38 2015 UTC,That would be a really good way to show off her ruthlessness and give her some characterization/development.

FlashTV,39c7eq,your_mind_aches,67,Wed Jun 10 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's a CW thing, but New 52 Flash comics did the exact same thing with Barry/Patty/Iris... apparently there is only one way to write romance now and it's through drama and love triangles."
FlashTV,39c7eq,Reverent,32,Wed Jun 10 20:59:23 2015 UTC,It is absolutely not a CW thing. It's an every thing.
FlashTV,39c7eq,thursdayaug22,4,Wed Jun 10 22:02:43 2015 UTC,"Love triangles are a literary tactic. It's a shitty literary tactic that does not age well with the times and is considered lazy writing. It's why Joss Whedon was originally loved so much, he took love triangles and said ""to hell with this shit, people can love who they want without unnecessary drama"".  However, love triangles are an accepted literary tactic. So you will continue to see it."
FlashTV,39c7eq,otusasio451,2,Thu Jun 11 10:26:11 2015 UTC,Really? Joss did that?  Because I certainly remember Buffy/Angel/Xander being a thing then Willow/Oz/Xander/Cordelia then over on Angel Fred/Gunn/Wesley and of course Buffy/Angel/Spike is pretty much Twilight level love triangle stuff going on there.
FlashTV,39c7eq,Airsay58259,6,Thu Jun 11 16:11:22 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, but the New 52 did that because it sucks, and it despises all pre-established relationships, along with the concept of marriage. Although, to be fair, I actually liked Patty. Then she broke up with Barry. Naturally. I hate the New 52 so much."
FlashTV,39c7eq,Yukichin,12,Wed Jun 10 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"I loved Patty. They are hinting at Barry and Iris though, even Patty saw it... It's a shame really because Patty was great for Barry. They keep pushing Barry towards Iris but other than the canon reason, I don't see why."

FlashTV,39c7eq,Karisma_not_Karma,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:33:13 2015 UTC,"Yup. Long story short, another Barry comes back from the future and replaces the current Barry (who's transported to a Speed Force-less place, I don't remember the details). He also starts killing villains rather than sparing them (in the future, Wally West was killed and future-Barry blames himself for not killing the person responsible). Anyway, hijinks ensue and normal Barry comes back, while future Barry...actually, I don't remember. But, either way, Patty gets kind of scarred by watching future Barry kill a guy, and breaks it off with present Barry as a result. That was the last issue of Flash I read, and I hadn't read several issues before that. I also liked the Manapul/Buccellato run quite a bit."

FlashTV,39c7eq,chill_imagining,18,Thu Jun 11 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"Olicity was fun when it was a ""will they/won't they thing""   I actually completely disagree with this - I think it was better when it was a ""she would/he wouldn't"" thing, like when she would just drool at him doing the salmon ladder, and he barely noticed her existence.  There was more to be made of that, while still exploring his complicated feelings for Laurel after getting Sarah fake killed and then, by extended proxy, real killed, while having an on-again, off-again relationship with both of them.   Felicity and Ray made a far better couple, and her ditching Ray because Oliver is just like totally so dreamy just made her seem like someone entirely lacking in character."

FlashTV,39c7eq,Janival,9,Wed Jun 10 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"Don't tell me they're casting Proxy... :(  For serious, though: I realize the CW's demographics and the respective ages of the characters in the Flarrowverse, but these love triangles/quadangles/squaring-the-fourth-again-tesseracting ridiculousness needs to calm down. Romance and sexual tension are not the only way to progress plot or develop characters. Barry just entered the Speedforce, watched his mom die, almost got killed by Thawells, watched a comrade commit suicide to save their group only to have that action open up a Langolier-minded paradox-eating singularity which he attempted to halt by entering it (and then being unceremoniously spit out) to unknown time/space.  I think he's got enough on his plate personally and plot-wise to fill quite a few episodes without involving a placeholder love interest."
FlashTV,39c7eq,SmileyFace_,3,Wed Jun 10 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree with you more.  Barry's most compelling stuff has come from non-romantic moments.  Drama and character development can exist outside of romance.  Honestly, if there is one thing I like more about SHIELD than Flash and Arrow, it is the lack of the same romantic nonsense.  Yeah, there has been some stuff, but it really hasn't been the focus for any of the characters."

FlashTV,39c7eq,cabose7,3,Thu Jun 11 04:04:16 2015 UTC,"Well if they actually cared to show iris working, it'd be a perfect opportunity. They work together, eddie is dead so a friendship would definitely be welcomed."

That said, ugh is she going to be like Linda and just be there for the sake of drama and get zero character development? Honestly they should just skip this romance drama and let Barry and Iris just do other things and then hook them up or just get someone who can write subtle romance.  Better yet just don't make Wendy into Felicity 2.0, besides Barry already kind of dated Felicity, didn't work out."

FlashTV,39c7eq,OLKv3,2,Wed Jun 10 23:05:45 2015 UTC,"I was going to say something like this. This season, Felicity actually acted like, well, Felicity when she was on The Flash. The old humor, the loveable dorkyness, etc. None of the whiney cringey character they turned her into on Arrow.  With luck, maybe, just maybe, they can make this new character work on Flash.

FlashTV,39c7eq,Greyhound272,3,Wed Jun 10 22:42:01 2015 UTC,"Meh, not a big fan of this but I'm going to remain optimistic for next season. I'd personally prefer they just leave Barry single for the moment and focus on him dealing with the fallout of the finale (Harrobard is presumably gone now, so who exactly is going to run and fund STAR Labs? Plus they might want to work out a slightly more legal detainment method for metahumans, and Barry is probably going to have his own mourning/grieving to do over Eddie and watching his mom die again.) and general superhero business. If they slow play the relationship and nothing really happens until the second half of the season then I think it could work pretty well, though I liked the suggestion someone made of her being a love interest for Cisco instead. Vibe needs love too damnit.   I'm actually kinda curious about Wendy's job though. Scientific-minded cop seems suspect to me for some reason. If she's a lab tech/forensic scientist like Barry then it would make sense, but if she ends up being a detective or something that can keep up with Team Flash and Felicity/Ray on the techno babble I think that's going to come off a bit too Mary Sue-ish."

Pairing him with Iris instantly is a bad idea so soon after the whole Eddie thing and with all the added drama we’ll probably see. I personally have no issue with relationships, just as long as they’re not completely hamfisted. Also it’s The Flash. I don’t think it’ll as angsty as relationship drama on Arrow."

He just watched his mom die (again, and knows he's going to have to see it a third time because fate/Speedforce is a cruel mistress), saw a friend kill himself to save everyone because Barry wasn't fast enough, then literally ran into a black hole. That's just the shit from the end of the finale too; a few days/weeks before that he fought a psychic gorilla (who is still on the loose), inadvertently set several dangerous metahumans free because he trusted Snart to not be a dick, and found out his mentor a longtime hero was a time traveling crazy person that killed Barry's mom. Barry throwing himself fully into heroing and getting faster to the point of having no social life for a while would make sense to me."

FlashTV,39cph1,cayal3,4,Thu Jun 11 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"I don't even think there would be an accretion disk.

FlashTV,39cph1,fapcola108,12,Thu Jun 11 05:05:47 2015 UTC,"I  imagine he/she would just retain the mind of Eobard. This is because when Eobard body-jacked Harrison, he took features that depended on the internal structures of Harrison, like voice and height.

FlashTV,39cph1,Nebula153,3,Thu Jun 11 22:11:33 2015 UTC,"The Flash Wikipedia page cites this ability as ""Quantum Tunneling"", a very complicated thing that I don't fully understand, but from what I can tell, it can only ever work with fundamental particles and never with macroscopic objects (like a hand). So I'm going to try to take it the direction that the show said. Essentially, when Harrison wells was explaining to Barry how to run through that truck, he said something along the lines of ""vibrate at the natural frequency of air and your cells and body will be in an excited state"". And that doesn't make sense at all. First of all, the phrase "" Excited state"" is usually applied to electrons and switching energy levels within an atom. Excited state is just that a thing has a higher energy level than its own ground state. Barry could drink too much coffee and be in an excited state, but that doesn't mean he'll go all Kitty Pryde after a Starbucks visit. Also, why would he need to vibrate at the frequency of air? Wouldn't it make more sense to vibrate at the frequency of the truck? Now we apply this to Eobards hand, and there really isnt a way that vibrating makes it possible to go through solid objects, at least not in the way that the show or comics explain."

FlashTV,398js3,khs16052,-18,Fri Jun 12 07:11:43 2015 UTC,At least Arrow isn't 95% filler with a plot that only moves forwards solely through after show scenes.

FlashTV,3967ue,Airsay58259,30,Tue Jun 9 17:21:10 2015 UTC,Nope. You see her doing some research and making herself a suit that keeps heat but she always needs living sources.
FlashTV,3967ue,Goaliedude3919,10,Tue Jun 9 17:30:48 2015 UTC,But what about the fact that she said a blast from Firestorm kept her warm for days? Firestorm's blast isn't a living source.

Only we don't produce a lot, Firestorm is so hot (look at their bodies' temperature), he produces a large amount of heat. They haven't talked about it in the show (but have in some interviews) but his real power is transmutation. That's how he makes fire and it's all coming from his body.

FlashTV,3967ue,Nut_Cancer,7,Tue Jun 9 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"So they've actually said that he's transmuting? I'm really hoping they show that sometime, that was always way more interesting than being a human torch clone."

FlashTV,3967ue,OK_Soda,10,Tue Jun 9 21:12:55 2015 UTC,"You should realize by now that comic books aren't meant to be analyzed too deeply.  they almost always have that type of plot hole. they choose to ignore logic for entertainment, which is fine because logic doesn't really agree with the basic concepts of super heroes anyway."
FlashTV,3967ue,Teive,7,Tue Jun 9 22:37:32 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with that. I don't know how the rest of this story goes, so I can't comment on it in its entirety, but this specific part right here is just sort of bad/lazy writing. There's no reason for the writer to not think about it for a few seconds and make it so a cat or whatever lasts longer and by extension, a human would give her even more time, because otherwise there's just no reasonable way she'd stay alive. It's an easy plot hole to fix. I hear the excuse a lot that ""logic doesn't really agree with the basic concepts of super heroes [or zombies/aliens/magic/etc] anyway"", but a story should be able to hold together at least well enough to keep suspension of disbelief from breaking. I'll easily accept the ridiculous premise of a girl who's made of ice and has to leech heat from living beings to stay alive, as long as it's internally consistent with itself."
FlashTV,3967ue,OK_Soda,3,Tue Jun 9 23:00:14 2015 UTC,"Who says it scales in a linear fashion?  Cats may give minutes, but then it goes up on a log or quadratic scale based on size [like how doubling size increases weight by 8].  Or maybe sentient beings have more 'life warmth'?  We don't have any indication that Firestorm heat blasts are more heat efficient than people, just that they involve less killing."
FlashTV,3967ue,Teive,3,Wed Jun 10 00:18:45 2015 UTC,"You might be right, but the way she talks about it, it makes it sound like Firestorm making her good for days is uncommon."
FlashTV,3967ue,bbpgrs,2,Wed Jun 10 00:21:06 2015 UTC,"Uncommon when compared to a cat.  But she wants to avoid taking life, especially human life.  'Days' is a long time to go without murdering an animal to a lot of people."
FlashTV,3967ue,Reverent,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:25:16 2015 UTC,"Right but there's no way she could survive on stray animals. That cat gave her a few minutes. Think about it in terms of food. If you had to eat a cat every few minutes, you could not possibly survive like that. Even if ""a few minutes"" is something like 15 minutes, and even if a human gives her 100 times as much energy, that still only means a human would give her about a day. So she's either killing someone every day to stay alive or just desperately spending every waking minute killing a hundred cat-sized animals. It's just sort of implausible."
FlashTV,3967ue,Airsay58259,3,Wed Jun 10 00:30:05 2015 UTC,What?  No.  She's fighting Firestorm every few days.  Then Firestorm disappeared.  Now she has to face the issue of starvation.  That's what the story is about
FlashTV,3967ue,OK_Soda,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:39:21 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, basically a story should be compelling enough that if you remove the sci-fi or fantasy element it should remain somewhat interesting.  I would agree if it were a novel/TV show/ movie. But I just don't consider comics to on the same level. I consider comics to novels like cartoons are to TV shows.  You wouldn't argue with the logic or plot of Tom and jerry or that imaginary friends cartoon like you would with the logic or Flash or Arrow, GoT, or any of the numerous sci-fi and fantasy shows and movies out there.  same goes for comics IMO, if you want a well thought out plot read a good novel.  EDIT: I'm not saying comics are for children only, I'm saying they're not written like novels where the focus is on the plot. They are written mainly for entertainment/excitement."
FlashTV,3967ue,SlightlyProficient,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:13:09 2015 UTC,"It's not about logic, it's about consistency. If the writers are allowed to change the rules whenever they please, the material loses all depth. Like the flash only being as fast as the plot allows him to be. It doesn't break the show, but it sure makes it worse."
FlashTV,3967ue,kaces,4,Tue Jun 9 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"She doesn't die if she doesn't feed. Heat makes her feel human again and this is her goal. When Firestorm hits her, you see her get her regular form again (skin, hair...). When she doesn't feed, she's in a constant state of hypothermia, almost dead but alive and always hungry hence her absolute need to steal heat even though she hates it."
FlashTV,3967ue,BigBassBone,5,Wed Jun 10 03:10:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, thank you for clarifying that. That makes a lot more sense. I thought she just straight up died."

FlashTV,3967ue,Svoboda1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:49:21 2015 UTC,Maybe she is referencing each blast being able to sustain her for days and not each fight. That would mean she could potentially just fight FS every couple of weeks and only have to kill enough people to attract his attention.

The first time I saw the red blur pass through as he is falling onto the shelves, that was the reference I thought of immediately.  The ""pre-lightning"" comment is an interesting thought, as prior to lightning strikes we know there are increases in static/ambient electricity (and more)...but that would mean we're associating the behavior of liquid with the use of speedforce specific changes in time, not time travel itself.  Whether or not they ever come back to the post-lightning red, it was a great idea to have it there from the beginning."
FlashTV,39ak6i,PurplePint,6,Wed Jun 10 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"I expect this to be the final scene of the final episode of the series.  Having read the comics, to me, There's no other reasonable explanation."

He knows immediately after meeting Wells that something isn't right about him, even after Wells plays the family card on Ollie by praising his dad, and that's something, considering family is a subject known classically to blind him to stuff that everyone else finds obvious. You'd almost expect him to walk away going ""I like that guy"", but they made a point to show us how disturbed Oliver actually was after meeting him.  I feel like Oliver telling Barry the lightning chose him will end up being equally prophetic, even if not exactly that way."

FlashTV,39ak6i,Gioezc,3,Thu Jun 11 01:17:56 2015 UTC,"unless the accelerator explosion somehow charged Barry's surroundings with the speed force pre-lightning?   Comics folks can correct me if I'm wrong, but if I've heard correctly, when Barry died in the comics, he became the bolt of lightning and struck young Barry. If that's the case in the show's universe, then the rise in liquids could be attributed to the copious amounts speedforce radiating off of adult lightning Barry."

FlashTV,39ak6i,ChocoboTorchicKid,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:34:40 2015 UTC,It's possible Harrison Wells had placed some kind of speed force device in Barry's apartment to attract the lightning and ensure Barry became the flash.

So Eobard using future tech caused a disturbance in physics back in Starling. The Lightning bolt hit and area effected by the particle accelerator.   It's not meant to be bigger then that.

FlashTV,39cczz,_RoyalFlush,2,Wed Jun 10 21:32:09 2015 UTC,"If they handle it correctly this could be exactly what the show needs to help develop Barry and Iris a little more before getting tossed together (because while Arrow not ending with Oliver and Laurel together seems plausible and even likely, I'm pretty sure Barry and Iris is going to happen one way or another) and might also help cover the whole legality issue of metahuman dealings, i.e. Wendy comes in as part of some metahuman task force which will in turn get a more not highly illegal prison set up. Plus if she actually is Felicity 2.0 then we essentially get Flash Felicity (read: not super mopey cry-voice Felicity) on a consistent basis, which I could definitely get behind.   However, if handled poorly, we're basically looking at some weird amalgamation of Laurel's season 2 breakdown (which, weirdly, I'm looking forward to for Iris; probably because it means her character won't revolve around Barry/the Flash and I actually loved Laurel's arc in Arrow's second season) and season 3's Oliver/Felicity/Ray love triangle of pointlessness and mega angst, except this one would have Papa Joe hardcore shipping WestAllen.

(iirc, it's explained that the writer of the Flash comics Barry read was inspired by dreams he had about Garrick.)  Jay Garrick is one of the most interesting characters, considering his meta-human status (retconned) and speed sans Speedforce. I really really really hope they include him in S2 somehow.

FlashTV,396tc7,LilGyasi,4,Tue Jun 9 18:41:27 2015 UTC,"I think Robbie Amell will stay on The Flash and upgrade to a regular. That might be what the ""it will be answered soon"" is about."
FlashTV,396tc7,_RoyalFlush,2,Wed Jun 10 02:29:48 2015 UTC,"I have no clue about what they are going. In one hand, Kreisberg said something about Caitlin's arc being like Willow's at the end of Buffy which sounds bad for Ronnie, but in the other hand I'd find it kinda lame not to have a Killer Frost VS Firestorm as Ronnie arc. Maybe not lame because I trust these writers but there's so much potential with them. About Robbie Amell... Well in only one year he got 3 big movies, would he really sign as a regular on Flash as a sidekick (Firestorm is so expensive too, he'd be what? 2nd engineer in the team?) or on LOT with so many other leads? I hope they won't kill him off and find a legitimate reason for him to just be a guest star... Ronnie said he stays in Central City now but I don't know, Eiling could come back."

Since Eobard caused the -20 to divert into the -15 Timeline, he is the direct cause of all actions Barry takes in the -15 Timeline instead of the -20 Timeline.   Original -20 Timeline = No Flash in 2015. No Flash in 2015, no Tsunami-Timeline offshoot."

I'd like to see them do it kind of like the show where even though  Barry hasn't met him yet, Eobard already knows everything about him."

FlashTV,393gqi,jerekdeter626,3,Tue Jun 9 12:08:13 2015 UTC,DC switched offices and stopped publication of regular titles for a while. They posted a few previews for the titles coming back this month. One of those was The Flash.
FlashTV,393gqi,Hpfm2,5,Tue Jun 9 12:14:41 2015 UTC,New thawne does know Pre new 52
FlashTV,393gqi,_JustToComment,9,Tue Jun 9 03:58:36 2015 UTC,What are you basing that on?
FlashTV,393gqi,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,10,Tue Jun 9 03:59:31 2015 UTC,The preview. The fact that thawne knows Barry. The fact that future Barry told our Barry to remember thawne before he died. Etc. It's not explicitly said but it's not hard to read between the lines
FlashTV,393gqi,_JustToComment,9,Tue Jun 9 04:02:38 2015 UTC,"That doesn't mean he's pre-Flashpoint knowledgeable. That could very easily have to do with solving Nora's murder, not multiversal shenanigans.  Much like we could only confirm Psycho Pirate, Spectre, the Quintessence, and a few selected others remembered Pre-Crisis earths once they said so on screen, we can't confirm that Eobard knows pre-Flashpoint by reading between the lines."
FlashTV,393gqi,dmull387,3,Tue Jun 9 04:07:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think we will get a confirmation, at least not with this writing team. They stated that they plan not to address it, so it's headcanon time and I like /u/_justtocomment theory."
FlashTV,393gqi,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Tue Jun 9 04:26:48 2015 UTC,Well maybe that's what the writers meant by leaving it ambiguous but it's always possible New52 Thawne has just time traveled in this universe. But I like your interpretation better because I want this Thawne to be the same Thawne that's been around since '63. It would make me feel a lot better about Flash's history being wiped with the New 52.
FlashTV,393gqi,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Tue Jun 9 04:20:20 2015 UTC,The Flash(vol 3) #8
FlashTV,393gqi,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Tue Jun 9 13:18:08 2015 UTC,"What I loved is that the way the story unfolds early, it's not taking the present Eobard and telling you as an adult he went back and fixed his things. They portray it as though the child version of Eobard is agitated to the point that his future self actually rewrites history as his younger self reacts in anger to his brother/family/Flash Museum, etc"

FlashTV,393gqi,NovaStarLord,25,Tue Jun 9 05:52:28 2015 UTC,Well it was because their parents made Eobard take care of his brother while growing up which caused Eobard to be behind in his studies which caused him not to be accepted to the Flash museum.  His brother popping in and arresting him was the final straw.  At some point he also caused the death of his parents because they were a distraction and kept getting in the way of his plans.

FlashTV,396xgw,thenottoserious,27,Tue Jun 9 18:18:01 2015 UTC,His lack of fighting ability. I mean he literally has no form whatsoever. Grodd does judo on his super sonic punch because Barry threw a punch like an idiot rather than shoulder checking him.  He gets his ass kicked by the same amount of multiplex dudes as the one guard did..... Etc...
FlashTV,396xgw,MartianMallCop,16,Tue Jun 9 19:23:39 2015 UTC,"aww, c'mon, the supersonic shoulder check doesn't sound as.... wait, yes it does....  I think Barry's fighting is inconsistent. When he was Rainbow Raider raging he was landing pretty good hits on the Arrow. Eobard was shown as able to fight hand to hand with Oliver, and Barry has been able to trade blows a bit. I want to say he had a decent fight with Hannibal Bates, but I don't remember."
FlashTV,396xgw,quontemplation,13,Tue Jun 9 20:58:31 2015 UTC,"He was getting whipped by Hannibal when the baddie was morphed into Catlyn and Iris.  Once he morphed into Eddie though, Barry unleashed the beast."
FlashTV,396xgw,Future_Vantas,9,Tue Jun 9 21:15:42 2015 UTC,"this leads to another point, barry is too obsessed with iris that he can't help but to have ill feelings toward eddie, yet eddie did nothing wrong to barry, and it was iris's choice to date eddie."
FlashTV,396xgw,Future_Vantas,8,Tue Jun 9 22:26:14 2015 UTC,He manage to swallow his pride long enough to bring Eddie into the loop.  These rewatches really highlight just how much Barry's grown over the season.
FlashTV,396xgw,RapeyTheSpermWhale,8,Wed Jun 10 02:03:41 2015 UTC,"I think barry tries to accept eddie, but he just couldn't. When it comes to eddie, it's instantly about iris to him. That is why he still allowed himself to be jealous even when eddie was kidnapped and iris was worried about the guy. He loves iris a bit too much, and because of that, he can't make rational desicions about eddie. I think deep down inside,barry knows eddie is a good person, but iris is too much of a ""distraction"" for him to appreciate eddie as a friend and ally."
FlashTV,396xgw,Keegman_99,3,Wed Jun 10 03:08:09 2015 UTC,Holy shit. You're right. Why the hell didn't he shoulder check him?! That would have been cool.
FlashTV,396xgw,PhilyDaCheese,10,Wed Jun 10 15:11:09 2015 UTC,"I think his biggest character flaw is that--and I quote Joe on this--his ""real power isn't superspeed. It's seeing the good in people.""  But seriously, I agree with you, I just think that's a part of him growing as a superhero. He's going to have some emotional issues when he first starts off."

The omnibus features Flash Comics #104 (the last issue of Jay's series), Showcase #4,8,13,14, and The Flash #105-132.   If you're wondering what happened to #1-104 of Barry's run, it doesn't exist. The editors decided to resume the numbering from Jay's series because, at the time, a bigger number was perceived by readers to mean that the book was strong and worth picking up."
FlashTV,3962j6,dmull387,2,Tue Jun 9 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"My name is /u/dmull387, and I'm the Fastest Redditor Alive.   This is the Flash recommendations post.  The good news about Flash is that the entirety of Wally West's Flash (v2) is on the website Comixology. So even if you can't find a trade, you can track down the individual issues.   Born to Run by Mark Waid Framed as a visit with his grandfather, Wally's origin is retold (in a much less creepy manner than Flash 110, if I may say so) Post-Crisis style.  Flash by Bill Messner-Loebs, v2 #30-44: Welcome to Keystone City, Wally West -- Hope you survive the experience! After surviving an attack during a movie date in NYC, Wally decides to move out west and live the simple life in Keystone. Some residents have other plans for him, though, from old foes to a sinister self-help group. Throw in feisty reporter Linda Park, and Wally will have his hands full!  The Return of Barry Allen. I've already said more than enough about this on reddit. I gave it a thorough review here.  Terminal Velocity If Mark Waid had ended his Flash run at Terminal Velocity, that would have been okay. It's definitely the culmination of everything that had happened to that point, and Flash 0, the prelude, is worth the price of admission alone.  Dead Heat & Race Against Time! Meet Savitar, master of the Speed Force! His plans go into motion and catapult Wally through time and space. Will Wally make it back from the future? Find out in these two Mark Waid classics!  Emergency Stop & The Human Race by Grant Morrison/Mark Millar a tribute to Silver Age style stories while still being firmly rooted in the then present, written to keep Waid from burning out.  Chain Lightning Calling all Flashes! The greatest relay race of all time begins as Wally leads the charge against an enemy Barry Allen made the day he was born!   Dark Flash Saga When Wally skirts the edge of the Speed Force too closely, a new Flash appears in his stead. Who is the Dark Flash, and what is his connection to Linda? Find out in the thrilling conclusion to Mark Waid's run!  Crossfire & Blitz by Geoff Johns While Mark Waid focused on rebuilding Wally, the man, Geoff Johns focused on rebuilding the Rogues, to a great effect. ""Zoom is dead."" ""NOTANYMORE.""  Rogue War Captain, my good Captain, it's my Rogues against yours! The new Rogues Geoff Johns introduced, led by The Top, face off against the old school Rogues, led by Captain Cold! The stakes only get higher as not one, but two threats from Wally's past join the fray as Geoff Johns's original Flash run concludes!  Dastardly Death of the Rogues Meet the Renegades! With the 25th Century's Flash a villain, you'd better believe the 25th Century Rogues are heroes! When one of their own is murdered, all evidence points to... Barry Allen? Solve the mystery of the murdered Mirror Monarch in this exciting volume from long time Flash scribe Geoff Johns!  Flash by Francis Manapul & Brian Buccellato the first four trades of the New 52 are solid.   If you're new to the Flash, skip Flash: Rebirth until you're fully familiar with the mythos. It isn't as much of an introduction to Flash as it is a fix fic for (almost) every hero who'd died or had their speed powers messed with.   Here's some single issue recs if you're not ready for full arcs:   Flash v2 0 Wally's origin post Zero Hour. A joy to read.  Flash v2 44 Bill Messner-Loebs does a great Wally, and this is Wally at his best for Loebs: still a bit of a jerk, but a hero through and through.  Flash v2 114, Race Against Time Chapter 2 Tornado Twins. 'Nuff said.  Flash v2 133, Through the Looking Glass Okay, I admit it, I'm just a sucker for McCulloch's version of Mirror Master.  Flash v2 181, Fallout This story shows Wally as the hero he is. It's not just about the punching and the kicking, but the making things right for Neil Borman.  JLA 107, Maintenance Day Flash vs. The Construct. One of the big things about The Flash is what a team player he is, so a team book would be nice. Cut out the Crime Syndicate portions and you're left with a great Wally/J'Onn story.   Flash: FMA #9 This is the closest to a stand alone issue we have for Bart Allen as Flash. It's framed via a phone call between Bart and his friend Tim Drake, aka Robin, with a nice little touch during the Steppenwolf fight about how Flashes are willing to sacrifice themselves for what's right.  Flash v3 #6, Dastardly Death of the Rogues conclusion a fun time travel story that's very Barry-centric.   Earth 2 #2 For New 52, Jay Garrick's first issue as the Flash.  Flash v4 17, Gorilla Warfare conclusion"
FlashTV,3962j6,dmull387,2,Tue Jun 9 20:22:44 2015 UTC,"My name is /u/dmull387, and I'm the Fastest Redditor Alive.   But this is not the Flash recommendations post. Some might say... it's the Reverse.  Three men have called themselves the Reverse Flash, each with varying motivations for taking on their hated rival. While Eobard debuted in the Silver Age, my expertise is modern Flash, so that's where you'll see most of the recommendations come from.   The professor is here. So let the teaching begin.   The Return of Barry Allen. With Barry Allen back from the dead, you know his worst enemy can't be far behind. It's up to two generations of Flash to team up and take him down.  Blitz by Geoff Johns ""Zoom is dead."" ""NOTANYMORE."" When a new threat emerges from outside time, it's time for Wally West to face his greatest fears and take on the new Zoom.  Rogue War Captain, my good Captain, it's my Rogues against yours! The new Rogues Geoff Johns introduced, led by The Top, face off against the old school Rogues, led by Captain Cold! The stakes only get higher as Reverse Flash puts his own plans into motion as Geoff Johns's original Flash run concludes!  Final Crisis: Rogues Revenge Bart Allen's murderer, Inertia, is freed from his prison, and the Rogues, who were manipulated as accomplices to his plans, are out for some good ol' fashioned revenge. But they'd better get to him before Zoom does...  Flash: Rebirth I haven't exactly been the kindest to this book in other threads, because it doesn't cover the Flashes themselves well, but Eobard is in top form in this book.  The Road to Flashpoint Who killed the Elongated Kid? More importantly, why does this 12 year old look like he's in his 90s? Time for the Flash to get some answers, one way or another.  Flash: Reverse by Francis Manapul & Brian Buccellato Someone is murdering those touched by the Speed Force, and it's up to Barry Allen to find out who.   BONUS: There are two other ""anti-Flashes,"" so to speak, known as The Rival and Inertia, opposing Jay Garrick and Bart Allen, the first and fourth Flash. The Rival appears in Flash v1 104 and at least one JSA story, if I'm not mistaken, while Inertia appears (in trade form, at least) in Flash: Mercury Falling, Flash: Fastest Man Alive: Full Throttle (which admittedly kind of sucks), and Rogues Revenge."

The Flash?  Underworld Unleashed and Hell to Pay The demon Neron has given some hard on their luck criminals a deal: their hearts desire, for a little piece of themselves, so small they won't even notice: their souls. It's up to James Jesse, the original Trickster, to find out Neron's true plans and put a stop to them before Neron unleashes hell on Earth! Then, Neron unleashes the soulless bodies of those Rogues he has claimed in order to wreak havoc across Keystone City, and it's up to The Flash to stop them.  Emergency Stop Legend spoke of a power suit created by the tailor to the Rogues, Paul Gambi. The legends are real, and it's up to The Flash to stop it.  Bonus: what do you do when you want some more of that cally dosh? When you're Evan McCulloch, Mirror Master, you'll risk kidnapping Flash's bonnie lass, Linda Park!  Wonderland It's not enough that Wally West woke up in a world where he can't access the Speed Force, but the only two people who remember he's the Flash are Captain Cold and Mirror Master. What is the secret of Wonderland, and what does it have to do with an old friend of Wally West?   Blood Will Run someone's been murdering every person Flash ever saved, and it's up to Wally and his new partners Jared Morillo and Fred Chyre to track this psycho down.   Bonus: Captain Cold and Flash team up to stop Tar Pit from ruining a hockey game! (No, seriously, that's what happens.) Then, Chyre's old partner left a baby behind, and he's shooting lightning from his eyes... Finally, when a serial killer Barry Allen took down unleashes a flesh-eating virus on Iron Heights Penitentiary, to stop the virus, Wally must team up with the only man to ever escape the walls of Iron Heights: The Pied Piper.  Rogues New Rogues are popping up every second, but can Wally keep up before the new Rogues shut him down? And when Captain Cold tracks down his sister's killer, Chillbaine will learn the true meaning of cold.  Crossfire Rogues to east, Thinker to the west, and Wally's stuck right in the middle.

When an old secret about Roscoe Dillon (a.k.a. The Top) resurfaces, it's up to Wally and Zatanna Zatara to set things right.

Final Crisis: Rogues Revenge When Bart Allen was the Flash, the Rogues $%&@ed up. Big time. They broke the number one rule, never kill a speedster, when they listened to Bart's rival, Inertia. Now Inertia is free from his prison, and the Rogues are out for some good ol' fashioned revenge. But they'd better get to him before Zoom does...  Dastardly Death of the Rogues Meet the Renegades! With the 25th Century's Flash a villain, you'd better believe the 25th Century Rogues are heroes! When one of their own is murdered, all evidence points to... Barry Allen? Solve the mystery of the murdered Mirror Monarch in this exciting volume from long time Flash scribe Geoff Johns!  Rogues Revolution The Rogues have always had a knack for weaponry, not metahuman powers, but that's all about to change as they confront the Flash for the first time in the New 52!  Rogues Rebellion The Rogues play by their own rules, no one else's, so when they tell the invaders from Earth-3 that they're not interested in playing by Syndicate rules, the Rogues go on the run to avoid a mob of angry supervillains on their tail.   Not enough Cold for ya? As leader, he gets his own list."

After serving his country in Task Force X (aka Suicide Squad), Captain Cold is pardoned for his previous crimes, and the Rogues throw a party in his honor in Flash v2 19. So why is the guest of the evening... Wally West?  Cold would sometimes play hero after Flash 19, teaming up with his sister Golden Glider as part of Golden Snowball bounty hunters, especially during the Porcupine Man Saga (26-28), and Wally's fight against The Turtle. (35/36) That all ended with...  Underworld Unleashed and Hell to Pay (Underworld Unleashed 1-3, Flash v2 127-129) The demon Neron has given Cold and four other Rogues a deal: their hearts' desire, for a little piece of themselves, so small they won't even notice: their souls.

New 52   Flash v4 #6-7 Captain Cold has upped his game. He can finally keep The Flash at arm's length. But how? Part of the Move Forward collection.  Rogues Revolution Once again a Rogue among Rogues, it's up to Captain Cold and The Flash to take out Glider's Rogues in the first big Rogues blowout of the New 52!  Forever Evil separated from the rest of the Rogues and stripped of his metahuman powers, Cold has to team up with the Injustice League to stop the Crime Syndicate from engulfing the earth in permanent darkness. Upon the conclusion of Forever Evil, Cold joins Justice League.   So that's four different characters/groups to sink your teeth into.

Not sure when it was, though, just saw it cited once in an Aquaman thread."
FlashTV,3910my,latticusnon,6,Mon Jun 8 21:02:11 2015 UTC,"Aquaman's only an 80-tonner, if I remember correctly. Superman is much stronger."
FlashTV,3910my,TheExtremistModerate,3,Mon Jun 8 23:03:35 2015 UTC,"I think that was true in Smallville, but even there Aquaman was just faster than Clark in the water, not stronger."
FlashTV,3910my,FollowThePact,3,Mon Jun 8 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"Nope. Aquaman can lift a cruise liner. Superman can lift the planet (or bench press its equivalent weight, if you want to nitpick)."
FlashTV,3910my,TheExtremistModerate,4,Mon Jun 8 23:32:43 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, Martian Manhunter, at least Post Crisis MM, is worse.  He has nearly identical flight, strength, and speed, and all of Superman's ""-vision""s, plus Martian vision, shape shifting, and telepathy."
FlashTV,3910my,FollowThePact,5,Mon Jun 8 23:34:26 2015 UTC,isn't shazam a better superman? He has his abilities but not his weakness (kryptonite)
FlashTV,3910my,TheExtremistModerate,14,Mon Jun 8 22:02:15 2015 UTC,"Superman has more than one weakness. 3 to be exact. Kryptonite, a red sun, and magic."
FlashTV,3910my,Terakahn,9,Mon Jun 8 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"to be fair, only one of those is a weakness. the other two are ""neutral"" vulnerabilities. it's not that they have a strong effect on him, rather, they are able to affect him."
FlashTV,3910my,cayal3,3,Mon Jun 8 23:18:38 2015 UTC,And batman. ;)   Wait. What about speedforce?
FlashTV,3910my,Terakahn,10,Mon Jun 8 23:42:42 2015 UTC,"But he still has a kid's mind, and none of his powers are up to par with Superman.....close, but no cigar.  Also if you can get to him before Shazam's lightning grants him his power he's a goner."
FlashTV,3910my,storman,10,Mon Jun 8 22:08:33 2015 UTC,"In most iterations his powers are definitely on par with Superman, but he's just inexperienced."
FlashTV,3910my,linuxphoney,6,Mon Jun 8 22:30:11 2015 UTC,"Yup. Which means that, if they were on equal playing fields, experience-wise, Shazam would win. Mainly because his lightning is magic, which Superman is weak to. But that's the part of Shazam that makes him really interesting. He isn't experienced; he's just a kid."
FlashTV,3910my,deadpa,7,Mon Jun 8 23:05:18 2015 UTC,"Superman is vulnerable to magic, unlike kryptonite which he's weak to.  Magic has the ability to hurt Superman badly, but he's been hit by some really strong magic attacks and has still gotten up to fight. Plus unless Shazam is able to get a hold of Superman good luck hitting him with the lightning."
FlashTV,3910my,drproximo,4,Tue Jun 9 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, what I mean by ""weak to"" is that it bypasses his invulnerability. He gets affected by magic just like any human would."
FlashTV,3910my,samx3i,2,Tue Jun 9 01:25:15 2015 UTC,"I was just pointing out that a lot of people bring up the ""magic > Superman"" deal, but in reality it just bypasses his inbulnerability.  As in to say a magician is able to turn a human into a frog, therefore Superman is able to turn into a frog. If a sword is enchanted to be able to cut through anything than it can cut through Superman.  However if someone is enchanted or granted through magic superhuman strength then that's just superhuman strength to Superman. It wouldn't hurt Superman anymore than regular superhuman strength. Now I'm not saying that Shazam's lightning is regular lightning. It's not, it's a pretty powerful magic attack, but Superman has been hit by and gotten back up from both the lightning and other similarily powerful magic attacks.  Also, and I can't find the scan for it, but Superman has broken WW's sword by blocking it with his forearms, and WW's sword is enchanted to be able to cut through atoms. Just a thought."
FlashTV,3910my,Rajion,2,Tue Jun 9 01:39:52 2015 UTC,"Superman's weak to magic similarly to how Martian Manhunter is weak to fire. Catching Manhunter on fire won't kill him immediately, and in fact he's more resilient to it than a normal human would be (such as in Justice League: Doom), but he's weak to it because it bypasses his invulnerability."
FlashTV,3910my,suss2it,6,Tue Jun 9 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"Also, shazam is vulnerable to lasers through the eyes. Injustice taught me that."
FlashTV,3910my,samx3i,3,Mon Jun 8 23:43:46 2015 UTC,That was brutal.
FlashTV,3910my,Terakahn,3,Tue Jun 9 02:43:57 2015 UTC,Heroes can make the best villains.
FlashTV,3910my,samx3i,2,Tue Jun 9 02:45:23 2015 UTC,dont forget the time superman lost his powers and gained the power to shoot little supermen out of his hands.
FlashTV,3910my,SeanCanary,25,Tue Jun 9 05:06:52 2015 UTC,"Also, he has to be faster because Speedforce.  If there is a speed that superman can hit, by definition it is a speed and the flash can use it. And superman really just is not the fastest thing in the universe."
FlashTV,3910my,AmantisAsoko,7,Mon Jun 8 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"Flash is faster than Superman but being the most powerful isn't what makes for the best character, most interesting story, or compelling themes.   Otherwise, we can just retitle every comicbook - Not The Flash."
FlashTV,3910my,GayFesh,7,Mon Jun 8 18:59:40 2015 UTC,wasn't that Quicksilver's first arc?
FlashTV,3910my,samx3i,22,Mon Jun 8 21:48:11 2015 UTC,"That's kind of my problem with Superman and the Justice League. The X-Men work because they're a team with a variety of powers. Yes, some are more powerful than others, but there aren't really much in the way of redundancies.   Super strength? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct assistance), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, and the Flash (infinite mass punch anyone?).   Flight? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter.   Neigh-invulnerable? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct shielding), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter (more likely density shifts through it, but he's still physically tough), etc.  Super Speed? Superman and The Flash, although Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman are able to get to wherever they need to go quickly, including across vast expanses of space.  Justice League with Superman just seems kind of redundant. Superman is a one-man superhero team."
FlashTV,3910my,AgentChris101,24,Mon Jun 8 19:14:32 2015 UTC,Which is why it is his personality and ideals which power the team.
FlashTV,3910my,Mr_Wasteed,9,Mon Jun 8 19:52:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's interesting you bring up the X-Men because they were specifically designed as a team, so everyone has lesser superpowers than can more easily bounce off each other. Whereas the Justice League is just DC's most popular solo characters smashed together into a team which leads to power overlap and a bunch of OP superheroes on the same squad."
FlashTV,3910my,your_mind_aches,2,Mon Jun 8 22:37:34 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. At the time of Justice League's beginning, the concept of creating a superhero team didn't even exist."
FlashTV,3910my,Mr_Wasteed,4,Mon Jun 8 23:21:27 2015 UTC,Plot power? Batman.
FlashTV,3910my,Imadoc91,7,Mon Jun 8 23:45:44 2015 UTC,Coupled with invincible plot armor makes him every bit as powerful as Superman.  Popularity is a hell of a power.
FlashTV,3910my,thomashush,3,Tue Jun 9 02:24:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like the tone is very different. If the competition were 'Who has the most emotional baggage' the X-Men would take it almost hands down (excepting Batman).   Also, Storm without her powers is such a badass that I think she could take down most JLA members with powers."
FlashTV,3910my,Kromgar,4,Mon Jun 8 22:13:42 2015 UTC,Has storm's mutant class gone up since I last checked? I thought her powers equated to hitting you with a tsunami or a lightning bolt. Doesn't seem like something superman couldn't handle.
FlashTV,3910my,jacobfreeman000,3,Tue Jun 9 00:44:58 2015 UTC,Aquaman also has super-speed in water.
FlashTV,3910my,WinterAssassinR,2,Tue Jun 9 01:13:09 2015 UTC,"Too true. Aquaman can swim at 10,000 feet per second. 10,000 feet per second is more than 3 kilometers per second, or 6,800 miles per hour.   For comparison, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps can sustain a speed of 4.7 miles per hour."
FlashTV,3910my,caipengislife,3,Tue Jun 9 02:26:05 2015 UTC,Michael Phelps   he is referenced in the flash

FlashTV,3910my,L1M3,18,Mon Jun 8 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe he was talking about the fact that his speed comes from his ability to tap into the the speedforce, theres no physiologic change in his body that makes him the fastest man alive. I could be wrong about this, but I heard there was a crossover story where the Flash was faster than Quiksilver in the Dc Universe, and when they raced in the Marvel Universe, he was no faster than the average man because the speedforce doesnt exist there."
FlashTV,3910my,Mr_Wasteed,9,Mon Jun 8 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"First of all, Quick silver runs in couple of multiples of sound speed. Flash can run almost at speed of light. So flash is definitely faster in terms of speed. There are bunch of youtube videos/discussion where ""super"" fans of each are debating about it and cite comics.   Second of all, there are instances where he is actually running around speed of light, physically. In the movie Crisis on two earths, the other flash who has the same power.. runs at almost max speed for about 5~10mins and gets old due to the Theory of relativity stuff so he physically was running at that speed. There is some differences in theory between the show and the comics."
FlashTV,3910my,samx3i,10,Mon Jun 8 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"Im not saying Quicksilver is faster than the Flash. When Flash has full access to the speedforce he can absolutely run circles around him. What I'm saying ia that Barry's speed comes from his ability to tap into an outside source (speedforce) and not Barry himself. Where as Quicksilvers speed comes from a physiologic source, his genetic mutation."
FlashTV,3910my,samx3i,10,Mon Jun 8 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"It bugs me that people get the amount of time dilation wrong. At just barely under light speed time slows down by a factor of 7. So if the flash ran for 10 minutes at light speed (from our perspective), he would experience 70 minutes.  Granted if he goes faster than light speed (because speedforce), then the writers can make shit up because we're outside physics."
FlashTV,3910my,cmmgreene,13,Mon Jun 8 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"Hi there! My understanding is that time dilation as you approach the speed of light approaches infinity asymptotically. At the speed of light, you no longer experience time, aka time dilation factor is infinite. If you take a limit of your speed as it approaches c you would experience a time dilation factor that is astronomically high. It would be reduced greatly at 0.9999999c and then reduced even more at 0.99c, because that's how asymptotes work. I think that's the idea behind what you're saying: that at 99% of c your time dilation is still drastically less than infinite.  ... but I've got to ask...  ... where did you get that factor of 7 from?  EDIT: There's a basic Lorentz Equation solver here (go to the site, put in 7, and click the Factor of Change button) which says you get a time dilation factor (Lorentz factor) of 7 at 0.99c, that must be where you pulled your rule of thumb from."
FlashTV,3910my,SuperUrfling,2,Mon Jun 8 19:28:54 2015 UTC,It was an /r/askscience thread about the speed of light and time and someone worked out the equation for the time dilation factor at 99.99999...% of c. They got 7 plus some change and that number has stuck with me since. I assumed it was true because it was the top level comment with a hundred replies that wasn't deleted.  I'll see if I can find a more credible source.  http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/HEP/QuarkNet/time.html This site works out the math and has a graph showing the time dilation factor as your velocity approaches c. When you get really close to c the time dilation factor increases exponentially up to about 10. So the guy I was quoting must have used a velocity that was slightly lower than c for his calculation.
FlashTV,3910my,g33k_01,5,Mon Jun 8 19:38:39 2015 UTC,"Ok. I'm not sure if you're confused, or it's just not coming through very well. This graph stops at 10 because it's zoomed in, basically. See how there's still a sliver of grey on the right side? That means you haven't gotten all the way to c yet. If you zoomed out, you would see that the dilation factor keeps going up, farther than you could ever zoom. There is no maximum dilation factor, nor even one that you get ""close to"". No matter what number you pick, you can always get a dilation factor higher than that number by going just a tiny bit closer to c."
FlashTV,3910my,small_far_away,4,Mon Jun 8 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"The asymptote doesn't go to 10; the asymptote goes to infinity. That's why it's an asymptote. The graph goes to 10, because no one wants a graph going to infinity.  As /u/chars709 pointed out, a time dilation of 7 (7.088812...) refers to .99 c. 0.999c gives you 22.366, 0.9999 gives you 70.712, 0.9999999 gives you 2236.068, etc. Time dilation can be anywhere from 1 to infinity.  The weird thing is, the observer moving at relativistic velocities is the one who experiences less time. So if Flash were moving at nearly light speed, it would be the world around him aging far faster than himself."
FlashTV,3910my,jscoppe,3,Mon Jun 8 22:21:37 2015 UTC,no one wants a graph going to infinity   I want that!
FlashTV,3910my,small_far_away,9,Mon Jun 8 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"Except relativity is the other way around: The closer you are to the speed of light the slower time feels, so 10 minutes would feel like a little less than 1.5 minutes, going by the factor of 7 figure.  IIRC, the reason he aged was not relativity but because running at max speed for so long was a strain on his body."
FlashTV,3910my,Conbz,6,Mon Jun 8 20:47:33 2015 UTC,"Well the concept is what i liked. They even had a ""QED"" : Quantum EigenState Device to travel between parallel universes and end up going to the Earth Prime: which was the first single Universe which led to multiple parallel universe created by different choices of different people and living beings. I like conceptual movies and this is an animated movies for us and kids so introducing these things is better for them. Being scientifically accurate at things, i have hardly found any movie that is perfectly accurate. Interstellar, gravity and others are not that accurate either. Being a physicist myself, i can quote Sheldon ""That's no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid, and that makes me sad."" I just enjoy entertainment as entertainment."
FlashTV,3910my,small_far_away,7,Mon Jun 8 16:58:24 2015 UTC,I thought that the Speedforce was supposed to exist in all universes and times. Shouldn't that include the Marvel universe?
FlashTV,3910my,Starrystars,10,Mon Jun 8 17:14:44 2015 UTC,DC Comics doesn't get to decide what does and doesn't exist in other companies' multiverses.
FlashTV,3910my,deadpa,7,Mon Jun 8 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"That's true. But if Barry was in the Marvel universe, there's no reason why his speed shouldn't work. Clearly DC and Marvel are in some kind of agreement in that scenario.  Also, didn't Barry run himself into the Marvel universe in one comic? His speed worked fine then."
FlashTV,3910my,ravelle,3,Mon Jun 8 19:38:17 2015 UTC,"Clearly DC and Marvel are in some kind of agreement in that scenario   Yes, and they agree, per DC Comics copyright and interests, that ""Speed Force"" is a unique property of DC Comics and does not/can not exist in the Marvel Universe, just as the Infinity Gauntlet proved useless to Darkseid in the DC Universe."
FlashTV,3910my,jscoppe,2,Mon Jun 8 19:40:55 2015 UTC,"I should hope not, I can only imagine the continuity of that universe."
FlashTV,3910my,ikescurvy,2,Mon Jun 8 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"It exists in all universes and times that are written by DC, not Marvel. During a Marvel vs. DC crossover, the Flash needed to bring Speedforce batteries to be able to go super fast in the Marvel universe."
FlashTV,3910my,SithisTheDreadFather,24,Mon Jun 8 19:16:28 2015 UTC,Now I just want to know what the accurate answer is!
FlashTV,3910my,jscoppe,32,Mon Jun 8 14:56:12 2015 UTC,If I remember this issue correctly he is trying to catch someone in a plane. So while he can outrun Superman on the ground actually getting in the air is a little trickier.
FlashTV,3910my,Willravel,28,Mon Jun 8 15:38:55 2015 UTC,"If you're going fast enough, you can begin 'swimming' through the atmosphere. And Flash can reduce the heat caused by friction as one of the well-documented features of controlling the Speedforce.  The short answer is ""yes, the Flash can fly"". Though they don't explore this too much in the comics, as they like to keep him 'grounded' (pun intended)."
FlashTV,3910my,AREYOUSauRuS,7,Mon Jun 8 16:52:19 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he addresses this in the issue. He mentions he can effectively run up air molecules...then doesn't and gets a lift in the plane. Maybe I am not remembering correctly though.
FlashTV,3910my,Karisma_not_Karma,8,Mon Jun 8 17:00:28 2015 UTC,If this is the comic I'm thinoing of he runs on vibrated water molecules in clouds to catch the plane so he can't fly but doesn't always need to
FlashTV,3910my,Karisma_not_Karma,3,Mon Jun 8 17:04:46 2015 UTC,Ah that's the one.
FlashTV,3910my,Karisma_not_Karma,5,Mon Jun 8 17:07:14 2015 UTC,I think they mention in one issue they show that it's not hard to get into the air it's getting back down that's the problem
FlashTV,3910my,Schnabeltierchen,4,Mon Jun 8 17:24:46 2015 UTC,There really isn't a problem since he can move his limbs near the speed of light and escape velocity is a fraction of that speed.  Flash could effectively swim through the atmosphere with ease.
FlashTV,3910my,cavarcher,2,Mon Jun 8 17:40:38 2015 UTC,How is he able to keep going if he has no ground to run on anymore? Is he running on the air itself?
FlashTV,3910my,Neocarbunkle,7,Mon Jun 8 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"The Flash doesn't just run fast, he moves his body fast doing anything, including swimming.   At high speeds, going through the atmosphere would be like swimming through water. Note that air and water are just collections of molecules, just with different densities.  The Speedforce allows him to shrug off the effects of friction, so he can go through any medium like air or water at whatever speeds without having to worry about being slowed down or burning up.  Edit: And now that I'm thinking about it, the 'vacuum' of space is actually made up of molecules, just vastly less dense than atmosphere or water. So theoretically, if you are going fast enough, you could 'swim' through space as well. Someone make Barry a form-fitting space-suit, stat!"
FlashTV,3910my,FlashFactBot,9,Mon Jun 8 18:41:45 2015 UTC,"The Flash is probably the most overpowered yet underrated Hero in the DC lineup.   He can fly, he can go through walls, of course he has superspeed that can go faster than you can think(this is how he beats teleportation over shortish distances). In addition to that, his speedforce control is such that he can use the speedforce to survive if necessary, as well as survive in space based off the fact that as long as he's running he's encased in the speedforce, eliminating the effects of the vacuum.

FlashTV,3910my,gjallerhorn,6,Mon Jun 8 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"Flash is OP for sure which is why he inexplicably lets bad guys run away who are no faster than an average human. Like Weather Wizard in Out of Time. Realistically, do you think that even underpowered CW Barry was so slow that he couldn't grab the wand? Or really, how far could WW have traveled after he was right behind Barry and Joe and struck them with lightning? When Barry took Cpt. Singh to the hospital (which was probably just down the street given that they were downtown), do you think WW would've gone back in the elevator and made it so far away that Barry couldn't find him?   Point being is that The Flash is crazy OP which is why we see Barry standing around blinking his eyes while bad guys run away with normal human speed and stamina."
FlashTV,3910my,JakeMongoose,4,Mon Jun 8 21:08:46 2015 UTC,I don't envy writing for crazy OP characters. They often have to make him dumb as rocks to let some bad guys get away/defeat him.
FlashTV,3910my,Anubissama,3,Mon Jun 8 21:22:25 2015 UTC,"Flash might be referring to how the Speed Force means that he's not moving in the same way Superman is moving. The Speed Force essentially removes and/or changes the rules of the universe around those who wield it, so the way Barry (or Bart or anyone else) is fast is not the same way something or someone like Superman is conventionally fast. Superman is fast following the rules of the universe, so he has to deal with things like increased friction, increased mass as high speeds, breaking people as he catches them and quickly changes their velocity, etc. The Flash manipulates the Speed Force to sidestep (literally? Figuratively?) those limitations.   Without those reality-warping effects, Flash is just a great runner. With those powers, he can be neigh-invincible and is fast in a way which is impossible for other things to be fast."
FlashTV,3910my,leonardo97,2,Mon Jun 8 22:50:08 2015 UTC,Good explanation.  This is my explanation between Flash vs Superman too.  Superman has super human abilities.  Flash has reality-altering abilities.

Here's an interesting fact: there is a mention and depiction of Superman vibrating/blurring his face to avoid recognition. It's in the Superman comic where Lex Luthor uses a gigantic computer to determine Superman's secret identity. When it spits out ""Clark Kent"", he denies that's the answer because Clark is so timid and no-one with real power could ever be like Clark.   (It's Superman #2, btw. From 1987.

FlashTV,38y0ao,PoundSake,63,Mon Jun 8 16:09:13 2015 UTC,I think that is a common thing throughout the show. The strength of Barry's powers is extremely inconsistent which is the one thing which would have made the show a lot more enjoyable for me (gradually seeing him get faster instead of his powers being as strong as the plot wants it to be).

FlashTV,38y0ao,Weregrizzly,22,Mon Jun 8 01:24:37 2015 UTC,I think Cupid is an excellent example of how Oliver underestimates his opponents.

FlashTV,38y0ao,DoctorSteve,-5,Sat Jun 20 05:57:11 2015 UTC,Cupid's episode is a terrific example of how badly Arrow missed opportunities and characters.

FlashTV,38y0ao,soggy_potato,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"That episode was not a filler episode. A lot of important character stuff happens in that episode. Oliver explains to Felicity through his conversation with Ms. Cutter why he can't be with Ms. Smoak. This pushes Felicity towards Palmer. Mr. Queen finally decides to live and be with Felicity, but he is too late. This was a key development for Oliver's character and actually furthered his identity crisis. Cupid herself is better than the comic book version by quite a bit. The main problem with the episode is Felicity's characterization, which makes her seem shallow."
FlashTV,38y0ao,diasfordays,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"You clearly remember the episode better than I do, you make some decent points. Still, the fact that I only vaguely remember cupid, since she was in the show only briefly, to me makes me think of her as a filler."

After that Oliver was disoriented because he wasn't expecting it and got handcuffed."

Your whole argument about Oliver's skill level being inconsistent has been debunked unless you want to justify your side of it.

FlashTV,38y0ao,SimplyTheDoctor007,3,Tue Jun 9 04:35:29 2015 UTC,"So if you could bench, say, 500lbs with one hand. And you're in a fist fight against someone that can only bench 20lbs with 2 hands. Are you going to be swinging your fists at him at full force and actually trying to kill him?"

FlashTV,38y0ao,soggy_potato,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:14:11 2015 UTC,"Its still challenging to take someone down without hurting them at all.

FlashTV,38y0ao,DoctorSteve,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:39:41 2015 UTC,"That's NOT WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO.  If that was how it was shot, it would have made sense. And given Oliver has like seventy tranq darts, that would have been what he did.  So stop this God damn stupid argument about Cupid."
FlashTV,38y0ao,soggy_potato,2,Tue Jun 9 04:40:41 2015 UTC,"That's NOT WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO.   Oliver says that's what he is trying to do. In the scene, Oliver clearly says, ""I don't want to hurt you."" Its pretty obvious that not wanting to hurt someone would limit ones fighting choices. Are you saying that Oliver isn't trying to do what he says he is trying to do?   And given Oliver has like seventy tranq darts, that would have been what he did.   You can ask this question of literally any fight scene in the show involving Oliver and a lesser skill opponent. This isn't even the same argument you made originally. The original argument was that Oliver's skill level was inconsistent, which isn't true. Oliver's use of archery and other tools he has is inconsistent. I agree with that argument."

FlashTV,38y0ao,Blueowl789,26,Mon Jun 8 11:39:46 2015 UTC,"pro photographer here.   there is absolutely no possible way any phone in existence right now could have taken a photo like that for more than one reason.   That being said, this is a show that takes place in a world where a genius from the future is creating technology for world consumption, and creates in-house technology capable of completely disregarding physics, biology and any number of other scientific consistencies we take for granted. Additionally, all of this happens in some crazy parallel timeline/dimension where if the actual phone she has is an ""iPhone 5"" or whatever, it could be a completely different phone all amped up on future Eobard Thawne-ified technology.   Who knows?"
FlashTV,38y0ao,kofteburger,2,Mon Jun 8 02:11:40 2015 UTC,Not even an amateur photographer here.  Why is this impossible? is it because of the speed he's moving at?  I can't say i recall exactly how fast he was going at the time (though I guess on my phone even if he was going a measly ten feet an hour he'd be fuzzy as hell).
FlashTV,38y0ao,Reverse_Grodd,6,Mon Jun 8 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"He's almost certainly going much too fast for the shutter speed to capture. He should just appear as a red blur, if he shows up at all."
FlashTV,38y0ao,OK_Soda,2,Mon Jun 8 15:47:07 2015 UTC,"The picture on the phone would not be able to be taken with the nicest consumer camera available for thousands and thousands of dollars.   First there is the issue of shutter speed. Most of the nicest cameras around can take a photo at 1/8000 of a second, which is pretty damn fast... but considering how fast the flash is, it is unlikely that you would retain all the detail of his body in a photo like this even if you were very skilled and lucky. You might be able to make out a person, but it would likely be mostly a blur. This is considering we are taking the photo with a very nice camera, but in reality we are taking a photo with a phone camera, which is simply not a ""really nice"" camera in any respect -even the absolute best ones.   But lets just say as a hypothetical that we could get the shutter speed fast enough to completely freeze the motion and capture the flash in mid run. It would be very, very difficult - to the point of being near impossible to focus on him.  This photo was not taken on a horizontal axis. If he were running in a straight line, and you were standing in a parallel spot focusing on an object that he will run by - you may be able to get him in focus with anticipation... but the photo on Iris' phone has the flash running directly towards her. Meaning that if she were focusing automatically (which is the only option on a phone camera) the computer would have to constantly refocus again and again as he got closer and closer. I don't know how fast the flash moves... but no modern camera, much less a sorority Instagram camera (iPhone) would be able to handle refocusing and tracking his movement fast enough to keep him in focus.   Then there is the exposure. Not only is the flash looking quite fantastic (in that he is perfectly lit, you can see the details of his face and costume), but so is the background and all the lightning surrounding him. You can do an experiment outside right now if it is daylight outside where you live... get a friend to stand in front of you on the street. Whip out your phone and touch him to focus on him, now touch the sky to focus on the sky....  You should see in most circumstances that your phone will want to expose the photo for either the brightness of the background or the shadows of the persons body. To get everything perfect is not only a science unto itself that is that much more difficult to handle on a phone camera... but normally requires some post production work (photoshop) to tweak it and get it to look just right.   If we are grounding this show in our reality, in that she is using a modern iPhone 5 as we know it today - it is literally impossible that she took that photo."

FlashTV,38y0ao,Virus_CaRNaGe,3,Sun Jun 7 20:30:36 2015 UTC,"So Thawne had the great name of professor zoom and Hunter Zolomon decided to drop the professor and go with just Zoom. Zolomon had far cooler powers though. Instead of super speed he had the ability to ""manipulate his reference point in time"". This often made him as fast (sometimes faster) than wally west who was the first flash to run at light speed. Zolomon was creative with his powers and often used sonic booms to create area of effect attacks as unlike the flash, he has no acceleration: his movement is basically instantaneous. Zoom was one of the most dangerous Pre-52 rogues often taking on multiple opponents. His reason for being a villain was to make heroes better by subjecting them to tradgedy for them to overcome. His only downside would be his lack of connection to the speedforce. This means his punches would not be able to increase in mass like wally with his light speed ""infinite"" mass punch that the speed force granted him. As well as this his inability to hypermetabolise and heal wounds. Regarding him getting crippled by Gorilla Grodd, that's actually part of his origin story not what ended him. Grodd is a great villain but there's no way he could take on Zoom. Man I love comic books"

My one complaint though was that you introduced too much too fast, the Crime Syndicate, the Question, Grundy, the Multiverse. I mean you spaced it out and timed it really well, it's just that it would be too much at one time for a casual fan to understand.

FlashTV,38znrd,Element1232,3,Mon Jun 8 19:10:21 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear that you are going to continue writing these. I sincerely enjoyed the story. Looking forward to your future episodes. I'm an armature writer myself and my writing style was almost the same when I first started. I went from writing in story format at first and then switched to screenplay format when I finally settled on a hybrid story/screenplay format. My style now is similar to fanfiction but with screenplay style location descriptions. If you're not familiar with fanfiction (which is basically what you wrote) then you're in for a big surprise. It's huge with countless fanfic writers posting their stories on the many websites that are dedicated to the ""literature"". What I like about the fanfiction format that most fic writers follow is the way the dialog is spaced out like it would be in a screenplay. What I don't like about most fanfiction is how the narration and or description can go on... and on... and on... with very little dialog in the story. I prefer stories that rely mostly on the dialog to tell the story. If your the same then take a look at some random pages of one of my stories...   http://imgur.com/a/pDYBX   You'll see its similar to a screenplay with Scene Headings and Transitions telling the reader of where the scene takes place but what you wont see is the character name preceding the dialogue. The dialog is written similar to how it would be written in a story. I purposely try to stay away from writing too much description or narration but that's because I'm not that good at it at the moment. As I get more familiar and more comfortable with writing, I go back and edit my story to give better descriptions. Anyway, take a look and see if it helps or inspires you to come up with your own writing format. The main advise I would like to give to you is to write for yourself and only for yourself and not for anyone else. If you like your story then that's what matters the most. Don't get discouraged by negative comments. You can't please all the people all the time, but you can please one person all the time, and that's you... the only one that matters ;D"

Without STAR Labs it becomes much more difficult to hold prisoners I know. But how will they pay for all the food to keep the prisoners alive without Harrison Wells? Perhaps Barry can develop some kind of Phantom Zone Speedforce prison instead.  The show needs to change. I'll be disappointed if epiosde 2 is the main team back in STAR Labs tracking down a high school bully. The end of Season 1 was highly serialized, Season 2 needs to continue that."

FlashTV,38yc02,TheWanderingN00b,9,Mon Jun 8 15:27:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not upset at all with NBC. I'm stating facts. They are not the best advertisers.  All of the new shows they started this fall and i believe last fall have been cancelled. Maybe one outlier.  People however did enjoy Constantine if they didnt this wouldn't be news and their wouldn't have been a campaign to try and save it.  Hannibal was considered one of the best dramas on tv right now and even that was endanger of being cancelled last season. I appreciate NBC  for giving Constantine the platform. However i disagree with the cancellation. Given another season i think it could have improved it was just finding its footing or even a full season instead of 13 episodes.  A similoat thing happened to the NBC show community which had a loyal fanbase was also cancelled and without the fan pressure in sure hannibal would have been cancelled as well. NBC is afraid to take risks. The unbreakable kimmy schimdt was originally suppose to be a NBC show then they chickened out Netflix got it and it was a hit.  Like I said I'm not upset with NBC at all, I'm just waiting for a show to stick on there"

I hope that DC/WB keeps him in mind if that Justice League Dark movie ever gets off the ground.

It's the only way to have so many aliens so cheap, and just look at Pilot, he already looks like Salaak, or Rygel, perfect height for a Guardian. (not saying they reuse the puppets, just that it would work)  My other idea, was to start the show with John Stewart since they already teased the beginnings of Hal Jordan. Browder could be Hal, who has disappeared, presumed dead, so his ring seeks out a new Green Lantern and finds Stewart.  Stewart would then find Hal later, captured by Sinestro. That way we get two earth lanterns right away (I'd also have Guy Gardner as a cop on the show who also eventually gets the ring)  But I was downvoted, so what do I know :P"

FlashTV,38wppa,snakeybasher,2,Sun Jun 7 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"I like some of the ideas here, but to me, a Green Lantern show would work well as a series that's around 13 episodes with a bigger budget like Game of Thrones, mix in the practical and CGI, like the Guardians being CGI just to make them feel more different then before, but add in some puppetry for creatures like Salak. And while the show would start out with Hal as a lantern, I'd skip the origin for Hal and eventually introduce John, Kyle and Guy, maybe even Simon."

FlashTV,38y2sh,SovietDomino,13,Sun Jun 7 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"The best answer i've heard so far is that the wormhole was a different method of time travel than his episode 15 jump.   In episode 15, he tries to get to as high a speed as possible to stop the tidal wave. At some point he hits a speed high enough for the speed force to send his consciousness back into his old body, a body which has a connection to the speedforce.   In the first future barry fight, it's technically the first time that barry travels back. He goes to before he had a connection with the speedforce, a time when he was 5. He does not have the same connection, but he has time travelled. He goes back as an adult and protects his child self. This works out fine.   In the finale, barry runs in the particle accelerator and collides with a hydrogen atom to create a wormhole. A wormhole both he and wells can travel in. Barry travels back to his time using this portal, rather than the speedforce. Since he uses the wormhole, the speedforce does not transfer the consciousness. Barry physicially enters the past, again.   And that's why it's super convoluted but still really cool and interesting tv."

FlashTV,38y2sh,Virus_CaRNaGe,12,Mon Jun 8 07:41:22 2015 UTC,Short answer: Speedforce  Long answer: Speedforce.
FlashTV,38y2sh,Hpfm2,8,Sun Jun 7 20:58:36 2015 UTC,"All right so hear me out, listen careful, and keep an open mind, because I'll be mostly spewing out bullshit.  Picture, if you will, time as a straight line. The Flash has the ability to run at such a speed that will make him go backwards and forwards at will.  You can see this during the finale. Barry pretty much straight up enters the time stream and is able to willingly decide where and when to go.  This is not the case in episode 15(?)  Barry has no idea what he's doing. He's just running really fast. Unkowingly, Barry ruptures the timestream, but he has no idea he has done it. He has no idea how to proceed, how to indicate where and when he must go. Confused and in an atempt to correct itself, the timestream will drop Barry in the closest (time wise) situation that most resembled the one he's in- In this case, some hours before, while running to the morgue. Since the timestream also doesn't know where to put him, it'll simply merge with his past self.  TL;DR: Speedforce."
FlashTV,38y2sh,Gate4043,2,Sun Jun 7 21:41:45 2015 UTC,"He ran into an alternate timeline, going past the previous version of himself because he cut into that timeline for a couple of seconds."
FlashTV,38y2sh,zoneluke,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"the way i see it as on the out of time episode both barry were the same barry hence why the replacement.  However on the finale the 3 barrys were from different timelines e.g. the past, present and future."
FlashTV,38v21n,Cgb591rocks,9,Sun Jun 7 01:57:23 2015 UTC,Happy birthday! Great picture and cake. Is the New 52 Volume 1 a gift as well?
FlashTV,38v21n,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,10,Sun Jun 7 02:00:37 2015 UTC,Yes!! Thank you! I turn 15 in a couple weeks. Kinda early. It is my gift. I have read #1-5 so far i volume #1.
FlashTV,38v21n,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,4,Sun Jun 7 02:07:29 2015 UTC,Your birthday is in a couple weeks and you're already more than halfway through reading your present? Better treat yourself to volume 2 when your actual birthday rolls around.
FlashTV,38v21n,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Sun Jun 7 02:11:28 2015 UTC,I'm planning on saving for a ps4. Any left over money is volume 2 for sure. I read way too fast. 1-5 was about 20 minutes on her couch.
FlashTV,38v21n,Future_Vantas,5,Sun Jun 7 02:18:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one advantage/disadvantage with comics, especially very action oriented ones is that they are quick reads."
FlashTV,38v21n,MordorTroll,2,Sun Jun 7 02:23:40 2015 UTC,Yeah only a few pages each but they are really good so far.
FlashTV,38v21n,TheWanderingN00b,2,Sun Jun 7 02:37:30 2015 UTC,"In the meantime try to see if your local library has copies of New52 Flash, or even some of the older stuff with Wally."
FlashTV,38v21n,iron_sites,2,Sun Jun 7 05:05:58 2015 UTC,I bet they do. Might check that out
FlashTV,38v21n,iron_sites,2,Sun Jun 7 06:10:07 2015 UTC,"Come volume 3-4 you are in for a treat, shit gets so real. Francis Manapul and Brian Buccaletto are immensely talented folks."

FlashTV,38v21n,The_Bravinator,-3,Sun Jun 7 06:10:24 2015 UTC,You are allowed to go into your presents weeks before your actual birthday? Spoiled as shit
FlashTV,38v21n,Future_Vantas,2,Sun Jun 7 10:18:34 2015 UTC,Well my friends decided to catch me off guard. It was just because i never have had the chance to just celebrate my birthday with my friends and they knew how much it would mean to me. I'm in no way spoiled
FlashTV,38v21n,drproximo,6,Sun Jun 7 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"Your friend drew that? Impressive, I thought they just took a headshot out of a comic panel and made it big.  Happy birthday!"
FlashTV,38v21n,drproximo,5,Sun Jun 7 08:16:03 2015 UTC,Yeah she told me a month ago she wanted some ideas for drawings. I told her to look at the show and the new 52. I think it's mainly colored pencil actually. And thanks. This birthday is memorable so far and I've still got like two weeks
FlashTV,38v21n,ajrawings,3,Sun Jun 7 08:17:58 2015 UTC,Well she really took those suggestions to heart because the drawing is on point.  Good to hear!
FlashTV,38v21n,FlashFactBot,3,Sun Jun 7 08:21:38 2015 UTC,Thank you a lot!
FlashTV,38v21n,ReverseFlashBot,2,Sun Jun 7 08:23:18 2015 UTC,Happy b'day Speedster. Have a good one buddy! :)
FlashTV,38syzp,KindaGoodPainter,158,Sat Jun 6 15:36:19 2015 UTC,I might cry if we actually get Jay Garrick next season
FlashTV,38syzp,walterpinkman45,101,Sat Jun 6 15:42:49 2015 UTC,"They foreshadowed the helmet. We have to now, right? It's Chekhov's gun, right? Don't show a gun in the first act if you don't intend to use it in the third."
FlashTV,38syzp,cantletyoubrewthat,65,Sat Jun 6 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"I would assume that the helmet would be a for sure thing, and I also think Hal Jordan will show up next season in either Flash or Arrow because of the ""one of their test pilots disappeared"" line in Rogue Air."
FlashTV,38syzp,walterpinkman45,30,Sat Jun 6 16:37:17 2015 UTC,"I know, right? Hal had better show the heck up soon. They've teased me long enough."
FlashTV,38syzp,cantletyoubrewthat,29,Sat Jun 6 16:39:26 2015 UTC,I know! I'd be fine if he was just a normal guy. But Green Lantern would be amazing
FlashTV,38syzp,walterpinkman45,44,Sat Jun 6 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"Have him show up as a normal guy like Barry did on Arrow, then he gets his own series. Boom."
FlashTV,38syzp,JumpingCactus,14,Sat Jun 6 17:42:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's too late for that. If I remember correctly, tehy say he dissapeared about a year ago, so by now he is already training to become a green lantern. :P"
FlashTV,38syzp,Kionz,37,Sat Jun 6 19:44:03 2015 UTC,Not for Arrow. The flashback story is now taking Ollie to Coast City.
FlashTV,38syzp,ObnoxiousGod,11,Sat Jun 6 20:09:18 2015 UTC,What if Hal Jordan is connected in how Oliver Queen learns how to fly. That would be amazing
FlashTV,38syzp,Pictuss,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:31:16 2015 UTC,how Oliver Queen learns how to fly   What? Does that happen at some point?
FlashTV,38syzp,sabin357,5,Sun Jun 7 13:32:36 2015 UTC,He's already in space. SPAAAACE.
FlashTV,38syzp,-Mountain-King-,3,Sun Jun 7 03:06:58 2015 UTC,BUT THEY'VE TEASED HIM TOO MUCH
FlashTV,38syzp,JumpingCactus,6,Sat Jun 6 20:12:56 2015 UTC,I KNOOOOOOOOOOW... STAY STRONG BROTHER!!!
FlashTV,38syzp,Kionz,2,Sat Jun 6 20:18:21 2015 UTC,Doesn't have to be an origin story. He could already be GL but avoid using his powers as to keep it secret.
FlashTV,38syzp,SlothSupreme,10,Sun Jun 7 21:55:45 2015 UTC,this.

FlashTV,38syzp,Future_Vantas,23,Sun Jun 7 05:02:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think the two are really comparable. We have physical proof of Jay Garrick, while the GL reference could be just that: a reference."
FlashTV,38syzp,CobaltMoon98,2,Sat Jun 6 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"no, we have physical proof of a helmet. we know who that helmet probably belongs to, but it's not a certainty. both are references, hinting at what's likely to come."
FlashTV,38syzp,drproximo,19,Sat Jun 6 20:54:21 2015 UTC,"That is an iconic helmet which belongs solely to Jay Garrick. Hal has not been mentioned by name and nothing iconic, such as his ring, has been shown. Until something more concrete shows up, that line should be seen as a throwaway reference."
FlashTV,38syzp,CobaltMoon98,3,Sat Jun 6 20:59:22 2015 UTC,"Just to contrdict you, I believe Wally wore the helmet in Kingdom Come"
FlashTV,38syzp,whitey-ofwgkta,8,Sat Jun 6 23:29:04 2015 UTC,"Huh, TIL. Still, it's most commonly associated with Jay. I doubt they'd introduce Wally like that."
FlashTV,38syzp,CobaltMoon98,6,Sun Jun 7 00:10:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but only really had it because Alex Ross hates Wally and wanted to make the identity of the Flash ambiguous."
FlashTV,38syzp,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Sun Jun 7 01:53:49 2015 UTC,He did.
FlashTV,38syzp,ToastedSoup,4,Sun Jun 7 00:04:30 2015 UTC,"Ferris Air has been shown and name dropped throughout Arrow and The Flash. Also, spoiler"
FlashTV,38syzp,walterpinkman45,5,Sat Jun 6 21:02:50 2015 UTC,"Those are more concrete references, but they still don't guarantee that a character will show up."
FlashTV,38syzp,CobaltMoon98,9,Sat Jun 6 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"I just don't see why they wouldn't introduce Hal at this point. If Oliver does go to Coast City in flashbacks, I'm assuming he will meet Hal Jordan there. It just makes sense. Plus, Hal is very good friends with Barry AND Oliver in the comics."
FlashTV,38syzp,walterpinkman45,3,Sat Jun 6 21:15:05 2015 UTC,Before the Flash was announced Laurel's mom constantly made references to Central City so did other instances in the show.   We can hope!
FlashTV,38syzp,pirated-ambition,2,Sun Jun 7 01:04:40 2015 UTC,"That is an iconic helmet which belongs solely to Jay Garrick.   ...in the comics. nothing should ever be taken as a given, don't assume that the way something is in the comics is going to be exactly the same as the TV show until it's confirmed on screen in the actual TV show, or someone involved with the production mentions it.   elsewhere in this thread someone suggested that the helmet may have been an artifact from the Flash museum which someone tossed through the portal as a signal, so even if it is Garrick's helmet there's no certainty that we'll see him, he may have been dead ""for centuries"" from the perspective of its point of origin.  even if it's extremely likely, like 95%, that's still not 100%, because NOTHING is 100% until it actually happens."
FlashTV,38syzp,drproximo,9,Sat Jun 6 21:41:13 2015 UTC,"I never said that confirmed his appearance, but merely his (or some version of him) existence in this universe. Like you said, nothing can be taken as fact until the show runners reveal it, which furthers my argument against all of the Green Lantern ""proof."" There's just a lot more solid evidence for Garrick than there is for Jordan."
FlashTV,38syzp,CobaltMoon98,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:51:05 2015 UTC,Honestly I think the Arrow writers and even Amell want Hal in the show but ultimately it's the WB who gets the last decision.  I am hyping about Hal possibly appearing but also bracing for disappointment if he can't.  Remember all those Kord Industries teases? Yet they weren't allowed to use Ted Kord so I am being cautiously optomistic about Hal.
FlashTV,38syzp,NovaStarLord,0,Tue Jun 9 06:52:07 2015 UTC,No it is not solely Jays. His helm was inspired by the Greek/Roman god Hermes/Mercury. Who is also in the comics.
FlashTV,38syzp,Liar_tuck,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:28:33 2015 UTC,"Actually the helmet doesn't belong solely to Jay, Kingdom Come Wally also dons the helmet."
FlashTV,38syzp,ToastedSoup,3,Sat Jun 6 23:58:44 2015 UTC,It's far too late for my hype train... My mind is already using these hints of Jay and Hal as proof for Alan Scott appearing.
FlashTV,38syzp,LarX99,9,Sat Jun 6 22:43:29 2015 UTC,hype train   Did someone say hype train?
FlashTV,38syzp,ReverseFlashBot,7,Sat Jun 6 22:53:45 2015 UTC,THE BRAKES WERE CUT ON THE HYPE TRAIN! NO STOPPING IT NOW!
FlashTV,38syzp,ToastedSoup,6,Sun Jun 7 00:05:08 2015 UTC,hype train   Did someone say hype train?
FlashTV,38syzp,ReverseFlashBot,5,Sun Jun 7 00:11:30 2015 UTC,I think they should save Green Lantern for Supergirl. Aliens and space police would fit in better there.
FlashTV,38syzp,Desecr8or,5,Sun Jun 7 04:11:22 2015 UTC,But Flash and Lantern are good buds
FlashTV,38syzp,CamTheGringo,2,Sun Jun 7 11:19:02 2015 UTC,And so are Green Arrow and Green Lantern. So based solely off character interactions I'd say he belongs more in the DCWverse than Supergirl.
FlashTV,38syzp,suss2it,3,Sun Jun 7 13:42:59 2015 UTC,"Also, the references to Ferris air throughout the whole season."
FlashTV,38syzp,ClikeX,2,Sun Jun 7 10:29:20 2015 UTC,I'd fly with Rogue Air. Sounds like it'd be pretty sweet.
FlashTV,38syzp,Veggieleezy,2,Sun Jun 7 04:00:35 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, though (Arrow related): Oliver made a comment to John Diggle, as John stepped into an elevator with slightly green light, while John was wearing a slightly green outfit, that if John was going to keep fighting crime, he should start wearing a mask.  Maybe John Diggle is going to become an analog for John Stewart."
FlashTV,38syzp,Roman2250,5,Sun Jun 7 04:19:47 2015 UTC,Not happening
FlashTV,38syzp,walterpinkman45,10,Sun Jun 7 11:10:52 2015 UTC,I thought that the helmet just meant that: the timeline is seriously about to get screwed up so its time to go - RF.
FlashTV,38syzp,linke92,5,Sat Jun 6 18:04:34 2015 UTC,"In any other show I might accept that but that's a Flash's helmet in a show about the Flash! They can't not show him at this point, right? Right?"
FlashTV,38syzp,cantletyoubrewthat,6,Sun Jun 7 01:41:19 2015 UTC,"Any other show, I'd say know.  But I also thought the Grodd cage in the pilot wouldn't amount to anything.  They deliver on everything here.  Jay Garrick is going to be tight as hell."
FlashTV,38syzp,marsepic,3,Sun Jun 7 03:19:25 2015 UTC,I like the way you think. Awwww yeah.
FlashTV,38syzp,cantletyoubrewthat,2,Sun Jun 7 03:57:27 2015 UTC,Nah. It could definitely be an easter egg.   I think we will se Garrick though but it's not a guarantee
FlashTV,38syzp,swiper33,2,Sun Jun 7 08:07:54 2015 UTC,I've been wondering how much Chekov's Gun applies with these comic shows and movies that have so many fan service easter eggs.
FlashTV,38syzp,TemporalGrid,3,Sun Jun 7 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"Well, as somebody pointed out, we got Grodd and I never thought we'd actually get him in this universe. So who knows?"
FlashTV,38syzp,cantletyoubrewthat,12,Sun Jun 7 15:03:28 2015 UTC,I started making this before the final episode. So you could imagine my excitement after seeing it.
FlashTV,38syzp,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,8,Sat Jun 6 16:15:32 2015 UTC,I can't see how we won't with that teaser in the finale. And it's going to be glorious.
FlashTV,38syzp,walterpinkman45,5,Sat Jun 6 16:20:24 2015 UTC,I'm so excited
FlashTV,38syzp,Ungreat,3,Sat Jun 6 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"I feel that Justice Society would be perfect for a spinoff show.   Have Barry interact with Jay Garrick in some way in the big swirly death vortex and it turns out the JS (or some version of them) has been trapped outside of reality for 70 years.   Some incident ripped them from the continuum, and people's memories, and now they find themselves in modern day."
FlashTV,38syzp,_AI_,36,Sat Jun 6 20:39:26 2015 UTC,Damn this is awesome! You should make more stuff.
FlashTV,38syzp,Karisma_not_Karma,29,Sat Jun 6 15:58:43 2015 UTC,I had to stop myself from making an image every time something awesome would happen.

FlashTV,38syzp,Future_Vantas,11,Sat Jun 6 17:32:00 2015 UTC,I don't know of anyone in the subreddit that'll complain about great OC in the off season
FlashTV,38syzp,DrFireIceRage,6,Sat Jun 6 22:38:07 2015 UTC,Some would say you should do the reverse...  Finally
FlashTV,38syzp,DrFireIceRage,23,Sun Jun 7 04:59:35 2015 UTC,"Dumb question: why does Firestorm look different? I can't quite place it, I think he has longer hair than usual."
FlashTV,38syzp,bzdelta,40,Sat Jun 6 16:46:00 2015 UTC,you're fine. I based it on an early version when he had his gross long hair. http://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Flash-Firestorm-Finale.jpg
FlashTV,38syzp,abortedfetuses,8,Sat Jun 6 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think it looks phenomenal; you're very talented, OP. Thank you for sharing."
FlashTV,38syzp,FluffyCookie,21,Sat Jun 6 17:33:09 2015 UTC,I was wondering why Cisco was Firestorm in this universe. Maybe this is Overpass-troll Firestorm?
FlashTV,38syzp,JealotGaming,5,Sat Jun 6 17:11:44 2015 UTC,Look kinda like reverse jay
FlashTV,38syzp,dragonman8001,3,Sat Jun 6 17:20:03 2015 UTC,I kinda figured it was the hobo version of Firestorm. I don't think Cisco would ever wear leather like that.
FlashTV,38syzp,cantletyoubrewthat,2,Sat Jun 6 20:57:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed, he looks like almost like Ghost Rider."
FlashTV,38syzp,jeramiatheaberator,34,Sat Jun 6 21:14:18 2015 UTC,Do you have a deviantart?  Or a tumblr or something?  I'd like to see more of your art
FlashTV,38syzp,mattymck,11,Sat Jun 6 17:42:33 2015 UTC,Well. This is my new desktop. Excellent work! Your username is an understatement.
FlashTV,38syzp,Future_Vantas,8,Sat Jun 6 16:28:05 2015 UTC,"Looks great! But I wouldn't hold my breath for Jay or GL to show up, just teasing. I think the helmet might be something from the flash museum or something, like something to send a message"
FlashTV,38syzp,Jimm607,16,Sat Jun 6 19:20:03 2015 UTC,"i feel like the helmet is too big of  thing to ignore. it was placed front and center for us to see. Even to the uninitiated it means something.  For hal there have been a lot less concrete hints, disappearing test pilots and coast city teases could just be coincidences.  But there is only 1, jay garrick helmet"
FlashTV,38syzp,Cyber-Logic,10,Sun Jun 7 00:13:14 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Eobard's specific ""oh crap"" reaction to it.  He really didn't want another speedster interfering with his plan.  I disagree with your Hal Jordan assessment.  The previous references to Ferris Air and Coast City were just eggs; they could both exist without Hal Jordan.  But a ""missing test pilot"" is too specific to Hal, it would be a meaningless line if it didn't tie in to him.  Add in the fact that that line was suppose to be in the pilot episode (I spy a pun) and was brought back near the end of the season, and the signs seem to point to Hal joining the DCW soon."
FlashTV,38syzp,DtotheOUG,6,Sun Jun 7 04:57:40 2015 UTC,Like Grodd was just a reference too right?

FlashTV,38syzp,Sharkictus,9,Sun Jun 7 03:03:17 2015 UTC,"I remember my buddy was like ""Damnit Jay Garrick, I only don't like him because the way he got his powers was ridiculous."""
FlashTV,38syzp,argyle47,6,Sun Jun 7 03:00:02 2015 UTC,Has he seen New52 Jay Garrick?  His origin is A LOT cooler.
FlashTV,38syzp,Sharkictus,3,Sun Jun 7 04:49:03 2015 UTC,"Isn't the entire New 52 out the window with Convergence? That was supposed to set everything back to pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths, which is insane and erases something like 25 years of the DC Universe history."
FlashTV,38syzp,argyle47,3,Sun Jun 7 05:41:55 2015 UTC,"No no, every continuity is back, current ones get to stay."
FlashTV,38syzp,suss2it,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:21:57 2015 UTC,"So, there's the current Earth-1, with all of the original Earth-1 heroes, in addition to the Justice Society heroes, the Charlton heroes, the Marvel Family, and the Image characters? And, there are also separate Earth-2, Earth-3, Charlton Earth, Marvel Family Earth, and Image Earth?"
FlashTV,38syzp,argyle47,3,Sun Jun 7 06:31:28 2015 UTC,Yes.
FlashTV,38syzp,suss2it,2,Sun Jun 7 06:34:54 2015 UTC,"That's wild! Any idea about the benefits of the New 52 Earth existing alongside the other various Earths? Of course, DC had already compromised the result and point of Crisis on Infinite Earths by having the three separate realities in Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds, along with the Kingdom Come universe and the JLA: Earth 2 graphic novel."
FlashTV,38syzp,argyle47,2,Sun Jun 7 06:49:51 2015 UTC,"Image Comics is an independent publisher that has nothing to do with DC. I think you mean Wildstorm which was created by one of Image's founders, Jim Lee and was an imprint of Image until Jim Lee sold it to DC and became an executive at DC. But yeah, Wildstorm (Stormwatch, Grifter, Midnighter), Charleton (Blue Beetle, Captain Atom, the Question), Milestone (Static Shock) and Fawcett (Shazam, Black Adam) were all independent publishers that DC bought over the years and merged into their primary universe.   The JSA no longer resides on Earth-1 tho and have been rebooted on Earth-2 as younger versions of themselves. Earth-3 is as you know opposite land (some might say the reverse) where all the good guys are bad and The Multiversity reintroduced the multiverse so now there's a world where the next generation are basically pop celebrities that appear in gossip mags, there's worlds that pay homage to Charlton and the other publishers that exist as if DC never bought them and what not.  Comics everybody."
FlashTV,38syzp,suss2it,2,Sun Jun 7 14:01:28 2015 UTC,"Where does that leave Power Girl? And, for that matter, Star Girl? They are, or were, both friends with Supergirl."
FlashTV,38syzp,suss2it,2,Sun Jun 7 17:01:35 2015 UTC,"Stargirl is on Earth-1 and her and Supergirl were in Justice League United together recently. Power Girl is from Earth-2, but alongside Huntress got stranded on Earth-1 but recently went back to Earth-2. As far as I know New 52 Power Girl and Stargirl have never interacted, but Power Girl and Supergirl did meet in Supergirl's series."
FlashTV,38syzp,suss2it,2,Sun Jun 7 17:04:33 2015 UTC,"I guess Stargirl's origin gets redone since the lineage of the cosmic rod/staff was Starman - Star-Spangled Kid/Skyman - Stargirl (maybe an additional Starman  thrown in), with the two previous being JSA members.  I'm gonna have to play catch-up. New 52 kind of messed things up for me. Like I'm thinking that the whole Supergirl - Power Girl/Nightwing - Flamebird thing never happened."
FlashTV,38syzp,Future_Vantas,2,Sun Jun 7 18:04:34 2015 UTC,"Nope. Power Girl and Supergirl have only ever interacted with each other for ~2 issues, and it was their first encounter and took place in the present."
FlashTV,38syzp,argyle47,2,Sun Jun 7 18:08:54 2015 UTC,Yeah it did. They haven't really elaborated too much on what changed yet tho. But for one she was basically the spokesperson for Amanda Waller's JLA doing commercials and PSAs for them and stuff.
FlashTV,38syzp,Vacation_Flu,2,Sun Jun 7 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"Not at all. Convergence was a filler event that has no bearing or impact on the New 52. It was just set up because DC's moving its comic book operation from NYC to LA, so the editors were either too busy getting new jobs or moving to the west coast so they needed something to publish for 2 months, enter Convergence. So basically the post-crisis DC is still dead, it was only brought back temporarily as a treat for fans."
FlashTV,38syzp,argyle47,2,Sun Jun 7 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"Wrong.  Convergence brought back the Multiverse, thanks to Parallax Hal Jordan going back and stopping Crisis on Infinite Earths.  Now all the DC stories exist on their own Earths; New52 is on one Earth, Post Zero Hour on another, and so on.  New52 Garrick and the survivors of New52 Earth 2 (spoilers?) get to live on Telos and make it the New Earth 2.  http://www.comicvine.com/articles/spoiler-the-future-of-the-dcu-revealed-in-converge/1100-152401/"
FlashTV,38syzp,fullmetalkarz,3,Sun Jun 7 13:47:23 2015 UTC,"So, New 52 Earth has the Charlton heroes? Someone had said that there was a separate Earth for them at the conclusion of Convergence. What about Captain Marvel/Shazam/Captain Thunder and the Marvel Family? Someone had also said that there was Earth-S, for the Fawcett characters, like the old, old days, after Convergence. Jay Garrick...origin not hard water accident, now bestowed by Mercury?  Edit - Every time I take a break from comics, they go and do something like Zero Hour, Final Crisis, New 52, Convergence and I have to scramble. I was getting irked with just plain The 52."
FlashTV,38syzp,suss2it,6,Sun Jun 7 19:15:46 2015 UTC,Jay Garrick has a very Alex Ross feel to him.  I like it.
FlashTV,38syzp,overkill136,5,Sun Jun 7 20:45:02 2015 UTC,What struck me about the Kingdom Come Flash was that he essentially wasn't even human anymore. He didn't access the Speedforce; he was the Speedforce. Superman seemed positively human by comparison.
FlashTV,38syzp,pwrusr,3,Sun Jun 7 00:56:18 2015 UTC,Jay Garrick might be Henry Allen in a flashpoint style timeline in which Barry goes to jail and Henry changes his name to Jay and becomes the Flash.
FlashTV,38syzp,zaj209,6,Sun Jun 7 05:49:47 2015 UTC,Why would he change his name tho?

FlashTV,38vx77,Malibooch,17,Sun Jun 7 14:35:21 2015 UTC,"Yep! That was my boy Mark Hamill. He actually originally played the Trickster a long time ago, and that's what gave people the idea for him to play the Joker."

FlashTV,38vx77,suss2it,5,Sun Jun 7 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"Flash and Substance ! Great episode, that's one thing I really loved about the Flash.. He was a hero in the sense that he wasn't superman or batman, fighting thugs throwing them in jail. Flash literally wanted the Trickster to find help for his mental instability. Showing Orion and Bats Central City is HIS city and things are done a certain way here. Regardless if its Wally or Barry wearing the lightning bolt"
FlashTV,38vx77,ShlubbyWhyYouDan,3,Sun Jun 7 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"Love that episode! It also shows the respect Batman has always had for the kind of person Barry is. He embodies everything Batman wants to believe people can become. You'll notice he is one of the only characters Batman doesn't give shit.  I've had a hard time getting back into the N52 after the Death of the Family fiasco but I was really happy that they kept the same dynamic between Barry and Batman in the early issues. Batman gives every other justice league member crap about how they hero but complements Barry on his work.   Have I mentioned how much I love The Flash! Behind Invincible, It's my favorite superhero comic!"
FlashTV,38vx77,blackswanscience,2,Sun Jun 7 21:34:34 2015 UTC,"Hahahahaha! I'm glad someone sees that though. Sometimes I think im the only one that sees that type of development. Flash is the hero that if a villain killed him, it would literally send the JL into crazy beat down mode. Most of the JL has gone crazy, except the scarlet speedster, its why its such an offense, he's the hero everyone wants"

FlashTV,38vx77,broodwyn,54,Sun Jun 7 18:05:54 2015 UTC,Mark Mardon (Weather Wizard). He seemed like one of the bigger threats in the season. He caused Barry to run so fast that he time traveled. I loved that episode.
FlashTV,38vx77,walterpinkman45,12,Sun Jun 7 11:30:42 2015 UTC,And if somehow he loses his power he can just grab a sword and use his Gladiator training.

FlashTV,38vx77,LordErebus,17,Sun Jun 7 08:17:11 2015 UTC,"If the rogues become a major threat next season, Pied Piper helping flash fight them off similarly to Rogues Revolution would be amazing"
FlashTV,38vx77,Tvayumat,3,Sun Jun 7 08:28:11 2015 UTC,"Considering the worst thing he's done is attack the reverse flash, I think theres a lot of room for him to ""go hero"""

FlashTV,38vx77,frostyfrosty42,5,Sun Jun 7 17:30:45 2015 UTC,"Multiplex. I just loved his story and his powers. The way they made it apparent that he wasn't some criminal mastermind, just an angry man. Like his way of fighting is just to make as many of himself as necessary and gang up on his enemy without any skill at all  Plus his final fight where he made an army of himself run at the Flash at once is still one of my favorite scenes"
FlashTV,38vx77,WTFbeast,5,Sun Jun 7 08:41:37 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who liked mulitplex?

FlashTV,38vx77,F5001,5,Tue Jun 9 02:51:48 2015 UTC,I think what made that episode awesome was that Mark Hamill played trickster before in the previous flash serie if he didn't play trickster before i think i would find it less cool.
FlashTV,38vx77,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Tue Jun 9 06:43:37 2015 UTC,It was actually Eddie who reopened the black hole. Barry and the team stabilized the wormhole until eddie shot himself thus creating a paradox causing the wormhole to reappear as a blackhole.

He also runs a few successful charity campaigns promoting good causes, so he gives back to the community too.  (The guy's super active on Facebook, what can I say.)  Not only that, but Amell is also super active on social media (I mean really, really active,) so he's still more or less the face of the Arrowverse (He's really active on facebook, but he's got more followers than Gustin does on Twitter too.) Also, unless you've been willfully avoiding the Arrow Subreddit, you can't claim no one is speculating about Arrow S4.

There is still speculation about Season 4 but not as much because the season 3 finale almost felt like a series finale so it's hard to guess about what is going to happen next.  Stephen Amell is definitely still the face of DC television, no question. Amell has a fuck ton more followers on social media compared to Grant Gustin and with his role in TMNT 2 that gap will probably get bigger. The Flash may be taking some attention away from Arrow but Stephen Amell is still the face of the DC television universe."
FlashTV,38uv2u,Farmandor,13,Sun Jun 7 01:54:24 2015 UTC,"Amell has 896k followers on Twitter, Grant has 843k. Keep in mind Amell earned that over 3+ years/seasons of the show. Grant reached his after one season."
FlashTV,38uv2u,Sultank,21,Sun Jun 7 01:57:59 2015 UTC,"Amell isn't big on twitter, go check his Facebook page."
FlashTV,38uv2u,Farmandor,11,Sun Jun 7 02:12:33 2015 UTC,"And Grant isn't big on Facebook, so it's pretty pointless comparing the two."
FlashTV,38uv2u,Sultank,24,Sun Jun 7 02:44:10 2015 UTC,But this is the internet! We have to!
FlashTV,38uv2u,SutterCane,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:33:07 2015 UTC,"How is it pointless? My original point was that Amell has more of a social media following, and he does, regardless of what website we're talking about. You can't really argue it."
FlashTV,38uv2u,Farmandor,10,Sun Jun 7 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"a) Grant Gustin actually created his accounts before Stephen Amell so you're wrong on the first point. Granted Amell has been apart of the DC universe longer, but Grant was well known before Flash so it's not like he was an unknown back then. If you're simply referring to the time that they have been apart of the DC universe then you may have a point but Amell exploded on social media far quicker than Grant Gustin has.  b) I'm not sure I understand your point here? They're both on the same social media sites we've been tallking about. I understand it's two different platforms but it's hard to argue against close to 4 million followers, even if it is on Facebook only.  Lastly, how is it a worthless measure? I'd argue that the face of DC television is the more popular person, the person who is more well known and the social media followers is a good indication of who is more well known. Even if Grant Gustin is quickly growing in following, the question was who is the current face of DC television and right now that is clearly Stephen Amell."

FlashTV,38uv2u,ExynosHD,7,Sun Jun 7 09:29:42 2015 UTC,"Well they never gave us anything to speculate about the new Arrow season. Ending was wrapped up so nicely that they could literally do anything. The Flash is also one of the most popular superheroes while Green Arrow was always kind of a second rate vigilante so ofc it get very popular after just 1 season.  With all that in mind, I’m still bigger fan of Arrow than Flash, mainly because I freaking despise all-powerful superheroes who loose purely because they’re sloppy or because suddenly, they lost part of their powers or got strong headache and now they’re weak.  Also, with what we know about Stephen, I think he doesn’t really care who is more popular."
FlashTV,38uv2u,nuadarstark,14,Mon Jun 8 03:42:12 2015 UTC,They ended the season with him driving into the sunset with the girl. Can't hype too much when someone major is gonna have to die in the first episode of the season to get him back to the action.   Well that's my guess.

FlashTV,38uv2u,The_Bravinator,7,Sun Jun 7 04:03:50 2015 UTC,Stephen Amell is still the face of DCTV. None of these shows would be around if it werent for Arrow. The problem is Flash had a strong season against a weak 3rd season of Arrow. If Flash came out during season 1 or 2 of Arrow things would be different.
FlashTV,38uv2u,jesuthewise,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:09:26 2015 UTC,this.
FlashTV,38uv2u,Ispita,9,Sun Jun 7 12:14:51 2015 UTC,"Season one of Arrow had pretty similar reviews as Flash.  The show focused on the important things (Diggle and Oliver's relationship) and they hired actors who could act for most of the main roles instead of pretty-but-inexperienced leads(Welling Kruek), leaving the hard stuff for the talented supporting cast(Rosenbaum, Mack) , No one expected much from it, I think they were imagining campy Smallville, which ended a 10-year run not long before filming for Arrow began.  Arrow needed to be different, and darker, in order to differentiate itself and it accomplished that.  It had high praise, quite frankly, because the hero killed people.  It was more believable, and a change of speed to have someone doing things the wrong way and have his supportive friends fighting for his soul.  It also had John Fucking Barrowman."
FlashTV,38uv2u,raechan2012,3,Mon Jun 8 17:14:16 2015 UTC,"Why would I be sorry for him? (In fact, some say I'm the reverse...)  He had his time as the face of DCTV. He even has made comments that suggest he's okay with passing that torch to Grant. There shouldn't be just one face of DCTV all the time. Besides, the fans will always have a special place for Arrow. Well...seasons 1 and 2, anyway."
FlashTV,38uv2u,Keegman_99,14,Sun Jun 7 03:38:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised to be honest. From the get go I knew Flash would be a bigger deal. He's one of the biggest superheroes in the world, his show was always going to draw more attention than Arrow.   Couple that with the fact that the first season of Flash was amazing while Arrow was pretty awful for most people this year. Arrow has a lot of ground to catch up if it wants to contend with The Flash."
FlashTV,38uv2u,AlwaysPandemonium,11,Sun Jun 7 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"Arrow has a lot of ground to catch up if it wants to contend with The Flash.   I'd say S1 and S2 do a damn good job of keeping up with Flash. Of course the fact that the tone of the shows is completely different doesn't help make that comparison.  Anyway, shows usually always have one bad season where execution is shitty. They also usually have a good next season because they learned from the mistakes they made."
FlashTV,38uv2u,guccigoogle,4,Sun Jun 7 01:55:44 2015 UTC,"Anyway, shows usually always have one bad season where execution is shitty. They also usually have a good next season because they learned from the mistakes they made.   A lot of shows also have really bad seasons that just keep leading into worse and worse seasons until the show ends, and you can never tell what you're going to get until after the fact."
FlashTV,38uv2u,Patius,10,Sun Jun 7 03:08:08 2015 UTC,"Anyway, shows usually always have one bad season where execution is shitty. They also usually have a good next season because they learned from the mistakes they made.   In case you didn't read that the first time.   You can only play the ""but the first two season were good"" card for so long before you lose all credibility.   So a show loses all credibility during it's first bad season? Even when the ones before it were great? How long exactly have they been playing the  ""but the first two seasons were good"" card?   While Arrow struggles to regain its integrity, season 2 of Flash will probably blow it out of orbit and into obscurity.   You have no way of knowing what will happen next season. Arrow could give the fans what it wants by introducing Green Arrow, and Flash could get so lost in multiverses and time travel that it starts to make no sense. One season of a show does not define it's future."
FlashTV,38uv2u,guccigoogle,4,Sun Jun 7 07:37:03 2015 UTC,"Examples?   Breaking Bad S3 and The Walking Dead S2. Also Supernatural and Smallville.   I'm saying there's no real point of using how it was years ago to defend how it is now.  I said you can only use that as an excuse for so long before your argument loses all credibility.   And how long have we been using the ""but the first two seasons were good"" argument?    considering the writers aren't changing   Literally all of them are focusing on Supergirl and Berlanti is focusing on LoT. Remember why S3 of Arrow was bad? Because they moved on to the Flash.   nor have they acknowledged any criticisms of the show   Wasn't this your argument for why S4 of Arrow doesn't look bright?   focusing only on social media outlets and reviewers who sang their praises."
FlashTV,38uv2u,guccigoogle,4,Sun Jun 7 03:24:03 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed season 1 of x show. Therefore, every other season is going to be good.   Never said or implied that. Isn't that what you're doing by saying S2 of Flash will ""blow Arrow out of orbit and into obscurity.""   The writers of season 3 of Arrow aren't changing.   Dude, come on, if you get into an argument do your research. The writers of Arrow are changing next season.   the writers only acknowledged the positive receptions for the season, not the negative ones.   And this is different for the Flash how? In fact it's worse because there's almost no criticism about it's flaws. Specifically 21/23 episodes being Freak of the Week and the Wells plot taking a backseat to the Barry Eddie Iris love triangle."
FlashTV,38uv2u,guccigoogle,4,Sun Jun 7 03:27:24 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying what's more likely, the show continues on the path its on, or deviates entirely?   You can't really tell. The first two seasons of Arrow were great, but S3 was subpar.    The only thing that's changing is they're getting a new co-showrunner   Sorry, I had her job title confused. This is more important than a getting a new writer anyway, since she now has the final say in everything along with Marc.    The flaws are relatively tame in comparison?    90% of episodes being Freak of the Week is a pretty big flaw."
FlashTV,38uv2u,guccigoogle,2,Sun Jun 7 03:35:10 2015 UTC,I can't wait until we feel sorry for Amell and Grant once our boy Routh steals the spotlight. Then of course it's BVS baby!  Seriously though what's the point of a spinoff if it's not really good?

The guy has invested a lot of time trying to make fans happy in as many ways as possible, he's the ultimate hype man, and one of the most legendarily down-to-earth celebs on TV, and not by accident, either, he really puts a LOT of energy, money, time, and effort into being that kind of lead actor. The hardcore fans worship him and he busts his ass to be worthy of that praise.   Then, he's forced to try and keep that persona up, even though season 3 has been such a huge disappointment. I can't help but feel like Guggenheim really dicked him over. Stephen busts his ass to make as many fans as happy as humanly possible, hell, he practically dedicates every free moment he has to it, and then Guggenheim takes all of those happy fans Stephen brings to the table, and individually slaps them all in the face, basically making Stephen look like a jackass. The fans trusted him unconditionally as they followed him headlong into season three, only to have that trust betrayed by forces ultimately over Stephen's head, but the season's failure still reflects negatively on him despite the fact that he could not have prevented it."

I enjoy Flash more than Arrow because I think all things considered it's a better show, but don't pretend like the story has any more merit to it."
FlashTV,38uv2u,Sultank,3,Sun Jun 7 04:13:15 2015 UTC,"I enjoy both programs about the same, and I find the comparison between the 2 unfair.  People seem to forget that Flash is only as fast as his plot armor needs him to be. For a guy that can travel faster than Mach 1 (quite a high number) and is even able to snatch bullets out of the air from a standstill, for him to be taken down by comparison very slow people and effects makes very little sense.  The only guy who should be able to take him down realistically is that guy who controls the weather and can hit The Flash with a lightning bolt which travels way faster than Barry at his current stage of development. Having said that, he would still need to aim this lightning bolt at an extremely fast moving target, so even that slightly goes out the window.  Yes I know, I am talking about which superpower would beat the other using real world physics as a measuring stick."

Ugh I also think during that era he had his lackeys kidnap a woman and then have them do plastic surgery on her so she would look like Iris, weird shit.  I think this was written by Cary Bates, the most of what I remember from his stories os that he fucked up Eobard's name a lot. Like at one point he writes it as ""Eobard Thawnye"" and then has Eobard call himself  ""Adrian Zoom""."

If we're standing by the theory that the fight in 2024 is when they both travel back in time, then the newspaper proves that that is our barry. The Barry in the newspaper is our one, as in made-5-years-earlier-Barry. Meaning than when 2015 barry goes back in time, the Flash saying no to him is the 10 yearl older version of him."
FlashTV,38ut0w,jlowry71,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:03:23 2015 UTC,Isn't the TV Flash Universe operating on multiverse theory for time travel? So after the fight wit RF original time line Flash should have been able to return to his own time line unchanged.
FlashTV,38ut0w,hw66,5,Sun Jun 7 21:27:06 2015 UTC,"A few things about the whole back in time incident....  What always got me about this is Future-Flash travels back in time to stop Reverse Flash, who's on a quest to kill young Barry.  He saves young Barry, Reverse-Flash kills Nora Allen and somehow loses his connection to the speed force, and the Future-Flash isn't seen again. I've always assumed he ceased to exist (at least in this timeline) because I can't see him going back to the future when your arch-nemesis is presumably still back in the past (you don't know if he still has his powers or not) and he could take out younger self at any moment.  But the Future-Flash waving Barry off... that suggests to me that he has some pre-knowledge of what's to happen... he didn't freak-out seeing another Flash there... in fact 2-against-1 would've saved the day... no, he motioned the current-Flash to not interfere and then took off with young Barry, giving the Reverse-Flash the opportunity in his rage to kill Nora Allen. So is this meant to be and if the show continues on in seasons will we at some point revisit the scene of Nora Allen's death from the point of view of the future Flash?  The third was Eobard's idea for Barry to go back in time and save his mother, while he would be given the opportunity to return back to his time.  Technically if Barry had gone back in time and saved his mom the timeline would've been changed and all of the events in the first season wouldn't have happened and Eobard wouldn't have been stuck living out fifteen years in his past (our present). So the mere fact that Eobard had this plan meant it wasn't going to work and Barry was never going to change the past."
FlashTV,38ut0w,mutant6653,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:53:47 2015 UTC,"For the timeline that Barry traveled into the past from (i.e. the tsunami timeline), do we just assume everyone in Central City was wiped out since the ""wind wall"" would've collapsed because Barry was gone from that timeline?"
FlashTV,38ut0w,TheGreatTrogs,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:56:07 2015 UTC,That's very well thought out. Perhaps in The Flash's universe you can only change minor events while the larger ones are fixed and unchanging no matter what you do.

FlashTV,38vlk6,Thx4theFish42,5,Sun Jun 7 05:07:25 2015 UTC,I didn't dislike the first episodes but I think the show gets really better around 109. The rest of the season 1 is then very enjoyable IMO. I wouldn't compare the show with Daredevil though.
FlashTV,38vlk6,Airsay58259,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:25:32 2015 UTC,I'm comparing more with The Flash. I guess I mentioned Daredevil because I found it somewhat more similar to Arrow than to The Flash. What's your take on Daredevil? I liked it a lot but I liked Flash just as much for different reasons. Daredevil was an amazing drama for many reasons including making you feel sympathy for Fisk to some extent and for the amazing fight scenes. I think that The Flash and Daredevil are two completely different kinds of shows. The Flash is fantastic fun and has gotten me obsessed with superhero shows. Call me crazy but I prefer it to the dark Batman movies that I have also loved. It's just so much fun to watch.
FlashTV,38vlk6,Airsay58259,2,Sun Jun 7 05:42:07 2015 UTC,"Oh you're not crazy at all (or we both are), The Flash is my favorite live action comic books adaptation. Simply because they are really doing a comic books show and that's something I had never really seen before. It's fun, epic, cheesy at times and still manages to tell beautiful and tragic stories, just like comics. Other live actions tend to stick to one genre. I love the Batman trilogy as well and Arrow (which is more Batman than Green Arrow at times) but I absolutely don't feel that comic book vibe. I liked Daredevil as well. The fights, acting, directing... that was all amazing. And I agree about Fisk, they wrote him really well. Both him and Eobard Thawne became my favorite TV villains. Arrow has some really good villains as well, you'll see."

FlashTV,38vlk6,walterpinkman45,2,Sun Jun 7 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"Keep going. The first half of the season is a little rough, but the scone half of season one is good. Season 2 was fantastic, and season 3 was okay.   Daredevil has a much higher budget than Arrow and The Flash do, so the quality was expected to be better.  Also, The Flash is a much lighter show than Arrow is. If you expect Arrow to be light, you're in for disappointment."

After that the flashbackstory gets really interesting. Then season 2 is amazing the best season and season 3 is ok not as boring as S1 but no where near as fun as S2
FlashTV,38vlk6,TriumphantBass,2,Sun Jun 7 13:17:12 2015 UTC,"Seasons one starts off okay then gradually turns awesome, season two maintains that all the way through, and season three maintains that up until the back-half where you get some good episodes, some bad episodes, then an unsatisfying finale that clears most things up and sets the stage for the next season but also has very cringe-worthy plot points."
FlashTV,38vlk6,SunDragon1947,2,Sun Jun 7 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"How far into Arrow did you get?

FlashTV,38tvor,simsim28,4,Sun Jun 7 04:54:45 2015 UTC,Easily one of the greatest finales to any show Ive ever seen.

FlashTV,38tvor,KryptykZA,5,Sun Jun 7 03:10:48 2015 UTC,The acting was fantastic from everybody. The scene with Barry and his mom and eddie sacrificing himeself were all so good. I also liked all the teases like jay garrick and killer frost.
FlashTV,38tvor,Virus_CaRNaGe,3,Sun Jun 7 03:13:41 2015 UTC,jay garrick   Shit was based
FlashTV,38tvor,Virus_CaRNaGe,4,Sun Jun 7 03:14:23 2015 UTC,"That finale gave me blue balls.  There were a couple of things that were out of place (lol, a wedding) but there were some awesome moments, like Barry saying goodbye to his mom and of course the massive freaking wormhole (the best part, followed by the worst part... the credits!!!).  It has me really amped for season 2 as I literally have no idea where this leaves the story. Is it going to be another speedster / time traveller deus ex machina sorting out the problem? Is it going to be Barry running counter clockwise on a wormhole to reverse time (lol physics)? Is it going to be him entering the time stream and ending up in an alternate universe? So many potential outcomes that we can't guess, even knowing that most of the S1 cast will be in it."
FlashTV,38tvor,Virus_CaRNaGe,5,Sun Jun 7 07:15:56 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a bit underwhelming for me, I wanted a lot less drama in the finale. Come to think about it a lot of the shows I watch have had underwhelming finales. I just wish the final fight in Flash was longer than it was."
FlashTV,38tvor,quontemplation,4,Sat Jun 6 21:49:02 2015 UTC,Yeah the main fights have been a problem. I was just let down when I realized the one in E22 was about three minutes. Especially since that was supposed to be the major hype crossover.

Like, I doubt most people would even know who Caitlin or Iris are, let alone Eddie and it would make sense a shapeshifting criminal would turn into either one.   I mean, to an outsider, there are plenty of non-Flash reasons why those three appeared on the film. Caitlin is a doctor working for STAR Labs (maybe he broke in to find out more about his condition); Eddie is a cop (always a clean getaway, right?) and Iris works for a pretty prestigious newspaper."

One event related to the flash could be a coincidence, but two? Come on. Then they do a little research on her and honestly, it looks like she has 4 friends top. Eddie and Iris were on the film, it leaves Cisco and Barry to the cops as potential Flash.   Buuut.. Joe could say ""I'll do the research"" and make it go away.

FlashTV,38t0qk,TriumphantBass,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:32:21 2015 UTC,There's suspension of belief and then just practicality.   Eddie dates Iris who is also friends with Caitlin. So Everyman simply turned into form associated with Eddie Thawne. Then of course most cops would really recognize Caitlin. Sure she had that kidnapping a while ago but most aren't going to remember. The person who does is likely Joe(and he can lie).   Remember there are lot of people in the city. There are a lot of connections that could be made. And Outsider simply isn't going to make them based off that little bit of footage.

FlashTV,38q4f3,Teves3D,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that dislikes how they nerf the flash and put him on a much closer to equal standing with arrow? By comic book standards they shouldn't even be in the same league(no justice league pun intended lol). Year one flash in the comics never even got touched touched ONCE by a human the first year he had his powers. Heck, an adult superman struggled just to touch him, and Barry made him miss several times at that.  This also really makes me wonder how Green Lantern would be portrayed in this show if he was to appear. Green lantern rings have the ability to destroy entire planets and even have even shown the ability to hold back an entire star from exploding. So if green lantern was to appear, I'm guessing the writers would lower his power levels severely like they did to flash. But honestly I don't even know how they would reduce green lanterns power and still keep the integrity of the character. Are they gonna make it so human and bullets can break his constructs? Give his ring an extremely short charge? I mean even rookie Green Lanterns have planet busting ability, so I just don't see what they could do to reduce his powers.  Hopefully we get to see a version of Barry that is closer to comic level power in the coming seasons.I think it will be needed to help keep the authenticity of the DC universe and keep the show developing at a decent rate for future seasons."

FlashTV,38q4f3,TheWanderingN00b,3,Sat Jun 6 06:49:47 2015 UTC,Well Oliver has a two season headstart.

FlashTV,38q4f3,Reverse_Grodd,10,Sat Jun 6 09:17:36 2015 UTC,Oliver was pretty much the deciding factor in beating RF in their fight so I imagine it would be an equal fight
FlashTV,38q4f3,darraghyoung,2,Sat Jun 6 10:07:13 2015 UTC,"That was a three on one fight, though. I imagine that RF fighting them individually would have led to their deaths."
FlashTV,38q4f3,genchris,6,Sat Jun 6 10:39:47 2015 UTC,What I mean is that it was the nanites(?) that Oliver was using that cause the RF to be defeated by slowing him down. So Oliver could just use the same tech against Barry who is arguably weaker than Thawne.
FlashTV,38q4f3,darraghyoung,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:53:15 2015 UTC,Yes but barry is going to be stronger now without thawne siphoning the speedforce

FlashTV,38q4f3,AnAngryFetus,-1,Sat Jun 6 09:27:52 2015 UTC,That is kind of silly. If we go with the  current (end of season 1) Barry he'd easily take Oliver. Obviously if they were put in a fight against each other it'd likely be very close to not make Oliver seem useless.
FlashTV,38q4f3,PoundSake,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:40:57 2015 UTC,"How can you say that? You have literally nothing to go off of. You can't just say that oliver would be easily beaten, without something to back it up."
FlashTV,38q4f3,TheWanderingN00b,0,Sat Jun 6 10:48:07 2015 UTC,"Going off basic logic from the show. Flash can catch arrow, escape lightning and goes faster than bullets. Of course in the show his strength of powers is very inconsistent but if we are judging it by Barry at his maximum potential currently vs Oliver's maximum potential it just makes no sense for him to be able to beat Barry in a fight. What argument do you have for Oliver beating Barry apart from the argument that he beat him once which was in episode 8. Since Barry has been taught by Oliver about awareness which was Oliver's main advantage. You can't tell me I have literally nothing to go off when you have equally nothing apart from a previous fight they had when Barry was much less experienced."
FlashTV,38q4f3,PoundSake,2,Sat Jun 6 11:30:50 2015 UTC,"I'm going off of the fact that, people knew there would be a fight in episode eight, and everybody had the same outlook then that you have now. Speed isn't everything. If you read literally any comics, or watch any of the shows, it is clear that his speed is easily counteracted by villains and heroes alike."
FlashTV,38q4f3,TheWanderingN00b,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"Barry and Thawne in the show have been shown to be vulnerable to distractions (explosions, etc) which keep them from focusing on using their speed mentally, if that makes sense.   An arrow that barry catches which explodes could still stun him long enough for oli to use another arrow or try to knock him out.   Barry could also catch on and recover before Oli hits him again, or dodge the arrow.   But the point is there are options, and there's a chance for Oli given barrys weaknesses."
FlashTV,38q4f3,TyranosaurusLex,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"There was an episode where Barry grabbed a bullet behind him just before it ended his head while not looking at it. Once again, if we are going to the maximum potential of both characters the flash wins every time."

Even if Barry doesn't go to another Earth or something like that, he saw Caitlin in the future right? He doesn't know if she's evil of course (or he will just assume anyone with scary white eyes is evil and that wouldn't be cool because Firestorm has crazy eyes too!), but he knows she will be a metahuman and just that could lead to an interesting arc next season, with Caitlin (and the team) knowing her future and trying to prevent it somehow."

FlashTV,38ssxp,walterpinkman45,5,Sat Jun 6 15:36:40 2015 UTC,"To expand on your second point, in the finale, Eobard tells Barry that he went back and altered his past with an event so traumatic, he would never become the flash, but because there was no flash in that time line after future Barry left, he lost his powers."
FlashTV,38ssxp,Element1232,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"1) So this led him to ""create"" The Flash, but how does Barry help him get his powers back? From the thing that was under his wheelchair? Did that machine somehow let him tap into the Speedforce and get his powers back or something?  2) Similar to above, in Eobards timeline (future), how does he ""get his powers from Barry""?"
FlashTV,38ssxp,SerCaramel,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:54:31 2015 UTC,"Basically, all speedsters from the DC universe are powered by the ""Speedforce"". The Speedforce was created the moment Barry became the Flash and if I'm not mistaken, keeps the speedforce expanding.  Eobard's speed is powered by the ""Reverse Speedforce"", which siphons off the original Speedforce. Meaning: No Barry = No Flash = No Speedforce = No Reverse Speedforce = No Reverse Flash.  That's the reason why when Eobard went back to the past and made it so the Flash never existed, he did not take into account that the Speedforce would also cease to exist. Which is why he then proceeded to ""create The Flash himself""."
FlashTV,38ssxp,neoblackdragon,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:42:04 2015 UTC,I would put a hold on the Barry creating the Speedforce. This does not appear to be the case for the new52 universe. Same with the source of Eobards powers.

FlashTV,38oi6d,gr33ngiant,2,Fri Jun 5 15:43:30 2015 UTC,"There's really only 3 time lines atm.    The original, with the original Barry/flash, eobard/RF, wells as wells, Barry's mother alive.   What I like to call the wells time line. Eobard kills Barry's mom(still on original time line just another path) once eobard kills wells and takes over his body he now creates an entirely new timeline that he himself becomes the maker of the flash.  All current episode events.   Barry goes back after stopping the tsunami and Cisco dies.  But this path re converges with the 'Wells' timeline(2) after Barry and Cisco change what caused the previous errors.    So essentially timeline 2 and 3 are separate but also become one after Barry and Cisco change their actions from the previous line.  All of the current events are happening on the 'wells' time line.  Which is why when Eddie kills himself, the wells timeline then has its paradox in Eddie never having eobard(through the generations) and thusly how Barry was made the flash on the current 'Wells' timeline.  The black hole opens and tries to correct its paradox of eddies death and Barry's current flash form.  When 'wells' Barry goes back to the original timeline and sees his future original Barry tell him not to stop his mothers death, that's all during the original time line.  Barry's mother living or dying doesn't change how the flash became the flash.  What creates an entirely new timeline('wells' timeline) is eobard taking over wells and jump starting that process.  What will be interesting to see is if Eddie being sucked up and Barry running into the black hole fixes the paradox.  If it does and it sends Barry into the past on his current wells time line.  He can then stop Eddie from killing himself and the paradox from ever happening.  Or he would just let eobard leave and not crazy punch his little hover ship.  Or still smash it and go on and infinite loop until he figures out how to defeat wells at that current time or finally get over his anger and just let him go."

FlashTV,38p91j,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,13,Fri Jun 5 18:29:12 2015 UTC,"I hope real Wells appears but Reverse Flash also has Wells' appearance too. Also while Real Wells might be good, there's nothing that says he can't some secrets of his own and maybe even a dark side (he is a genius, after all, most of them seem to have big egos). I imagine a lot of the time Eobard was with Team Flash he was channeling a lot of Well's personality he had absorbed which made his disguise feel more genuine. So we could have Barry dealing with a man who ""looks"" like the man who killed his mother but in reality is just a relatively good guy who is trying to help him."
FlashTV,38p91j,DornishMasterPlan,15,Fri Jun 5 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"I actually like the idea of him playing both characters, especially a more cynical Wells than we saw in the flashback.

I would hope they don't go that route because it would feel like sort of a rehash, Wells hiding things from the team. If we see any of real Wells on this show again, I hope he continues to be genuinely nice, humble, excitable nerd we saw in ep 17.    I imagine a lot of the time Eobard was with Team Flash he was channeling a lot of Well's personality he had absorbed which made his disguise feel more genuine.    This I don't think is true at all. Tina specifically said in ep 19 that Wells personality changed completely after the car accident, far beyond what could be explained by grief alone."
FlashTV,38p91j,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:15:20 2015 UTC,The writers did say that there was a deleted scene from the finale in which Eobard explains that when he absorbed Wells's appearance he also absorbed a bit of his personality.

Even after the finale the producers were mum on Tom Cavanagh's role next season.   Edit: Is this what you are talking about? Because according to this article on comicbookmovie.com he's talking about the rest of season 1.    Kreisberg went on to confirm that both the real Harrison Wells and Eobard Thawne (played by Matt Letscher) will return before the season ends: ""You'll be seeing more of the original Harrison Wells, you'll be seeing more of Matt Letscher as Eobard Thawne, and more of Tom as Eobard Thawne."""
FlashTV,38p91j,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Sat Jun 6 12:43:32 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't real Wells be a possibility? Now that Eobard has been ""deleted"", it's possible that the timeline is adjusted just enough that he never killed real Wells."

FlashTV,38p91j,OmegaX123,2,Sat Jun 6 04:21:58 2015 UTC,"That is part of my reasoning, but there are story reasons I don't see it working as well. I can't see them rolling back the clock and having Harrison Wells live. Despite Eobard being erased from existence in the season finale, I can't see the producers actually unwinding all the events of the first season. In addition to just screwing with fans' heads, it would also mean Nora is alive and it would basically negate many of the emotional moments of the first season.  Also, the Grodd episode had a significant buildup of Barry and the team questioning whether they could do what they do without ""Wells"" and I think it would be a shame to bring real Wells in, just when the team was gaining confidence on their own."
FlashTV,38p91j,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,74,Sat Jun 6 12:41:55 2015 UTC,"He's not a Merlyn-esque character. OG Wells is a normal, good guy. He's never even met Cisco, Caitlin, or Barry. It will be a very interesting dynamic."

FlashTV,38p91j,Vinnie_Vegas,7,Fri Jun 5 22:14:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think Merlyn was ever an absolute good or absolute bad guy. His motivation for destroying the Glades was messed up, but it had probably stronger reason to it than any other motivation the other villains had. (Like Slade's complaining about Shado when we barely saw the two interact, or Ras Al Wingman)   The only thing Merlyn seems honest about is that there's a part of him that cares about Thea. But his selfishness takes over more than his care about her (or he wouldn't use her as a pawn to get out of his death threat from Ras), and even though he helped Oliver a lot in Season 3, it was all under a motivation to take over the League again."

FlashTV,38p91j,MyL1ttlePwnys,11,Fri Jun 5 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"EP Andrew Kriesberg   We got a brief glimpse of Matt Letscher before Reverse Flash fizzled out. Will he be a part of the show moving forward?  Yeah. We hope so. Greg [Berlanti] and I both worked with Matt on Eli Stone. We’re friends. We’re such huge fans. The idea of Eobard Thawne having essentially stolen Harrison Wells’ body was an idea that we came up with midstream. That wasn’t always part of the conception. What’s wonderful about it is now it allows us to have two tremendously talented actors both playing the same villain. When the Reverse Flash returns, the face that’s underneath the hood can be one of two faces now."
FlashTV,38p91j,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Fri Jun 5 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"Depending on what timeline the show is in, it can be either one under the cowl...I like it, because as Barry screws around with the time line more and more, people will be good or bad on a week to week basis.  We already know an ""original"" timeline had the good Wells going as if nothing happened and Barry still became the Flash, but who knows what ripples in time will create?"
FlashTV,38p91j,your_mind_aches,6,Fri Jun 5 21:04:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great benefit to the show and the audience with the way they've set this up. By starting the show in the middle of a long feud from Eobard's perspective you enable the show to have the same villain appear with two different dynamics with Barry. Having him take on another man's appearance at the middle of this event  helps the audience differentiate the two.   At some point, probably soon, we will start to see Barry and Eobard's feud start from Eobard's perspective and then as the seasons go on we can see what led them to a point where Eobard wanted to kill Barry as a child. Meanwhile the older Eobard with Wells appearance can continue the feud in his on way, while having a very different relationship with Barry. It will help prevent the RF from becoming a stale villain despite what will likely become frequent appearances on the show."
FlashTV,38p91j,shakuyi,2,Fri Jun 5 21:37:44 2015 UTC,":o Awesome!  Like Oliver and Slade somewhat, but much much longer"
FlashTV,38p91j,Hpfm2,2,Fri Jun 5 22:03:17 2015 UTC,This can actually bring to some really good conflict in the show.  Like imagine they start season 2 and Barry is back and there is the real Wells sitting there trying to help him.  Barry would probably lock him up right away or have lots of conflicting feelings with who he was.  He grew up with the man who turned out to be his biggest enemy no one would just drop those feelings.  He could be legitimately trying to help him but why bother listening to the man who looks like the person who killed your mother?  Having the different actors play different roles will actually make this show a lot better.  I remember when Fringe started exploring parallel universes the show took a crazy turn with different situations in different worlds.  It's all about surprises here and I am actually excited to potentially see the real Wells stick around for a little while.
FlashTV,38p91j,KryptykZA,2,Fri Jun 5 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"Here's what I've been thinking to myself. If we're really going to a paralel earth, as it seems like we're going, Cavanagh could be playing Wells in this Earth. Now, I know this is the most popular and believed theory. but hear me out.  Obviously barry will not trust wells. Barry will investigate. Try to see if things don't add up. Eventually he'll be conviced that this guy really is Wells. And just when that happens... BAM PLOT TWIST TURNS OUT HE WAS THE REVERSE FLASH TOO"
FlashTV,38p91j,Hpfm2,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:03:55 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking along the same lines.  It would also be super weird having Wells doing an entire season out of the wheelchair, having become used to him being in it for most of the show so far.  It's so nice not knowing where the series is headed. We can have reasonable stabs at it, but as it stands we don't know if it will be Earth2 or if Barry ends up saving Earth1. I feel that the writers may have constraints in this regard, as wiping the slate clean from a character development point of view may disrupt some of the more...simple viewers. It has been done before and has generally not been well received. I loved Fringe, but it seems it dropped off in viewership once they started exploring parallel worlds.  I trust the writers for this show to do a good job of whatever they do on the show. Alternate timelines can be good if done right, I just hope it's not to the show's detriment (cos we all know that ratings = show's lifespan)."
FlashTV,38p91j,KryptykZA,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:28:15 2015 UTC,The fact that this show shares continuity with Arrow (and the upcoming Legends of Tommrow) gives me all the hope I need that Earth-1 (if we choose to call it that) will continue to exist in it's current form.
FlashTV,38p91j,Cavmo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:30:54 2015 UTC,"This is what I meant by character development - to wipe the slate clean would be a waste of season 1 (and wouldn't forgo the tie ins to other shows).  I suspect we may see Barry get in to the time stream and go back just enough to prevent the paradox from happening, which may give us Wells back in RF goodness."
FlashTV,38p91j,Huntersteve,2,Sat Jun 6 14:41:20 2015 UTC,"I hate to be that guy, but...source on cavanagh coming back? I saw the imdb page, but that's not 100% accurate."

FlashTV,38p91j,gridpoint,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:31:14 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to give the real Wells a different path. I hope they don't make Wells a main villain. Barry might change things enough to keep Wells alive but not save the wife.  Writing him as a man who has a complex relationship with Barry would fuel an interesting dynamic.  He's not an evil man like Thawne, but he also doesn't like or trust Barry.  Relationship dynamics between all of the characters really defined the best parts of the show. After season two sorts out its immediate perils, it will need another foundation to carry them forward with more than a freak-of-the-week.  Caitlin, Cisco and Barry (of our timeline) have an established relationship, and are rudderless without a clear leader. Barry can try to convince the real Wells that the team needs him, and perhaps Wells might need them too."

FlashTV,38n5fm,Gerry-Mandarin,5,Fri Jun 5 14:51:41 2015 UTC,There should be. I dunno if DC does the same style of mega collection but you can definitely buy the trades for Flash.
FlashTV,38n5fm,Lupin_AAGL,5,Fri Jun 5 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"As somebody said below, Geoff Johns Flash run is collected in two omnibus formats. Those are his Wally books. If you want to read anything about Barry, check out the New 52 Flash, the first four trades. Then you'll want to eventually dive into The Flash: Dastardly Death of the Rogues for a solid Barry Allen story, and then of course Flashpoint (although I recommend you check out the animated movie, Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox instead, as its easier to understand and is more focused imo)  Finally, if you want good Flash books, the man who wrote the greatest Flash books of all time is Mark Waid. He doesn't have an omnibus yet (possible bad blood) but this is where to go for great Wally West reading. The invention of Speedforce as a concept, Bart Allen aka Impulse aka the second Kid Flash is also introduced in his run, and is fantastic. A pretty well known fact is that the best Flash stories of all time are in fact about Wally West, as his era of writing was more character based than Barry's previous years (and even now to an extent, as they've leached quite a bit off of Wally to make Barry more interesting) so if you want to enjoy Flash, its going to be a) by Mark Waid and b) Wally West.  Everything I've already listed is the essential Barry Allen reads, but this list should be everything you need for good Wally reads (and in general, the best Flash reads)  http://imgur.com/FGEYBc9  Welcome to comics!"

The absolute best starting point would be Barry's OG stuff from the 60's or the first 4 trades of the new 52. However, the best Flash reading of all time is Mark Waid's Flash run, which starts in issue 62 of Flash volume 3. Mark Waid's run is absolutely brilliant, and if you want to know about Speedforce, Eobard Thawne, and Bart Allen aka Impluse aka the second Kid Flash, start reading here. The first story is Born to Run, Wally's updated origin, and it informs everything you need to know about Barry Allen as well. It's from issues 62 to 159, and its great, its all on comixology.

FlashTV,38pq20,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Sat Jun 6 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that Flash Rebirth and Flashpoint are not a good place for fans only familiar to the show to start, but neither is Geoff Johns Flash. There's too much history and way too different from the show in base characters to start there.   New 52 or Barry's original run is the only place to start if you want no backstory"
FlashTV,38pq20,Hpfm2,3,Fri Jun 5 20:16:40 2015 UTC,Johns Flash mostly explains it though. You don't need to know the history to understand what's happening for the most part. Johns run definitely has story over continuity.

Heck, maybe the person the OP is texting is a friend they know in person.  It has taken on a new meaning over the last decade, but haven't you ever made a reference to something that, among certain people is a joke but to those unaware, it sounds REALLY strange? Just yesterday I was talking with coworkers who said they don't know what the Pentagon actually does or what's kept inside. I said it's a mega prison for a super villain back in the 70s.

FlashTV,38l52n,Huntersteve,-1,Fri Jun 5 06:16:26 2015 UTC,"no, IRL simply means In Real Life.  the friends you interact with face-to-face are your IRL friends, but any conversation that is facilitated with a computer or mobile device is not an IRL conversation. if the posts title was ""when you make a Flash reference with your IRL friends..."" I wouldn't have an issue. ideally you know most or all of your facebook friends IRL, but a Facebook Messenger chat is no more an IRL conversation than a twitter back-and-forth. how well you know the person you're conversing with does not change the nature of the conversation. and is ""not online"" really as unambiguous as you seem to believe? an average iPhone user can effotlessly flow from facebook to twitter to SMS to kik, and they're all the same kinds of conversation; the technological difference of one of them using phone signals exclusively and the others usually using internet connection is fairly arbitrary, especially with apps that use the internet for SMS (and even phone calls) becoming more and more common.  I'm perfectly willing to admit that it might just be that I'm out of touch, but I can't shake the feeling that what's really happening is that some people are so invested in maintaining a technological boundary between themselves and their ""friends"" that the idea of what is and isn't ""real"".  when I started using the internet heavily in the early 90s, if you met someone online and struck up a serious enough friendship that you wanted to meet, you were thrilled at the idea of finally talking to them IRL. referring to a SMS conversation as ""IRL"" pretty much strips the significance away from the term, and feels like a huge fucking step backwards."

It just felt like they would be an amazing band in a smaller venue... like a House of Blues. something under 5,000 people. They just didn't have the energy or gravitas to pull off an arena show to 17,000 people.  A festival may work well if it's at a venue with no seats... I think that contributed to the lack of feeling when I saw them."

FlashTV,38o7l6,Virus_CaRNaGe,2,Fri Jun 5 21:37:09 2015 UTC,Yeah me too but not that slow. I don't mind a slow pace but it has to move the story forward at least a little bit. I just finished 507 though and enjoyed it a lot so I'm excited to see 508 (in about 4 seconds).

I'm ready for the actual ""song of ice and fire"" (but of course the journey was important as well).   Even in the non filler episodes, they still managed to put a lot of filler scenes. 122 was epic but as a penultimate episode I expected the main villain to be the main focus, not Prison Break 2.0. Smallville had its flaws, but the last 2 or 3 episodes of a season were really connected to the main plot."

FlashTV,38o7l6,Biggorons_Blade,2,Sat Jun 6 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"I just watched episode 23 of this series.  Why couldn't Thawne just run and create a wormhole for himself instead? Why did he need a time machine to get back to his timeline? Couldn't he have just entered the wormhole that Barry created? If he could, why did he waste time fighting barry, and not just run into the wormhole when barry got back? Why didn't Eddie just shoot Thawne when Thawne wasn't looking, like batman did in the Flashpoint Paradox?"
FlashTV,38o7l6,diamondDNF,2,Fri Jun 5 21:33:00 2015 UTC,"Barry already clarified this: Thawne's speed randomly disappears at times, he gets it in spurts and he can't control when he gains or loses it, hence why he was using the wheelchair to charge himself up. I'd assume if he ran into the wormhole and his speed ran out/went on the blink something horrible would happen or he'd be stuck in time-limbo. Which is probably why time-travellers like Rip Hunter use the time-sphere's. It's a protective/regulative measure.   Shooting speedsters in The Flash universe, even when they're distracted, is pointless. Remember when Barry was fighting Peek-A-Boo and her boyfriend tried to shoot Barry in the neck? He was fast enough to catch the bullet."

The flash can snatch a metahuman in a second, but no flash is gonna stop and talk to them, and we are gonna win against that metahuman in 30 minutes of the show. I know some people justify this as - Barry has a lot of going on, but like come on, not 20 fucking times, and no backup plans etc...)  3. Legend of Korra (haven't seen the last season, but the first few seasons sucked balls, that's why)"

FlashTV,38m071,SuperBattleFranky37,6,Fri Jun 5 11:59:33 2015 UTC,I think the action peaked in the 3rd season and the 4th season was just a long epilogue for us to say say goodbye to the show.

But, I did hang in there and by the time Captain Cold showed up, I was like...""yeah, this is fucking awesome"".   I say give it a chance and you won't be disappointed.

Professor Zoom himself is the engine that generates this Negative Speed Force with every step that he runs. He used it to infect Barry Allen in the hopes that the Negative Speed Force would consume Barry's loved ones and other speedsters who rely on it, consuming Barry in grief so that he'd merge with the Speed Force. Professor Zoom is currently being kept immobile in Iron Heights Penitentiary to prevent him from generating the Negative Speed Force. However, Hunter Zolomon (the most recent Zoom) is kept in the next cell, and believes working together they can be even more powerful, which may be bad news for both Central and Keystone Cities.

FlashTV,38p4ko,machine_pun,5,Fri Jun 5 17:55:09 2015 UTC,"I recommend these stories to everyone that wants to read The Flash. I hope this helps!  First off, you have to know that there have been four people that have taken on the mantle as The Flash. They are Jay Garrick (40s-50s), Barry Allen (50s-80s, 2010-now), Wally West (80s-2010), and Bart Allen (06-07).  The two that get the most recognition are Barry Allen and Wally West. Here are some recommendations:   Barry Allen: Most of his stories are from the 50s-80s and I haven't read any of those. Just know that he sacrificed himself during Crisis on Infinite Earths and go from there.   Flash: Rebirth: This is the reintroduction of Barry to the DC Universe. It's a fantastic story and I highly recommend it. It features the Flash Family (Jay Garrick, Wally West, Bart Allen, Jesse Quick, and Max Mercury).  Dastardly Death of the Rogues: This comes right after Rebirth and Blackest Night(Green Lantern story) but it is still a Flash story. Rogues from the future come back to try and arrest Barry. It's a very fun story and I recommend it. Flashpoint: Probably the best Flash story I've ever read IMO. Major time travel consequences. If you watch the show, then you'll understand this story.  New 52 Flash series: After Flashpoint, DC did a reboot on a majority of the characters, and The Flash was one of them. This will retell the origin story of Barry Allen and explore his time as The Flash. It's a great story, and the artwork is phenomenal.   Wally West: Former Kid Flash, turned The Flash. He becomes The Flash right after the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.   Read this list in order to get a good taste of Wally West. I read a good majority of that list and got a good understanding of the character.  Have fun reading!"

It's super hard to run a show by yourself no matter how creative you are. He had to do all the shit by himself so the show stumbled a bit  But Guggenheim is responsible for Olicity!!! No, not at all. Amell confirmed the ending of season three was decided before season 2 ended, so when Berlanti and Kriesberg were still on. They also talked at length at comic con about Olicity. Kriesberg gave an interview in september where he said that season 3 would be the ""olicity season"".   I'm disappointed that everyone is just assuming everything is Guggenheim's fault. He's done good shit. So I hate that there are so many posts that are just like ""lol Fuck Guggenheim amiright""."

FlashTV,38j5qh,americanhardgums,12,Thu Jun 4 17:15:44 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I feel like Moffat is another writer with great ideas but needs a more authoritative presence to stop him from going overboard. The quality of Doctor Who has got worse and worse each season after Russell T. Davies left (although it has since picked up with the introduction of Peter Capaldi as the Doctor).  Moffat wrote Don't Blink under Davies, but since Davies left there have been several episodes that make use of the Weeping Angels (not sure if Moffat wrote all episodes with Weeping Angels or if other writers have been involved). This has, imo, ruined them as a truly scary villain because there is too much backstory for the creatures."

I love comedy, I watch it all day, I listen to it all day, I read it all day. the recaps you see on reddit are terrible. not just flash, game of thrones too. I think I understand, it's like, when your friends are funny you laugh, but if the professionals were as funny as your friends you'd hate that show, because in the grand scheme your friends aren't that funny.   this reddit likes the in-house recaps, but they're not funny on a larger scale than that.

These posts appeal to a teenage sense of humor. That's not to say they're juvenile, they're just... raw. Chuckle humor, not belly laughs. The humor lacks the cutting edge I prefer.   I'm a big stupid jerk for hating on this and I feel bad for that, I just thought it was funny that you thought I was implying that you have an immature sense of humor because... you're literally immature. I mean, hell yea you do, you have every right to. Rable rable. The word scrotum is funny, no matter what."

FlashTV,38m6eg,mirulezs,4,Fri Jun 5 02:57:36 2015 UTC,"First off, you have to know that there have been four people that have taken on the mantle as The Flash. They are Jay Garrick (40s-50s), Barry Allen (50s-80s, 2010-now), Wally West (80s-2010), and Bart Allen (06-07).  The two that get the most recognition are Barry Allen and Wally West. Here are some recommendations:   Barry Allen: Most of his stories are from the 50s-80s and I haven't read any of those. Just know that he sacrificed himself during Crisis on Infinite Earths and go from there.   Flash: Rebirth: This is the reintroduction of Barry to the DC Universe. It's a fantastic story and I highly recommend it. It features the Flash Family (Jay Garrick, Wally West, Bart Allen, Jesse Quick, and Max Mercury).  Dastardly Death of the Rogues: This comes right after Rebirth and Blackest Night(Green Lantern story) but it is still a Flash story. Rogues from the future come back to try and arrest Barry. It's a very fun story and I recommend it. Flashpoint: Probably the best Flash story I've ever read IMO. Major time travel consequences. If you watch the show, then you'll understand this story.  New 52 Flash series: After Flashpoint, DC did a reboot on a majority of the characters, and The Flash was one of them. This will retell the origin story of Barry Allen and explore his time as The Flash. It's a great story, and the artwork is phenomenal.   Wally West: Former Kid Flash, turned The Flash. He becomes The Flash right after the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.   Read this list in order to get a good taste of Wally West. I read a good majority of that list and got a good understanding of the character.  I hope this helps! Have fun reading!"

That's what I did when I went to get my tattoo done, and I haven't regretted it for a second.  My advice is to simply gather some images to use as a reference, like the pic you linked, then find the right artist for you and let them work their magic. :)"

So you're probably better off getting a good quality pick of the flash suit you want, and showing them the spiderman tattoo.  Not sure if you or your husband have gotten tattoos before, but a large color one like that will be expensive if the artist is any good, so make sure you see some of their completed work to make sure you get your money's worth."

Lol we usually find a picture we like and give to an artist for them to go on but since there wasn't any of the flash like this,  thought I'd ask.

Eobard then dips out knowing that something had to have gone wrong for this to happen. Eddie gets pissed that he wasn't the hero, starts his descent of jealousy of Barry, starts his journey towards Cobalt blue. What happens after that, i dont really know, maybe with Barry coming back through the wormhole it actually further effects Cisco making his powers more noticeable, affects caitlin, and also effects eddie, say he gets knocked over into the cobalt pieces or a piece from the paradox timeline flies into him.

And throughout the episode/first few episodes of the season (/the entire season if they reaaaally love their flashbacks like Arrow) , we learn what happened 5 months ago. A little trip to another timeline/universe or someone from the black hole visiting ours, the aftermath of the black hole for the city and the team, how and why Wells is there, Cisco dealing with his new abilities, Barry telling Caitlin about her future, Iris right after losing Eddie...    I feel like they'll want to go back to the light and funny show really quickly and I don't see that happening if we start exactly where season 1 stopped. Barry just let his mother die, Iris lost Eddie... And it would also mean dealing with the black hole really fast because I'm pretty sure they are planning on doing weekly villains again.

It's possible, though highly unlikely, that the writers themselves handle these... It's far more likely that occasionally they send stuff to the Social Media Manager to post and the rest of the time, it's the job of the SMM to gather information and content to post or to come up with ""funny"" banter, like what you see above.  oh yeah...

FlashTV,38cfe6,DarthTauri,4,Wed Jun 3 19:13:33 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get too excited for a Supergirl crossover yet. I watched the pilot and the show needs a lot of work. It's not terrible, but it was way too much like a non-parody version of SNL's Black Widow trailer. The SFX were pretty rad though. Even if they did cross over, it would need to be an inter-dimensional thing because Superman has existed for many years in the world of Supergirl, which would be... very problematic for the continuity of the CWverse, to put it mildly. The only thing I can realistically see them doing with it at this point is a special event crossover with Legends of Tomorrow since time travel is a major part of the show, which is basically a fraction of an inch away from full-on dimension hopping."

FlashTV,38f33d,drproximo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:25:11 2015 UTC,"Very true. I was looking at it more from a writer's perspective of calling him zoom. If they had them call him zoom, when they were using the name of the original RF, then when they brought in Hunter Zolomon, they would be forced to call him RF. This of course would make no sense.   From your point though of Cisco popping in with ""What should we name him? How about Zoom! Nah, Wells already called himself RF we can't rename him.(or some shit idk. I'm not a writer)"" could work, and even be a good lead in to Hunter Zolomon one day."

FlashTV,38d1sr,McWitt19,3,Wed Jun 3 13:43:44 2015 UTC,"My take on this is that in the corrected history of things, Eobard never existed and Eddie just committed suicide. We just know better because we are watching this TV show with a God's eye view, but to those people who do not retain memories from a precious timeline (i.e. Everyone Not Barry or Cisco) Eddie committed suicide in the particle accelerator for no reason. I'm sure the spin would be that the stress from being framed by Everyman earlier for killing those two cops drove him to kill himself."

I still don't understand why Eobard would tell Eddie at all, if he wanted Eddie to stay on the right path then telling him Iris marries Barry should've been enough. Dragon ball never really handled plot holes well but at least they said time travel created a parallel universe and that's why they can't go back in time again to just fix it."
FlashTV,38d1sr,krispness,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"The fact that they can all still remember who Eobard was even after Eddie killed himself, thus removing his existence from that timeline might be explained by the portal and singularity which may act as a ""temporal displacement shelter"". I saw an episode of Star Trek that suggested how individuals can be protected from chnages in a timeline. As for Eobard, he may not have been removed from existence, but just from this alternate-timelined universe."
FlashTV,38d1sr,grafxguy1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:05:34 2015 UTC,"I think there was a timeline were Barry's mother was still alive, and he still become the Flash.  After Eobard killed Barry's mom he already removed himself from his own timeline, and was now existing in an alternative one.  Now the Eobard of this timeline may have eventually traveled back in time too, but Eddie shooting himself shouldn't have had any effect of this Eobard because he was already from an alternative timeline.  If Eddie has shot himself at any other time I think it would have had no effect on Eobard, but given that the space-time continuum was extra sensitive at that moment given the hole that had just been ripped in it, and Eddie being so close to his ancestor from an alternative timeline it was enough to rip the hole back open, and cause Eobard to dissolve into the Speedforce."
FlashTV,38d1sr,Justice_Prince,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"Barry would likely have become the Flash anyway. As shown in the Pilot episode, when he was a kid he tried to protect a boy that was being bullied - even though he got beat up.

FlashTV,38cydb,leithbeast,16,Wed Jun 3 12:26:27 2015 UTC,"Gotham was never meant to be a super hero show in reality. Its a crime detective show contained in the universe.

FlashTV,38cydb,DrakenZA,38,Wed Jun 3 18:21:13 2015 UTC,"From my point of view, The Flash succeeds because it immediately gives you exactly what you want: the suit, time travel, the speedforce, even a giant bloody gorilla. Gotham lacks the ability to do this: it is a prelude to Batman, but will never truly be Batman, until maybe the last episode IF that. It serves to develop his allies and rouges gallery, but they will never really reach the craziness that Batman actually is, where the villains fully embody their comic book counterparts. On top of this development and building towards the something that will never truly be achieved, Gotham seems to have generally weaker writing and sloppier storylines, and these put it far behind The Flash in overall quality*  *OPINION PIECE"

FlashTV,38cydb,WildGrass,8,Wed Jun 3 21:18:18 2015 UTC,"Well, most of the characters are in the show because of their relationship to Batman, except maybe for Fish.  Or their relationship to other Characters who have a closer relationship to Bruce, it all radiates from Bruce, who is the hub, even if he is not in it much. I agree with people who say that Gordon is the main protagonist, but he is still only there because he is Jim Gordon, from Batman. There is not much focus on the various nonentities living in the city. But this is not Gotham sub. op asked why ""Gotham got it so wrong?"" I don't even know if I agree with this statement, The Flash without Barry would probably be worse than Gotham without Bruce."
FlashTV,38cydb,bpurebvigilantbhave,2,Wed Jun 3 15:15:44 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with this. There is no denying that most of them have relationship with Batman, but Batman isn't born yet. They are there because of their relationship to Gotham City.  Penguin come back to Gotham because he loves Gotham. ""Gotham is my home"" He could have gone anywhere but Gotham is most likely to get him kill. Gordan have a pretty impressive resume but he decided to stay in Gotham to clean up because of who he is. Don Maroni is dead. Falcone decided to leave Gotham because he can't stand it anymore.   They are in this show because of their relationship to Gotham. Its just Batman is too big and it is very difficult to not think of him."
FlashTV,38cydb,WildGrass,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:21:03 2015 UTC,Everyone doesn't know everyone. Many characters exist without knowledge of the other. And why would they not exist in gotham prior to Batman?
FlashTV,38cydb,Jack-so-Slack,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:01:21 2015 UTC,"I was speaking broadly to make a point, but there are many relationships that have previously been depicted as existing before the Adult Batman story lines, such as Gordon and Bruce, and others such as Gordon and the cops and the crims that are logical extrapolations, but many others have been created, maybe forced a bit, maybe a bit too much, that is a matter of opinion, if people don't like these slightly forced relationships that were previously never mentioned, then they might squirm bit in Gotham. I enjoy the show, I was trying to answer ops question, to see what they might have got wrong, if anything. The real thing that they got wrong is a conspicuous lack of Barry Allen! Doctor Wells! and Cisco! also Season one Felicity and Deathstroke."
FlashTV,38cydb,bpurebvigilantbhave,12,Thu Jun 4 00:49:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't really get into Gotham. I like their Gordon and their Bullock, but I never got into the show.    I think part of the difficulty is that many of the characters are set up to make this huge nudge nudge wink wink say no more by referencing Batman villains, but we aren't ever going to see Batman.    They present this huge caricature of the characters that aren't already villains that it makes it almost unenjoyable.    Penguin as a villain makes sense and he is presented well, and so was Zsasz  (though the actor was better in the Flash IMO) but I hate that Ed Nygma already speaks in riddles but isn't overly evil (I only watched about 5 episodes before jumping ship).    The Gotham version of Alfred also has many more wild emotions than any version I've seen and it unsettles me.    I know most of these are more personal gripes, but I think overall Gotham is attempting to be more than it is.    They want to reference all these comics and still create a compelling, real-feeling story. It's a cop procedural wearing half a bat cowl.    The Flash is fun, and it realizes that it is a show about people with powers. It's a show with heroes. The nods to the larger DCverse are either much more blatant or much more subtle, and they don't seem to have the need to reference people's names when they give the wink and nod.    I think the Flash has been well thought out as an entity (and isn't attempting to reimagine the source material too much) while Gotham is trying too hard to be both new and old."
FlashTV,38cydb,bored_not_working,7,Thu Jun 4 03:02:00 2015 UTC,"You gave up to soon on Ed Nygma. He does a lot more than in the first 5 episodes.  In regards to Alfred, he realizes that Bruce just lost his parents. Now he has to be the one to care for this young boy, so it's pretty out of his comfort zone. Bruce is also way beyond ordinary, so he'd challenge any butler. Alfred could settle down later on, but IMO he's better when he's not just a cliche butler all the time and shows emotion over Bruce's outbursts and struggles."
FlashTV,38cydb,quontemplation,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:35:17 2015 UTC,"Growth is good so I'm glad Ed gets better and/or more interesting.    As for Alfred, I like it when he cares about Bruce like a son, but the few outbursts I remember happened around Bruce, which weakens him to me.    Being emotional and caring with the other adults or in private makes sense, but I think that, at least in my perfect world, Alfred is the strong, silent - suffering father figure who guides Bruce by day, and cries into his pillow at night.    I think I may have also been opposed to Fish Mooney in general, and the addition of Morena Baccarin makes me want to dive back in, but so far I haven't been able to make myself do it."
FlashTV,38cydb,bored_not_working,3,Wed Jun 3 18:05:00 2015 UTC,"I mean Gotham is several origin stories. It's all about growth.  Bruce grows up to be the strong, silent type. Alfred doesn't want that of him, so it would make sense that he would try to not be a role model that would encourage that personality.   Gideon Morena is pretty good in her first arc. She kind of settles down afterward in my opinion."
FlashTV,38cydb,quontemplation,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:17:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe what turned me off at first was the large number of stories they kept trying to touch on all at once in the first few episodes.    If they try to cover everyone's story all the time, they have to pull time from other characters to make room to mention everyone. This muddies the story and pulls focus more quickly than I at least enjoy in a series like that."
FlashTV,38cydb,bored_not_working,3,Wed Jun 3 18:23:27 2015 UTC,No disagreement here. Ivy was shoved into the pilot and has only reappeared as a minor character. All pretty pointless.

FlashTV,38cydb,AKACherry,2,Wed Jun 3 18:31:33 2015 UTC,I don't why so many complain that Riddler keeps posing riddles to people. . . it's the Riddler. Having a hard on for riddles has always been his entire character.
FlashTV,38cydb,Jack-so-Slack,3,Fri Jun 5 02:02:46 2015 UTC,"I just feel that posing constant riddles from the get-go takes away from any semblance of realistic psychosis in the future.    I know this is origin city, but I think that riddles in every shown interaction is somewhat of overkill.    Start with one every few episodes, like a small hobby, and add more as he dives into a psychotic break before he becomes the riddler in earnest.     That at least would come across more organically to me."
FlashTV,38cydb,bored_not_working,3,Thu Jun 4 00:52:34 2015 UTC,"The casting.  Honestly that's the biggest problem with Gotham.  I like Jim/Harvey/alfred/Bruce.. but almost all of the others are just not good actors (Don't even get me started on the Penguin.. I don't know why everyone likes him so much) OR have been told to act ""too hard"" it almost feels like live theatre sometimes with the villains."

FlashTV,38cydb,patrickjpatten,4,Thu Jun 4 22:58:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think Gotham has got it wrong I think everyone else is expecting something else because it is called Gotham. It is not a show about Batman, like everyone seems to believe. To me it is a police drama that helps to tell the story of the City of Gotham it is in no way a superhero show like Arrow or The Flash. Once you understand that it is telling the story of Gotham through Gordon's eyes not the story of batman it is much more enjoyable. I think the producers have succeeded at what they are trying to do but people don't understand that and just want Batman and the Joker instead they get the corruption and reasons why Gotham needs someone like Batman fighting crime unhindered by the corruption."

FlashTV,38cydb,Bagpipes064,3,Wed Jun 3 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"For me I enjoy Gotham so much, that is a weird wacky crazy unpredictable comic/mafia/police show, different kind of fun. There is no heroes, shippers, teen love and superpower, only Gotham city. So it only attracts the minority audience. Although I would say Flash is better than Gotham, I still prefer Gotham over Arrow.  The question is why do you say the producers of Gotham have got it SO wrong?"
FlashTV,38cydb,WildGrass,2,Wed Jun 3 15:18:37 2015 UTC,"I still feel as if people are seeing Gotham as a superhero show, its a crime drama that happens to have some famous villains in essentially. I'm not saying its flawless or that it did everything right, but I feel its getting worse feedback than it deserves due to people thinking its something its not."
FlashTV,38cydb,ictbubba,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:07:48 2015 UTC,"I'd agree, if that were consistent. I feel like it wants to be a procedural, but it wants to remind us that one day, Batman will be here. How do we know? Pilot opens with the death of the Waynes. So many subplots with Selina, Pamela, Harvey, Oswald, Nygma, even the Joker.  No. This is a superhero show -- perhaps that was not its intent or concept, but through their own doing, they have created a prepubescent rogues gallery. If we had a mob-heavy Gotham, with Gordon making slow inroads into cutting some of the corruption out of the GCPD, making a friend out of Bullock, then you'd have a point.  But shoving Fish Mooney off to an island where there is a fantastical villain who can sew people into other people, that's not a crime drama. The premise of a killer who uses weather balloons that can't lift more than a few fucking pounds is not a crime drama. It is a superhero story. It is a badly thought out one.  People think it's a superhero show because that is what keeps being written. I'd love a pulpy crime show. But this is James Gordon, Supercop. People loved Gordon in the Nolan franchise because he could be brave - but he was motivated by the arrival of Batman. He could be hurt, wrong, mistrusting. Supercop is covered in plot armor, as is his position at GCPD, endlessly righteous and always forthright. Sounds like a superhero with a gun to me."
FlashTV,38cydb,RuinAllTheThings,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:08:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you are saying but the fact that the villains are not realistic doesn't automatically make it not a crime drama/ a superhero show, it just adds a but of fantasy/sci-fi/supernatural-ness to it all and makes it more interesting. This point isn't trying to say what it did and how it did it was great but rather that it doesn't make it a superhero show"
FlashTV,38cydb,ictbubba,2,Thu Jun 4 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"Gotham has bad writing. Period. For all the hand-wringing about CW formulas with emotional scenes every episodes, that style is in the writer's room's wheelhouse. They can work with it.  Gotham, on the other hand has a tonal schism. Is it a procedural? Drama? Why after a serious moment do we then see, say, a body crash through a window as if it's meant to be humorous?  At the same time, it suffers from Batman Babies syndrome. Young Selina Kyle who likes to be called ""Cat,"" young Pamela Isley, young Bruce Wayne. To say nothing of a 30-something Victor Zsazs which would make him in his 50s during the age of Batman.  I was willing to grant Penguin. Seeing his rise would've been interesting. Dent, though? Riddler's annoying origin? While the Barbara twist was interesting, what the fuck?  Gotham doesn't know what story it wants to tell. And it's willing to just throw everything into a fire to see what burns (other than the whole world). The result is a mishmash of half thoughts, bad stereotypes, characters that don't belong and shitty writing."
FlashTV,38cydb,RuinAllTheThings,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:35:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly I like Gotham enough to have watched all of it, but not enough to wander into the subreddit (or Tumblr tags). I think the idea of what goes on in each episode tends to be worse than the good actual episodes. I waited to watch the last five or so episodes because I feared them being bad, but I thoroughly enjoyed them.  I think the storyline is probably the most confusing. As others have said, the characters who make up Batman's Rogues are in development and can't really show their full potential as villians. Similarly, most of the city is building up to Batman infamy, but most of the city's just a giant craphole.   They do a villian of the week plot with only half-formed villians, or have a story arc that spanned a lot of directions and still had to leave room for development.  The Flash also had either a villian of the week or an over-arching story, but they didn't have to hold back in how they represented them. Honestly I think Gotham might have had some better villians, but they were still presented in a half-baked, not fully formed character.  I guess Gotham is reluctant to show any major storylines coming to a definite conclusion, because they need to show it all tying together with the entrance of Batman. Flash can conclude storylines or return to them, because not everything is going to be reused."
FlashTV,38cydb,quontemplation,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:29:44 2015 UTC,"I think Gotham missed the mark of what it was should be.  What I mean is that the show should have focused on the city of Gotham, the gang war, crime, and the police department.  But instead, they tried to make it about Batman. The problem is that Batman doesn't exist for 10-20 years. It was a mistake to have Bruce Wayne, Selina Kyle, and Alfred on the show. I don't really care about these characters because they really aren't relevant to the city of Gotham for  a while  It was also a mistake to put so many Batman villains in the first season. It creates this feeling of ""hey, all the villains, Gordon, and Batman all knew each other all along"". As much as I liked Penguin on the show, he suffered from that.  That's not to say it shouldn't be based on the comics, but they should have focused on the Police-Gang storyline, and just give us small occasional nods to future characters. That's part of what made ""Viper"" such a good episode. They didn't say ""HEY GUYS, HERE'S BANE"", they just nodded to the fact that the show was in a world where Bane would eventually come to be.  The Flash knew what it was before the show even started. Kreisberg, Johns, Nutter, and Berlanti knew to focus the story on a few characters and plotlines that are important for setting up the world and the hero."
FlashTV,38cydb,mrglass8,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:00:51 2015 UTC,"Gotham obviously needs more development of Nimbus Zsasz and Gideon Dr. Thompkins.  Heck, make Grant the young adult Joker, Wentworth a young Dr. Fries, etc. Make The Flash film Gotham too."
FlashTV,38cydb,quontemplation,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"Gotham would have been great if it was centered around Gordon and Bullock as a cop kind of show, but it isn't. They are too focused on introducing young villians with as many hints as possible. (Stop with all the riddles Nigma! Did anyone ever tell you, you walk like a penguin?). Even young Bruce is just Batman, but at 10 years old. It's trying to grow into Batman as fast as possible. Also the whole mixed tech era thing (we have cell phones, but use filing cabinets and no computers) really REALLY bothers me.   I have been a fan of the Flash for a few years and got into the new 52 when it came out (and going back and reading stuff like rebirth as well). The show though embraces the comic in the modern era. It keeps to the essence and basics of the comic, while also being a good TV show. The show is very accessible without treating the audience like their idiots, while also threading deep comic themes into it without being obvious. Like how Eobard can't use the speed force without the Flash or the end of Flashpoint into the season finale.  We've also been over saturated with Batman content and the opposite with the Flash. He does have a good comic fanbase and only one real solo feature (the original Flash TV show). It's refreshing."
FlashTV,38cydb,The_RTV,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:28:24 2015 UTC,Gotham is already good. The people hat hate are the people that want batman. We know this defeats the purpose of the show. If anything the final moments of the series should show Bruce suiting up.

FlashTV,389gdx,WhelmedB01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:17:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you can call it shifting through time and space, since that makes it sounds as if he's can freely manipulate both time and space, while I think it's just time itself. You can argue that while manipulating time and moving through space, he is manipulating both, but his powers are described as alterings time relativity to himself. From the DC Wikia:   Personal Time Manipulation: Hunter Zolomon has the ability to alter time relative to himself, as opposed to utilizing the Speed Force like most of the DC Universe speedsters do. He can apparently use this ability to move at ""speeds"" rivaling those of even Wally West, fastest of the Flashes, and usually, ""faster"" than the speeds that even Wally can muster in most cases. Since Zoom isn't actually moving at great superhuman speeds (rather, he is greatly slowing down time relative to himself and can make himself so ""fast"" that even most of the Flashes look to him to be moving in slow motion, instead.) The temporal nature of his speed allows him to avoid the usual problems encountered by other Flash-type speedsters (friction, seeing and hearing at such near-light speeds, et al), whose automatic and unconscious use of the Speed Force overcomes those problems. As he is moving at a normal velocity, and the rest of the world is ""slow"", those hindrances simply do not affect him."

Could Eddie become Cobalt Blue in season 2? Maybe. Why? Because the secret idenity of Cobalt Blue is Malcolm Thawne. But wait, there's MORE! Malcolm is actually the TWIN BROTHER of Barry Allen. He was stolen away by the doctor who delivered them, and given to the Thawne family (this was to cover the fact that he KILLED the Thawne's actual child, so he gave them Barry's brother, and told the Allens that he was stillborn). The Thawnes were a family of con-artists, and raised Malcolm in this trade. But, as an adult, he learns the story of his origins. He kills the doctor, then meets his grandmother, who teaches him the family art of controlling the power of the blue flame and we've gone full comic-book insane, haven't we? OK, then. Long story short, the jealous Thawne gains the ability to drain speed from the Flash, and becomes the villain Cobalt Blue. So, who knows? Maybe this series will debut its own version of Cobalt Blue in the form of Eddie Thawne driven insane by the wormhole, or something to that effect.   So...kinda?"

Mark Hamill as the Joker Trickster was my favorite moment/villain. For season 2, I hope they do not go into the multiverse or introduce Kid Flash (at least not with powers yet). As a comic fan, that would be awesome. But there is a lot of good story to tell with just the main cast (in this timeline/universe). Barry Allen grew a lot as the Flash, but that was with Eobard's guidance. Season 2 would do well to show how Barry gets more into his powers without Eobard.

My thoughts is that Eobard and Eddie will be in Season 2 because Eddie killing himself creates a self-cancelling time paradox (Eddie kills himself to prevent the Reverse Flash from existing, but without RF existing Eddie is never given the motivation to off himself).  It's kind of like how RF can't kill Barry Allen in the comics or stop him from becoming the Flash."
FlashTV,38az8e,Robotshavenohearts,30,Wed Jun 3 01:14:47 2015 UTC,The writers have expressed their desire to bring in more speedsters for Season 2.  And Barry could really use a speedster mentor/trainer.  Don't be surprised if the black hole turns into a link to Earth 2....
FlashTV,38az8e,Future_Vantas,11,Wed Jun 3 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"it really does seem to be the most.. ahem.. ""logical"" outcome after the last episode really  It certainly explains why they did the ""Flash can travel through time through pure speed"" episode as early as they did - think about it, Reverse Flash can just be 'oh.. future technology = Time Travel' and audiences will buy it, but the 'run really fast and travel through reality' portion came certainly a lot earlier than I expected."

Now my theory is that they're not going to just introduce Jay or Wally, but basically throw their hands up and go ""Multiverse!

This show is in love with the Silver Age of comics. and I'm happy as hell with that."

And Grant Gustin mentioned that he was under the impression Earth 2 will factor into the next season. Danielle Panabaker said in her reddit ama that Jay was one of the things she was most looking forward. I highly doubt it was just an easter egg.

I've only really known Flash since the TV show, but still, Thawne is one crazy motherfucker, and unfortunately because he's a Flash villain it means he doesn't have the same pop culture recognition as say Joker. I hope a movie changes that, because he's arguably more fucked up and psychotic than the Joker. Some of the shit he's done could easily fit in a 15 rated film (although to be fair, the same goes to the Joker easily)."

I'd go as far as saying it's on par with Ledger's Joker, but that'd stir a little hate. Not as much as this next comment will however. Kevin Spacey should redo Lex Luthor. Hear me out. If you got the writers of House of Cards to work on Lex's character and nothing else, you would realise that Lex Luthor is Francis Underwood, except with bigger goals."
FlashTV,3872dk,Gate4043,104,Tue Jun 2 12:04:36 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on Kevin Spacey. In Superman Returns he wasn't portraying Lex Luthor, he was portraying Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor."
FlashTV,3872dk,Spy_Fox64,73,Tue Jun 2 12:38:28 2015 UTC,In all fairness Routh did a fucking great job of playing Reeves as Superman.
FlashTV,3872dk,TheJoshider10,30,Tue Jun 2 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah. Of all the problems with that movie (and there weren't as many as people think), Routh was not one of them."
FlashTV,3872dk,BigBassBone,32,Tue Jun 2 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"Kevin Spacey=Lex Luthor<Mark Strong=Thaal Sinestro.  And in no way am I downing Spacey, you're right, he fit it perfectly.

FlashTV,3872dk,Terakahn,14,Tue Jun 2 22:09:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was as good as Ledger's but to each their own. I definitely agree on Lex though. To me, Spacey was Lex. You wouldn't get much hate for that though since people liked him as Lex, just not the material he worked with."

FlashTV,3872dk,BallisticGE0RGE,2,Tue Jun 2 16:57:10 2015 UTC,That wasn't it's only flaw. I'd say not giving anything for Superman to actually hit was a pretty big flaw too. Him being a deadbeat dad was kinda weird too.
FlashTV,3872dk,suss2it,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:28:03 2015 UTC,"Well, he wasn't really a deadbeat dad, he never even knew Lois was pregnant. By the time he realised, she had moved on *coughcough* and someone else had taken his place as a father."
FlashTV,3872dk,Lecks,0,Thu Jun 4 22:12:33 2015 UTC,"True. Then he breaks into their house to whisper speeches into the kid's ear while he's sleeping, so I guess he's more of a proactive father than I originally said."
FlashTV,3872dk,suss2it,6,Thu Jun 4 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Ledger's Joker was just good acting but pretty far from the comics. You saying Cavanagh's Zoom is comparing to Ledger's Joker is just analogous to saying Cavanagh acted good and portrayed a good Zoom which I have to agree with."
FlashTV,3872dk,BearZeBubus,7,Tue Jun 2 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"Ledger's Joker wasn't all that far from the comics. He wasn't based off mainstream Batman - he was based off The Killing Joke.  Its the same thing with Amell's Green Arrow. It's not that the character is far off the comics, it's that they used non-mainstream comics as inspiration. In the case of Arrow, the inspiration was Mike Grell's ""Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters""."
FlashTV,3872dk,radapex,0,Tue Jun 2 17:32:53 2015 UTC,In what way was Ledger's Joker based off the Killing Joke? Aside from wanting to show Batman that everyone can be brought down when pushed the right way.
FlashTV,3872dk,ClikeX,2,Wed Jun 3 09:46:32 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Killing_Joke#Film   Director Christopher Nolan has mentioned that The Killing Joke served as an influence for the version of the Joker appearing in the 2008 feature film The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger, who played the Joker, stated in an interview that he was given a copy of The Killing Joke as reference for the role. The influence in Ledger's character is evident whenever the joker tells the story of his scars, because he narrates completely different versions, the same as in the comic in which he says quote:""If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!""."
FlashTV,3872dk,radapex,6,Wed Jun 3 11:18:43 2015 UTC,"I would contend Underwood is more evil than Luthor. Maybe not as harmful or damaging, but i think he's more self serving."
FlashTV,3872dk,idontliketocomment,4,Tue Jun 2 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"To the contrary, I believe Luthor should be closer to Underwood's character. In both cases we're shown a greedy villain obsessed with power, but in the most childish sense, as we see with Underwood, he fucks up the moment he gets what he wants. The difference between the two is that Luthor has never quite been portrayed as villainous as Underwood, but if we're to get a proper performance true to the psychological views, Underwood is closest to anything."
FlashTV,3872dk,Gate4043,3,Tue Jun 2 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. Lex Luthor is one of the most self-serving characters ever. Dude, got the powers of a god and could make everyone happy and all he had to do was let go of his grudge against Superman and let him be happy too. Guess how that turned out? In John Byrne's Man of Steel he had Lex go to a random diner and promise a life of luxury to waitress only to bail before she could make her decision so that she'd always have to live with the ""what if..."" question. I don't think Underwood's ever done anything that petty."
FlashTV,3872dk,suss2it,2,Wed Jun 3 00:26:48 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of different interpretations of Lex. I personally really like the version from ""Luthor"" by Brian Azzarello, where he's actually a pretty good person, he just views Superman as a threat to humanity. That Luthor believes in progress and boundless potential, but sees Superman's perfection as a limit that can never be overcome. It's a really interesting read and possibly my all time favorite comic."

He was supposed to have kids who would one day lead to Eobard being born. Now that he's altered the timeline, the universe is pissed off and everything after that altered point in time is being erased from existence a la dimensional vortex"
FlashTV,38ca6s,Commander_Cob,3,Wed Jun 3 08:23:45 2015 UTC,After the vortex is closed I bet time will get slight rewrites to fix the future.   Harrison Wells was never killed and Tess's death afer his accident motivated him to work harder to build his dream for her.  Thats one I imagine also means we get to keep Cavanagh

He acted as a mentor of Barry in the comics. I have no idea why RF was scared though."
FlashTV,38c7p8,AraneusAdoro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:54:06 2015 UTC,"Reverse Flash saw the multiverse being disturbed by time travel. Barry's unwillingness to kill his mother slowly coagulated all universes into interacting with one another. As a result, Eobard had to leave before shit went down. I have no idea why Eobard didn't freak out due to this realization. Had he known that trouble was acoming, did he not know the flash was coming with it? Unless this is all wrong, and I apologize for confusion."
FlashTV,38c7p8,Saif-pineapple,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:18:35 2015 UTC,"So Barry is not the original Flash? I know Wells could walk in flash backs etc, just wondered when he started using a wheel chair."
FlashTV,38c7p8,AraneusAdoro,6,Wed Jun 3 08:31:15 2015 UTC,"So Barry is not the original Flash?   Not in the comics. But since Jay Garrick is from parallel universe, Barry is the original in his one.   just wondered when he started using a wheel chair.   He referred to it as a result of particle accelerator explosion multiple times."
FlashTV,38c7p8,mmemmetee,2,Wed Jun 3 08:50:30 2015 UTC,"Star Labs was created after Eobard took over Wells identity. He needed to create the particle accelerator faster than original Wells was going to do it. Yes, Team Flash has never met the original Wells. They have only known Eobard as Wells.  Eobard was injured by the particle accelerator. But he was also using his wheelchair to recharge himself as Barry's powers evolved. As Barry grew stronger, Eobard's healing capabilities also grew. Hence why he's able to walk later in the season.  The helmet is Jay Garrick's helmet. Jay Garrick is the original Flash from the comics. This signifies the introduction of multiple universes within the show's universe. Throughout the entire season, it was always believed that there was this singular universe; the one they're living. But when that helmet landed, it signified that there is another universe and possibly many more. I believe that Eobard knew that there was going to be a problem with the wormhole. So when he saw that the other universe was basically leaking in, he needed to get out of that timeline and into his original one or to whenever he wanted. There is no guarantee that Eobard was telling the truth about going home. He just needed them to make it possible for him to time travel. He also never expected Barry to come back because when Barry came back to punch him. He was surprised because if Barry had changed the past, Barry wouldn't have come back. But he did so things didn't go according to his plan. Who knows what else was part of his plan?"

FlashTV,385fvt,viva-la-struggle,19,Wed Jun 3 10:16:19 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they were filming future episodes all season. These episodes weren't all filmed when season 1 premiered.

FlashTV,385fvt,viva-la-struggle,2,Tue Jun 2 08:38:57 2015 UTC,No... Only Netflix and HBO do this. 23 all year long seasons don't have enough time to film it all at once.

It addresses the inability of the classical concepts ""particle"" or ""wave"" to fully describe the behavior of quantum-scale objects. As Einstein wrote: ""It seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other, while at times we may use either. We are faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do"".

It is quite interesting that they mentioned Arthur Light by name and could be a possible foreshadowing of what's to come but I personally don't think it affected Cisco.  I reckon Cisco's powers are dormant and will emerge slowly or Cisco will realise he's of more use with his knowledge of technology on the streets and will use Pied pipers gloves to tap into his vibration powers.  The gloves may be a way of amplifying his powers and a way of transporting to other dimensions. There will come a day when they need to gather speedsters and Cisco may be an integral part.  I.E.

In retrospect, it wasn't the best idea, but considering how distraught he was over his last moments with his mom, I think it makes sense as an emotional response."
FlashTV,389tv2,khuffac,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:42:51 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I hadn't thought of that. You're right. He has to listen to his mom getting killed by RF. That's gotta be maddening.  Any thoughts on the time travel though? It was never clear how the Flash time travels, or rather, when he can. Can he do it at any time? Because if there was ever a time to do it, that ending was it."
FlashTV,389tv2,khuffac,4,Tue Jun 2 21:56:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I haven't read much of the comics, so I'm not sure if there's some protocol behind it.  In the show, it seems like Barry doesn't really know how to time travel on command yet, which may be something they focus on next season. Though I guess the overall theme is that changing the past just makes more problems, so I don't think he'll be doing it on purpose all that much."
FlashTV,389tv2,quontemplation,4,Tue Jun 2 22:32:41 2015 UTC,"There's the Cosmic Treadmill (S.T.A.R. labs has the makings of one), which allows Barry (or other speedsters) to focus on a certain time period IIRC.   When returning to their modern day, speedsters pretty much do what Barry did in the finale and think of home ala Wizard of Oz. With Wally, there's a constant reference to Linda Park as his ""grounding rod"", and probably the same thing with Iris and Barry. So I guess Barry always demonstrating greater feats of speed because of Iris is actual Speedforce.  Also, part of the DC multiverse theory is that each universe is humming at a different frequency. Originally Barry crossed over into Earth 2 by happening to vibrate at the right frequency that resonated with Earth 2"
FlashTV,389tv2,I-Cut-Myself,3,Tue Jun 2 23:43:05 2015 UTC,Also when speedsters go fast enough they can enter the speed force and through time.  e.g Other Barry chasing Eobard through time in the past.
FlashTV,389tv2,quontemplation,3,Wed Jun 3 01:22:31 2015 UTC,"This is the basic concept and I totally forgot about it.   Since the Speed Force is an energy field (by its simplest definition), it encompasses all of space and time, even other dimensions. Speedsters enter and then exit wherever they're going (although sometimes they get pulled to other places by the Speed Force).  Generally, ""going fast enough"" is faster than Mach 2. The show is really nerfing Barry's speed in terms of numbers."
FlashTV,389tv2,quontemplation,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:28:41 2015 UTC,"The science in these superhero worlds is so whack. Sometimes I wish I didn't have an engineering background so I could really fully get immersed in these universes.  Like the fact that Barry had to go over mach 2 when colliding with the particle. Particle accelerators are usually at the speed of light. That's like, 880000x faster than the speed of sound. It's just all very odd, and mixed up."

Do you really think it would be a good idea to let someone get away that has only one goal - Killing you or rather erasing you from existence? He had the chance right there to stop him, if Thawne got away he would've tried another time. Yeah, he lost so it wasn't too clever in the end, but the thought isn't that wrong.    Issue two: Why the fuck would they ever go back in time at all?!   He was presented a chance to change the one thing in his life that cost him his whole family and altered his entire life. He was also confident that he would be able to do it. Do you really blame him for trying?   it is ALL Barry's fault   Yes it is. He had a choice, he made his choice and it turned out not so good...Or did it?Do we know what would've happened if Thawne got away? Anyway, even if his choice turned out to be wrong in the end, at the time he thought it would be the right one. Do you really want a show where the characters ALWAYS make the right decisions? That would be pretty boring, wouldn't it?"
FlashTV,389tv2,JumpingCactus,2,Tue Jun 2 21:03:06 2015 UTC,"Do you really think it would be a good idea to let someone get away that has only one goal - Killing you or rather erasing you from existence? He had the chance right there to stop him, if Thawne got away he would've tried another time. Yeah, he lost so it wasn't too clever in the end, but the thought isn't that wrong.   It's not just this. Barry wanted justice. He didn't want Thawne ""getting away with it."" Thawne truly is evil and wicked. He really did do all this nasty stuff, destroying or manipulating everyone Barry cares about. He doesn't just get to leave because he offers Barry an alternative. He especially doesn't get to leave for that reason as it implicates Barry in all that evil, makes him the puppet of the person he hates.  By tricking Thawne and coming back, he gets back at him in a way Thawne can't ever fix. He took away all that power from Thawne. Even (especially) if Barry loses (which he may have even expected), Thawne is stuck forever in the world he hates. In the world he made. It's sort of the ultimate justice."
FlashTV,389tv2,shiner986,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:42:16 2015 UTC,"1) Barry has admitted in previous episodes his inability to beat RF. It was a bad idea to try when so much hung in the balance. He agreed to the deal, so obviously he wasn't so against Eobard returning.  2) yes totally. Like I said, that was a super villain level gamble. In movies, the villain has a plan, and often there is a possible catastrophe as a side result. The hero is supposed to stop it, not catalyze the catastrophe. In real life, no one would ever make the decision he did. Risking total annihilation is just so against Barry's character. He always tries to hold back at those moments where he knows he's emotionally compromised. Not this time.  3) and because of that, thousands of people die. He probably killed more people than  Malcolm Merlin. How am I supposed to feel anything but hate towards a character that felt okay making the trade off he did?"
FlashTV,389tv2,platinumrug,4,Tue Jun 2 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"At the time the team thought they could deal with the black hole. And, eventually, they did deal with it and close it. But then Eddie shot himself, causing the black hole to open again, with no way of stopping it.  So blame Eddie."

FlashTV,389tv2,Robotshavenohearts,2,Wed Jun 3 01:10:41 2015 UTC,But the only reason he kept losing to RF was because he was using the tachyon device to siphon off the speed force. So they knew he didn't have full access to his speed anymore.

But he only had fucking 20 seconds left and he's wasting time. It annoys me that with 1.52 time on the clock, he waited until he had 20 seconds left to actually LEAVE. where did that 1.32 seconds go????"

At the end of the episode, one of the members was killed. I believe the other members were sent to prison. However, at the beginning of Arrow S3, a group of convicts broke out. Perhaps the RFG was among that group, and the three of them went to Central City? I may be overanalyzing, but if this is the case it's a nice way of keeping continuity."

I've always theorized that in a few years, (probably by time of Flash movie since DC doesnt like to cross streams) Barry will be killed off like in the 80's comics, and the Flash will switch focus to a New 52 style mixed-race Wally West.  When it is time for Barry to go. I definitely want to see Black Flash as that storyline. So that's why I don't want to see him next year, I want them to hold off on him.  So for me season 2 the new speedsters I wanna see are: Wally, Jay Garrick, and maybe Eddie returning as Cobalt Blue.  Bart Allen, Hunter Zolomon, Max Mercury, and Jesse Quick and whoever else can stay at bay for the time being. They will need speedsters in later seasons."

First season is like 23 episodes right? If every season is like that, then the first season should absolutely be Mark Waid's The Return of Barry Allen.

FlashTV,3860r0,RadzPrower,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:01:45 2015 UTC,"He doesn't need to know what's going to happen to realize that if a younger version of himself is there, that means the past is about to be changed and and that Barry was there to correct it. He is smart enough to realize that even though from his perspective it might be just correcting the past, from that Barry's perspective it would be changing the past.

For those of you who own GTA V on pc here is the link for them mod  https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/flash-mod  Comments have a good way to configure it so that particles come from your feet instead of your ass .

FlashTV,387j1l,Tsorovar,3,Tue Jun 2 13:18:07 2015 UTC,"theres enough evidence to suggest  doubt, dont need to prove his innocence just his guilt. the eyewitness accounts definitely mean theres an element of doubt henry killed nora"
FlashTV,387j1l,AREYOUSauRuS,4,Tue Jun 2 14:49:52 2015 UTC,"There's the same evidence there always was - 10 year old Barry's testimony (which only mentioned red and yellow flashes of light, not men in yellow suits), and Henry's original testimony (he may not even have talked about the flashes of light in his statement to police). And of course the physical evidence, like Henry was there, was holding the knife, etc.  Everything else is irrelevant, inadmissible, or so circumstantial it basically doesn't matter. The most you might be able to prove is that speedsters exist now, and that a speedster could look like a blur of light. This does not create reasonable doubt.  And in any case, they do need to prove innocence, rather than just raise reasonable doubt. At trial, there is a presumption of innocence. But after a defendant is found guilty, then its the opposite. You need to introduce compelling evidence that the convicted criminal had not committed the crime. Usually that means some sort of incontrovertible physical evidence (generally DNA)."
FlashTV,387j1l,TheWanderingN00b,2,Tue Jun 2 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"he still has to appeal and win it, which isn't very likely.  All they got to go on is his son's testimony... his son who wasn't even at the scene once the police got there and hearsay that now, 15 years later, the killer finally reappeared.  If that was enough to overturn the conviction, everyone would file appeals claiming an unknown meta committed the crime, not them."
FlashTV,387j1l,cleric3648,2,Tue Jun 2 14:55:10 2015 UTC,Doubt isn't gonna get you anywhere. There's no chance that they could get him out with what info they have
FlashTV,387j1l,bostonmolasses,2,Tue Jun 2 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"Didn't RF run off with the box of evidence from the original crime?  Even if the eyewitness accounts (the son and husband of the victim) were even slightly believable, at this point they would need a preponderance of evidence, at least enough to provide a reasonable doubt.  Most of that evidence is either destroyed or missing.  If anything new did come up. like the blood splatter in the next room, it would be hard to prove that it was from the murderer, and not just some random person who entered the house at some point."

They use the show's universe and gives little backstories for the characters. I'm still wondering about Eddie's ""secret""... Iris' flashback/nightmare (at the end of the Circus freak show arc) was canon since they had basically the same scene during the episode The Trap, so we can assume Eddie did have a secret from his past."

Basically the story they are referencing is one in which an older Eobard tries to go back in time and fix everything that went wrong in his life. He views his family as a hinderence to the great things he could have accomplished. In the end he still ends up in a similar position despite having most everything he wanted in life.

It's normal and happens all the damn time for just about everything. I don't really get why that requires a separate post."

I haven't really seen more than a handful of the ""leaking"" post but I tend to enjoy them, whereas discussion based posts can be fun after something new comes to light I think they would get old super fast and there wouldn't be anything to discuss after a week of it.

I don't agree that it wasn't exciting in the beginning, but every one has become the same. They're all the same jokes in every post and they might keep better comedic posts from being seen."
FlashTV,37zxps,MycosX,2,Mon Jun 1 04:01:29 2015 UTC,"Well they keep getting upvoted so somebody likes them, I mean it couldn't be that hard to just ignore them, and it is very dry out here..."

My argument, yes it's easy to just not open the posts but it also junks up the sub. Why should we have 8 posts a day that each contain the same, ""dead for centuries"" or ""it was me"" joke? Not always, but some of the time it keeps good, quality posts from getting looked at and getting more attention than a ""we leaked"" post that is the same as the last one and the one before that."
FlashTV,37zxps,Techno_Bacon,5,Sun May 31 22:53:51 2015 UTC,"But those posts take up space on the front page.We could have more interesting stuff rather than these posts which are no longer unique.They were funny the first time,but now they are getting old.It's oblivious we're leaking, no need to keep pointing out everyone a flash how is made on another subreddit."
FlashTV,37zxps,Tanokki,2,Sun May 31 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"Then you would think the more interesting content would be upvoted. I don't care either way, but someone posting a ""leak"" joke isn't preventing other posts from being seen."

FlashTV,380l9i,Otacon_Kunvention,2,Mon Jun 1 02:30:52 2015 UTC,"I dislike hardcore shippers because the only thing they care about is the couple more than they care about the actual characters themselves. Like Olicity shippers for example like Ollie and Felicity together and they can be as OOC and as obnoxious as hell to other characters but as long as they are together and nice to each other it's fine. Break them up for good and they will hate the show or go away.  I mean shipping is fine and all but when the writers themselves start doing it and it affects the story in a negative way and makes the show (which isn't a romance show to begin with) center around the ship and in the process destroys a character? The nope, screw that."
FlashTV,380l9i,NovaStarLord,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:41:07 2015 UTC,"The Supernatural community is just... so bad when it comes to shipping. Caitlin/Barry is a perfectly fine ship. They've got that chemistry that I could've seen become a relationship. Yet on Supernatural is Sam/Dean Wincest and Dean/Castiel or the more rare Dean/Crowley or the scary John/Dean/Sam.  Granted, Supernatural creates this problem by killing off or writing out every damn female character on the show. The only female characters left are a lesbian and a lady who's old enough to be their mother. I'm almost 100% sure this is because of how strong of a female fanbase it has and any threat to their ""Wincest"" or ""Destiel"" ships are met with vitriol."

They just see two pretty people talk to each other, and then all of a sudden want to see them together, regardless of plot, canon, or comic sense. I still remember all the people who wanted Clark to get with Chloe on Smallville. I kept looking at them like WTF guys. He's gonna end up with Lois, period."
FlashTV,380l9i,marcohtx,8,Mon Jun 1 03:28:47 2015 UTC,"He's gonna end up with Lois, period.   It doesn't matter though. There are some stupid fucking ships I will admit, but the best ships are the ones that aren't expected or destined to be canon.   I don't watch Smallville, but if the chemistry was better between Chloe and Clark, then people would ship it, because they feel it's a better match.  There's nothing wrong with wanting something to be outside of the canon IF that thing works better. For example, Iris being a terrible character would turn people off the canon idea."
FlashTV,380l9i,TheJoshider10,3,Mon Jun 1 13:26:26 2015 UTC,"Its literally been one season. One season, where 75% of it, the writers had been destroying her character by purposely keeping her outside of the entire storyline. They even brought in Linda Park for an unnecessary love triangle plot. Now all that is over, she will be an actual character, and not just a dramatic plot device. Thy have plenty of time to focus on her and Barry's relationship. Of course Barry, and maybe Iris will date other people during the show, because CW, but I dont see the show ending without them getting together. If not, there would be zero reason to even have Iris on the show."
FlashTV,380l9i,marcohtx,2,Mon Jun 1 20:32:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you there, but my point is she's been written as a bad character from the start, their relationship seems forced, and it doesn't feel like they've had that close brother-sister bond which they tried showing.  It was the same in Flash. Laurel was shit so they paired the main character with whoever seemed like a decent character. Then Felicity became a regular and a massive amount went for her because le quirky girl xd but they also went with Sarah because she was just a better Laurel."
FlashTV,380l9i,TheJoshider10,2,Tue Jun 2 06:14:58 2015 UTC,"They haven't even got together yet, so how is it being forced on anybody? All we have been given is a kiss in an alternate timeline before they faced death, and an acknowledgement in real life, that there are feelings that exist between the two. That's it. They haven't went on a date or anything. Plus her boyfriend literally just died, so I dont even see them becoming an actual couple until well into the show, when she has gotten over Eddie. Like I said before, the show has just begun. For people to completely write off the potential for them ever getting together, using the little that we have gotten is just absurd. I don't think anyone should be forced to accept any ships on any show, but as a longtime Flash & DC fan, its almost blasphemy for myself to think of this show not ending with Barry & Iris. I think the writers of the show love the character of The Flash enough, that they wouldn't continue to write his longtime love interest in a way that no one would ever want them to ever be together, otherwise it makes Iris presence on the show unnecessary. Its like if there was a Superman show, where he never gets with Lois. Like I said before, the show has just started."
FlashTV,380l9i,marcohtx,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:34:05 2015 UTC,"Because she is clearly the end goal. The whole reason Barry can even reach his heights is because of Iris for crying out loud. They are clearly setting it up, but because she's a bad character right now, it's hard to get behind it.   I dont even see them becoming an actual couple until well into the show, when she has gotten over Eddie.   Yeah I agree, and it'll be a silly ""will they won't they"" that no one really cares about.  Also Arrow has shown it is possible for shows to go out of canon if they think something works better (although I do have my thoughts that Felicity is just a very present thing and by the end of Arrow it would be Laurel who gets with Oliver, but this is then after she was pulled from being a love interest and she became her own character."

FlashTV,380l9i,Rajion,9,Mon Jun 1 14:33:00 2015 UTC,"I only half heartedly did it until ""Crazy For You"". The ending of that episode was definitely hinting at something (the way Caitlin says she needs someone new to be crazy about, and then has a dreamy look in her eyes after an awkward/cute goodbye to Barry) plus the Everyman episode had her kissing him back. Plus since Arrow did the ""anti canon"" thing (I still feel Laurel is end game though), you wouldn't be foolish to think the same could happen here.  In hindsight they are probably ""look at what COULD happen, but WON'T happen"" in the same way Harry and Hermione had some scenes in the films/books where it played on the idea that to many they would be the ideal pairing.   But yeah, after seeing the set pictures I knew what to expect and was ""lol mfw ship sinking"" but you never know with S2. I just want to know why Ronnie isn't in Legends of Tomorrow, surely something happens there.   End of the day, this is all because of how poorly Iris is written. She is literally just a love interest. There's no depth to her character past that. She is there purely because the end game is her and Barry. If they made her a good stand alone character, I would care.   TL;DR: Iris being poorly written made Caitlin a much more promising prospect for Barry as she is written as a stand alone character and not nothing more than a love interest. Plus they hinted at her having feelings for him on more than one occasion."
FlashTV,380l9i,TheJoshider10,2,Mon Jun 1 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"I'll never understand why they wrote Iris like Lana Lang in Smallville... love interest, love triangle, that's it. Lois was awesome because she was written as a stand alone character for 4 or 5 seasons, dated other people and we actually saw her career, unlike Iris. I get that it's more difficult in Flash because Iris and Barry don't work together, but still she has 0 development. She made an entire file about metahumans and STAR Labs but we didn't see her researches and worst, we didn't even see a conclusion for her investigation... The ""spark"" was beautiful but took away Iris' chance to shine as a journalist. They write her as a temporary love interest even though she's endgame, it makes no sense."

FlashTV,380l9i,marcohtx,0,Mon Jun 1 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"Yes and I liked her in the last episodes. But the similarities with Lana/Whitney and Laurel/Tommy are so enormous, it's safe to assume they will keep this writing a little more for Iris. Will she blame Barry for Eddie's death (assuming the black hole thingy doesn't change that), will she really join the team... They have to write her grieving for Eddie and these writers, so far at least, have not managed to write such a storyline while making the character likable, mostly because it means more drama with the hero. (I personally enjoyed Laurel's arc in season 2, it was very difficult to watch because depression is complicated... but people hated her for that the entire season)"

FlashTV,380l9i,TheJoshider10,8,Mon Jun 1 13:18:31 2015 UTC,"As someone who buys into that ship hard: Iris and Barry have no chemistry, I hate that they're basically siblings and getting romantically involved, they don't seem to have anything in common but their dad, and that's weird.  I guess I'm less pro-Snow, and more anti-Iris.  Also, I don't give a shit about the comics. If I wanted the comics, I'd read the comics."
FlashTV,380l9i,DrKomeil,6,Mon Jun 1 03:05:58 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Barry had more chemistry with Felicity than anybody else. In a perfect world, they would be perfect for each other. Him and Caitlin have an advantage because they bonded over them working together, while Iris was purposely left out of the main plot for bullshit CW drama. Now that she is fully in the know, and will be more involved now, then the writers can finally start writing the Iris that we all know and love, and not the clueless, immature Iris that we got in season one. The brother sister stuff doesn't matter, because its always been established that Barry never saw Iris as his sister, and its not like they have the same last name. They are best friends, who will obviously evolve to be more, and then we get the Flash family."

FlashTV,380l9i,SirJerrico,3,Mon Jun 1 00:15:17 2015 UTC,"If two characters get together this early in a series, there's no way it'll last till the end."
FlashTV,380l9i,Evenseeker,2,Mon Jun 1 02:50:14 2015 UTC,"Well to be perfectly fair, the thing that is interesting about this situation in the storyline is that Barry has effectively gotten his powers 5 years earlier than he normally would have. Naturally you can imagine that things have drastically changed because of these events.  This isn't to say Barry wont end up with Iris. However during this five year gap beforehand, who is to say that Barry can't date other people?  The same thing goes for Oliver and Laurel. We know they will end up together. And yet Felicity ended up being with Oliver in the present time.  Now again, don't get my wrong. I don't care about any shipping in regards to any characters on this show. I think the show has done something rather fantastic with romance really being a subplot to the overall story of Barry learning to use his powers, and confronting the person who killed his mother.  Although on another note. Lets paint a picture where Snow and Barry being together is not only possible, but also an incredible means of storytelling.  Robbie Amell's character is once again gone. Firestorm is sent to the future to confront Vandal Savage. Members of Star Labs have been affected by the particle accelerator, and now Wells is gone before Barry's two leading members of the team get to explore their powers.  Season 2 kicks off on a wild start.(I believe he is in the future for a brief period with the legends of tomorrow or whatever it's called. So lets skip over resolving this black hole thing and get back to the actual series.)  Barry and Iris are now on the fence because while Iris cares deeply for Barry, she just lost Eddie whom she would have married.   Barry is doing his hero thing to the best of his ability, and succeeding quite well despite the absence of wells which is a bit of a boost to his ego. Not only that, but Joe is suddenly in need of a police detective to fill the void that Eddie left behind, and he is looking to Barry for that. (Reiterating themes and parallels with Iris dating her dad's partner.) Things are going good for Barry.  However his two closest friends, that couldn't be further from the case. Cisco is reeling from the information that Well's dropped on him, and Caitlyn is down about the loss of her husband to time. As Cisco finds himself struggling to figure out his own destiny, in Caitlyn's grief her own powers begin to awaken.  Cisco and Caitlyn both require time off from the team leaving Barry floored at the prospect.  Perhaps Cisco then wanders to his brother for guidance, as well as finding himself in the presence of Snart's sister(Probably the only pair on the show I find fun enough to watch).  Meanwhile Caitlyn continues to explore her powers and how to control them. However every attempt she makes is met with failure. That fact only further increases her frustration, and that furthers her power's loss of control.  Barry is now juggling his relationship with Iris, saving the city as the flash with all the rogues running about, becoming a police detective with Joe(The only real stable relationship he has right now), trying to help Cisco figure out what Well's meant about his destiny, and finally Caitlyn.  Depicting Caitlyn and Barry's relationship as one of opposed ideals. She is a woman of science and is trying to find logical means to her predicament. Barry is a man that has been in her shoes and is trying to get her to explore her powers by how they feel, not what they should be.  The two have clashing ideals. Caitlyn states that she is alone in her efforts where as Barry had a team behind him, and a family that loved him. Meanwhile she has lost the people that cared about her (Firestorm, and Wells).  Now most villains in comics have a twisted sense of reality. Caitlyn believes that she is alone where in fact Barry has always been there for her. Although she gradually keeps slipping further and further away.  Perhaps this can ultimately lead to a confrontation between Team Arrow and Team Flash's shattered squad. Caitlyn and Oliver come to a disagreement in the way things should be handled, while Oliver tells Barry to get his team together.  At this point Barry's team resembles the first movie's avengers. A bunch of skilled individuals that can't work together.  The conclusion to that would be Caitlyn and Oliver coming to blows before being split up by Barry. It leaves the two teams relationships on cool terms.  Barry is forced to come to terms that ever since Well's disappeared, there hasn't been a clear leader in the team. He can't just be the guy that goes out running about and saving the city without tending to his team first like Well's always made sure to do. The thought leaves Barry with mixed feelings.  With renewed efforts, Barry finds himself trying to help his team once again, and pulling both of them back together.  Then with Barry's help nearing the end of the season with a new big bad, Barry finds himself standing side by side with Caitlyn both of them now seeing eye to eye having gone through much to bring her back to that point.  Perhaps we could end off the season on a joke with Cisco commenting, ""Now imagine if Caitlyn went rogue or something? Do you think she would be robbing banks with Snart?""  ""Yeah, maybe in another dimension Cisco.""  XXXXX  But some notes about this. Obviously this development neglects Iris quite a bit, which I honestly don't really know how to deal with. However I also feel that if Barry's team was in shambles, he would have so much on his plate that he wouldn't have time to keep trying to consolidate his relationship with Iris.  The thing I love about Barry's character in this series is who he is. People in day to day life waste a lot of time, and then they wish for more. Well here is a man with more time than we could ever comprehend, and his relationships still struggle, they still fall apart. It is fascinating."

FlashTV,380l9i,ItsNotAPhaseDad,8,Mon Jun 1 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"i hate shippers, there is nothing wrong with wanting 2 people to get together on a show, but its ruined when (like on arrow) the shippers force it to happen. Surely its more satisfying when you're like ""it would be cool if these 2 got together"" then eventually they do after well developed story lines rather than going ""i want these 2 together, HEY EVERYONE GET THESE 2 TOGETHER I LOVE THEM OMG"" then getting everyone else involved with bugging the show-makers to get them together for them to be brought together out of force. (I also think fan-fiction ruins shows for me so i avoid it, thats just a personal thing.) I believe as an audience we have a right to say what things would improve the show and what characters we would like to see portrayed, but we shouldn't have a say on what actually happens on the show, that is a job for the team making, they write the dialogue, the stories, direct it and do god knows what else and we, as fans, shouldn't force our opinions on how stories and characters are portrayed, otherwise we limit the creative minds of the people involved because they feel they have to please the fans.  tl;dr - make suggestions to the show but don't essentially force massive plots, relationships and other such on to the show."

FlashTV,380l9i,MiguelK97,5,Mon Jun 1 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not a shipper, but i'm really more inclined towards Barry/Caitlin than Barry/Iris. The reason? I don't like Iris. In the end, I know that Barry is going to end up with Iris (Although, quoting u/theawesomebla ""It'd be hilarious if it was just another guy named Allen"" ) and I know that... eehrr... SnowBarry, is it? It sounds... kinda weird. Anyway, I know that it isn't going to happen in any ""permanent"" way.   I'm only hoping that they improve the Iris character into something likable. Like in S01E23, where they finally made me not dislike her.  And finally, the romance is not one of the reasons I watch the Flash. I watch it because the incredible characters, because I want to see the growing and formation of one of the most awesome super heroes, for the great plot and the impeccable acting... specially Tom Cavanagh, that guy is AWESOME!"
FlashTV,380l9i,KyleRaynerGotSweg,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"It's the same problem with Arrow for me, in the Oliver/Laurel department over there and obviously Barry/Iris department on Flash. I'm just a big fan of both of their relationships in the comics and I would love to see it translated into the shows. I mean the iconic relationship has always been Superman/Lois Lane but for me Barry and Iris are the best couple in the DC Universe, and a lot of that has to do with how well Iris has been written before and I just haven't felt that at all with this show, it's the only really big complaint I have to be honest. I'm hoping that they will make her more and more into that Iris over time, so really we'll just have to wait and see how she changes in the show, but like you said in E23 they definitely started going down the right path so here's to hoping!"

FlashTV,38425l,FlameyFlame,2,Mon Jun 1 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"Once you've blasted through Flash season one, I definitely recommend all 3 seasons of Arrow. It's a great show, slightly darker tone. But watch it, if for no other reason, then because it makes the crossover content so much more satisfying."
FlashTV,38425l,BlackCharizards,2,Mon Jun 1 19:00:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. I've heard that the start is seriously slow, and most of my friends ended up stopping it around the start of season 2."
FlashTV,38425l,FlameyFlame,3,Mon Jun 1 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"Well they missed out big time. Season 2 was the best, followed by 1 then 3."
FlashTV,38425l,VyseNice,4,Mon Jun 1 20:55:46 2015 UTC,"What? Really? I have heard many complaints about the show, but never that it starts slow.  In fact, I recently rewatched the Pilot Episode with a buddy of mine. He had been denying me the opportunity to get him into the show since Season One. Well, I finally got him to cave when I started talking about the archery scenes and he is a bow-hunter. iirc his exact response was ""Oh my fucking god, Tyler. Why the fuck did you let me wait that long to watch this!"" This was maybe a week ago, and my buddy who didn't think he would like it is already caught up on all 3 seasons lol.  So I'd say give it a try, first 2 seasons are on NetFlix. Most of us Flash fans in this sub watch both shows. Worst case scenario, you watch a show you don't like for 45 minutes, and come out with a better understanding why you dislike it. Don't just take your friends word for it though, you'll miss out! :)  EDIT: tablet typos"

FlashTV,3811qg,FlameyFlame,9,Mon Jun 1 12:46:18 2015 UTC,"I think most all bad guys believe what they are doing is actually heroic and good.  It's pretty rare in fiction to have a character who is evil just because ""fuck you guys I'm greedy and I want stuff and I like blowing up the universe.""  Any good writer is going to give their antagonist a believable motivation imo.  Malcolm Merlyn also thought he was doing the right thing, Ra's was motivated by tradition so you know in his own head he thinks he is serving the greater good. General Eiling works for American military and is all ""hoo-rah!"" And would probably die for his country making him a hero in his own mind too.  Villains motivated solely by revenge like Grodd and Slade or ones just openly greedy like Captain Cold are not as common for the ""big bad"" character."

He is the twin brother of the Scarlet Witch and the son of Magneto as well as the paternal half-brother of Polaris. However, he and his twin sister were later retconned, in Uncanny Avengers #4, to be the children of Django and Marya Maximoff who were kidnapped and experimented by the High Evolutionary. After a failed experimentation that gave Pietro his power, the High Evolutionary returned them to their parents and they then grew up believing that they were common mutants.

FlashTV,382w4x,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Mon Jun 1 13:54:41 2015 UTC,What if we got Tom Welling to play Jay Garrick?
FlashTV,382w4x,nocturnalis,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:39:08 2015 UTC,"I mean, well, Tom's not exactly in his last years, is he? That said, I don't really think Walsh would be a good candidate either, it'd just start a tradition for each Flash show. Maybe go one further so... Wally becomes Barry for the next show. Barry becomes Henry. Henry becomes Jay. Only problem with that would be that Wally's going to be black if they have him, so it really wouldn't work out properly."
FlashTV,382w4x,suss2it,2,Tue Jun 2 11:53:09 2015 UTC,"Why does Jay have to be old exactly? When he first debuted in wasn't old, and when he and Barry had their first crossover (and thus cementing the multiverse) he wasn't old either. After a couple decades him and the rest of the JSA were aged up to senior citizens, but I don't see why he has to debut like that here. Not to mention he's currently a young adult in the comics too."

FlashTV,380x0f,quontemplation,0,Mon Jun 1 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"Mach 2 isn't that fast, especially for a speedster. Someone else pointed that jets travel at Mach 3, but they're also visible because they're much larger. He might be a blur, but it's nowhere near as fast as light. (Ignoring those times where he somehow moved fast enough around Iris yet she didn't see him)  If nothing else, only twice the speed of sound is kind of slow for a character who moves faster than light and does the attosecond thing"
FlashTV,383jba,hadronhunter,4,Mon Jun 1 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"Idk about the lightning that hit Barry.  But about Thawne being able to predict where Barry would be during the lightning strike:  I believe he didn't predict but instead used his history knowledge. What if Barry became the Flash at around 2014 in the original timeline where his mother was still alive? Thawne explains to Wells that the particle accelerator Wells built with his wife changed the course of human history in 2020. But we're never told explicitly if that was when Barry got his powers in the original timeline. Maybe Barry was already the Flash for 6 years and the particle accelerator merely gave him superpowered enemies.  Thawne wanted the particle accelerator accident to happen earlier, around the time Barry became the Flash (as he knows from history books) so that Barry would immediately start pushing himself, trying to get faster. This way, Thawne doesn't have to wait until 2020.  Tldr; Barry was destined to get hit by that lightning on that day and become the Flash, particle accelerator or not and Thawne knew this fact from history.  Forgive my horrendous formatting, I'm typing this from mobile and have no idea how to format from here."

Barry reversing its direction is only going to send him back in time to right before he taps into the time stream, so if the next season starts logically, assuming there's no timeskip, Barry should end up running inside the accelerator.

FlashTV,3808rg,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,4,Sun May 31 22:08:41 2015 UTC,Hey! Thank you for replying! I can't sleep after watching the finale haha. I don't really know anything about the Flash comics but...I assume the Reverse Flash is the main villain? Or Flash's arch-nemesis. The acting was so good for the part of the Reverse Flash...I really hope he comes back as the same actor and not someone new.
FlashTV,3808rg,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,4,Sun May 31 22:14:59 2015 UTC,"Yes Eobard Thawne is Barry's main nemesis. I should amend my answer to question 1. The producers have revealed that Tom Cavanagh will be a regular in Season 2 but Rick Cosnett will not. They also talked about the benefit of having Matt Letscher and Tom Cavanagh, both strong actors, able to play Eobard in the future."
FlashTV,3808rg,angreesloth,5,Sun May 31 22:18:56 2015 UTC,"Ok now I'm even more excited for season 2! I have a feeling Flash might go through the black hole and end up on another timeline, one where Wells is never murdered but somehow still plays an integral role."
FlashTV,3808rg,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,4,Sun May 31 22:33:12 2015 UTC,"In the original timeline (pre Barry's mom getting killed) the original wells does create the same circumstances that create the flash, just in 2020 rather than 2014.   So I'm assuming wells will be playing less of a teaching role season two but still part of the flash team."
FlashTV,3808rg,Keegman_99,2,Mon Jun 1 03:23:58 2015 UTC,I'm hoping he ends up on earth-2 to meet and learn from Jay Garrick for a bit.
FlashTV,3808rg,supersandwich100,5,Sun May 31 23:03:33 2015 UTC,"1) Season 2 deals with the DC Multiverse. Producers and writers confirmed this.  2) Definitely. Writers said we haven't seen the last of spoiler We know for sure, though, that Tom Cavanagh will return, but they are being very secretive as to who he is playing.  3) Alternate timelines: yes. Batman: no, but we have Arrow.  4) Barry knew that saving his Mom would destroy his current timeline and undo basically the entire season.  5) Yup. In the comics he's Vibe, a hero who has vibration powers.  6) It's an AMAZING show. Probably best superhero show on tv."
FlashTV,3808rg,Keegman_99,1 point,Sun May 31 22:33:50 2015 UTC,Vibration powers? Hehe.   So Cavanagh will be back as a new character? Or Wells in flashbacks? Hmm..I didn't care for the original reverse actor so much

Eobard died, so technically he never took Well's body. And Matt Letscher (original RF) actually looks a lot like the comicbook Eobard Thawne.

I don't even necessarily disagree even though I'm not huge on the synopses. (If there are maybe 20 frames per episode synopsis I usually laughed at about 5)   But honestly, nobody has any reason to make this. Much less the cast. They have careers and lives to do. They give us so much little silly extra fan content to enjoy already. They don't need to waste their time on making a whole project just because a couple people on Reddit thought it would be SO funny if they did it.  It isn't going to happen and probably shouldn't. Sorry."
FlashTV,380bu0,CatMan79,11,Sun May 31 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"Was discussing this with my wife just a few minutes ago.  We just finally watched the finale, and I was wondering the same myself.  Perhaps it wasn't a Barry from an alternate timeline after all.  Maybe he's this timeline's Barry from the future.  Maybe that's a point of connection both across time and the multiverse and Eobard is from an alternate timeline and Future Barry isn't.  The other idea we had was that Eobard has been lying the whole time and he's not really from a different timeline."
FlashTV,380bu0,RadzPrower,3,Sun May 31 22:27:31 2015 UTC,"Your last point would make sense of the whole Eobard dying/disappearing thing. If it's a linear timeline, his ancestor dying would erase him from time. Also, the suits of the two Flashes are very similar, aside from colors. It's possible that Cisco changed the color of the suit in the near future, and then that Barry went back in time to stop other-Barry from saving his mom."

Obviously, somewhere in the past the timeline skewed down into this tangent [draws new line and writes 1985A] creating an alternate 1985. Alternate to you, me, and Einstein, but reality for everyone else.""    ...    Marty: ""So we go back to the future, and we stop Biff from stealing the time machine.""    Doc Brown: ""We can't, because if we travel into the future from this point in time, it will be the future of THIS reality, in which Biff is corrupt, powerful, and married to your mother.. No, our only chance to repair the present is in the past, at the point where the time line skewed into this tangent.""

FlashTV,380bu0,3NSLEY,9,Sun May 31 22:42:18 2015 UTC,"OT Barry knew, probably from past experience, that saving his mom would cause flashpoint. Yet, in the current timeline, Eddie killing himself to defeat Reverse Flash caused flashpoint anyways"

FlashTV,380bu0,pm_me_taylorswift,2,Mon Jun 1 05:41:49 2015 UTC,"If anything, we kind of know the opposite. Barry's mom dying was what changed the timeline. If it was meant to happen, why is he the Flash like ten years early?"
FlashTV,380bu0,Tsorovar,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:28:35 2015 UTC,"No, Eobard going back in time is what changed the timeline. One thing we definitely know is why Barry became the Flash ten years early: because Eobard took over Wells' life and built the particle accelerator sooner. Everything that changed from the original timeline to the one in the show is directly traceable back to Eobard's actions.  So we know that Eobard didn't originally kill Barry's mum. But she could easily have died in any number of ways at any time from that night onward. Maybe, except for Eobard already killing her, an ordinary armed robber would have arrived one hour later and done the same thing. We have no way of knowing."
FlashTV,380bu0,pm_me_taylorswift,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, we can assume things would have worked out much the same way.  But you said it yourself - Eobard changed the past. He killed Barry's mother. The only reason we have to think she might be dead in the original timeline is Other Barry stopping Grant Gustin from saving her. And for all we know, Other Barry was actually telling Grant Gustin to stop because Reverse Flash was still there and would have murdered Grant Gustin dead.  So yeah, we really don't know either way, but since Eobard is the one who went back in time to kill his mom, I think the safer assumption is that this is another change."

If you do you are a BAD GUY. I am sure it is not only unethical but very illegal as well. Rip Hunter would like to have a word with you.   Barry did the right thing by not interfering with the timeline, he does not have the right to 'play God'.   Future Barry was wise enough to know this and did the right thing by telling present Barry to back off.   This is time travel ethics 101."
FlashTV,380bu0,brenton8090,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:53:12 2015 UTC,"BUT Barry's mother living IS the original timeline. Barry has lived in the ALTERNATE timeline all season: Eobard comes from the original. I don't know why everyone was worried about what would happen if they saved his mom: they can easily see what will happen by reading Thawne's newspapers. Saving his mother would not be interfering with the timeline: it would prevent Thawne's interference, and restore the ORIGINAL timeline, which was just fine according to Thawne and his newspapers. So what gives? It seems like Barry let the bad guy win so he could stay in his own familiar ALTERNATE timeline (dead mom) and was scared of an unfamiliar, original timeline (alive mom.) Which seems really selfish."
FlashTV,380bu0,CoorsFight,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"Ok first of all I was speaking in a sort of comedic context, obviously you can screw with time, but like I said it is a dick thing to do.  If some jerk off decided to play God and change time, you do not necessarily have the right or obligation to try and 'fix' it. Doing so invokes the 'two wrongs don't make a right' clause and you really have no guarantee if you will even fix things or make them better. From an ethical POV, it's best to not interfere any furthur with shit beyond your scope. If anything, changing over 15 years of history for my Mommy is selfish, he has little to no idea what other consequences there will be.  Also, can you explain to me how you think saving Barry's mother would somehow prevent Thawnes interference?  Also, Thawnes newspapers could only be telling the future from the new timeline Thawnes created, obviously this is a paradox but things tend to calm down and fall back I to place after enough time has passed. What I'm saying is, messing with the fabric of time is like throwing stones in a pond, eventually the water goes back to stillness."

He seemed like a pretty nice guy, and forward thinking scientifically. He could want to come over to the altered timeline to learn from the accelerator that eobard had built in his name. Imagine the technological advances that could be made by, heh, reverse engineering."
FlashTV,37zbzw,Happy_Mask_Salesman,3,Sun May 31 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"Thawne told the real Wells he would build the particle accelerator in the future, but not soon enough to suit Thawne's timeline.  He was a pretty nice guy, romantic, sweet, and imaginative.  If he ends up in 'our' timeline, he could be played like a huggier guy.  Or, if he still loses his wife, he could be more like the 'Wells' Thawne was pretending to be before the accelerator accident.  He wouldn't be an evil guy, but he might be a bit more serious.  Maybe not dressing like a goth clubber, either."
FlashTV,37zbzw,raechan2012,2,Mon Jun 1 02:39:59 2015 UTC,"Considering how nothing in the present timeline really changed after Eobards death, I think Wells is not supposed to return as he was KILLED by Eobard (the dead body found buried at site).

My theory is that the original Harrison Wells did build the accelerator like he wanted to. But now it really blew up in an accident and causing all the metahumans, creating a timeline very close to the timeline of season 1 but without the reserve flash.  But I can't explain how Barry's mother would have died then."
FlashTV,37zbzw,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,6,Sun May 31 18:08:55 2015 UTC,But I can't explain how Barry's mother would have died then.

FlashTV,37wc01,IngNo,23,Sat May 30 23:05:34 2015 UTC,So that's why Wells could no longer harness the speedforce when he killed Barry's mum? Because it no longer existed until Barry became the flash again?
FlashTV,37wc01,jfb1337,21,Sun May 31 10:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yea. He explained that the trauma of that event caused Barry to not grow up to be the Flash, so the RF lost his powers. Thats why he encouraged Barry and helped him. He needed him to become the Flash that inspires him in the future."
FlashTV,37wc01,KageCM,2,Sun May 31 11:01:19 2015 UTC,This makes more sense than Barry who fought RF beforehand left the time line and RF had to get Barry to become the flash for Speedforce to exist again

FlashTV,37wc01,ScrabCrab,2,Sun May 31 09:59:00 2015 UTC,"The Flash in the TV series is an alternate version of the Flash, not the main Flash although Barry Allen is probably the main person to don the name and costume."

FlashTV,37wc01,Gingerslayr7,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:09:38 2015 UTC,"In the comics there are multiple universes and this includes the movies and tv series. It was explained (recently) that the Flash who created the Speedforce is just somewhere living his life. So if Thawne would kill Grant Gustin Barry Allen it wouldn't affect the Speedforce since the original Flash is still okay (for now, as it seems it is foreshadowed that he will die)."
FlashTV,37wc01,BearZeBubus,1 point,Sun May 31 16:26:28 2015 UTC,"That's pretty stupid.   ""Hey guys, this spiderman can totally die because it's not really spiderman.""  Then why am I watching it?   Just have the flash tv show be the goddamn flash tv show. It's not like they have to alter the comics to fit the show. Keep em based off the comics but separate."
FlashTV,37wc01,Psyanide13,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:05:48 2015 UTC,"They aren't going to alter anything? I think I am missing your point.   Each universe has their own version of the character. Just because we have an extra Flash it doesn't mean dies. For instance, Val-Zodd another Earth's Superman is such a well written character that a lot of people would be sad if he would get killed off.   It is the same thing for this series Barry Allen. They won't kill him off since the audience like him a lot.   And it is not like other Barry Allens haven't died. I know the Flash of a few Earths have already died due to catastrophes but it just so happens that the Flash from a specific Earth holds something important."
FlashTV,37wc01,BearZeBubus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:33:43 2015 UTC,"According to this video, Barry Allen is who created the speed force that allows every other flash / speedster to have powers."
FlashTV,37wc01,Drive_By_Spanking,1 point,Sun May 31 06:58:59 2015 UTC,Yes. Barry Allen created the Speedforce but not this Barry Allen. The Barry Allen who created the Speedforce is another from another universe. He is pretty much the one from the comics a few years back. Right now he is one of infinite Earths in the multiverse living his life unaware he is the one who created the Speedforce that every speedster in every universe uses.
FlashTV,37wc01,BearZeBubus,2,Sun May 31 16:28:55 2015 UTC,This is why I really dont like comics. Too many universes and timelines. The stories become less and less coherent. And the biggest issue I have with comics is that no one truly stays dead.
FlashTV,37wc01,dafood48,1 point,Sun May 31 19:25:58 2015 UTC,"Has it been confirmed that CWverse and the comic universe exist together, though?"
FlashTV,37wc01,NotJohnFairfax,1 point,Sun May 31 20:41:15 2015 UTC,"It is not so much about confirmation but more that they can co-exist together without taking out from the TV series or our world.   Technically, even Marvel's comic book universe has existed in DC (due to amalgam) and I think it had been referenced. Since the Marvel Cinematic Universe is part of their universe, and Marvel's universe part of DC's, I won't call it a long shot that they are in the same multiverse.   With that, it wouldn't be too far of a shot to say our universe exists in their multiverse as well."
FlashTV,37wc01,BearZeBubus,-1,Sun May 31 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I heard or read somewhere that the Speedforce wasn't created by the Flash, but is an eternal force of nature from which all kinetic energy originates. He simply taps into it. Or, has this definition changed in recent years? In The Green Lantern comics, will power exists throughout the Universe (just as the Speedforce does) and the ring taps into this force of nature."
FlashTV,37wc01,grafxguy1,3,Sun May 31 17:24:27 2015 UTC,...did you even watch the video?
FlashTV,37wc01,ZeroPride,1 point,Sun May 31 17:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did, but I was referring to what I thought was perhaps an older definition of the Speedforce. BearZeBubus explained that this new defintion is different or expanded from how I always perceived the SF."
FlashTV,37wc01,grafxguy1,1 point,Sun May 31 17:51:18 2015 UTC,Yeah it got changed or at least expanded upon that the Speedforce is this eternal force that all kinetic energy originates from but it was originally created the first Barry Allen.   Note: If you have infinite speed you can travel back in time (It is just an effect of speed = distance / time). So with that idea I guess DC is going with Barry Allen created the Speedforce during his time then because of that moment it created the  Speedforce in all the universes.
FlashTV,37wc01,BearZeBubus,3,Sun May 31 17:46:36 2015 UTC,"TBH this explanation of the speed force is very irritating to someone who grew up on the stories written by the man who originated the concept, Mark Waid.  The speed force always was and always would be. There is no way to ""manipulate"" it since it's a bedrock of the universe. All speedsters drew their power from it, some more than others. Wally West mainlined the force more than any other speedster, including Barry, so he developed more unique talents associated with it.  Shoehorning Barry into, ""creating"" the Speed Force, having Thawne generate a, ""negative"" version, all seems like a hackneyed way to make Barry, ""more special"" than he originally was. This just leads credence to my theory that if you have to retcon things and attribute all these new things to a character maybe he should have just stayed dead."

Similarly, his younger child self does not have powers as of yet so the three Barry's coexist within that space.  When he traveled back one day, it was within his own timeline and these problems weren't present."

Red Emblem Barry first time traveled without the need of it, but it merged or overwritten the Barry earlier in his timestream.  With that wormhole, I suspect it allowed him to be present without being overwritten as long as he returned within 1 minute and 52 seconds. If he didn't, the wormhole would become unstable, but I also suspect that the timeline will start correcting itself. Otherwise there wouldn't be a need for a wormhole to exist since Wells is already faster than Barry (who topped off at 1500mph)."

The night his mother was murdered, The Flash with the white emblem travelled back in time to stop the reverse flash and there was a child Barry Allen present also. When the current flash (the one we see on TV with team Flash) travelled back in time, he was an addition to the other two Barry's that were there on the day. That's why Flash with white emblem stopped Flash with red emblem from stopping reverse flash.  This may be kinda confusing but when he travelled back 15 years these were the people that were there:  Nora Allen  Henry Allen  Barry Allen (Child)  Barry Allen (Flash - White emblem)  Reverse Flash  Barry Allen (Flash - Red emblem, the one that travelled back in time).

FlashTV,380pbk,agreedis,3,Mon Jun 1 00:30:47 2015 UTC,"In two conversations between Thawne and Cisco (Both times being played by TC) We see the complex and deeply narcissistic nature of Thawne.  The first was when he killed Cisco.  During his confession to Cisco, he compliments Cisco by saying he'd always said Cisco was smart.  He tells him he's been like a son, and that it was difficult to keep his secret from Cisco.  When he says these things to Cisco, and asks for forgiveness when he killed him, He's so hyped up on his own intelligence that he drops these little comments as if Cisco should feel privileged to have been so valued by Thawne.  Claiming a feeling of kinship is the most self-centered thing he probably says because Cisco hasn't ever even been on a first-name basis with him.  When he finds out Cisco remembers the other timeline, his brush off of the murder ""I'm sure I had my reasons"" but he continues to show off and preen.  When he is about to leave, he still drops compliments because Thawne thinks his praise of Cisco is meaningful."
FlashTV,380pbk,raechan2012,3,Mon Jun 1 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"Great points. A few times I've seen other people attribute his interactions with Cisco as signs that Eobard can have actual affection or evidence that real Wells is alive in him, but I agree with your analysis. Eobard is a sociopath ultimately unable to form what normal people would consider a meaningful relationship. His ego and his wildly over-inflated self-importance prevents that."

The people I can think of who were on a first-name basis with Harrison Wells were the lady from Mercury Labs, Wade Eiling and Simon Stagg, none of whom were kind people and on good terms with Wells. He's certainly shown more affection with Cisco (and Caitlin) when watching movies and against Hartley, even though they'd never been to his house (but then again he was keeping a secret).  I didn't interpret ""You're incredibly clever, Cisco"" or ""Good job Dr./Ms. Snow"" as narcissistic. I mean, it could be that they don't receive compliments from him, so receiving one is valuable or suprising, but that's working off the pre-existing fact that he's their boss and not a warm person. I have doubts that he got them addicted to his compliments, so I don't get the big deal in him being honest with Cisco, although you're probably right.

The Animated Flash likely takes cues from Barry Allen's origin because Wally would be the first Flash in the animated continuity.

FlashTV,37tjny,OmegaX123,12,Sat May 30 15:36:04 2015 UTC,How do you just lend a Lantern ring?
FlashTV,37tjny,WollyGog,29,Sat May 30 19:22:51 2015 UTC,"The ring listens to its owner.

FlashTV,37tjny,OmegaX123,11,Sat May 30 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"I get that, but then is the ring able to follow commands of the new user? After all with a Green Lantern ring, you need huge amounts of willpower to wield it properly."

It's the same reason Arrow is not allowed to use Deadshot anymore.  Also there is no Batman on TV. There's a show about Gotham that takes place roughly 15-20 years before Batman exists.

FlashTV,37tjny,sufficientlyadvanced,8,Sat May 30 13:30:37 2015 UTC,"But it seems like most people already know about Supes. That lady in the diner says, ""Finally, a superhero for my daughter to look up to"", or something similar. Also Jimmy Olsen had a picture of him. It won a Pulitzer."
FlashTV,37tjny,The_LDT,9,Sat May 30 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, though in the comics(at the beginning of new 52) alot of the Metropolis people know OF superman, whereas the rest of the US think that he is a myth or an urban legend. This is the easiest and the most sensical way they can merge those two universes.   ""Finally, a superhero for my daughter to look up to""   Wouldn't that imply that there are more superheroes than just superman?"
FlashTV,37tjny,sufficientlyadvanced,7,Sat May 30 14:50:05 2015 UTC,"It does imply that (which admittedly confused me a little). I just have a hard time suspending disbelief that in the era of the internet a superhero on Superman's level would be considered a myth. I can understand someone like Batman or Green Arrow, but Supes isn't exactly known for subtlety."
FlashTV,37tjny,The_LDT,6,Sat May 30 15:02:30 2015 UTC,"You are right. I mean he has been active for so long he should be known literally across the globe. Then again, the particle accelarator exploded more or less 1,5 years beofre the flash finale, with alot of metahumans popping up in central city, yet the people of central city don't actually know that there are metahuman villains, while the flash himself is considered an urban legend in central city. It's gonna be hard for the producers to merge these two universes since neither supergirl nor arrow/flash will be making any references to each other, unless supergirl turns out to be succesfull."
FlashTV,37tjny,Hpfm2,3,Sat May 30 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"The Flash is pretty widely known as of now. And since the people of central city seemed to know of THe Arrow, it's not to farfetched that the stories of the Flash extended over to there too."
FlashTV,37tjny,Mr_Milenko,2,Sun May 31 00:02:46 2015 UTC,"Batman is considered a myth everywhere outside Gotham. Superman is pretty much known.

No.  In DC there's four.  Golden Age, Silver Age, Post-Crisis, and New 52.  The only one really relevant today is New 52, and sort of Post-Crisis a little.  Different authors and different stories doesn't mean different universes.  EDIT: I guess you could include Flashpoint as a universe, but it was so brief it doesn't really count in my book.

FlashTV,37tjny,ficarra1002,2,Sat May 30 21:15:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've really been wanting to get into the comics, but have always thought they were much more complicated than that. Marvel is much more complicated, isn't it?   I just wish the comics weren't so expensive. It's my understanding from a quick google search, there's individual issues, then there's volumes which have 8 comics each? Is there anything a step up after that? Don't think there is from googling  I liked the way Walking dead (The only comics Ive read) did it, issues, volumes, then the compendium."
FlashTV,37tjny,doctorvonscience,3,Sat May 30 21:25:16 2015 UTC,"Marvel's actually even less complicated than DC is.  There are two big universes in Marvel.  There's the regular 616, and there's the Ultimates universe.  Though there is currently a series going on called Secret Wars which might be combining them, so we'll probably end up with a new universe after it's over.  616 and Ultimates are completely separate, and unlike DC, there is no transition between them (they release concurrently), whereas DC has had multiple events to reboot their continuity to bring in new readers.  There's monthly issues, which are the building blocks.  Trade Paperbacks usually collect anywhere from 5 to 10 issues, however long the complete story arc is.  These are the best ones to get for most people, you can pick and choose which stories you want so you just get the good ones, and they're cheaper than buying all the individual issues the trade collects.  Some trades are also released in Hardcover.  Then there's the Omnibus, which usually collects all the work of a specific author who did remarkably well on a series, or just as much of a series as they can cram into one book.  I believe there's a Brian Michael Bendis Daredevil omnibus, there are omnibi for classic silver-age stuff, there are omnibi for most of Marvel's Ultimates Universe.  These are super expensive and you really shouldn't get them unless you're SUPER into one series or author."

FlashTV,37tjny,Joe_Vahkiin,4,Sat May 30 19:18:36 2015 UTC,"And where did you hear that? Because unless you have a good source it doesn't really mean anything.  They haven't said anything about it, but that doesn't rule it out.  I don't think we'll see Hal but that's only my opinion."
FlashTV,37tjny,SheriffofBanshee,-2,Sat May 30 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"All this time you're taking asking me for a source could have been spent on a quick search to find anything about it. I don't understand this attitude on Reddit that everyone has that a person asking for a source shouldn't have to find one themselves.   No it wouldn't be hard for me to google either, but why should I be required to when you're the one curious?   Don't take any of this the wrong way, I'm just tired of people doing this kind of thing. It's not my job to look up information for people."
FlashTV,37tjny,Joe_Vahkiin,7,Sat May 30 19:39:54 2015 UTC,"I won't quicksearch for it because I'm pretty sure there isn't a source at all.  It's nothing to do with Reddit, as a general principle it's bad form to state something without backing it up.  It's not your job to look things up for people, but is it everyone else's job to do your research for you and back up your claims for you? No, so unless you're stating an opinion (which you weren't - ""last I heard..."") you need to back it up otherwise it means nothing."
FlashTV,37tjny,SheriffofBanshee,0,Sat May 30 19:45:36 2015 UTC,"Then accept it as meaning nothing, kiddo. I honestly don't care if you believe me."

FlashTV,37x1dn,otusasio451,6,Sun May 31 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"The recap was SO BIG that I couldn't get under the character limit. So, I'm posting arguably the most important Easter egg here instead, until such time that I can trim the recap down enough to fit it. And with that:   The Crisis in the newspaper headline. Oh, boy. Where do I start? You may have realized by now that comic books are...complicated. And, more importantly, that they have a LOT of history and backstory attached. This isn't even including alternate universes, Elseworlds stories, more time-travel, etc. By 1985, the DCU had been going since 1938, with the Silver Age characters having been around since 1956 (with Barry Allen's first appearance). In that time, the continuity got really, REALLY complicated. Because of this, DC execs decided to demystify, simplify, and collapse the Multiverse into one, singular world with one singular history to be rewritten. Thus, in 1985, the DCU met its greatest calamity ever: the Crisis of Infinite Earths. In it, a universe-destroying ultravillain (BEYOND a supervillain (COPYRIGHTOTUSASIO4515302015NOTAKEBACKSIES)) named the Anti-Monitor set out to destroy ALL universes. Thus, nearly every single hero and villain in the DC Multiverse set out to stop him. In the struggle, two lives were lost. One was Kara Zor-El, AKA Supergirl. The other: the second Flash, AKA Barry Allen. Barry dies in order to get the other heroes into Anti-Monitors private universe. In doing this, he becomes a part of the Speed Force, and becomes a being made purely of energy. As a part of the Speed Force, this energy can travel through space and time. It eventually arrives on Earth in the past, taking the form of a lightning bolt over Central City. This bolt striked through the window of a humble, chornically late forensic scientist named Barry Allen. That said, that's one of FOUR Crises in the DCU, the others being Infinite Crisis, Final Crisis, and the very recent Convergence (which just ended last week). Arguably, Flashpoint is another of these crises, as it completely rewrote the DCU. It is not considered a crisis because it doesn't involve multiple Earths or a universe-ending threat. But, as it does rewrite the continuity of the universe (and was developed for similar reasons as the original Crisis was), I personally include it. In Flashpoint, Barry Allen (alive again; death hasn't been a thing in comics ever since Superman ""died"" in the 90s) goes back in time to save his mother from Eobard Thawne, AKA Professor Zoom. However, his running screws up the timestream, generating a drastically different universe in which Barry has no powers (but his mother's alive, so he's got that going for him, which is nice), Bruce Wayne's FATHER is Batman (his mother is the Joker, and he's a corpse), Superman has been kept in a dark cell by the government since he was a baby, and the world is being ripped apart by a war between former lovers Wonder Woman and Aquaman. Yeah, Barry really messed up. Everything gets beter though. Well, that depends on your opinion of the New 52. In my opinion, everything got worse. That, however, is another discussion entirely. EDIT: So, there's been some discussion in the comments about whether the ""Crisis"" referred to in the show may not be Crisis of Infinite Earths based on the ""red skies"" mentioned in the newspaper. It took some rereading of my copy, along with some internet research, but I present to you this, this, this, and this (which, full warning, has a MAJOR spoiler in it about the events of the story). Yup. The original Crisis had red skies. Somehow, I'd forgotten about that."
FlashTV,37x1dn,OmegaX123,6,Sun May 31 03:01:07 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they said the Crisis in the newspaper wasn't that Crisis (the CoIE one, at least). In fact, being a Crisis, with red skies, that isn't CoIE, I think it might be Convergence, possibly, or just a completely new Crisis invented for the show."
FlashTV,37x1dn,rickgrimesfan123,1 point,Sun May 31 07:31:51 2015 UTC,"True. I did mention the other Crises to be complete. However, I elaborated on Crisis on Infinite Earths and Flashpoint because only in those events is Barry Allen a main character. However, the one in the show is DEFINITELY not Convergence, as the show's development happened WAY before Convergence. I'm not actually sure that any of the Crises had red skies, but that's a minor detail to me, honestly. At least in terms of the comic-books. I'm willing to bet that it's a new crisis, and that the name is a nod to Crisis on Infinite Earths, and to the fans.  EDIT: So, I checked some interviews with show producers, and Greg Berlanti was actually greatly inspired by the original Crisis. Additionally, I can't find anywhere that says the event isn't a reference to the original Crisis. Plus, the original Crisis DID have red skies, so..."
FlashTV,37x1dn,OmegaX123,1 point,Sun May 31 21:12:09 2015 UTC,i thought the red skies part had something to do with superman and the red sun taking away his powers so flash had to fix the problem could be wrong though.
FlashTV,37x1dn,OmegaX123,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:58:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually sure that any of the Crises had red skies   According to a page shown in this subreddit a while ago (Clone Superboy as he appeared during the Reign of the Supermen event, pre-Crisis Barry, and post-Flashpoint Jay, all meeting), Convergence did."
FlashTV,37x1dn,OmegaX123,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:12:03 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but again, there's no way that the Crisis referred to is Convergence. It's not only way too complicated for The Flash to handle right now, but this show's development happened WAY before DC came up with the CONCEPT for Convergence, let alone the artwork.

FlashTV,37y1t2,4thdimensionviking,2,Sun May 31 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"Malcolm Thawne (New Earth) (from Dc wikia):       On the stormy night of May 13, two pregnant women came to the office of Fallville, Iowa's Dr. Gilmore. However, the doctor had been drinking, and he had sent his nurse home. The child of one of the women, Charlene Thawne, had been strangled on its own umbilical cord, and Gilmore was too intoxicated to save the poor baby. However, the other woman, Nora Allen, successfully gave birth to twin boys. Gilmore, trying to be fair, gave one of the twins to the Thawne family, telling the Allens that one of their children had been stillborn. The twin that remained with the Allens was named Barry, and he grew up to be the Flash. The other twin, however, was raised by the Thawnes, and he was named Malcolm. Malcolm's adoptive parents were con artists, using a strange inherited Thawne power, a blue flame, to heal people, afterwards selling jars of petroleum jelly with blue food coloring to the healed and their friends. All the other members of his family had this power except for Malcolm, and they constantly taunted him for being inferior. Finally, when he was seventeen, during one of their many arguments in which Malcolm asked to be taught the power of the blue fire, his mother told him that he had been adopted. Going to Fallville, knowing that was where he was born, Malcolm sought out Dr. Gilmore. The doctor told him of his origins, and the enraged lad killed the doctor for having picked him to give to the other family.  Malcolm traveled around the world and got into trouble with the law. Upon his decision to finally confront Barry with his existence, he learned that his brother had become a policeman. Envious, Malcolm got a job as a janitor for a cleaning service used by the Central City Police Station. He watched Barry from afar, even witnessing the accident that gave him the power of superspeed. He grew to hate Barry for having everything that Malcolm thought should have been his own. He went to his adoptive grandmother, the mother of Hugo Thawne, to learn more about the blue flame the Thawnes wielded. It turned out that it was an art with many more capabilities than what Hugo and family had been using it for. Malcolm's grandmother taught him that the flame could steal anything that your heart desired, feeding on passion. Using this power, she taught him how to place his hatred for Barry Allen inside a talisman, which he wore on his chest. Malcolm drew his power from this talisman, and adopted a costume as the super-villain Cobalt Blue. When he faced the Flash and Kid Flash, he had the ability to steal their speed by enveloping them in his blue flame. After a battle at the zoo, Cobalt Blue appeared in Barry's lab, revealing his knowledge of Barry's identity. After a high-speed chase with a Flash created from the blue flame, Cobalt Blue was engulfed in his own blue flame. Wally thought that he had caught a glimpse of the face behind the mask, a very familiar one. Cobalt Blue surfaced again after Barry's death. He blew up the Flash Museum and attacked Barry's old house and his laboratory at the police station. He also robbed the original Flash, Jay Garrick, of his speed. Wally, now going by the Flash, tracked him down to Barry's tombstone, which Malcolm tricked Wally into destroying. However, Wally bought time by prompting Malcolm to tell his life story while he soaked up enough speed force energy to retaliate, defeating the villain quite quickly. *  Obsession: Although his hatred for the Flash Family allows him to activate his talisman it also becomes a major downfall to his battle-prowess and general well being by blinding him from true purpose. *  Blue Flame Talisman: Although unable to tap into the power of the Blue Flame, Malcolm was granted access to the Blue Flame through a talisman given to him by his adopted grandmother.     Energy Projection: Malcolm can burst his flame out of his body and sword causing flames to leap out of his person.  Energy Construct Creation: Malcolm can create objects out of his Flame and his favorite is his flaming blue sword.  Power Absorption: Malcolm used his hatred to channel the Blue Flame to steal objects and power from his enemies. In most occasions he uses this power to steal speed from the Flashes.  Superhuman Speed: Malcolm can reach incredible amounts of speed by using his Blue Flame to steal speed from opponents. He can steal multiple levels of speed from different sources and achieve speeds to assault even Wally West.       Healing: The Blue Flame was mainly used by the Thawne family to ""heal"" and presumably Malcolm has the same ability but he hasn't shown the ability to produce healing flames as of yet. >*  Energy Projection: Malcolm can burst his flame out of his body and sword causing flames to leap out of his person. >*  Energy Construct Creation: Malcolm can create objects out of his Flame and his favorite is his flaming blue sword. >*  Power Absorption: Malcolm used his hatred to channel the Blue Flame to steal objects and power from his enemies.

FlashTV,37ps8e,Aexsburg,10,Fri May 29 18:21:08 2015 UTC,You're not the only mate. I have nothing against same sex relationships I just wished they ended off on a note that didn't appear to pander just to shippers. It's my main gripe with the arrow season finale as well.
FlashTV,37ps8e,Jezamiah,9,Fri May 29 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"It wasn't pandering though... both Avatar series ended with a relationship. The creators had wanted to do this for a while, but partially hadn't had the chance to set it up because of all the network troubles. But they asked Nick during S4 and they said they could imply it, so they set up some subtle flirting, and that ending, because they had wanted to.  Also at the end of the day, it helped a lot of homosexuals, so I don't mind for that reason alone."
FlashTV,37ps8e,8eat-mesa,6,Fri May 29 19:42:28 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with differing opinions. I would have just preferred a different ending
FlashTV,37ps8e,Jezamiah,-5,Fri May 29 19:55:46 2015 UTC,":D  I mean, even as someone who doesn't think same sex relationships are good (based on my religious beliefs), that wasn't my main problem. The series just ended with bad story telling. I greatly appreciate the handling of the same sex relationship (Captain Singh + his bf/fiance) in The Flash, as they feel real (and not like a statement) and they don't detract from the story being told. I actually enjoy that relationship more than many (most?) of the other relationships in the CWverse, if I'm being completely honest. Probably because the story doesn't revolve around it, and they're not purposefully characterizing them purely as a love interest but as people.  But Korra? Good grief, they sidelined closure for other main characters (BOLINBOLINBOLIN) in order to bring it about, and then the creators came around and basically took a dump on anyone who called them out for the ending, claiming those who didn't like it or didn't see it coming had ""heternormative lenses"" on. Well, excuuuuuuse me princess for thinking they were closer to a Frodo/Sam friendship (which I absolutely adore, and I wish more storytellers would incorporate friendship/ non-romantic forms of deep love into their works) than heading down the road to a romantic relationship.  Ugh, it makes me upset. I had higher expectations of them. But it is nice to come across those few who agree, since I don't get to talk with them often, haha."

There was literally nothing she could've done to defeat Korra after witnessing her literally stopping a fucking giant ass spirit cannon from killing her without even so much as some hesitation on her part. At that point she finally realized the raw power Korra actually possessed and their heart-to-heart made her realize she was causing more harm than good for the people of the EK.  I'll admit they should've alluded to her back story more over the course of the season(and we might've if they weren't forced to create a clips episodes after Nick slashed their budget), but I think they wrapped her character up decently. Plus it demonstrated Korra's growth over the entire series finally culminating to this one moment where she had a chance to prove it."

Barry goes back in time and kills 1999 Thawne, saving Nora, and preventing him from killing 1999 Wells. 2015+ Thawne was moving through the timestream as Barry made the change, making him a walking paradox, immune to changes in the timestream.  The ripples, or ""Time Boom"", as it were, caused by Barry create a number of slight changes.

They turn it on, which results in a sizeable Metahuman population. Barry and his parents were off visiting relatives, so he was not in Central City to receive his powers.  Malcolm Merlyn takes Rebecca's call and hears that she is in trouble. He tells Moira, and she offers to drive him to the Glades. When he arrives, the gunman shoots and kills Moira. Malcolm knocks him out and has him arrested, saving Rebecca's life. Robert blames him for the incident, severing their friendship. From this point onwards, Robert sees the Glades as a plague upon his city. He attempts his own undertaking, but is thwarted by Malcolm, who has become a vigilante known as The Arrow. In this timeline, the Queen's Gambit never set sail. Oliver is simply a reckless billionare, and Thea was never born.    Flash to today. Our Barry Allen awakes in the new timeline to find the world has changed around him.  Eventually, he learns of the massive war that is occuring. ARGUS, led by Amanda Waller, has decided that metahumans are a serious threat to the public, and are attempting to bring them all into their custody. Notable forces on ARGUS' side include The Suicide Squad, Maseo & Tatsu, and Digger Harkness & Slade Wilson of ASIS.  The metahumans, led by Citizen Cold, are fighting for their freedom. Their ranks include Killer Frost, Vibe, Gorilla Grodd, Heatwave, and many more.  Barry, not willing to go to STAR Labs in fear of encountering Eobard while powerless, heads to Starling. Unable to find Oliver, goes to see Felicity, who is working IT after hours at Queen Consolidated. He mentions ""The Arrow"", and she knocks him out. He awakes in the Quiver, with Malcolm Merlyn looking over him. Barry explains the situation, and after a time, Merlyn believes him. He flies with him to Central City, to meet with the original Harrison Wells. Merlyn explains the situation, and Harrison reactivates the Particle Accelerator, giving Barry his speed back.  Barry runs off to fight both sides and confront Thawne.    This is all I have right now. It's not complete, but it should give you an idea of where I was going with it."
FlashTV,37smfr,TriumphantBass,5,Sat May 30 06:15:28 2015 UTC,"Omg, reading this makes me so hype. You've convinced me, CW NEEDS to do a Flashpoint in live action at some point, maybe when it's time to cancel both shows, they could do Flashpoint as the big finale sendoff.  The only thing is, Brick was apparently the guy who killed Malcolm's wife, so he wouldn't be knocked out that easily. We'd need to think of a way around that. Also Stephen Amell would need to play some kind of part."
FlashTV,37smfr,PiccoloBurntToast,2,Sat May 30 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"Also Stephen Amell would need to play some kind of part.   In the scope of things, I don't see him as much more than a billionare playboy, but here's the most feasible alternative that I can come up with:  He plays the role of Thea. After his father is arrested for the undertaking, he is taken into Malcolm Merlyn's custody, as despite Malcolm and Robert's rivalry, he was still named as Oliver's godfather years earlier. A few months before our story begins, Malcolm and Tommy let him in on their operations. He is understandably upset with being lied to for several months, but eventually gets over it. Merlyn trains Oliver to keep him safe, with the constant threat of war surrounding him.   The only thing is, Brick was apparently the guy who killed Malcolm's wife, so he wouldn't be knocked out that easily. We'd need to think of a way around that.   I forget, what exactly was the deal with him? He wasn't metahuman, but seemed to have skin, well, like a brick. Was he born like that? If not, it may be before he gained that ability. If so, I feel like Malcolm could still catch him off guard with a nearby crowbar or something."

FlashTV,37smfr,kunasaki,1 point,Sat May 30 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"It's feasible, but I really want Tommy to fill that Red Arrow/Arsenal role. More importantly, I don't see pre-Island Oliver jumping at the opportunity. Without the island, he's missing five years of experience, and the influence of Yao Fei and Slade Wilson, both of which played a large role in his character development.  Roy wanted to make a difference, to be a better person. I think without Ollie's character development, he would simply shrug off the near-death encounter and move on with his life.  Merlyn was able to get Thea up to speed in a few months between season 2 and season 3, and I imagine he could do the same for Ollie."
FlashTV,37smfr,TriumphantBass,3,Sun May 31 00:05:50 2015 UTC,"A few other things of note:   As the Queen's Gambit never set sail, Sara never got involved with the League of Assassins or Nyssa. Neither her nor Laurel become Canaries.  Quentin Lance is a well respected police captain who has his life together. As Rebecca was not the one who was murdered, Malcolm never crosses the threshold to kill anyone. As a vigilante, he holds firm to his no kill rule. He hesitated for a few years, but finally decided to take his only son, Tommy, under his wing to join his crusade to save his city, teaching him archery. With Robert Queen in charge of Queen Consolidated, neither Isabel Rochev nor Ray Palmer were able to weasel their way in and aquire Queen Consolidated.  (EDIT: If he gets arrested for the Undertaking, I would have Walter Steele operate in his stead, carrying out business as Robert would have willed it.) Sebastian Blood found and recruited a scientist named Anthony Ivo (who was never killed on Lian Yu), who helped him refine and mass produce the Mirakuru serum. Ivo successfuly mitigated the negative effects of the drug, and Blood used the serum to create an army. He set the army loose in the city to generate the chaos needed to support his campaign platform (that Starling needed saving). Blood's election was thwarted by Malcolm Merlyn, and he was arrested for corruption.  ARGUS then recruited Blood to the Suicide Squad. ATOM got his suit fully operational (with shrinking), and went public. He works for the government in a similar fashion to War Machine in Iron Man, placing him in roughly the same role as Cyborg. He becomes dissillusioned and decides to help the metas. Diggle is called in by ARGUS to drive an experimental weapon into the Metahuman front. Much like Green Lantern in Flashpoint, he is quickly defeated. Not weighed down by caring for Oliver, Yao Fei succesfully defeats Edward Fryers and saves his daughter, Shado. The two of them eventually cross paths with Merlyn (during an international mission of his) and decide to join him. Iris lives in a different household from Barry, so he is able to voice his feelings much sooner than if they were living together.     During the course of the event, I would expect Harrison Wells to devise a powerful serum to counteract a speedster's ability, which Merlyn will shoot at Thawne to give Barry enough time to go back and stop him from stopping Thawne. Inside STAR Labs, Vibe will get Barry set up on the cosmic treadmill and help him get back to the past."

FlashTV,37smfr,HPSpacecraft,1 point,Sat May 30 06:06:57 2015 UTC,"Really the only important characters in The Flashpoint Paradox are Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Batman, Flash and Reverse Flash.  As for who they'd be... Adaptations are fun, kids.  Deathstroke I think would end up being the Captain of the Amazo with a squad of Mirakuru Soldiers and Metahumans, they would be looking for Shado who would have no longer died in this version.  Instead of Citizen Cold being Snart, it'd be much cooler (ha!) to me if Caitlin was under that identity instead. Having lost Ronnie twice (with no Flash she wasn't able to separate him and Stein in time, and they both died for real.) if Killer Frost hasn't shown up by then, it's also a nice nod to that.  Starling still gets hit by the Earthquake only it goes off as Malcom planned rather then just having one device go off, he does get killed by Robert, going by the code name the Archer, during said quake, Moira, Thea and Roy all die.   Diggle becomes a permanent agent of Argus with Lyla instead of joining up with Robert and leads the suicide squad on all it's missions: Including an attempt to stop Aquamans(or whomever they get to replace him) WMD, but the attempt fails and like so many others, he dies.  Cisco is locked up in an Asylum speaking crazy talk because he can remember every timeline, not just the Flashpoint and TV one and he can't ever turn off access to these memories. He's the one that gives Barry the clue on how to find the Reverse Flash at the end of things.  Oh, and just so Barry has to screw up happiness for people for an extra gut punch, He and Iris are Married, have kids and are living wonderful lives. Joe is retired and has a successful book out so he's also living rather comfortably and despite sometimes missing days in the field, he's much happier being a grandfather."

I'm very convinced that the difference of technical quality would be screaming (for example, most villains don't even have a good/real costume and the filming locations are very limited) and a handful of actors are not qualified enough to simply pop up in the big screen, plus the plot holes it could generate and the difference of mood between the universes (TV is more soapy, cinemas tends to be way more focused on the epicness itself while TV thrives with it's budget).  TL;DR  Cinematic Universe will make TV Universe feel like fan-productions"
FlashTV,37qzg2,Otacon_Kunvention,15,Fri May 29 18:35:54 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that most of us imagine them being shared as it being acknowledged that they are part of a multiverse, not directly involved.  Unless it's a special 'verse crossing crossover."

FlashTV,37qzg2,Pickles256,4,Sat May 30 18:51:29 2015 UTC,Or poorly acted
FlashTV,37qzg2,NorthernRealmJackal,-2,Fri May 29 20:16:27 2015 UTC,"I made this in reply to another part of the thread, but I makes better sense here, so I moved it:  I think any misandy that this may imply, lies with the casting team, rather than with the fanbase. The female cast (of the CW-verse in general) is generally very pretty, and consists of fairly bad actors (on average at least). One can't help thinking that it is as if they were cast for their looks alone.. Notice how the male cast, in comparison, have many average looking (or at least not hot) actors, that are clearly there because they can act (and these are just the recurring ones): Joe, General Eiling, Dr. Stein, Dr. Wells, Capt. Signh, Capt. Lance, Maseo, Ra's, both Barry/Oliver's dads, Walter Steele, Vertigo, Clock king, Heatwave, and a load of other recurring villains + maybe Cisco. Add to this, the arguably hot guys, who also acts pretty well: Barry, Ollie, Diggle (!!!), Capt. Cold, Merlyn, Tommy, Deadshot. Those I haven't mentioned are largely bad actors, in my humble opinion.  Anyways, how does this look for the female cast? Recurring female actors in the DC/CW-verse who aren't hot: Moira Queen, Felicity's mom, Dr. McGee, maaybe Sin and maaybe Tatso Yamashiro (Katana), IDK.. Recurring female actors who are hot, and can act: Tatso Yamashiro, Amanda Waller, Lyla Diggle, maybe one or two villains like Peek-a-Boo, IDK..? Some would say Felicity, although I'd have to respectfully disagree. Overall a very hot, and largely unskilled segment of the cast.  Does this mean that all hot chicks are poor actors? Definitely not, but somehow, in the CW-verse, they seem like they are cast for their looks first, and their skills second.  I'm no third-wave-SJW, who thinks this whole thing is some massive patriarchal conspiracy. I just think there's an unnecessary pattern in their casting of women, that could have lead to better acting overall, if taken into account earlier. It's of course a touchy subject, so feel free to disagree with me on some of the particular characters.."
FlashTV,37qzg2,Ktk_reddit,2,Sat May 30 15:17:28 2015 UTC,Can you give an average for the ratings /10 ?
FlashTV,37qzg2,LiquidTeaQ,0,Fri May 29 20:22:45 2015 UTC,The drama and connections in Arrow and the Flash are very similar. Both have a love interest with a secret way of contacting the hero (phone/blog). Everything revolves around secrets and lies.  Still love the show though :D

FlashTV,37t4b3,SuperCosmicNova,3,Mon Jun 1 05:06:03 2015 UTC,Eobard didn't kill Barry's mom so that he wouldn't become the Flash.   Eobard killed Barry's mom out of anger because Flash and young Barry got away. Eobard didn't know he would lose his powers in doing so/letting Barry get away. And yes Barry did become the Flash in a timeline where his mom is alive.   Edit: Eobard originally intended to kill Barry to stop him from becoming the Flash. And from my understanding Eobard didn't know how much he needed Barry in order to have speed force until after Barry got away.
FlashTV,37t4b3,poopoorrito_suizo,9,Sat May 30 06:41:42 2015 UTC,He outright states in the finale that he killed her to stop him from becoming the Flash...
FlashTV,37t4b3,FoxInDaBox,5,Sat May 30 15:36:20 2015 UTC,"He outright states in the finale that he killed her to stop him from becoming the Flash...   As the poster above you said, he killed her because he was mad. He wanted to kill little Barry, but older Barry saved little Barry, leaving her alone in the room with Thawne.  To support this: Reverse Flash Bot, you killed Nora Allen , correct?"
FlashTV,37t4b3,TriumphantBass,14,Sat May 30 17:04:59 2015 UTC,Reverse Flash bot   You called?   You killed Nora Allen   It was never my intention to kill Nora. I was there to kill Barry.
FlashTV,37t4b3,ReverseFlashBot,2,Sat May 30 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"No, he didn't simply kill her out of anger. Since he couldn't kill Barry, he killed her instead with the intention of preventing Barry from becoming the Flash. He had a purpose in killing her, not just to spite him. This was all stated in the finale."
FlashTV,37t4b3,FoxInDaBox,7,Sat May 30 17:17:20 2015 UTC,"Just finished the last episode and the memory's still fresh, Wells mentioned that he killed Barry's mother in order to cripple Barry's childhood as he thought that if he changes the variables, then Barry wouldnt become Flash. Little did he know that time works in mysterious ways and the consequences of doing so made him lost his powers, hence he became the one factor which made Barry Flash in the new timeline. Its ironic somewhat, to attempt to delete your nemesis before he is born but ending up as the reason for why he exists, but I thought that was pretty good writing."
FlashTV,37t4b3,wuulala,1 point,Sat May 30 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, Wells did say that time has a way to fix itself, when Barry told him about his first time travel (episode 15) and then we saw Cisco almost dying a couple of times in the next episodes, indicating that indeed time does tend to replicate the events that happened in the previous timeline."

There is definitely another timeline where Eobard didn't kill Nora, but she may have been killed by someone else or otherwise died before Barry became the Flash.  Given it took Eobard years of battling the Flash just to learn his identity in the original timeline, it's not unreasonable to think he has no idea when or how or whether Nora died in that timeline."
FlashTV,37t4b3,Tsorovar,1 point,Sat May 30 07:28:48 2015 UTC,"He wanted to kill boy Barry to prevent him from becoming the Flash, when he couldn't.. He decided to kill Nora in order to hurt Barry.

FlashTV,37sop9,Tristar_123,2,Sat May 30 13:17:47 2015 UTC,"Technically if all he wanted to do was ejaculate, it'd take even less than that. There is a specific vibrational frequency that can trigger ejaculation without climax or orgasm or really any kind of pleasure. They use it to help cripples like me freeze their sperm.   So if he knew that frequency, one of the Flash's superpowers could literally be jizzing on things at high speed."
FlashTV,37shzr,lce-Man,18,Sat May 30 01:01:48 2015 UTC,I would say it will happen but most likely later in the season. Plus hopefully Cisco figures out the flash ring or something.
FlashTV,37shzr,JMM44,4,Sat May 30 01:06:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe a slightly different suit if he does go into alternate universes?  Otherwise JMM44 is most likely right.  Cisco will give the updated suit with the white, like he had commented on, when he finds out how to do the ring."
FlashTV,37shzr,PM_BUTT_PICS,3,Sat May 30 01:34:48 2015 UTC,Given how much they keep teasing and alternate suit and how they keep saying the suit will evolve. I do think they intend to make a new suit for the next season.
FlashTV,37shzr,neoblackdragon,3,Sat May 30 02:14:15 2015 UTC,I really want to see a suit more like Future Flash's suit with the white emblem and the lighter red eventually.  Also the lightning on the current suit often looks off-centre to me.
FlashTV,37shzr,ProtoKun7,2,Sun May 31 00:29:30 2015 UTC,I would expect if we get an updated suit next season it will happen around midseason
FlashTV,37shzr,utlonghorn2016,2,Sat May 30 02:37:55 2015 UTC,Didn't they confirm the suit would evolve? It will likely get the white centre in the next season and hopefully they can fix how shitty the mask is.
FlashTV,37shzr,great9rejects,1 point,Sun May 31 00:37:27 2015 UTC,I think it would be unlikely especially if there would be more chances of interacting with future flash / past flash. Maybe in S3 / 4.

Then I think he would show up in the mid season finale of Flash and help in a firestorm-esque way in a confrontation against the seasons big bad. After which he'd probably reconcile with Carol, have a chat with the Star Labs team and then fly off to space."

FlashTV,37poe2,Future_Vantas,47,Fri May 29 14:14:10 2015 UTC,"I'd start him on Arrow, Ollie visits Coast City and gets flying lessons from a guy named Hal Jordan on the QT.  Some weird stuff happens in Coast City that connects to Hive, Ollie puts some arrows in the problem, and Hal teaches Ollie how to fly.  At some point during the flashback, Carol and Ollie exchange bodily fluids because CW drama, and this eventually causes some friction between Hal and Ollie.  The last thing Hal tells Ollie is something like ""I love you, but next time I see you, I'm gonna punch you in the face.""  In modern times, Ollie runs into Carol in Coast City, where he finds out that Hal went missing around the time Barry was forced to nap for the better part of a year.  Cross over to Flash, Barry goes in the wormhole and ends up in Earth 2.  He spends some time there, meets this cool old guy named Jay, and learns how to throw a halfway decent punch.  After a couple episodes, Team Flash finds a way to bring him back from E2, but by doing so it alerts some space baddie, maybe some low-level guy no one normally cares about, into some weird things going on in Earth.  This gets the attention of GL Hal Jordan.  GL comes to Earth to fight this alien, I'll call him Bob.  Bob is trying to set himself up in a good spot in Earth, but bites off more than he can chew.  He gets harassed by HIVE, loses a good deal of his tech, and is stranded on Earth.  Bob makes his way to Central City, cause wormhole particle accelerator, and tries using that to get home.  This is when he runs into the Flash.  Barry and Bob fight, with Bob one step ahead, until GL hows up.  Barry does a good job holding off Bob, but he can't get the upper hand.  When GL shows up, crap gets real.  Barry and GL beat Bob, but they learn that Bob's toys are in the hands of some bad people in Starling.  ROAD TRIP.  The whole time, Barry and Hal refer to each other by their code names, not real names.  Neither know who the other is.  On the next episode of Arrow, Ollie is fighting off a bunch of Hive people who use some of this alien tech.  Makes life a pain for Team Arrow.  As Ollie looks like he could use a bail out, here comes in the form of Team Christmas (Flash is red, GL is green, and its mid-season finale).  Ollie is confused by the big green fist until he sees Barry, knows he has good judgement of people (jk), so he must be a good guy, and all three join in the fight.  They win.  After the fight, Flash goes to introduce GL to Arrow, but they seem to recognize each other.  GL slips his ring off his right hand, and before the suit dissipates, GL cold clocks Arrow.  Flash stands in horror, he was not expecting that.  As Ollie gets back to his senses and ready to tear him apart, the suit vanishes and there stands Hal Jordan.  ""I told you I'd punch you in the face next time I saw you Ollie.""  Barry looks confused, and Ollie recognizes Hal.  Hal and Ollie bro-hug.  They all head back to the Arrow cave where, once again, Felicity blurts out Barry when she sees Flash.  This will become a running joke, every time Barry needs outed, let Felicity do it.  He's the only one she ever outs.  In the Arrowcave, which Hal calls it to Ollie's chagrin, they talk about aliens and stuff.  Diggle looks on like ""this stuff keeps getting weirder and weirder."""

FlashTV,37poe2,Taconinja10000,10,Sat May 30 14:04:36 2015 UTC,Oliver's gonna meet Hal in the flash back and ask for some flying lessons (Oliver landed a burning C-130 safely into the ground in the finale).   Oliver knows first hand knowledge of the GL already. I would assume he's keeping tabs on potential assets. So he already knows Hal is missing. So that's where Oliver and Felicity are actually going... To investigate the missing Hal Jordan. Plot plot plot they can't do it so they refer carrol to star labs. Plot plot plot we get GL season 3.

All that said, I still feel they will eventually show Hal Jordan, but I wouldn't be shocked at all if Alan Scott made an appearance.

FlashTV,37poe2,F1uffyTurtle,3,Fri May 29 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"For the show, I'd have it star John Stewart.  The reasoning for this is two fold, first, we know Hal has already started his journey, so we can start Stewart's hero origin fresh. Secondly, the best part of Green Lantern is the Earth Lantern's friendly relationship together.  So we see John Stewart, get his ring on the middle of a middle eastern battlefield. He becomes a lantern and finds out that his predecessor, Hal Jordan, vanished. So John's first mission as a Green Lantern is to find out what happened to Hal.  John Stewart traces Hal's life back to Coast City where he sets up shop with the help of a Irish looking cop named Guy Gardner.  Eventually his search for Hal leads him to Hal's mentor, Sinestro, who also vanished.  By the midseason finale, John finds out that Sinestro has betrayed the Green Lantern Corps and taken Hal in the attempt to convince him to join Sinestro's cause. Upon John learning of Sinestro's deeds, he's captured and teleported to Quard, the home of the new Sinestro Corps.   John's ring is left behind, now without an owner, it seeks out a viable replacement, Guy Gardner.  John, as a prisoner, finally meets Hal, just in time for Hal to complete an escape plan he's been working on for months. They take down a few Sinestro Corps members, and find several other Green Lanterns who have been killed by the Sinestro Corps. Hal and John take their rings and use them to escape.  Arriving home, Hal, John and Guy Garner now work together to stop the impending invasion of Sinestro's army."
FlashTV,37poe2,Future_Vantas,3,Fri May 29 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think Arrow may have an easier way of introducing Hal Jordan. The Arrow finale teases that Oliver might go to Coast City, there he meets Hal Jordan, teaches him how to drive a plane, and maybe even lives with him for a while until Ollie gets into an accident riding one of the planes and crash lands somewhere near or in Russia (This is all flashback fyi). In present day Ollie and Felicity visits Coast City and there Hal Jordan (back from being missing) spots Ollie and Felicity driving, eating, having sex on the beach, or doing whatever. Hal Jordan having recently obtained his ring asks Ollie for help (idk with what, I couldn't think of one lol). And of course Ollie respectfully says no because he's ""Retired"". Then Hal Jordan walks of in the sunset because he's got swag. Then we see him in the mid season finale again helping Ollie with whatever. I know this theory is poop btw lol.   P.S Hal Jordan knows who Ollie really is... How? because he's cool and is swagalicious."

FlashTV,37poe2,SwishDota,2,Fri May 29 22:40:06 2015 UTC,"I think the producers will take a page out of DC New Frontier: have Hal show up with the ring, but for reasons it'll be out of juice and the battery lost somewhere.  As such he didn't port to Oa: he either was ported somewhere else on Earth, or was snatched by ARGUS who wanted that alien tech.  Come time for Arrow/Flash crossover, a Green Lantern baddie is causing trouble, which brings Sinestro to Earth and gives Hal a chance to recharge the ring and become Green Lantern."
FlashTV,37poe2,THE_Batman_121,2,Fri May 29 20:11:28 2015 UTC,"If they're going to do Guy Gardner, I'd personally prefer it they used his original background where he was a teacher of kids with disabilities, and not an ex-police officer. I kind of hated in the comics that they reintroduced him in the '80s after about a decade of absence as someone who suffered brain trauma and subsequently became a complete jerk."
FlashTV,37poe2,Fiorbeth,2,Sat May 30 08:48:36 2015 UTC,"Screw Hal. Have him be ""lost in space"" GL. But because Earth needs a Green Lantern, have a hot headed former prison social worker Guy Gardner. Hating the aggressiveness brought out of him by working with inmates at Iron Heights he quit and became a gym teacher for special ed kids. Naturally drawn to at risk kids, his temper and crass attitude rubs people the wrong way. Especially abusive parents. But Guy never backs down from a fight, and really dislikes bullies. Deep down, he's a big ol' softie.   There's a reason the ring had to pick between Hal and Guy. Hal was just closer. And if he thinks the Flash isn't cutting the hero job to protect the little guys, you bet Guy will step on his toes to prove it. Not every hero has to be on Barry's good side. >:)"
FlashTV,37poe2,SuperCosmicNova,3,Sun May 31 01:24:16 2015 UTC,"What I want :  I want him to appear, full costume and everything, in the first episode of the season.  Cause I mean, lets be honest.  When a black hole that acts as a gateway to every time ever opens up on earth, and then closes, it's going to be noticed.  Especially when another one opens shortly after the first one is closed, and starts to suck the entire city / planet into it.  They could make it so Barry jumping into the 'tornado' as it were would have killed him, not thrown him into Earth-2, and he's saved by a giant green hand that grabs him and pulls him back.  Once the disaster is averted, have him fuck off back to doing SPACE SHIT and spend part of the season long B-story arc of them trying to figure out wtf happened and who that was, eventually revealing the backstory of Hal.  What I don't want:  Them to have ""Hal Jordan"" appear as a normal dude for a handful of episodes, only for us to catch only a glimpse of him becomming a Green Lantern, like they did with Barry in s2 of Arrow.  They should make Hal straight up a Green Lantern that's been doing it for at least a year or two at this point.  No more introducing a character and starting their origins please.  Have him already be active and do flashbacks if you really need to do his backstory.  Or just a giant info-dump monologue."

FlashTV,37sy5s,P2up1down,3,Sat May 30 03:23:43 2015 UTC,"In some continuities, there's the idea that the lightning bolt that struck Barry was Barry. Which they kinda seemed to be referencing, way back at the start, when Oliver said that the lightning bolt chose him.   It's also sometimes said that the speedforce was brought into existence when Barry was hit by the lightning, meaning that he needs to exist for other speedsters to have their powers. Which I kinda thought was linked to why Wells needed to create the Flash, so he could have speed? Or something like that."
FlashTV,37sy5s,maxyyb99,2,Sat May 30 14:45:18 2015 UTC,In the first episode wells claims the accelerator caused the storm but there has been nothing to show that that is true. As far as the audience knows barry was struck and wells may or may not have played a part in it.
FlashTV,37sy5s,LaLa1234imunoriginal,2,Sat May 30 04:15:04 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that Thawne mentions when assuming the guise of Wells that he needs to build the accelerator earlier than planned so he can get back to his own time. EDIT: Which requires Barry to become the Flash and create the speed force
FlashTV,37sy5s,KazukiS79,3,Sat May 30 04:04:04 2015 UTC,"Thawnes plan could have just as easily been spread metas get close and make the flash become fast enough in a more reasonable time, or get close so he can't stop thawne or get close so you can make sure things go as you want them(the timeline stays roughly the same)."
FlashTV,37sy5s,LaLa1234imunoriginal,1 point,Sat May 30 04:17:42 2015 UTC,I think the meta's were not his intention. The thing is he KNEW that day Barry would receive his powers.   What are the chances that his accelerator would trigger a storm and lightning bolt that would hit Barry? Sure lightning rod I guess.  But if he knew that Barry always get's his powers that day...
FlashTV,37sy5s,neoblackdragon,3,Sat May 30 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"Then again, he also needed to use Barry to collide with the particle in the accelerator to create the wormhole. That means the particle accelerator had more than one function if he needed the accelerator to create the Flash as well."
FlashTV,37sy5s,magicaltrevor953,2,Sat May 30 08:18:29 2015 UTC,"Which it did, because it was the accelerator catastrophically failing (intended by Eobard) that created the metas and (presumably) Flash, while it was the accelerator launching successfully (also intended by Eobard) that created the wormhole that allowed Barry to go back and would have allowed Eobad to go forward."
FlashTV,37sy5s,OmegaX123,1 point,Sat May 30 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"I don't read the comics, so correct me if I'm wrong. If I remember correctly, an aged Barry Allen becomes the lightning and strikes his past self, endowing him with superspeed.  If this is true, then perhaps the Particle Accelerator served as a lightning rod of sorts, drawing Barry's lightning to that particular location in spacetime."
FlashTV,37sy5s,TriumphantBass,1 point,Sat May 30 21:16:12 2015 UTC,By creating the particle accelerator explosion Thawne created more possible events for Barry to gain his Flash powers. He could have tried other things to make Barry the Flash before exploding the particle accelerator and hoping it would affect him. Additionally many other the metas gained their powers due to the materials they were around when the explosion happened. Perhaps Wells somehow engineered Barry's future to make sure he was around the chemicals needed to give him his speed when the accelerator exploded.

FlashTV,37rxp4,vballjenn1061,6,Fri May 29 22:13:55 2015 UTC,"I have posted this on SO many threads lately haha  First off, you have to know that there have been four people that have taken on the mantle as The Flash. They are Jay Garrick (40s-60s), Barry Allen (60s-80s, 2010-now), Wally West (80s-2010), and Bart Allen (06-07).  The two that get the most recognition are Barry Allen and Wally West. Here are some recommendations:   Barry Allen: Most of his stories are from the 60s-80s and I haven't read any of those. Just know that he sacrificed himself during Crisis on Infinite Earths and go from there.   Flash: Rebirth: This is the reintroduction of Barry to the DC Universe. It's a fantastic story and I highly recommend it. It features the Flash Family (Jay Garrick, Wally West, Bart Allen, Jesse Quick, and Max Mercury).  Dastardly Death of the Rogues: This comes right after Rebirth and Blackest Night(Green Lantern story) but it is still a Flash story. Rogues from the future come back to try and arrest Barry. It's a very fun story and I recommend it. Flashpoint: Probably the best Flash story I've ever read IMO. Major time travel consequences. If you watch the show, then you'll understand this story.  New 52 Flash series: After Flashpoint, DC did a reboot on a majority of the characters, and The Flash was one of them. This will retell the origin story of Barry Allen and explore his time as The Flash. It's a great story, and the artwork is phenomenal.   Wally West: Former Kid Flash, turned The Flash. He becomes The Flash right after the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.   Read this list in order to get a good taste of Wally West. I read a good majority of that list and got a good understanding of the character.  I hope this helps! Have fun reading!"

FlashTV,37rxp4,walterpinkman45,1 point,Fri May 29 23:07:33 2015 UTC,I believe Jay's last apperance as the main Flash was in ' '51 or '52. I know his main book ended in 1949 but I think he made team apperances for a couple years more.

FlashTV,37rxp4,walterpinkman45,2,Fri May 29 23:49:57 2015 UTC,"They're entertaining but very different. I can't speak for all franchises but as far as The Flash goes, you can read the early silver age books and they feel like Flash stories. The narration and dialogue are certainly done differently than modern comics but the plot, tone, and themes are the same as modern Flash books. The same can't really be said for Jay's books; they for the most part have a very different feel to them.   Golden age books in general are more like an extension of the newspaper comic strips than silver age-present comics IMO."

There's tons out there to read, so if you're like me and don't really have much money to spend, the New 52 is really quite good and an easy place to start reading. There isn't much (if anything!) in the New 52 volumes that you won't understand.  If you go pre-New 52, I've read Flash: Rebirth and Flashpoint. Both are great, but need more of a broader knowledge of the DC universe to understand some things, while the New 52 is more like ""pick it up and there's a story about The Flash""."

FlashTV,37t9dj,ThinboyBulk324,2,Sat May 30 05:14:50 2015 UTC,"Watching Arrow won't give you much background information on The Flash, aside from a couple of Arrow episodes Barry Allen appeared to becoming the Flash.  You can  enjoy The Flash without watching a single episode of Arrow, with the exception of cross-over episodes in which the characters from one show appear on the other.  However, the writers seem to be keeping the cross-over episodes fairly self-contained so that the audience of one show doesn't need to know everything that had been happening prior on the other show. But if you really want to watch them alternately, In my opinion, here is how to watch the two shows:   Watch Arrow seasons 1 & 2. Watch Flash season 1, episode 1  Watch Arrow, season 3, episode 1 Flash Arrow   and so on!"
FlashTV,37t9dj,IronpowerPublishing,1 point,Sat May 30 07:15:34 2015 UTC,I'd recommend looking up the airing order and watching it like that.
FlashTV,37t9dj,TheDangiestSlad,4,Sat May 30 05:57:25 2015 UTC,"The airing order is slightly flawed towards the end of the season because CW aired a new episode of Flash and rerun of Arrow during the same week. Or vice-versa. The order to watch it in is to sync up the episode numbers with Flash always coming first. So Flash 17 then Arrow 17 then Flash 18, Arrow 18 etc."
FlashTV,37t9dj,suss2it,5,Sat May 30 07:08:27 2015 UTC,This is correct... EXCEPT... The finale.  Flash 22  Arrow 22  Arrow 23  Flash 23  This happened because the producers actually adjusted the finales for the CW's scheduling error.  Also.... Episode 18 of Flash happens DURING episode 17 of arrow... Just before the Mayors office scene at the end.
