keming,3brqwj,autowikibot,2,Thu Jul 2 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"Monospaced font:       A monospaced font, also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space.  This contrasts with variable-width fonts, where the letters differ in size from one another, as do spacings in between many letters. The two high use letters 'I' and 'E' in both cases simply do not need the same footprint, while both differ in center to next letter edge (and center to center) spacing distance needs (margins) in variable width fonts. The variable that changes is the offset from what would otherwise be monospaced centering. In a modern proportional font every dimension can be scaled and change, but such sizing mathematically must still maintain monospacing or variable spacing.

Patterson, Webster's chemistry editor, sent in a slip reading ""D or d, cont./density."" This was intended to add ""density"" to the existing list of words that the letter ""D"" can abbreviate. The slip somehow went astray, and the phrase ""D or d"" was misinterpreted as a single, run-together word: Dord. (This was a plausible mistake because headwords on slips were typed with spaces between the letters, making ""D or d"" look very much like ""D o r d"".) A new slip was prepared for the printer and a part of speech assigned along with a pronunciation. The would-be word got past proofreaders and appeared on page 771 of the dictionary around 1934."

keming,3533ho,01hair,-3,Wed May 6 21:16:10 2015 UTC,I'm just saying there is an obvious space between creed and unity but the title doesn't separate them. I have no idea what keming is so maybe that's why this is all going over my head but thanks anyway.
keming,3533ho,BootStrapWill,3,Wed May 6 21:25:38 2015 UTC,"Kerning is the space between particular letters in a typeface. Keming is an in-joke, since it's what you get if the R and N in ""kerning"" are poorly kerned and they sort of merge. Sometimes, a typeface will err the other way and dramatically separate certain letters to avoid this problem.  Others are right that this isn't a kerning problem - it's a tracking problem.  The old Engrish text on chopsticks (""glonous history"") is also probably someone who doesn't know Latin lettering trying to blindly copy Latin letters R and I, but the font rendered them too close together due to bad kerning."
keming,3533ho,best_of_badgers,7,Thu May 7 13:48:15 2015 UTC,"Kerning is NOT the spacing between letters. Kerning is the adjustment of spacing between CERTAIN letter combinations. The general spacing between letters is tracking, which your image is an example of.  Kerning vs Tracking"

keming,332zb6,swuboo,-5,Sun Apr 19 11:48:07 2015 UTC,"No, it shouldn't.  I think this font is only called 'monospace' because it's a Courier knockoff, and Courier actually is monospace."
keming,332zb6,swuboo,11,Sun Apr 19 07:10:23 2015 UTC,Monospace refers to all fonts which have letters of equal width. Courier is just one example of a monospace font.
keming,332zb6,swuboo,-1,Sun Apr 19 11:52:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm aware of that.  Courier is a popular monospace.  This is a Courier knockoff in terms of letterforms, even though it's not a monospace itself.  Is the logic behind calling it 'monospace' to obliquely refer to the font they're ripping off so improbable?  Can you think of another reason this might even be called 'monospace' on your phone?"
keming,332zb6,AcellOfllSpades,3,Sun Apr 19 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"Look, the font name isn't ""monospace"". I don't know what the font is called, and it may well even be Courier, for all I know. But ""monospace"" doesn't refer directly to Courier. There are a lot of popular monospace fonts, but you are suggesting that Courier is somehow the ultimate monospaced font that all other fonts copy. I'm simply referring to this as a monospaced font because that is what it's supposed to be."
keming,332zb6,kelopez,-5,Sun Apr 19 21:19:06 2015 UTC,"Look, the font name isn't ""monospace"". I don't know what the font is called, and it may well even be Courier, for all I know.   Then your title was a bit misleading.  It's also obviously not Courier, since it isn't a monospace; it's very clearly a knockoff of one kind or another, with the letterforms changed just enough to avoid copyright.  (The miniscule i for example is slightly different in the serifs, and the e and a are slightly rounder.)   There are a lot of popular monospace fonts, but you are suggesting that Courier is somehow the ultimate monospaced font that all other fonts copy.   No, no I'm not.  I said Courier was monospaced, and this is likely called a monospace by way of reference.  I never said one word about Courier being somehow special.  I did not say all other typefaces copy Courier.  I said this one is.   I'm simply referring to this as a monospaced font because that is what it's supposed to be.    Alright, so what does your phone actually call the typeface?"
keming,332zb6,akcaye,17,Sun Apr 19 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is definitely a ligature in the font sense."
keming,332zb6,cybrian,19,Sun Apr 19 04:19:00 2015 UTC,"Ligatures, my friend."
keming,332zb6,cybrian,4,Sun Apr 19 01:52:54 2015 UTC,"Ligatures are nice and all, but this isn't just a ligature.  Monospace should have letters of the same width. This ""monospace"" puts two letters into one space if there are narrow letters next to each other."
keming,332zb6,juped,13,Sun Apr 19 02:32:20 2015 UTC,"It's a ligature. Ligatures are considered a single character and since this is a monospace font; it makes the fi ligature occupy the same space as any other letter would. So s + a + v + e + fi + l + e is 7 characters, as opposed to s + i + v + e + f + a + l + e, which is 8 characters. So the font is monospaced, except that ligatures make two letters occupy the space of one. Which frankly shouldn't happen because you almost certainly wouldn't need a ligature in a monospaced font since f and i would probably not overlap at all. But it is monospaced; it's just that the ligature is a bad idea."
keming,332zb6,wormeyman,20,Sun Apr 19 08:08:05 2015 UTC,"That is a ligature, in the font sense. That is a single encoded character that is substituted for the place of ""fi."" It is actually the program displaying the font that is making a mistake here."
keming,332zb6,benthatguy,6,Sun Apr 19 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, if the font had a decent substitute character, then the program wouldn't even be able to do this. Whoever designed the font actively decided that this would be a good idea."

Among Byron's best-known works are the lengthy narrative poems Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and the short lyric She Walks in Beauty.  Byron is regarded as one of the greatest British poets, and remains widely read and influential. He travelled widely across Europe, especially in Italy where he lived for seven years; later, Byron joined the Greek War of Independence fighting the Ottoman Empire, for which many Greeks revere him as a national hero.  He died one year later at age 36 from a fever contracted while in Missolonghi in Greece. Often described as the most flamboyant and notorious of the major Romantics, Byron was both celebrated and castigated in life for his aristocratic excesses, including huge debts, numerous love affairs with more than one gender, rumours of a scandalous liaison with his half-sister, and self-imposed exile.   He also fathered the Countess Ada Lovelace, whose work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine is considered a founding document in the field of computer science, and Allegra Byron, who died in childhood - as well as, possibly, Elizabeth Medora Leigh out of wedlock.

keming,2zifpf,ThatsJustAGuyinaSuit,6,Thu Mar 19 17:16:11 2015 UTC,You would think the printer (the prepress guy) would've picked this up.
keming,2zifpf,CDNChaoZ,6,Wed Mar 18 22:59:18 2015 UTC,"Nope, not part of their job, this is the designer's fault. As a prepress guy, you output what you're given, nothing more, nothing less."

keming,2zifpf,wdgiles,3,Thu Mar 19 13:33:05 2015 UTC,Really? Our prepress guy at the printer catches problems like this once in a blue moon and lets us know. Mostly from ads that were provided to us.
keming,2zifpf,CDNChaoZ,6,Thu Mar 19 14:08:26 2015 UTC,"Not saying it doesn't happen, Just that it should be caught much earlier than the final output. I always used a clean machine to test postscript output before sending disks out for print. (I know that dates me, when I was doing design work, we only had an ISDN line connected to AdSend, an AP service for distributing newspaper ads. Everything else was fedex'd out on a WORM optical disk to the printing houses.)"
keming,2zifpf,wdgiles,3,Thu Mar 19 13:51:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. 99.5% of the time it's caught during internal proofing or preflight, but strange things still happen. The case presented here is so blatant that multiple people should've caught it."

keming,2ygusd,akcaye,8,Mon Mar 9 20:12:59 2015 UTC,it's a bad idea to try teaching children to write a double-story a.   Why is that?
keming,2ygusd,amici_ursi,19,Mon Mar 9 21:18:56 2015 UTC,"It's overly complicated and impractical. It's one thing to teach them to read it, but there's no reason for a beginner to learn how to write it like that."
keming,2ygusd,akcaye,6,Mon Mar 9 22:57:20 2015 UTC,"I write my A's like that but it was only when I was older and I made a conscious effort to change the way I write them because I thought it looks nicer. The whole reading/writing exercise in the photo was poorly thought out. And the entire page is kerning hell.  And now poor Max will forever think that ""wo"" is a letter."
keming,2ygusd,PantyPixie,3,Tue Mar 10 13:13:37 2015 UTC,"It does look nicer, but it makes more sense to change it later like you, as opposed to learning it as you're learning to write at all while you don't need to make things as complicated.  As a side note: I don't know if these kids will ever use a pen when they're adults, I barely write anything now, and most of my friends seem to have a lot worse handwriting than they did when we were kids. This may be solely an artform soon. It happened to styluses and tablets. It will probably happen to pen and paper."
keming,2ygusd,akcaye,2,Tue Mar 10 13:44:02 2015 UTC,Thats a sad truth. I thought it was crazy to hear from teens that the hardest part of their SAT's was writing a paragraph in cursive!  The death of the analog watch seems eminent as well. Which is sad because I find analog watches & clocks to be quite beautiful. The new generation is growing up with digital time devices everywhere that they might not even learn how to read an analog.
keming,2ygusd,PantyPixie,2,Tue Mar 10 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's partly nostalgia. We moved on from a lot of things, I'm sure things that people at the time deemed beautiful... Convenience will pretty much always win, but we can find beauty and personality in new, convenient things too."
keming,2ygusd,akcaye,3,Tue Mar 10 14:09:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't miss cursive. I was always horrible at it. But I'm glad I at least know it. Now when I want to ""speak in code"" in front of a tween I'll just write it down in script like its a secret language. ;)  Knowing how to read an analog clock has its benefits as well. You can use it as a way to describe the location of something:  ""Check out that guy sitting at the table.""  ""which table?""  ""over there, 4:00"".  And you can tell the time of the day based on where the sun is located in the sky compared to the face of an analog clock. Which I think is a pretty important aspect that digital-only-folk won't be able to understand."
keming,2ygusd,PantyPixie,2,Tue Mar 10 14:20:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Even assuming one day analog clocks will be forgotten by the majority, I don't think they'll feel that something is missing. If it's really necessary to describe directions like that they'll probably find a new way to do it. Maybe they'll just use degrees!"
keming,2ygusd,akcaye,2,Tue Mar 10 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"I had to grade my college class's midterms last night. Not a lot of written work usually, since it's a CS class.  There were 2 or 3 students I couldn't even read their name. It took process of elimination to figure out who they even were. They wrote their names like some people write signatures, just kind of a squiggle on the page. I couldn't believe it."
keming,2ygusd,mscman,11,Tue Mar 10 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"It looks like it was supposed to be a different typeface, presumably one that let students trace over it, but the font was missing. That would explain the default Helvetica and the keming."

keming,2vv6c8,naught101,3,Mon Feb 16 00:56:58 2015 UTC,"Spotted dick:       Spotted dick is a cylindrical pudding popular in Britain, containing dried fruit (usually currants or raisins) and commonly served with custard. It is made from a flat sheet of suet pastry sprinkled with currants and raisins, which is then rolled up into a circular pudding.   The dish is first attested in Alexis Soyer's The modern Housewife or ménagère, published in 1849, in which he described a recipe for ""Plum Bolster, or Spotted Dick—Roll out two pounds of paste ... have some Smyrna raisins well washed..."". The Pall Mall Gazette reported in 1892 that ""the Kilburn Sisters ... daily satisfied hundreds of dockers with soup and Spotted Dick"".   The name has long been a source of amusement and double entendres, to the point that the catering staff of Flintshire County Council decided in 2009 to rename it to ""Spotted Richard"" because of all the jokes they were receiving.  While ""spotted"" is a clear reference to the dried fruit in the pudding (which resemble spots), ""dick"" is more obscure. The word was widely used as a term for pudding in the 19th century; in late 19th century Huddersfield, for instance, a glossary of local terms described ""Dick, plain pudding. If with treacle sauce, treacle dick.""  It could alternatively be a corruption of the word pudding, evolving through puddink, then puddick, then finally dick. Another possibility is that it is a corruption of ""dough"".

The OpenType version showcased some (then new) OpenType features, including ""set ligatures, true small caps, different numeral styles, and a variety of special alternate characters, such as the swash Capital Qu combination"".[3] This marks it out from earlier digitisations such as the OS X system version, which do not include ligatures such as Th and Qu.

keming,2t0yvo,psdtwk,1 point,Tue Jan 20 06:57:42 2015 UTC,Right: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter-spacing
keming,2t0yvo,autowikibot,0,Wed Jan 21 15:17:28 2015 UTC,"Letter-spacing:       In typography, letter-spacing, usually called tracking by typographers, refers to a consistent degree of increase (or sometimes decrease) of space between letters to affect density in a line or block of text.  Letter-spacing should not be confused with kerning. Letter-spacing refers to the overall spacing of a word or block of text affecting its overall density and texture. Kerning is a spacing adjustment of specific pairs of adjacent characters that, because of the relationship of their respective shapes, would appear to be too far apart if spaced normally. A classic example is a capital V next to a capital A in a seriffed typeface.  In its original meaning with metal type, a kern meant having a letter stick out beyond the metal slug it was attached to, or cutting off part of the body of the slug to allow (other similarly-trimmed) letters to overlap. So a kern in that sense could only bring letters closer together (negative spacing), though of course it was possible to add space between letters. Digital kerning can go in either direction. Tracking can similarly go in either direction, though with metal type one could only adjust groups of letters further apart (positive spacing).
