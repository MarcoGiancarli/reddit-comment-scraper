wicked_edge,3dg5qh,Jiraiyasama,7,Thu Jul 16 00:33:33 2015 UTC,"My order just arrived, and just in time to celebrate my birthday! I decided to take the plunge and get into wet shaving. I viewed a lot of the kits and decided to go with the Maggard starter kit, the soap I purchased separately on Amazon. I want to thank Casie and the team at Maggard for the excellent customer service I received! I'll update after I give it a test run.  Update: Yeah, never using cartridges again. I found it relatively easy to get the razor angle right and all those years of working in the kitchen paid off, the lather was pretty straight forward to make fortunately! Shaving my face and legs went pretty smoothly for my first time with a DE razor. I nicked myself twice on my ankle before I figured out how to position my foot properly. Thank you /r/wicked_edge for showing me that shaving doesn't have to be a chore!"

Since you're new to this everyone will tell you to buy sampler packs to find the right blade.  I did that and settled on the Astra blades, and bough a case of 100 for something like $10 on Amazon.

My local Dollar Tree carries it and I always found it to be a pretty decent glycerin soap. It also has a nice spice smell to it that is hard to describe. It's kind of like the Neutrogena smell but more intense.
wicked_edge,3dg5qh,rumbleinthegrundle,2,Thu Jul 16 01:15:28 2015 UTC,Is the pears soap for pre shave? Do you just wash your face with this before shaving or what?
wicked_edge,3dg5qh,PaperBagHat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:59:34 2015 UTC,I assume that's what he is using it for.  I used to use it for pre-shave. I felt like it was a bit redundant since the last thing I do for my shower is to wash my face thoroughly. It has a scent I really like so I keep buying it as bath soap. It's a nice change from the generic oceanic scent a lot of body washes are.
wicked_edge,3dg5qh,squeaki,2,Thu Jul 16 02:04:52 2015 UTC,I couldn't find it at a local Walmart so I ended up getting it at Amazon. Using the glycerin soap and then lather on top is amazing!

I decided to go for the S1 in the end, can't wait to use it, very excited. Hopefully it lives up to it's reputation. I went with the atlas handle to see how a shorter handle alters the shave- the barber pole pattern feels strangely satisfying to touch, much deeper grooves than the merkur 37c. I like it.

wicked_edge,3deinp,Leisureguy,2,Thu Jul 16 03:40:40 2015 UTC,"It may be that the rust you saw was from the blade, not from the razor. Some blades are prone to rusting (even though they are stainless), and the rust can stain the razor. Gillette Rubie blades are one example. You can usually remove the so-called ""tea stains"" with a soft toothbrush and toothpaste, which is a mild abrasive."
wicked_edge,3deinp,shawnsel,2,Thu Jul 16 21:04:55 2015 UTC,"So, how'd the first shave go?"
wicked_edge,3deinp,Nusquam-Humanitus,2,Thu Jul 16 15:12:25 2015 UTC,"One word-amazing! So smooth, yet so efficient. Very nice weight with the atlas handle. Shaved three times with it so far, very impressed-that's not just me trying to justify its expense, but it actually DOES give an incredible shave (at least for me).   Edit. Have only used polsilver SI blades with it so far."
wicked_edge,3deinp,arbarnes,2,Fri Jul 17 22:44:43 2015 UTC,"Great razors. Watch the weight. Most likely, it will take a little time to adjust to it. Give it at least 12 shaves to make a full assessment."
wicked_edge,3deinp,Leisureguy,2,Wed Jul 15 17:38:33 2015 UTC,"Good advice. Thanks. My other razor is an iKon DLC slant with a SE handle, I've trained myself to be cautious with the weight of that, as it is quite heavy. Hopefully muscle memory will help me."
wicked_edge,3deinp,arbarnes,2,Wed Jul 15 17:55:38 2015 UTC,"I find the S1 much more comfortable than the iKon slant. Congratulations, and good luck!"
wicked_edge,3deinp,Leisureguy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:19:09 2015 UTC,"I think you're referring to the iKon stainless slant, rather than to the iKon #102 slant. I agree that the S1 seems to be a bit more comfortable: the iKon stainless is very picky about pressure. But (at least for me) the #102 and the S1 were about the same in terms of comfort and efficiency---in doing a shave and using both razors, I could detect no difference, though over the long haul some slight differences might become more noticeable. And given the sameness in comfort and efficiency, the #102 ($75---when available) is much better bang for the buck than the S1 ($185)."
wicked_edge,3deinp,Nusquam-Humanitus,2,Thu Jul 16 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"I think you're referring to the iKon stainless slant   Yes I am, because that's the iKon slant being discussed here. Or at least it was.  But to sidetrack a little more, I just don't get the whole slant thing. The S2 was a very good razor, but if anything it was just a tiny bit more efficient than the R2 for me. And I flat-out dislike the 37c and the iKon stainless. Haven't tried the #102, and probably won't.  I borrowed a Wolfman WR1 for a week, and found it significantly better than anything else I've used. It shaved me closer than the Standard, ATT R1, and other mild-efficient razors, while being significantly more comfortable than the R41, ATT H1, and others that fall on the extreme end of the efficiency spectrum. Once James has filled my order, I'm done trying new razors. (And this time I mean it. Really.)"
wicked_edge,3deinp,repete66219,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"Right. But since iKon has two slants, I thought casual readers (who might be thinking about the #102) would think you were referring to that one. Just a clarification."

wicked_edge,3deinp,Kubi74,-20,Wed Jul 15 18:02:49 2015 UTC,Holy crap! I just went to their site... why are they charging so much?!  Its just 303 aluminum not even a coated metal?  Fuck that.  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CLH5MG/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&qid=1436985810&sr=1&keywords=slant
wicked_edge,3deinp,MrTooNiceGuy,8,Wed Jul 15 18:43:45 2015 UTC,It must be nice to be able to form such strong opinions in the absence of any facts.
wicked_edge,3deinp,Kubi74,-14,Wed Jul 15 19:18:11 2015 UTC,Oh please enlight me on how a piece of machined aluminum is worth more besides the fact that idiots are willing to pay for it?
wicked_edge,3deinp,MrTooNiceGuy,6,Wed Jul 15 23:47:04 2015 UTC,It's stainless steel. It wears out the expensive tooling in the expensive CNC machine that uses expensive electric motors and expensive cutting fluid to make precision cuts.
wicked_edge,3deinp,Kubi74,-10,Thu Jul 16 00:16:31 2015 UTC,"Expensive cutting fluid? you know you can just use some simple green right?  and by the way real cutting fluid isn't expensive.  Bits cost 5 - 20 dollars.  and do you really think using a machine for it's intended purpose will ""burn the motor out""? People cut titanium on those machines, it'll eat aluminum like nothing.  You can pretend like it cost them alot to make and that it was expensive, If I had to put a number on it, those guys have a margin of more than 90%  But I can clearly see this is not the place for logic.... it's a circlejerk, nothing new.  Enjoy!"
wicked_edge,3deinp,MrTooNiceGuy,6,Thu Jul 16 00:29:30 2015 UTC,"I mean, how many times do you need to be told they're stainless steel?    And the point was, if you're going to invest in a machine up front, you need to recoup that investment somehow. Materials aren't what are being charged. It's the risk of investment and time needed to come out of the red.    If the profit margin at $180 is 90% on materials, but you paid a total initial investment of $100,000 to start your machine shop, you're going to need to make 600 razors to break even.  I never said anything about burning out motors. Just that they're expensive. It's those $5-10 bits that wear out when you're cutting stainless steel (in case you needed another reminder).  Suggestion: 1. Go start a business. 2. Invest your own money in it. 3. Be thankful that you're running your business in a perfect vacuum and there are no operating costs, your one machine never breaks down, and still see your books sit in the red for a long ass time. 4. Be thankful you live in a perfectly ignorant world. 5. Profit $$$$$$$$$$$"

You did not disprove or negate any of the 3 points I made, the same 3 points which negated your original argument as to why they are charging that much.  And now we are here talking about how you are an expert in business operations.  I don't give a flying fuck what some guy invested into his business. how the fuck is it my responsibility to pay for their decisions? invest better maybe?  Oh no! not a 5 dollar bit! holy fuck the business is destroyed! do you think other shit in other business doesn't need replacing? the belts on conveyors go bad, do you see factories bitching about it? it's a cost of doing business, something that you as a ""business expert"" should be familiar with.

wicked_edge,3dg0ni,arbarnes,6,Thu Jul 16 14:26:02 2015 UTC,"It's actually pretty tough to make a great shaving soap. But a few years back /u/jbisinla decided to try to hack the process, and chronicled his efforts online. LA Shaving Soap Co. was the result. Because this information was widely available, lots of people adopted, worked with, and tweaked his formula. His open-source approach is one of the reasons so many great artisan soaps are available today.  That's not to say that other soapers haven't independently come up with outstanding products. The fact remains that you can't make great shave soap by accident.  I make soap. It's actually pretty good soap. But it's not shave soap. Lots of posts in soapmaking forums claim that it's easy to turn it into good shave soap. They're wrong. That's why most folks selling soap at farmers markets (who know little or nothing about really good shave soap) sell bath soap that has been modified a little bit. But it would never pass muster with anybody who knows what s/he's doing. They're not dishonest, just misguided.  There are almost certainly exceptions to this general rule. Maybe there's even somebody with a soap that blows away LASSCo, Barrister & Mann, and all the others. They may even have a product that will eventually put Martin de Candre and Czech & Speake out of business.

Soap makers will take their bath soap recipe, add clay, and slap a shaving soap label on it.  Olive oil has not been an ingredient in any successful shaving soap I've heard of.  However I understand that LA Shaving Soap (who make excellent shaving soaps) has taken this as a challenge and may offer a ""rule-breaker"" soap in the future which contains olive oil and clay and performs well.  So far this doesn't exist.  I broke my own rule a few weeks ago and bought one because the vendor said it was ""triple milled.""  When I got home, Google told me that the ingredients were an exact match for a ""melt and pour"" shaving soap kit available online from SFIC.  It's not bad soap, but it's the worst I've used in the past six months.  And the scent's a bit wonky.  At least it came with a sweet wooden bowl, turned by another local artisan.  The safe bet would be not to buy it.  If you want to risk it, here are the main things you should ask:   how did you develop the recipe? Is it a modification of the bath soap recipe? What other shaving soaps on the market have you compared it to?  If they really have something good, they should be able to name a major shaving soap vendor and say how their product compares to that.  I think a lot of these slipshod soap makers have either not tried their own soap for shaving, or don't understand how a proper shaving soap should behave.  Implicitly the assumption is that sub-par performance is OK for something made in a kitchen.   I love the idea of buying local products and supporting our hobby at a grassroots level.  But I don't want to support mediocrity.  There are lots of legit artisans who you can order from online, such as Mickey Lee, Barrister & Mann, and Dr. Jon's."

wicked_edge,3dg0ni,Greyzer,3,Thu Jul 16 06:13:47 2015 UTC,"I used a ""farmers Market"" type shaving soap for years. the lather sucked and the shave was passable. It was better then regular bar shower soap. We are going back about 12 years now.  I now use a  shave soap with stearic acid, coconut oil, tallow, castor oil, shea butter and lanolin. I think  you have a good idea of what to look for in ingredients, so go with your gut. Really, how wrong could you be?"

wicked_edge,3dg0ni,soeasy11,5,Thu Jul 16 15:44:23 2015 UTC,"The one pointer I could give you to 100% ensure you don't buy a crappy shaving soap is this: don't buy a soap at a local farmers market.  I'd probably pick up some regular ol' bath soaps from an farmers market artisan, but that's about the extent of it.  There's an old idea that adding clay to soap turns regular soap into shaving soap.  That type of thinking seems to run rampant at the farmers markets circuit.  I get the feeling that high quality shaving soap makers all know each other from the internet, that's where they learned the basics of their craft, and probably where they sell their soaps."

wicked_edge,3dh83x,Zpearo,3,Thu Jul 16 06:37:27 2015 UTC,There were two group buys at /r/Wet_Shavers recently. A minimun order of 500 knots  was the only way to buy in bulk. They were 24 & 28mm plisson-type synthetic knots. The 28mm came to $2.65 each.       Maybe someone on this sub could organize a group buy. 500 knots would be claimed in no time. If you charged an extra dollar per knot it would be worth the hassle.

wicked_edge,3de92m,Zbignew2,42,Wed Jul 15 16:16:57 2015 UTC,"I just started using a DE razor recently, and I am hooked.  I never really had problems with ingrown hairs or razor burn. I don't think wet shaving is really much cheaper, and as you say, it's definitely not cheaper in the short run due to the initial investment.  In my experience so far, I have gotten the best, most comfortable shaves of my life. This is only after learning that no pressure means literally, zero pressure. This is because the blades are very sharp, and I guess my old way of using a cartridge razor until I absolutely had to switch them just stopped making sense. I always get my kitchen knives sharpened - it's inefficient and more dangerous to use a dull blade. Why would I stick to that in the kitchen, but not in the bathroom?  Why do I like it so much? One, it turns something that used to be an unpleasant chore into something I look forward to. I like lathering, and I like that you can get an incredible, artisan shaving soap for $13-$14 and really enjoy the scent of it. It really is a nice way to start the day. For comparison's sake, a bottle of $13 wine is often pleasant, but gone in an hour or two; the soap will last months and months. Is it cheaper? Sure if you really want it to be. But whether it's cheaper or not, what you're getting is very high quality for a fair price.  It does take me a bit longer than cartridge shaving, but I'm getting faster and faster, and I don't really mind an extra five or so minutes to do something that gives me a sense of satisfaction as I improve my technique and get better results.   I shave every other day, more than 150 times a year. If I'm doing something that often, I figure I oughtt to do it right. Wet shaving will lead you to consider what is best for you: a huge den full of kit, or your trusty razor, blade, a tube of Proraso, and some good witch hazel for a minimalist setup. Either way, it's your setup designed by you for you. Gillette is made for the lowest common denominator, and is designed to produce safe, consistent, but very average results.  How much convenience are you giving up? That's dependent on how you decide to do it and what your measure of convenience is. You will have to learn the ropes, so if you're not into that, then DE shaving is not for you. It's not for everybody. Then again, you're interested in it, so if you want to try it out, you can get a good set up for around $50 if you have the money. It's worth trying if you're interested, I think, even if you decide not to go with it. That way, you'll know what you really want and be satisfied with your decision. And of course you can give away/sell what you buy if you need to.  Here ends my rambling on this subject."
wicked_edge,3de92m,CorneliusNepos,11,Wed Jul 15 16:46:06 2015 UTC,This response is beautiful. Couldn't have said it better. Bravo.
wicked_edge,3de92m,Wickatron,7,Wed Jul 15 16:59:13 2015 UTC,"You're paying more up-front for greater value in the long run. I used to get perfectly fine shaves with cartridges and shave gel but I was forcibly extending the lives of the cartridges because of the price and they would get so clogged up with hair that it would be a chore to shave with them.   If you stick to the basics and not get caught up in the collecting, shaving with a safety razor will pay for itself in no time."
wicked_edge,3de92m,PantheraOnca,5,Wed Jul 15 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"I don't let my razors get clogged with hair, part of the reason I shave in the shower as the water is better for cleaning out the razor."
wicked_edge,3de92m,MundiMori,4,Wed Jul 15 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"I, too, shave in the shower. And would try to extend the life of my cartridges as much as possible; I would basically only switch out when on holidays when I could steal them from my parents house. I hate spending money when I don't have to.  DE is worth it. I can swap out blades constantly and get a quality shave every time instead of just when I get done pilfering my family's cabinets. Because no matter how much water you're running over that thing in the shower, the blades are getting duller each time. And after initial startup cost (which wasn't much more than getting a new Venus embrace or whatever would cost) I now have 100 blades and won't have to spend again if I don't want to for like... A year and a half?"
wicked_edge,3de92m,seroeth,6,Wed Jul 15 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"You may get a closer shave, and shaving will be a lot more fun - but more time consuming. If you're satisfied with your current setup, you may not want to switch.   I switched because I got ingrown hairs/bumps horribly bad with the disposables - they just mangled my face. DE shaving is much easier on my skin.  That being said, I bought a 100 pack of Astra Platinum blades for $10. I only shave 1-2x weekly, so they're going to last for a very, very long time.  http://www.amazon.com/Astra-Platinum-Double-Safety-Blades/dp/B001QY8QXM"

Getting into this kind of shaving probably saves money for like 1% of people, because you naturally buy a number of things to experiment with. The shaves are not that much better for me personally, I just like the old-school aesthetic. The brush and cream is really nice though, and you can find some creams that really do good for your skin. If you're getting good shaves with your current set-up there's no reason to get into it unless you just want to experiment. You wont save any money though, at best you'll break even over the years."

wicked_edge,3de92m,BluShirtGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:41:15 2015 UTC,"I think the ""cost saving"" argument is stupid.  I shave my head and face and for my head, I still use a cartridge.  I shave my face with a straight first, then clean up with a DE (or just use a DE) simply for the process.  I have a lot going on with work and family and just general stress and shaving takes me away for as long or as little as I need.   I will say for the first year, there was hardly any difference.  Now that the routine is down, the comparison isn't even there.  The shave I get with the straight and DE are silk compared to a cartridge.  I didn't have ingrown hairs or cut myself or whatever.    With all that said, you don't have to spend a crazy amount of money.  I have 2 DEs, a single straight, 2 creams, 2 scuttles, and 2 brushes.  Why the 2 of everything except for straights? I travel once a month and I got tired of packing my bathroom bag so I have one set that is always ready to go/in my suitcase.  The other is in my bathroom. You could easily get away with a single blade, no bowl, a brush and some soap.    Is it for everyone? Probably not.  But I was interested in the how before I was really interested in the outcome.

Other stuff is a case to case thing, as most people do get a lot of savings... others, like myself, spend a bit more..."

Most of the people here are annoyed by the high price of razor cartridges, and drawn by the coolness factor.  Unless you're unwilling to turn shaving into a hobby, you are welcome to join us.  But who knows, you may have something better to do."
wicked_edge,3de92m,arbarnes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:44:30 2015 UTC,"I think the cost of shaving argument is also stupid, because the proponents of DE say it's cheaper yet they buy multiple expensive razors, multiple badger brushes, soaps, etc. Then you need to try different blades to see which one you like. However, you're supposed to be saving money because the blades cost $0.10 each? There is a larger initial investment and you will need to be shaving for a while before it pays off."
wicked_edge,3de92m,4to6,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:06 2015 UTC,"Cost is not the biggest factor for me, but it is a factor.  I doubt I will ever hit the level of . . . snobbery that at least one person replying has gotten to.  It just isn't my style.  So my expense level likely will only rise the first year, after that it will likely fall to about where I am right now, barring breakage."
wicked_edge,3de92m,seroeth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"The multiple expensive razors, multiple brushes, and soaps are totally up to the individual: he purchases them only if he wants to. A blade sampler pack, though, is pretty much a necessity, but it's a one-time purchase of around $10. Quite a few choose to use just one razor, brush, and soap. If you want to buy more, you can, but it's completely voluntary and, presumably, done by those who find the additional purchases worthwhile."

I have very soft hair that's very slow growing.  I was able to get by shaving only twice a week.  And it was a chore and my neck was always irritated.  I tried electrics and those were worse on my neck.    Needless to say I spend more money on shaving since I switched to DE shaving and I also shave every other day now.  My neck isn't as irritated, though I still have occasional red bumps.  The difference is I look forward to shaving now.  It's relaxing and therapeutic, a great stress reliever.  And being a gun guy, this is a very inexpensive hobby comparatively."
wicked_edge,3de92m,MundiMori,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:57:26 2015 UTC,Simple.  It's time you started looking forward to your shaves.
wicked_edge,3de92m,Wickatron,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"You seem to be misinformed about the cost of DE shaving. Yeah, you can spend hundreds of dollars on stainless steel razors, silvertip brushes, custom scuttles, and soaps made by French artisans. But you can get a RiMei razor for about $3, an Omega S-Brush for under $10, and a small tube of CO Bigelow shave cream for $5. A 20-blade sampler will set you back another $10 or so, but once you've found your favorite you can buy in bulk for as little as $0.06 each. And you don't need anything else.  Thing about it is, you'll have to learn to use the tools. It's not like a can of goo and a cartridge where you spew some stuff out, rub it on your face, then apply the razor and pull. You have to learn to make a good lather. You have to learn proper blade angle. You have to un-learn the habit of using pressure. And shaving in the shower without a mirror will make all these things more difficult.  Once you've got everything dialed in, shaving is quick and convenient (I take about four minutes each morning for a three-pass shave). And the shave quality is much, much better. But unless you're committed to spending the time and effort it takes to use a DE razor effectively, you're just wasting your money. Even if it isn't that much.  Edited for clarity."
wicked_edge,3de92m,here_to_fuck_up,-2,Wed Jul 15 19:10:41 2015 UTC,"The razor companies have been deceiving you. Four blades? Really? Do you think four blades are better than one blade? Do you buy the silly graphics they use in their commercials? I use a double edge because I know the commercials are garbage, and I want to stick it to Gillette and the rest of them. The only reason anyone is using double, or triple, or ""quattro"" or five blades or whatever ridiculous shit is being promoted on the television is because they have been brainwashed into buying it. There is no advantage at all to more than a single shaving edge. Safety razor shaving is my way of telling the big razor companies to go fuck themselves."
wicked_edge,3de92m,Karnblack,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:00 2015 UTC,"So, you get a better shave with DE?  That is really what I am interested in.  Not the 'experience' of shaving.  It is a job that needs done, that is all."
wicked_edge,3de92m,Karnblack,3,Wed Jul 15 16:47:49 2015 UTC,"So, you get a better shave with DE?   You absolutely can. 3 passes, with the grain, across, and against will give you a very close shave. If you've ever had a barber give you a straight razor shave, it's like that but every day."
wicked_edge,3de92m,Karnblack,2,Wed Jul 15 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"I do. Before starting DE shaving, I thought my shaves were good... Now I know they weren't."
wicked_edge,3de92m,Karnblack,2,Wed Jul 15 17:03:50 2015 UTC,"Better shave, and less irritation by far because you're cutting at the skin, not pressing down to pull the hair up and cut below it. With a cartridge razor I had no choice but to let a couple days stubble grow in bikini-wise before I could shave without scraping my skin to hell. With a DE I can do it three days in a row no problem."
wicked_edge,3de92m,cwaniaczek,2,Wed Jul 15 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"This is pretty subjective. If your only looking for a quick close shave with no irritation and your current razor does that, then DE may not be better. It will take some time and some new equipment and new technique, but for most guys it can definitely provide a much batter shave than cartridges. I had major ingrown hairs and irritation with them which is why I switched, and for me a DE absolutely is a better shave. But if your current setup gives you a good shave then you might not need a DE. Even if you like your razor I would try getting a good, cheap brush like the Omega S ($10) and some better cream or soap (see the sidebar - a lot of good options here). These two components will definitely improve your shave even if you keep your cartridge razor."
wicked_edge,3de92m,butylparaben,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:07:31 2015 UTC,"I'm new to DE and loving it.  That said, the cartridge way of life was great for the first shave.   If you really are only using 7 of them a year, I imagine you're like me: pushing that beat up blade one more time, for one more shave. You keep using it until it feels like you're dragging barbed wire across your face. You finally throw it away and all is forgiven because that next new cartridge blade is so great. You're like a beat up spouse, happy to get a reprieve.   DE shaving is always like the first cartridge shave. Maybe better.   I don't stress about the cash because ten cents is so close to nothing. However, if you can afford new cartridges and it isn't anything to you, you may consider just keeping your situation going.  Although, I feel like a fucking man when I lather up my face in the morning and bust out my grandfather's DE."
wicked_edge,3de92m,Nocturnx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"Shaving was always a chore for me as well. Something I had to get done. I never really looked forward to doing it and would try to put it off as much as possible shaving 3-4 times per week if I could get away with it. I've never really been into pampering myself. Everything is utilitarian because that's what I believe or have been led to believe that that was what we as men are supposed to do.  Once I started wet shaving with a DE I began to look forward to shaving every day. I don't get razor burn any more, no ingrown hairs, and I get a much closer shave. It does take me longer partly because I'm still new and partly because I want to take the time to pamper myself. I can get it done in 10 minutes if I need to, but I'd rather take my time."

Shaving with a DE isn't for everyone, but almost all of us in this subreddit enjoy/prefer it. I started with an electric razor and never really got a clean shave with it. Switched to a Gillette Fusion which is what I stuck with for something like 7 years. A safety razor takes me a tiny bit longer to work with, but I'll never go back.   There's no suggested age for starting. If you have facial hair that needs shaving, its as much of an option as anything else. If you're like me with the Fusion, making the switch is going to save you tons of money. At least until you decide that you need to try everything that you see people posting here."

Shaving in the shower is still possible, but I would think that a little slickness might assist your shave a little. Otherwise I'll give you the same suggestion I give everyone when this question comes up, if you aren't exfoliating, you should be. Getting that layer of skin off before it can jam up those growing hairs has made all the difference in the world for me."
wicked_edge,3ddrye,drivenlegend,2,Wed Jul 15 14:25:45 2015 UTC,What products do you use for exfoliating?
wicked_edge,3ddrye,rastred,2,Wed Jul 15 16:41:20 2015 UTC,"I shave in the morning, so that night when I shower I use one of the little facial exfoliating pads and just whatever Stirling bath soap I'm using that day. Any day I haven't shaved I use Bulldog Face Scrub before my normal Bulldog Face Wash. I've just made it a part of my showering routine (I was already washing my face anyway right?) and it hasn't bothered me having a few extra steps. If I've had a rough shave or any extra irritation I'll spray on a little Thayers Witch Hazel with alcohol after the shower. I don't know that it does anything really but in my mind I think I've associated the little pinpoints of burning with killing potential bacteria or something like that...  Over at the skincare subreddits they always warn against mechanical exfoliation and tell people to go with chemical, but this works for my skin just fine. Plus if I look all rugged and boot-leathery when I'm old I just consider that a bonus."

Nivea has an Energy face wash that has those beads in it, or you can use a nicer product like Keihl's facial fuel energizing scrub. I have both and they work great."

They end up going down the drain and passing through almost all water filters in waste water treatment plants, which means they pass through into rivers and eventually oceans. They get ingested by fish and other critters because they look like food. They're real real bad.  Use a wash cloth or something with a face wash or glycerin soap instead.

wicked_edge,3ddrye,Metal_Massacre,4,Wed Jul 15 20:04:29 2015 UTC,"one of the benifits of DE certainly for me is excatly the dissapearance of the issues your currently having - reason being cartridge style razors with their 3-5 blades actually shave your skin off - the first layer or so of dermis - which obviously is not good - this combined with inferior shave foams, body soap (rather than specific shave soaps) and poor cartidge blades thus increased pressure needed all contribute to a bad shave and irritation afterwards.    DEs fo me do not give this (apart from a certain astro platinum blade that ive been testing) and the style of shave combined with the zero pressure that DEs allow you really means far less irritation , combine this with correct softening of hair (showering) and a solid pre-shave prep of lather and using a good shavebrush all add to now rarely ever having a bad experiance - sometimes average some times awsome shaves."

DEs have, well, a double edge. You can flip to the other side if one get clogged with lather, less rinsing.

With a straight razor, you don't replace the blade, but you have to strop it before each shave and send it out to be honed every once in a while. I personally have no desire to move to SRs because I see the required upkeep/maintenance as more hassle than it's worth. However, others of course feel differently, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who enjoy the process of stropping their SR."

If you use one gram per shave, it'll last you 200 shaves. If you're shaving every single day with it, you'll get through over six months of shaves. $100 a year isn't bad, but again, that's if you use a gram per shave. For reference, I use about a gram for my head, face, and arm pits, so the average Joe will probably use something like 0.5-0.75g per face shave.

BTW, I smoosh it paper-thin in a tub so it has the area of a full puck, which minimizes the lathering from a crumb problem.

What I mean by this is that I had a nice, thick and creamy lather on my face and in the brush as I lathered. I put the brush down to shave my face and when I picked the brush up again to do another pass, the soap was gone - a thin runny mess, much like what you had in your video.  I normally use synthetics or badger brushes; this was my first use of an Omega boar brush. Is this behavior typical of boar brushes? I had never heard or read of this, but having experienced it and then seeing it happen to you leaves me wondering."

You are off topic but.... here is some help anyway.  This is the first use of this Omega brush?  Boar brushes are not badgers or synthetics and take a goodly while to break in, i.e. tips split and bristles soften. Until they do so they are only fit for shaving your palm or a bowl. My Omegas took at least 15-20 practice palm lathers before they were useful for shaving and my Semogues took 25-30. Boar keeps getting better the more lathers you get on it.  If you are the patient sort make palm lathers out of your cheaper soaps  and let them dry out thoroughly for 48 hours. Do that for as long as you have the patience but 15-20 lathers should get it ready to use. Is all of this worth it? You betcha;-)."

It has been a great performer from the first use.  I see several split ends now, so it feels softer than on first use.  Not by a large margin though.  It has splayed a little bit now, and that's probably because I am not particularly gentle with it.  For the first shave with the 10049, I remember I used Van der Hagen Glycerin.  Worked great!

By 20 lathers I realized that I liked it, by 30 it had mostly split tips. At this point at maybe 60+ lathers it is a special brush though bigger than I care for in a face lathering brush. You were lucky that you had a usable brush right out of the box but then Omegas are known to break in and split more easily than Semogues. I have not used my Omegas for a good while and have switched to the Semogue 610 and 620. Both took a lot of lathers to split and break in, the 620 longer than the 610 but at about 50 lathers each they are now excellent face lathering brushes in every way and are 2/3 of my brush rotation. I found what I was looking for so why keep switching around?"

wicked_edge,3de3gr,Leisureguy,2,Wed Jul 15 20:15:47 2015 UTC,"I got a lot of crap for using hair conditioner instead of the traditional soap and a brush.  Dry shaving might be possible but there are so many brands of blades it may take a while to find one that would work for you.  I started shaving with a Gillette sensor back in the early 90's and used it for a long time until blades became hard to find, I upgraded to the excel and when those became hard to find I began looking for alternatives.  I got a mach 3 or something but the price on blades got to be ridiculous as I only got about 1-2 shaves from a head, I either dry shaved or just splashed a bit of water on my face and the gel on the head gave enough of a coating that I wouldn't get razor burn, I also tapped my razor against the sink which supposedly messes with the blade alignment so I probably do a lot of ""bad"" things.  I ended up getting my first DE in September 2011, I got a variety pack of blades and tried them all out but none allowed me to dry shave or even just use water as they all irritated my skin too much and I'd end up with bumps or a rash.  After a few shaves like this I figured I needed some lubrication and grabbed the bottle of hair conditioner from the shower (I didn't have shaving cream or anything and didn't feel like running to the store).  That same bottle is almost empty now so I'll have to get another one soon but after almost five years of shaving my total cost of shaving is around a nickel a day.  As a side note, I did order a starter kit (soap, brush, bowl)  in December 2011 after posting here and I did go through 1 puck of soap just after getting it but I don't have the same desire for shaving to be a calming ritual that a lot in here seem to have."

The brush helps exfoliate your face(slightly), and raise up the hairs, so you slice them instead of yanking them out with a cartridge razor.

There are various other blades as we know, and none of them seem to approach the cost of a DE blade. this is part of the reason the non DE bladed shavettes have never appealed to me: cost. i'd rather go with a real straight or something that takes DE. I don't find the middle ground appealing, but if I had the cash for something that shaves like a true straight that never needs sharpening like a feather AC, then yeah, that would be very cool!  the least appealing to me are the dovo long thin shavette blades. i did shave with one as it came with the dovo i returned, but it wasn't worth the huge increase in cost over a typical DE, especially since I had been using the dovo and miraki shavette for a while and was fine with the shorter DE blade.  i use the miraki to zip off heavy beards / head hair, but mostly i'm lazy and use the my standard muhle DE instead.  i've gone full circle back to standard DE. ;)"

I would suggest taking a shower before you shave. Also, going over your face again and again in the same direction doesn't get more and more hair off. The hair is already off in that direction. I would also try going across the grain if you can't go Against the grain. Also, your face is probably not used to getting exfoliated at the level that you do with a safety razor."

wicked_edge,3dayol,ThatAssholeMrWhite,5,Tue Jul 14 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"My blade epiphany is that I've been an idiot for resisting trying different blades for so long. I bought a 100 pack of Derbies when I started DE shaving, and have been too stubborn to try other blades. I tried a pack of Feathers at one point. They were better, but there was certainly a lot of blood.  I thought I just sucked at DE shaving until I tried the Astra this morning. It was a completely different experience. No cuts. No drag. Just a smooth DFS. I might even be able to go ATG without hacking my face to pieces with these blades. We'll see.  tl;dr: If you don't like your shave, try different blades."
wicked_edge,3dayol,Leisureguy,4,Tue Jul 14 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"I fairly frequently refer people to this post in hopes of convincing them to do some blade exploration, but it's an uphill battle. And still men think that their own experience with a given brand is universal. YMMV is hard to grasp."
wicked_edge,3dayol,Leisureguy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:16:11 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I read that post at some point. I was just invested in the Derbies and broke enough that buying more blades seemed like a waste of money. (... which, looking back, is stupid considering at most I'd be out $10 if I threw away the rest of the Derbies.) The sad thing is I've been shaving for a year or maybe 2 on that box 100 Derbies (and one pack of Feathers), and I've had shitty shaves that entire time... all because I was too cheap/stubborn to just try different blades (even though I knew I should).  Thankfully I was able to visit a great shave shop in person and pick out a few individual packs of blades. I can't wait to try the others, but the shave I got this morning was on a whole different level and has renewed my interest in wet shaving."

I'll need more time to really give you some info but real quickly: 1,5, & 9 I'd set aside as, IMHO, they're not worth restoring.  6 and 8 are on the edge to where I wouldn't bother with them but it's plausible that they'd turn out nicely for whoever did do the work.    The others will also need some work but you won't be losing that much in having them restored.  I'd say 7 probably has the most value on name and size; it has some honewear but it's still a nice, hefty Wade & Butcher that looks maybe 7/8""?  2 is quite nice as well with the blade engraving and the ""bow"" logo on the tang but not as much width as the other.

I just had my best shave today as well with a Parker 24C and TOBS Jermyn St. If you like TOBS I highly recommend the Jermyn Street version. The scent is a basic aqua/citrus cologne scent and is apparently designed for sensitive skin (which I have). I've been trying out blades and soap/cream samples and every time I've used the JS TOBS it's been the best shave I've ever had. You should definitely check it out.

IMO you don't need MONTHS to pick up anything - your technique will improve steadily over time but you can swap things around and see if you can get a better shave pretty regularly. If you start having constant issues you may want to pick a few things to use consistently to figure out the problem, but beyond that have fun and enjoy the shaves!"
wicked_edge,3dccpk,EmptyAy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:51:21 2015 UTC,"Is your face dry or is the lather drying on your face? The latter would suggest you need to add more water to your lather. Some people don't react well to the chemicals found in certain products. You should also check out some soaps in addition to creams. In my experience, artisan soaps seem to hydrate my skin better in addition to providing more cushion and slickness. You could also try following up your shave with an aftershave balm to help moisturize your skin."
wicked_edge,3da57g,ShooTa666,4,Tue Jul 14 18:13:20 2015 UTC,"If you're familiar with your razor and you're using a good lather, the blade should work well.  If it doesn't, adjust angle from very shallow to steep.  If it doesn't get the job done, move on to what you like.  If the shoe doesn't fit, don't wear it.  I've used close to a dozen blades and the only 2 that stand out are the Feather, for the bleeding it caused, and the Voskhod, for being like freaking buttuh.  The rest are adequate but unremarkable.

wicked_edge,3d9rz9,grand_royal,6,Tue Jul 14 16:43:38 2015 UTC,"You can consider a Gillette adjustable (the Super Adjustable can be found at quite reasonable prices, and it's quite good), and I think that would work better than the Futur which is aggressive, heavy, and somewhat awkward. That said, quite a few love their Futur.  Of the Merkur adjustables, I find the Progress to be clearly the best, FWIW.   With any adjustable, start at a low (very low) setting and advance the setting in small increments only in order to get a satisfactory shave. You want the lowest setting that works, not the highest you can stand.  Read this post on blades. With any new razor it will be necessary to do some renewed blade exploration: a brand that's best in one razor may not be best (or even good) in another. But as to recommending a particular brand: see the post at the link.  In general, though, I recommend that your second razor be a slant razor, for reasons specified at the link.  Hope this helps.  edit: wrong word corrected"
wicked_edge,3d9rz9,Leisureguy,4,Tue Jul 14 16:50:32 2015 UTC,"Look at the Merkur Progress. It is also adjustable.  The Futur is like trying to shave with a croquet  mallet. Shaving your mustache area is especially hard.  Since it's adjustable, you can do exactly what you described. Or if you have a more sensitive neck than your face, you can dial it down based on specific parts.  You will have to do some renewed blade exploration with an adjustable. You might find out using a really sharp blade on a mild setting works best for your, or a not so sharp blade on an aggressive setting."

And the sound it makes when it cuts whiskers is loud, unpleasant, and (for lack of a better word) plasticky.  But those are all subjective complaints. There are also objective problems with the razor.  When you pull the top cap off, the blade sometimes comes flying out; several people have had to get their fingers stitched up after this has happened. You have to compensate for this by flicking the cap and blade onto the countertop while keeping both your hands behind the base plate.   The adjustment mechanism is very difficult to operate unless you grab the head of the razor - again, at the risk of cutting your fingers. You have to use a rag to cover the head (thus risking damaging the edge of the blade) or disassemble the razor to adjust it.   Finally, the top cap is held in place by two spring steel wires that are peened into the bridge and tend to come loose. This cannot be repaired, and renders the razor unusable.  If you want an adjustable, consider the Progress or a vintage Gillette, as mentioned by others. Or just get a better razor. The Merkur 37c slant is a very popular second razor. I didn't like it, but I'm in the minority. My favorite reasonably-priced razor is the Standard. Availability is a little tough, but they were just on Massdrop, so a few should be coming on to the secondary market within the next few weeks."
wicked_edge,3d9rz9,arbarnes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:35:31 2015 UTC,I was going to buy a Futur but after a bunch of research I talked myself out of it.  Interesting style but too bulky & overpriced.  Merkur Progress is looked upon more favorably.  There are also vintage Gillette adjustables that are more affordable.
wicked_edge,3d9rz9,repete66219,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:17:44 2015 UTC,I think my toss up now is between vintage Gillette adjustables and the Merkur Progress.

wicked_edge,3d9rz9,mrballooknot,2,Tue Jul 14 18:54:14 2015 UTC,Good choice. Try the Shave Bazaar too; you'll probably get better information about the razor (since most sellers are enthusiasts) and a fair price. Here is one listing with a couple of Slims; here's another.
wicked_edge,3d9rz9,TopHatAce,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:15:09 2015 UTC,I've had mine for a few months. I love it. Some people seem to take issue with a few things about it but   I personally don't have the same experience. I have very coarse wiskers and this thing mows through them like butter. I can do a quick one-page and be presentable or go bbs with 1-2 more passes. I really like the heft as well.
wicked_edge,3dciuj,asunnyman,2,Wed Jul 15 05:03:13 2015 UTC,"To my understanding the razor head is made out of plated zamak/pot metal, and the handle is plated brass. The part that usually breaks in these modern 3-piece razors is the threaded middle post. Most likely due to a drop. But assuming you don't drop the razor, or over tighten the handle, it should last years. However I think the plating will eventually wear off from the threads just with normal use, exposing the zamak/pot metal underneath, which will cause it to break. So I don't believe that the razor will last decades.   Vintage Gillette razors were mostly plated brass, so they should be more durable.  The most durable option is a stainless steel razor. Current manufacturers: Feather, Above The Tie, Ikon, Pils, Wolfman. Note that the Ikon Shave Craft razors are not fully stainless steel. I believe the cheapest fully stainless steel razor costs about $150. But for that price you can get multiple modern razors/vintage razors."
wicked_edge,3dciuj,Papander,4,Wed Jul 15 07:22:07 2015 UTC,"If you take care of your razor it could last decades. Pot metal razors have a reputation for breaking but this is usually do to people dropping them, or regularly over-tightening the cap, etc."

wicked_edge,3d78cj,oozethemuse,5,Tue Jul 14 01:45:18 2015 UTC,"A few weeks ago I had a pretty sweet haul from an antique show.  I really wanted to get the Dubl Duck restored since it looked to be in pretty good shape.  Here's the before album    After some discussion with /u/Rvmaster, he talked me out of plain black scales and to go with the imitation mother of pearl.  So glad that he did.  He was so nice through the process and answered every noob question that I had along the way.  The first pictures in the album are from him as progress pics. The last three were when it made it's way home.  10/10  Will be sending more stuff his way and would highly recommend him for any work you may want done!"
wicked_edge,3d78cj,RVmaster,4,Tue Jul 14 01:50:43 2015 UTC,Glad you like how she turned out! After seeing the razor in your original post I couldn't wait to get those cheap Pakistan celluloid scales off that duck especially since the gases from them were starting to eat into the blade. Those scales are buried somewhere they can never harm another razor again lol.   Your razor is a hollow ground and not a wedge though my photo angles do make it look quarter hollow or near wedge so it's a satinedge not wedge. /u/commiecat still might be correct because it's possible it started out as a wedge and was reground but I'm pretty sure it's just a satinedge.   Now for the strop. I didn't realize you didn't have one and I should have asked. I would have gladly sent you one and waited for your next paycheck or whenever you had some disposable income. I'll PM you.
wicked_edge,3d78cj,commiecat,2,Tue Jul 14 12:51:07 2015 UTC,"Hey, beautiful job!    The Satin Wedges were typically quarter hollow, although there were some a bit more pronounced.  The distinguishing factor was a single concave grind.  Looks like a single grind in that lovely mirror finish and that would also pair with a single stabilizer.   All the other Ducks were double hollow ground with two stabilizers AFAIK.  Martin103 has some great DD advertisement scans in this SRP thread."
wicked_edge,3d78cj,RVmaster,2,Tue Jul 14 14:09:07 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for that info :) it's been about 12 razors ago since I worked on it but I seem to remember it being really thin like an extra hollow ground but my memory has failed me more than once. Wish I had paid more attention to that when I had it because after reading that I'm inclined to just go with your opinion because it makes sense based off that article that its a satin wedge based off the single stabilizer. Hopefully op grabs some profile pics for us to look at. I'm questioning myself now lol.  Edit yeah you're definitely correct! Awfully thin grind to call a wedge but I believe your correct after doing more research!

Looks like a space in your lettering and the razor only has one stabilizer which, to my knowledge, was only used on the Wedge.    You had it restored and you don't have a strop yet?!  Definitely jump on that so you can give it a whirl.  Personally I'd hold off on the stones until you master the shaving and know that you want to stick with straight razors."

wicked_edge,3d94n3,theVokster,2,Wed Jul 15 11:11:11 2015 UTC,"creating a poor lather isn't necessarily the fault of your water hardness. it could be related, but its not entirely based on that factor. see how the lather is incredibly bubbly? its way too thin and broken down. lather starts thick, sticky, and pasty, and becomes thin and bubbly once you've added too much water."

wicked_edge,3d7xcg,crexor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:44:15 2015 UTC,$10 or less is pretty standard for nearly any single edge safety razor.  I'd say it's a reasonable price but not great.

wicked_edge,3db8o1,razor_emporium,2,Tue Jul 14 22:46:56 2015 UTC,We use brass sheet and this punch set to make our own spaces so that the scales close with ease and you don't have to over tighten the pins.   Using regular washers you will really get so much space in between the scale and blade. These work like a charm and are very cheap / easy to make.  Thought I'd share.  happy shaving!  Matt
wicked_edge,3d7l77,aaronmil,4,Tue Jul 14 03:28:39 2015 UTC,I'll be interested to read about a shave with the Gillette 7 O'Clock SharpEdge in the 26C with the LASSC soap. (That has the same rhythm as Col. Mustard in the Library with the Candlestick.)
wicked_edge,3d7l77,Leisureguy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:53:32 2015 UTC,"I do have one more 7 O'Clock. But I recently purchased an extra 10 Personna Lab Blues because those recently gave the best shaves, so it might be awhile :) I had also only ever used a a Feather in the Ikon 102 with the eShave cream (redness city), so that's going to need revisiting as well."
wicked_edge,3d7l77,Leisureguy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:25:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Feather doesn't work so well for me in the #102, though it is great in the Gillette Tech (for example). I find the Personna Lab Blues work very well for me also, and that's what I normally use in all of my slants."

wicked_edge,3d7l77,shawnsel,2,Tue Jul 14 05:57:06 2015 UTC,"""my face looked like a rash with red bumps everywhere.""   I'm in no way an expert, but to me that sounds like an allergic reaction. My guess is that if you didn't even shave and applied your eShave cream for a few minutes ... you'd probably still get the rash....  I ran it through CosDNA, and by ingredient analysis, eShave doesn't appear to be an especially irritating formula:  http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7c8b196988.html     It could be one of their fragrance ingredients. Linalool could be it....     If you are a person with skin that reacts to many ingredients, you might be interested in this list of fragrance free soaps/creams that I have started (each listing includes a link to a CosDNA analysis):  https://www.reddit.com/r/ShavingScience/wiki/sensitive-skin-product-analysis"
wicked_edge,3d7l77,shawnsel,2,Wed Jul 15 17:33:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But, as I mentioned, it was nonlinear in the sense that if I didn't get nicks or otherwise already have blemishes, I didn't get redness with that cream, so it seems my allergy or sensitivity was exacerbated by skin traumas. I was disappointed to find a similar reaction to a sample of the Mystic Water Sensitive Skin soap this morning, but this is an opportunity for me to narrow down which ingredients my skin is reacting to, as you suggest. Thanks for the links!"
wicked_edge,3d7l77,repete66219,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:02:17 2015 UTC,"Good point. Although, might it be a reaction that gets worse with repeated exposures?  Glad I could help. I have very sensitive skin myself. I once sprayed a spot on my face with organic aloe juice, waited a few minutes, and then took a shower. Even after the shower ... I could still see redness, even where the aloe juice had dripped from where it had originally been sprayed....  Please let me know if you come across more good sensitive-skin soaps/creams/data and I'll add them to my wiki list.  Cheers, Shawn"

wicked_edge,3d741y,cwaniaczek,2,Tue Jul 14 02:07:58 2015 UTC,"You'll quickly learn the common objections. From the preface to the most recent edition of the Guide:   Moreover, our expectations are subject to a strong confirmation bias: we can quickly think of reasons and examples that suggest that a (preconceived) expectation is correct, but—since we have already embraced the expectation—it’s much harder to think of reasons or examples that indicate that it’s wrong. However, once experience or experiment has proved the expectation false, then hindsight, that powerful tool, immediately uncovers many reasons and examples that show why the expectation was wrong.   The phenomenon is familiar to any DE shaver who discusses shaving with someone still using multiblade cartridges and canned foam. Quite often, a man who has yet to try traditional DE shaving has much ""knowledge"" about what DE shaving is like, which is why he’s not interested in trying it. For example, he already knows that a multiblade cartridge gives a smoother result, that traditional shaving is tedious, that in using a DE razor you cut yourself all the time, that using a brush to make lather from a shaving soap or shaving cream is a time-consuming chore, that he would hate traditional shaving, that multiblade cartridges are better for his skin, and so on. (Experience has repeatedly demonstrated that, for almost all men, each of those suppositions is false.)   You can probably read the entire preface using Amazon's Look Inside feature."

wicked_edge,3d7ta1,FermentedFupaFungus,2,Tue Jul 14 16:21:18 2015 UTC,It's wet shaving that is the key.

Either way, watching the videos is important, and they're free!   Check out www.youtube.com/mantic59.  Angle and pressure are important.  Videos can help with that.  Prep is important too.  One way or another you need to get your whiskers wet for 2 minutes or longer, just before you shave.  I just shave immediately after my shower.  You can do the same thing by  washing your face at the sink (gently) for two minutes.  Some people use wet towels instead.  The other thing you can try is to make your own lather from a shaving soap or shaving cream and a brush.   It's good that you're expecting some time to get the hang of it.  But it's a bit unnatural and you'll progress more quickly if you watch videos and read stuff around here.  Personally it took me about 20 shaves with the safety razor before I was getting consistently good shaves.  I was also unlearning bad habits from cartridge razors.  If you're new to shaving entirely, it might be easier for you.  Good luck!"

My only gripe is that  I won't feel the same shaves until I master DE shaving.  Could different razor types also help? I feel like there's not enough blade coming out between both parts for me to get a good shave!"
wicked_edge,3d7ta1,jb270,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:12:32 2015 UTC,"The blade doesn't stuck out very far to prevent injury, hence the name safety razor. It makes it harder to cut yourself with poor blade angle. Try placing the top cap against your face with the handle perpendicular to the floor. As you start your stroke, slowly tilt the head until you hear the hairs begin to cut. Until you get your technique down you should shave in a quiet bathroom. This means no music, no fan, no running water. Silence will help you focus on the task and allow you to hear audible feedback from the razor. Another thing to try if you think the razor isn't cutting is to ensure it is assembled correctly. It may sound stupid, but it is pretty common for a newbie to assemble the razor with the baseplate upside down, which makes it useless."

In the tests I've done, the lather I get using distilled water is interchangeable with the lather I get treating the water with citric acid which is interchangeable with the lather I get just using my hard tap water and spending 30 more seconds loading.   It also makes lathering sound a lot harder and more complicated than it needs to be, which might scare off new folks. Most folks are going to be able to make a perfectly fine lather using their tap water."

I used to consume about a gram and a half to two grams per shave. I'm not sure what it's at now, but judging by how little I have to load when using distilled water, I'm thinking half to three quarters of a gram."

I use Proraso cream, which I've read lathers better than bar soaps. The difference between my tap water and my mother's softened water is minimal. I've yet to try distilled water, mainly because I never think of buying a jug.   It really might be the creme vs soap that makes the difference, but if it helps someone else, I figured I'd post it here."

wicked_edge,3d4x3o,Leisureguy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"I resisted it myself until I tried it.   I am 100% with you on this. I can lather well enough with my Upstate NY water which is ""medium hard"" but using distilled water takes it to a  different level. Different soaps or particularly creams which tend to contain more water in their formulations than soaps, different quantities loaded, different salts as /u/Mantic59 stated above and its a whole different ballgame. As you said further on in this thread you need less soap to make a lather and that also counts with expensive soaps.  I have simply given in and always use the 4 oz. of distilled water necessary to soak my brush in a narrow coffee cup and wet out the surface of a triple milled soap. With daily shaves that amounts to one gallon per month for a cost of $12/year. I simply heat the 4 oz. in a microwave and march off to my bathroom for a shower and shave.  The difference I see in travel shaves with the same shave stick and brush is profound. If I am in a place with really high quality, neutral water such as NYC I easily get great lather quickly; if the water is hard(er) then I have to work at it longer and load more soap. I am okay with compensating when I travel but I am not willing to do so when I am home. That said, I NEVER heard of anyone using distilled water for shaving in the ""good old days"" or even now except on these forums. Somehow everyone got along just fine, or didn't and didn't know why. Maybe that is why canned shaving creams were created?"
wicked_edge,3d4x3o,I_Like_a_Clean_Bowl,2,Tue Jul 14 18:24:44 2015 UTC,"Citric acid seems to be a lot less trouble overall than using distilled water: run the sink half-full of hot water (or cold water, if you like a cold-water shave). Dissolve a pinch or two of citric acid in it---not much. Use that water for the pre-shave beard wash, the lather, and rinsing the razor and splashing water on your face at the end of each pass.   Do the final rinse with tap water. Use the lather from a distilled-water shave to define the baseline quality of lather you are going for.   You can get a small container of citric acid on-line and in some stores. You want pure citric acid, not citric acid mixed with anything else. It can often be found in healthfood stores (used as a salt substitute and also to prevent mold when growing sprouts) and where canning or brewing supplies are sold.  Read this post and this post to see the difference it made in two instances.  Shaving is very much a YMMV activity, and some, after experimenting with softening the water with citric acid, find that they are happy just using the unsoftened water, while others prefer using softened water. To determine your own preference, use citric acid a week, skip it a week, then use it another week (a ""week"" being on the order of 7 shaves), and then decide based on your own experience. Preferences are something one discovers.  And preferences vary from person to person: don't assume that another's preferences will match your own. They may, or they may not. Best to experiment and get some experience with both approaches. Then decide."

Indeed, you're not even really rinsing: just a splash to wet the face. And the water is not dirty, if you've followed good practice and are shaving with a clean face. It may be soapy, of course, and indeed it may have some stubble in it, but of course you also have stubble on your face if you're shaving for the usual reason. I really don't understand what the problem is, but this process is not mandatory. It's simply an alternative to try.  edit: In fact, the only thing in the water besides some small amount of stubble is the very stuff you're applying to your face to begin with: lather."

Arko, for example, seems to lather the same whether I use tap water or distilled but most others, including Stirling, noticeably favor distilled.  However, even in my extreme area all it seems to take is more water and more time.  Having hard water doesn't ultimately seem to be a huge issue."
wicked_edge,3d4x3o,Dimanovic,7,Tue Jul 14 09:41:55 2015 UTC,"I strongly believe the effects of hard water on lather are often severely overblown.

I have moderately hard water in my own house, and I have tried dozens of different popular soaps and have never had a problem getting a good lather from any of them. Using distilled water didn't really improve the quality of my lather, or the ease of creating it."

If you know your soap and have the soap-to-water ratio down, building a lather is not that much more difficult in hard water when compared to soft water."
wicked_edge,3d4x3o,stirlingsoap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:18:16 2015 UTC,"It's very odd, but some people do notice a significant difference in ease of lathering and amount of soap required when they use very soft water, either distilled/demineralized or softened with citric acid. Here are a couple of examples: this post and this post.  Because it's clear that the experience varies by individual I do encourage people to try to discover what works better for them. For you (and some others in the thread), they notice no difference at all between using hard and soft water; others notice a big difference."
wicked_edge,3d4x3o,Leisureguy,3,Mon Jul 13 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"I would wager the difference in experience in may cases comes from how much soap you load.  I have very hard water and all it took for me to get good results was loading a little longer.  Now I can understand the argument that I am using more soap than others but it is not a huge issue for me to use a little more.  I will tell you I am now solidly in the ""loads too much soap"" category as I have found it much easier to ""overload"" and compensate with added water.  This typically results in enough lather to shave a wookie but that is fine by me.  Point being I would guess the people that notice no difference from hard water to distilled or treated water could yield the same results with less soap in the distilled or treated water but are used to really loading up which will not yield a big noticeable difference."

wicked_edge,3d4x3o,hawns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"Totally understood. That's why, after trying them, I suggest making the choice based on which worked best for you. Of course, if one doesn't try them, the choice is based on mere expectations, which often turn out to be contradicted by experience---cf. guys who haven't tried it saying that making a real lather from soap and a shaving brush is way too much hassle and trouble than using canned foam. Quite a few, after trying both ways for a reasonable test (6-7 shaves with true lather, then 6-7 shaves with canned foam, then 6-7 more shaves with true lather) find (sometimes to their surprise) that they prefer the true lather and it's not nearly so much hassle as it seemed it would be.   But if you've tried using a pinch of citric acid in your shaving water for a week, then skipping it a week, then using it another week, and you decide that it's not worth it, certainly there's no need to continue. But you might find, for example, that the easier loading and faster lathering is worth the second or two it takes to add the citric acid.  But by all means go by your own experience. (And be wary of expectations.)"

wicked_edge,3d4x3o,Leisureguy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:32:41 2015 UTC,"It's always good to experiment: it's easy to try using distilled water, and if the lather seems easier to make (and/or better in quality), it's easy to experiment using citric acid to see whether that produces the same effect. I certainly would not suggest that people avoid trying things: given the YMMV of shaving, some will find using citric acid (or distilled water) worthwhile, some will not.  Since it may take a few shaves to notice the difference---e.g., discovering that with distilled or softened water one can get a great lather with much less soap than formerly used---I recommend giving each alternative at least 6-7 shaves: perhaps use regular tap water for 6-7 shaves, then water softened with a pinch of citric acid for 6-7 shaves, then again with the untreated tap water for 6-7 shaves. That should provide enough experience to make a good choice.  Obviously, those fortunate enough to have soft water don't need to worry about it, but those who know or suspect their water's hard may well want to experiment, especially given the low cost of distilled (or ""purified"" = demineralized) water (about $1/gallon). If someone likes the result, citric acid offers a more compact solution (a small bottle of citric acid vs. a 1-gallon jug of distilled water) and avoids having to heat the water if he prefers a hot-water shave (since with citric acid, he can just use hot tap water).  Obviously, some are quite happy using hard water, and some don't even notice any real difference. Others have commented that their own experience was quite noticeably better with distilled or softened water. So I recommend that those open to change experiment with it to see what their own experience is like."

Although this should seem like a pretty simple answer, unfortunately, given where your home is located in our distribution system it actually is pretty complicated!  The reason for that is because we have two different sources of water plus the MWRA connection. One of the sources of water has a low hardness (37 mg/L- so pretty soft) and the other is considered moderately hard (160 mg/L). The MWRA water has virtually no hardness. Depending on system demand for water and the hydraulics at any given time you could be receiving any of these waters or a combination of them.

wicked_edge,3d5zg4,Dark_Saint,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:35 2015 UTC,I'm a fan. It doesn't have much of a scent. I just put a thin layer on without rubbing it in much. It stays shiny/greasy for a few minutes but once it soaks in I can't feel it.   It's pretty cheap and has lasted for awhile. Wouldn't hurt to give it a try.
wicked_edge,3d5zg4,IllegalMonk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:42:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't used the Nivea so I won't comment on that, but I am a balm junkie.   The best balms I've used, in order of preference:   L'Occitane Cade balm. This stuff is in a league of its own. It has a thick texture, but it dries without being greasy at all. It can stop bleeders, eliminate dry skin during the winter and sooth irritation. The ingredients are sustainably sourced.  Savonnière du Moulin Aftershave balm. This stuff is as good as Cade, but quite a bit more expensive. It's also hard to get in North America due to the broken English website. Bullgoose may still have some. Dries even lighter than Cade, but also doesn't have quite the power, better for summer definitely.  The rest of the L'Occitane balms. They're good, not Cade good, but still top tier balms. I have them in a few fragrances depending on what soap I use.  Scale polish. This is an offering by Dapper Dragon and something I don't use very often, but everytime I do I'm impressed. Lightly mentholated and strong scents. A must have if you have Dapper Dragon soaps.  444 Gel. Cheap. Menthol. Effective. Unscented. When I have a scent I can't pair or want a menthol blast then this is my go-to.  MLS Milks. I use these for the fragrances. They dry oily for me, and I have dry skin."
wicked_edge,3d5zg4,Nocturnx,2,Mon Jul 13 21:00:42 2015 UTC,I picked up Dr. Jon's Arctic Hydra just the other day and thought it was very nice.  Between the citrus scent and menthol freeze it is a great summer soap.

wicked_edge,3d5zg4,birdmankustomz,2,Mon Jul 13 21:37:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, the menthol is just right.  I'd say it's slightly milder than TOBS Peppermint.  Edit: I just used the Arctic Hydra again this morning and I would say it's right on par or a tad stronger than TOBS Peppermint."

I've shaved that way using bar soap (which is another option).  Not ideal, but good enough.  I believe wet shaving in India is more widespread than it is in the States, so you might have more options finding a brush to pinch-hit with."

Failing that, tobs and other creams are marketed as usable brushless, you can just rub them in with your hands and hope for the best - it won't be superior to your lather performance but it will do the job.   Also, India has some very skilled barber that you can literally find on the street. They will give you a great pampering experience for a ridiculously cheap cost."

wicked_edge,3d4u9f,ItchyPooter,2,Mon Jul 13 18:10:14 2015 UTC,You can use a small washcloth as an emergency brush.  Just push your finger up through the middle of the cloth and twist it to make a bubble/knot -- so it looks like a small ghost.  Then lather away.  It will work fine for a day or two.

Reading here and other discussion boards will offer many approaches, but the very simplified answer is get a good brush and soap/cream, prep well (hot shower and face wash at least), make a good lather and then do a ""3 pass"" shave. That is:   Apply lather, shave with the grain (WTG) all over. this is most often downward or north to south. Apply lather again, shave across the grain (XTG). This is mostly East-West and vice versa Apply lather again, shave aginst the grain (ATG). South to north. Touch up stubbly spots if any Apply no pressure, just let the weight of the razor do the work   You need to learn the grain map of your face to do this most effectively.

Got a Maggard sampler pack of 12 different types, maybe a bit of overkill. I do like the Astras too though but unless I find something better in the rest of this pack, I'll probably stick with feathers. I don't know about sharpness but they work best for me."
wicked_edge,3d2id3,repete66219,7,Mon Jul 13 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"I've used around 10 different blades and I bleed more when I use the Feather.  Considerably more.  IME it's not a subjective opinion, but a fact that while they may not be sharper they certainly display objective data that would indicate as much.  I don't shave blind, so perhaps I'm introducing bias when I know I'm using a Feather, but I believe I'm not changing technique in any way.  As it is, I bought a 10 pack.  I've used the Feather 4 times (a week at a time) in my rotation.  They have consistently caused more nicks than all other blades I've used--PolSilver, Voskhod, GSB, 7 o'clock green & yellow, Med Prep, Lab Blue, Astra SP, Derby--without providing a noticeably closer shave.  There's only down-side using Feathers so I'm done with them.  I'll put what I have left in the next item I BST.  Adios Feather!"
wicked_edge,3d2id3,repete66219,6,Mon Jul 13 13:47:58 2015 UTC,I don't know if bleeding is the right indicator for sharpness. I've cut myself a lot more with dull knives than sharp knives for example.
wicked_edge,3d2id3,ca178858,2,Mon Jul 13 14:31:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there's a direct correlation between sharpness and bleeding either.  Even the dullest blade should cut skin without any problems if that's the intent.  But if all things are the same--angle, pressure, lather, razor--and one draws blood while another doesn't, it's not unreasonable to conclude the one causing the bleeding is sharper.  I'm not sure if this issues translates well to knives, because a knife that isn't cutting well will cause you to use more pressure or longer strokes after you notice it's not working.  That's not what's happening with the Feathers.  My experience has been different.  In my 5 years in a kitchen my cuts corresponded so well with knife age that my GM would go out of his way to say, ""Hey Pete, be careful.  It's new knife day.""  (That was with serrated blades, so probably a bit different than your experience.)"

wicked_edge,3d2id3,merelyadoptedthedark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:46:41 2015 UTC,"There are other variables but since blood is an indication of a cut and cutting is a function of sharpness, it's not unreasonable to conclude that the blade which causes more bleeding is sharper.

wicked_edge,3d2id3,yayachiken,18,Mon Jul 13 14:49:47 2015 UTC,"So I'm trying to understand why Feather is considered the sharpest blade. I bought some to test out and I had a hard time shaving with them without really irratating my skin and yanking out hairs. They felt dullish and got super dull very quickly.  I decided to grab some Gillete Silver Blue, Astra Platinum and Personna Comfort Coated blades and the Feather Platinum blades to test. I used the same sheet of paper on all four blades and made a bunch of cuts with each side. Feather was by far the worst to cut with. After a few cuts it was more tearing than cutting. The best turned out to be the Gillete Silver Blue, it really sliced right through the paper.  In the pic they're ordered in the order of sharpness from dullest on the left to sharpest on the right. This isn't super scientific, but it's what I found so far. I'm going to see if i can rig something up to actually measure the force and run a repeatable experiment to have actual data. But my hypothesis is that these Feather blades are pretty darn dull.  What is everyone experience? Also how did the community land on Feather as sharpest? Were there some tests at some point?"
wicked_edge,3d2id3,denali42,9,Mon Jul 13 00:25:27 2015 UTC,"This is why we stress YMMV on this sub. If feathers irritated your face, then they aren't the right blade for you. You should also try a different feather blade, it's possible to get duds from every manufacturer I'm also not sure if the paper test is a good representation of a blades performance. They are meant to cut hair and only hair. Trying to use them for anything else will cause them all to lose their edges pretty quickly."

I was just super excited about the Feathers and then felt like they were dull. The scientist in me (my family is like 50% scientists and 50% businessmen, I'm business) really wants to quantify it.   it's possible to get duds from every manufacturer I'm also not sure if the paper test is a good representation of a blades performance   I wanna pull one out of every pack I have to test with if I do setup a more scientific test. Probably order a small package of them again to make sure it's not this one run.   I'm also not sure if the paper test is a good representation of a blades performance.   I'm going to do some more research on how sharpness is quantified in general by science. However I'd assume the sharpest blade would cut paper the easiest. I mean you can drop those gillettes at the edge of the paper and they cut in.    They are meant to cut hair and only hair. Trying to use them for anything else will cause them all to lose their edges pretty quickly.   Paper absolutely dulls quickly, you're totally right about that. Maybe I can save some hair from my next haircut to test with :)."
wicked_edge,3d2id3,denali42,5,Mon Jul 13 00:49:49 2015 UTC,For testing sharpness how did you do it? Just grab a blade and try to cut paper? Cause if you don't support the blade in some kind of holder (as razors are meant to be used) you're going to skew that test quite badly... My guess would be that it would skew it to thicker blades since they won't flex or bend causing the paper to rip.
wicked_edge,3d2id3,repete66219,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:18:49 2015 UTC,I don't think paper would be a good test at all. You can cut paper with very bad steel that has a large crystal structure because after sharpening you will have a more pronounced micro-saw on the edge. Paper is sturdy enough for the sawing action to matter.  Razors are supposed to be smooth on the edge. Shaving flexible hair or maybe cutting meat is probably the only telling way to test this really.
wicked_edge,3d2id3,zensunni66,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:10:56 2015 UTC,"Oh i know it's not a perfect test. Just wanted to see how easily each one cut paper if I applied what felt like roughly the same force and held them the same way. The way I held them was in the middle of the blade with my thumb and index finger and sliced down in one motion. I did this a bunch of times for each blade. Feather felt like it took the most force to cut every time. My hands are pretty big so most of the blade is covered by my fingers, there really isn't room to flex. Maybe I can rent one of those sharpness testing machines if it's not crazy expensive."

wicked_edge,3d2id3,d0ndada,2,Mon Jul 13 21:02:26 2015 UTC,"My experience with these is purely anecdotal.   When I first got into DE shaving I bought a sample pack with a bunch of different blades. It had Feathers among many others (it did have those Astras and a couple of Gillete blades, though not the Silver Blue Gilletes, never heard of those until now). The feathers were the only blades that literally just slid across my face like there was no hair. It was glorious. Until my neck broke out in a bright red rash halfway through shaving. They also did seem to dull rather quickly which didn't help the rash.  I have very thick hair on my face, not in terms of the amount of hair, but just the thickness and wiry-ness of individual hairs (I'm one of those ""lucky"" men who can give themselves splinters with their beard hairs). Most blades just tug and pull the hairs rather than cut through them. Feathers just wiped the hair away. The only other ones in that sample pack that came anywhere close for me were Israeli Personnas (the ones I went with). They aren't perfect but they don't pull hairs badly or give me razor burn.  So that's why I and many others feel that Feathers are the sharpest. You could argue that it isn't their sharpness, but some other quality that they have which allows them to do this. Either way, they cut hair cleanly that other blades just can't."
wicked_edge,3d2id3,scienceofsharp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:21:35 2015 UTC,I too had better luck with Feathers than other brands. But I definitely think it's a YMMV thing.
wicked_edge,3d2id3,ClintHammer,2,Mon Jul 13 09:11:54 2015 UTC,"My experience is similar. Astras and Feathers didn't last, though the Feathers are unforgiving of pressure. The Silver Blues last the longest with Personnas a distant second. Oddly enough, Gilette Platinum also last.   But anyone interested should get the top 10 tryablade collection and figure this out on their own. It'll have all these."
wicked_edge,3d2id3,popepeterjames,2,Mon Jul 13 05:35:08 2015 UTC,"For me, they pull the least and are by far the least forgiving for mistakes. I have a middle-eastern beard, which is so tough it can chew a fusion razor totally in 3 shaves (no blue left on the strip, blades warped and cutting).  I've used silver blues and 7'o clocks and they come close...but not perfect.  Then sharks, then the rest below it become worse and worse. To the point I'd go back to a Fusion if I had to shave with a lord or personna. But, that's my experience.  So, for me, they are the sharpest. You also could have gotten a few dulls (I've gotten dulls before).  It could also be they aren't sharper. All hair could just need a specific 'sharpness' level of x, and all razors could have it pretty much. They could just have a wider cutting edge with a thicker coating which doesn't warp or distort, and the pressure from the razor and therefore force the hair out of the follicle and cut it via pressure,  cutting it at the root with the pressure of the wedge, instead of cutting thinly into the hair as it moves across it. This would mean that it comes into contact less with the skin and therefore could cause less razorburn.  I know someone took an electron microscope and checked out the razors. Most were almost identical to thickness, so that theory above is probably wholly unsubstantiated.  I just can cut through a 5 day growth of beard (that could sand balsa wood) with a feather with less effort than even my carbon steel straight."

A sharp blade is very hard to use with an aggressive razor, or a razor made to inexact tolerances.  I have about a bunch of razors, and I can shave with VERY sharp blades in many of them without any issue, going very fast and without much care.  However there are several of them that you have to be very careful if you have any sharp blade in them at all, because of the blade pitch and gap being more aggressive.  My Parker 91R is particularly aggressive and is difficult to use with anything sharper than a Shark blade.  But, my Gillette Super Speeds will take pretty much any blade you throw at them and give you a great quick shave without any hassle.... even without using shaving cream/soap if you are in a hurry.  My Merkur and Muhle razors tend to be in the more aggressive and harder to use with a sharp blade group, but my Edwin Jagger is quite mild and easy to use with a sharp blade.  Adjustable razors are nice, because you can change the pitch for the blade you are using.  Using a very sharp blade? Drop the setting between 1&3. Using a more mild blade? Kick it up to 7, and get an equally good shave.  Pretty much all blades can be hard to use if paired with the wrong razor setup."

But I would argue that ""sharpness"" is not one-dimensional. There is the bevel, the finesse of the grind and the thickness of the blade, each can have a different optimum for any given hair type and razor combination. When using a shavette for example, I prefer blades that have become too dull for use in the DE."

Just get a regular cereal or soup bowl, scoop about 1/3 of the soap from the small sample jar and press and mold it into the bottom of the bowl. Then you can take a damp brush and swirl and load from this bowl for 30ish seconds. Once your brush is loaded you can either lather on your face and keep adding water to the brush until the lather is good, or you can get another bowl, add some water and start building your lather in there."
wicked_edge,3d49w7,Wickatron,2,Mon Jul 13 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"as of recently, Maggard's sends some instructions with samples. On is to put the soap sample (or some of it- these sample are only meant for a handful of shaves)  into a small bowl in which to apply lather. Whether you will ultimately face lather or bowl/scuttle lather, this is an important step for brush loading. Trying to load a brush on those 1 inch diameter sample cups is frustrating at best, and ineffective at worst,"
wicked_edge,3d49w7,abbyw2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:39:07 2015 UTC,"I actually had a lot of trouble with the sample soaps that I got from there so much that I stopped using them at first. I found it hard to create a decent lather with them when learning, but more recently I have found I am able to do it now.  The way I personally do it is the following:   Soak brush for a while in warm water While that is happening put a few drops of water on the sample soap Take out brush and do a slight shake so brush does not drip water (really just a small shake) start to firmly rub the brush over the sample in circles. You will have to move the brush around for complete cover.  do this the ends of the brush seem to stick together   I am no expert in shaving and there are others much better. If you search around you will find similar posts and even more specific details such as having hard water and how to fix (by instead using distilled water to lather or putting in a pinch of citric acid).  Welcome to /r/wicked_edge!"
wicked_edge,3d49w7,13djwright,2,Mon Jul 13 14:52:32 2015 UTC,"You can soak the brush simply by getting the knot wet under the hot-water tap, squeezing it gently as you do that to ensure that it's totally wet, and then let it stand. Only boar and horsehair brushes require soaking---you can skip the step with badger and synthetic. (You can test it: soak brush for 6-7 shaves, skip the step for 6-7 shaves, and soak it again for 6-7 shaves and see for yourself whether it makes any difference. With boar and horsehair, it does.)  No need to wet the soap: the wet-damp brush will provide all the water needed. (See this video of loading a brush from a soap that had not had water put on it in advance.) But again, you can test: do it for 6-7 shaves each way and see whether it makes a noticeable difference."

Just do your research before buying one, maybe post on here when you find one you think is good. I'd recommend going on /r/Shave_Bazaar and watching for a shave ready straight.

wicked_edge,3d3ioe,blackbeltbanana,2,Mon Jul 13 08:17:23 2015 UTC,"There are two reasons to start with a safety razor, and neither of them are huge reasons:   To work on your brushmanship with a razor that's a bit more forgiving. That is, to learn all about making lather and what lather works for you with a razor that doesn't tear your face apart as easily. As long as you're careful, though, you should be perfectly fine. Cost. This is the bigger one. It's pretty cheap to get started with safety razors: get one of the $25 starter kits from Italian Barber, add in a sampler pack of blades and an alum block. In total it shouldn't be more than $50 or so. With straights, you're going to want the razor (which could easily cost $150-200 by itself), a couple strops, a honing block, and the brush/soap/alum you need with safety razors. You can hold off on the honing block for a while, but you'll need it sooner or later.   All said, if you're just not interested in using a safety razor and you have the money for a straight, then go for it! Like others have said, definitely do your research to make sure you're getting good gear. And before you order anything, you should make a post here saying what you're ordering and we'll make sure to let you know if there's anything bad in it.  Welcome to the community!"
wicked_edge,3d3ioe,demize95,4,Mon Jul 13 13:49:43 2015 UTC,"In re: point 2. A good vintage straight can be had - shave ready - for ~$50 from one of our skilled redditors on Shave_Bazaar.  I personally started with a modern ""gently used"" entry level Dovo I picked up at an antique store for $10. Honing by one of our skilled redditors runs $20 or less, so my initial investment in a 5/8 round point Dovo was $30. Also, one strop is sufficient, and inexpensive strops are available from the same source. As you said, a honing stone isn't necessary to start with, and as long as one is starting with a shave ready blade the only hone needed will be a finishing hone to maintain the edge.   If you go with an inexpensive quality boar brush such as an Omega ($10), a good inexpensive quality soap such as B&M Latha ($10), and a bottle of generic Witch Hazel ($1 or less at Walmart) for an astringent/after shave, you can get started straight razor shaving for ~$75-$100 total."
wicked_edge,3d3ioe,junderdawg,2,Mon Jul 13 14:43:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think it has to be that expensive when starting with a Straight. The razor cost you listed is only for new razors, there are a few users and places that will do ""used"" razors at much lower costs and will come shave ready. A couple strops seem a bit at first. I think just one strop should be okay as long as you are careful.  I would not say a honing block is needed ever either if you just send it out to be honed (like $25 whereas a block is much more). This only happens I think every 6 months or so, YMMV.   I just bought for $60 a sight unseen straight with a 3"" strop. So most of my post comes from what I have read around this sub for a while."

If it's a question of angle and pressure, maybe you could learn that from a safety razor before, but that is just speculation. I haven't used a straight so I can only assume having a safety razor will minimise the damage you could have potentially done with a straight."

wicked_edge,3d3ioe,GoodVelo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"Learning to shave with a real straight razor, while time consuming, isn't terribly difficult. Just mind your angles and pressure, and make sure to use a well built proper lather made from a soap or real cream - no canned aerosol creams from a can.   A shavette, on the other hand, can be difficult to learn and can leave you bloody and sore for quite some time. The original purpose/use for the shavette was as a hair trimmer/shaper. People use it for shaving, some quite successfully, but most people experience a much steeper learning curve than with a true straight razor and generally experience many more nicks and cuts (and more severe cuts) than a true straight."
wicked_edge,3d3ioe,junderdawg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:33:40 2015 UTC,"IMO the main reason to learn to shave with a safety razor before taking up a straight razor is that it's easier. It took me a couple of days to start getting good shaves with a DE; it was more like a couple of months before I was proficient with a straight.  During that time, the DE came in handy - I do a three-pass shave every morning, and would start the shave with the straight razor and finish with the DE. As I got more comfortable with the straight I'd do more of the shave with that and less with the DE.  Don't know if that would work for you, but it worked for me..."

wicked_edge,3d6cpz,Zfetcko,6,Tue Jul 14 00:24:48 2015 UTC,"I'll try to give you some advice, since it sounds like your situation is similar to mine:  First of all, the number one thing you can do in your situation is get a brush and use proper shaving soap. The canned stuff just doesn't cut it. Using proper shaving soap with a brush softens up the hairs and makes them significantly easier to cut: I've had tolerable shaves with cartridge razors using a brush and soap, but using the caned stuff just makes the razor pull my hairs instead of cut.  Second, shave after you shower, and make sure you're getting your face wet in the shower. The water helps soften the hairs, just like using proper shaving soap.  Third, try different blades and maybe a different razor. The Parker 24C is an excellent razor, as is the Edwin Jagger DE89. Both can be had for around $30. As for blades, buy a sampler pack and try each blade in it a couple times until you find one that works. There are people who say that blades don't matter, but you should judge that yourself. I've had great success with certain blades in my Edwin Jagger razor that just don't work for me in my Parker razor, and the blades that work best in my Gilette razor don't work well for me in any other one I own despite being one of the more popular blades out there.  If none of this works for you, then you may be best off with an electric razor. They tend to be much gentler, but they don't tend to get as close a shave as other razors.  Finally, you should read the sidebar and look at the links there. If you're planning on purchasing more, you should ask about it here first in case there's anything bad on your list.  Oh, and one more thing: no matter what you shave with, it sounds like an alum block would certainly be a good investment for you. It would help with the razor bumps at least a little."

Between the waitlists for the BBS-1 and the Wolfman Razors, he was booked for months, and the waitlists were still growing, which meant there was no time for him to get to work on developing prototypes for future razors.  So we gave everyone a few weeks notice to get on the waitlist at the then current price, and bumped the prices on the BBS-1 and the Wolfman Razors to try to slow down the demand slightly, so that he could have time to develop new product.  If you've seen the BBS-1 in person, you know how nice it is, and it doesn't get that nice without a lot of time and effort and polishing, and when you've got an aerospace machinist putting in that level of time and effort, that comes at a price.  They're definitely not for everyone, and economy has never been a driving factor for these razors.

wicked_edge,3d3plm,wadenator,3,Mon Jul 13 07:25:12 2015 UTC,An alum block is basically a coagulant (consists of aluminium salts). An aftershave is meant to lessen the stress of the skin and remoisturize after the shave.
wicked_edge,3d3plm,Istykker,3,Mon Jul 13 08:48:12 2015 UTC,"Um, no.  An alum block has astringent and antibacterial properties. It really isn't a very good coagulant; a styptic pencil works better for that.  Different aftershaves do different things. As someone with oily skin, I use alcohol-based splashes to tone and soothe my skin. People with dry skin tend to prefer balms, which (as you note) moisturize."
wicked_edge,3d3plm,arbarnes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:28:55 2015 UTC,"Aftershave balms will moisturize. I think aloe and witch hazel might as well.   Aftershave splashes are astringent, disinfectant but also dry out your face. Mostly used for fragrance."
wicked_edge,3d3plm,IllegalMonk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:04:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, go with alcohol free aftershaves."
wicked_edge,3d3plm,Istykker,2,Mon Jul 13 21:38:29 2015 UTC,Depends on the skin type and how much you want the fragrances
wicked_edge,3d3plm,IllegalMonk,3,Mon Jul 13 21:58:25 2015 UTC,"Alum both tightens the face, closing up weepers in the process, and disinfects so those weepers are less likely to get infected.  There are two basic types of aftershave (AS)--splash and balm.  The splash is usually an alcohol-based liquid.  It will provide a ""sting"" (Home Alone style) on areas of your face that have the skin broken, disinfecting in the process.  They can also have other ingredients (i.e. menthol) that provide a different skin feel, tightening and all that.  AS usually have a pronounced scent and, because of the alcohol, can dry out skin.  Balms are more like lotions.  They don't provide a sting so much as a soothe.  And rather than dry out, they moisturize."
wicked_edge,3d3plm,repete66219,2,Mon Jul 13 14:00:51 2015 UTC,"Alum Blocks are AMAZING. They are used to help stop the bleeding from any nicks, but I don't cut myself anymore and still use it after every shave. You get this amazing tightening feeling that tingles a bit. Leaves your face feeling really fresh.  Highly recommend. This is the one that I purchased a couple months ago and I still have most of it left despite the high usage. As far as price per oz goes, I don't think it gets better than this, and brand loyalty means nothing with alum blocks as they are all basically the same."
wicked_edge,3d3plm,fawkesmulder,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:45:09 2015 UTC,They do indeed last forever. Is like an antiperspirant just 100% in crystallized form. I use it as antiperspirant as well. Works way better than high strength ones since you can apply a precise amount unlike the roll ons.
wicked_edge,3d3plm,Istykker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:03:08 2015 UTC,"In addition to what other people have said about alum blocks, their antiseptic properties help lessen or entirely prevent razor bumps. Most people wash the alum off a minute after applying it, and then they can apply aftershave if they want. There's no reason to use one and not the other unless you just don't want to use one!"

wicked_edge,3d1gfb,richilina,8,Sun Jul 12 19:08:55 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you've rolled the edge.
wicked_edge,3d1gfb,arbarnes,2,Sun Jul 12 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"I'm new to this stuff, what exactly does that mean?"
wicked_edge,3d1gfb,arbarnes,6,Sun Jul 12 19:35:45 2015 UTC,"The edge of a straight razor is somewhat flexible. If you strop it improperly, or let it come into contact with - well, with just about anything other than whiskers, you can turn the edge so that it no longer points straight out from the spine.   If you have a high-powered loupe or microscope you may be able to see this. And if the edge isn't rolled too badly, you might be able to re-align it using a balsa strop and abrasive paste. But your best bet is probably to send it to a honemeister who can diagnose and fix the problem."
wicked_edge,3d1gfb,arbarnes,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:48:10 2015 UTC,"It's only at one little spot, on one side of the blade. Could that still mean that it's a rolled edge? Being as it isn't all the way down the edge?"
wicked_edge,3d1gfb,RVmaster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:04:15 2015 UTC,Ayup. You can roll all or any part of the edge. I had the same problem with a razor that hit the scales when it closed.
wicked_edge,3d1gfb,arbarnes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:25:00 2015 UTC,Damn. And this isn't something I can fix myself with some chromium oxide?
wicked_edge,3d1gfb,Leg_Mcmuffin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:27:19 2015 UTC,If you only rolled the point at the toe it's possible to fix it with chromium oxide paste 20-30 laps then plain leather 60-120 laps. If you rolled more than just the very tip then it will need to be completely rehoned.   Edit spelling
wicked_edge,3d1gfb,Vassap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:42:22 2015 UTC,"I'll try that. I think it's only the tip, on one side of the edge. If it doesn't work I guess I'll just have to send it in."

I don't want to repeat what I did during my learning stages with a straight razor haha. I made sure to read as much as I could to get a good grasp. Due to a lack of prep and knowledge back then, I had lots of nicks and cuts learning to shave. The old kit had a pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and after shave balm. I figured it was time to learn to properly shave and buy some more product to test and try out :)."
wicked_edge,3d35zn,Wickatron,2,Mon Jul 13 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"I would get some sort of post shave. I use Thayer's witch hazel, unscented with aloe and it definitely helps when I get a little razor burn. You won't feel or smell anything like you would with another alcohol based aftershave, but it will definitely help the redness go away more quickly. Also, TOBS is fantastic but you might want to get samples of some other soaps or creams in case you end up not liking TOBS. All of the sample brands Maggard's offers are great so you can't really go wrong. Good luck!"
wicked_edge,3d35zn,Wickatron,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion :). I will look into some post-shave options. I figured the alum block + my left over postshave will last me a bit, but now that I look at it again its rather low.   I will try some other soap/creams samples from Maggard's after I use up my TOBS samples :). They were highly recommended in some of the posts so I had to try them.

wicked_edge,3d6mpi,CombatJorts,12,Mon Jul 13 22:54:19 2015 UTC,"You seem to be somewhat uninformed about stainless razors. And razors in general, for that matter.  First, the best stainless razors - Above the Tie, Wolfman, and LA Shaving - are precision-machined from a billet of steel on a CNC mill. They're made one at a time and hand finished. No assembly line is involved. It's a labor-intensive process that eats machine tools. And while ATT razors are readily available (at US$185 each), you have to get on a 4- to 5-month waiting list to buy a Wolfman for CAD$300.  Feather and iKon razors are made from sintered stainless. But I know that iKons are plated and suspect that Feathers are as well. Not sure if the top layer is chrome or not. But then again, high chromium content is what makes stainless steel stainless in the first place (if that matters to you).  Finally, a DE razor is not just a ""razor blade holder."" A razor's head geometry  is very important in determining shave quality.  If you want a cheap razor, get a cheap razor. There are plenty of good ones out there. But if you want a stainless razor, you're going to have to pay for it.   A possible alternative for you to consider is an aluminum razor. Standard Razors are fully machined from aluminum, while the iKon ShaveCraft #101 and #102 have aluminum heads. Because aluminum is so much easier to machine, they cost a lot less than stainless razors."

It is so common I can't come up with an adequate simile.   Finally, a DE razor is not just a ""razor blade holder."" A razor's head geometry is very important in determining shave quality.   Except it literally is. It's common knowledge the geometry to apply to a safety bar for an aggressive shave or a mild shave, so there isn't any high level engineering involved. No way. I won't be duped into buying into 'the perfect shaving geometry.' It's marketing.   A possible alternative for you to consider is an aluminum razor. Standard Razors are fully machined from aluminum, while the iKon ShaveCraft #101 and #102 have aluminum heads. Because aluminum is so much easier to machine, they cost a lot less than stainless razors.   Wasn't aware of aluminimum razors, but they are probably bad. Such a feather weight metal would weigh probably the same as a disposable bic razor. It'd be like having to learn to shave all over again with a DE razor.

I wouldn't have said anything if you had said it was obnoxiously expensive because it is.   And yes ferraris are expensive for the reason you said but many people in this thread including myself have explained why this razor is more expensive than others.
wicked_edge,3d6mpi,Huckleberryking,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:03:50 2015 UTC,"The way you are looking at the razor price a little unrealistic. You seem to see it as the metal costs x so the price should be y; but you are forgetting z = labor, manufacturing, and overhead. Yes stainless steel is readily available but manufacturers have to take a billet of steel and cut off parts they don't need to make the razor where other razors of lesser metals such as brass or zinc can be cheaply mass produced by casting large batches and then finishing those batches quickly by grinding etc. The macho nines and tools needed to CNBC stainless steel are more expensive and require more skilled workman to operate that have to be paid a higher hourly wage. Combine the increased cost of manufacturing and labor with the fact that the manufacturer can't produce as many stainless razors per hour due to the need to hand finish the much more durable metal and it adds up. If a plant can produce 1000 zinc or brass razors per hour and it costs them $100 to make them for that hour vs 500 stainless razors that cost 200 to make then they have to charge more for the stainless razor because it is costing them more and take up space that they could use to produce cheaper razors that sell faster.   As for the razor just being a blade holder that is true. The dimensions to make the razor mild or aggressive are known known; but when manufacturing anything there are tolerances of give in the machining process. Manufacturers can make multiples of the same head easily but it might have defects that have to be ground off, the machine left a little tag of metal on the razor head, or the machine was wearing out a tool and some razors are out of spec. Those heads then have to be closely inspected and either corrected or thrown away because the blade angle is off. When you are dealing in razors that the head dimensions are critical and the pieces are small it becomes more challenging to get it perfect every time. Cheaper razors will still be sold or sold to another distributor that will sell them even cheaper while stainless razor manufacturers will remelt them or throw them away which means the consumer absorbs the cost of the raw materials. So while it is just a blade holder it is a precisely manufactured blade holder.   If the stainless is too expensive, the aluminum is too light, then you might consider finding someone that produces custom handles for razors. Someone that has a lathe can buy a kit and made wood or acrylic handles for de razors; it adds weight, durability, and looks to the razor for a decent price."
wicked_edge,3d6mpi,vivek7006,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"The interesting precision for me is the alignment of the blade. When the pins or rails on the top cap that hold the blade have play in them, you have to eyeball and adjust the blade to get even exposure all the way around.   On the well made very expensive ones, you don't have to do that. On some of the less expensive ones you don't need to do that. But it's a minor thing."

wicked_edge,3d6mpi,ACMEanvils,3,Tue Jul 14 01:14:16 2015 UTC,"Lightweight does not require pressure. It requires a light touch.   If you're thinking of applying pressure to compensate for light weight, stop and rethink. It's just not necessary. If the razor skips or jumps across your face, it's not more pressure that's needed but more slickness (soap, cream, oil) and perhaps a sharper blade.   The Standard is one of the greats. It works better for me than many others."

One end screws into the head, the other into handle. The result is a more durable thread and a post that can be replaced if some dope cross threads it.

wicked_edge,3d0xzo,jrodrox,14,Sun Jul 12 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"For some people, the roots of their facial hair will always show through no matter how often they shave.  The best thing to do is to be kind to your skin. It's not your fault that you're a hairy beast!  Presuming you have good technique and strong prep when you shave, you might consider the following:  1) a slant head safety razor: these razors cut more efficiently (read: not more aggressively) which is often perfect for people who have sensitive skin. Also, since it cuts more efficiently, you reduce your hairs much more quickly with each pass than you might otherwise do with standard safety razor.   2) witch hazel: works wonders on irritation. Thayer's is cheap and has worked wonders for me.  3) better soaps: some soaps provide better protection (cushion and glide) than others. you might want to consider getting a different soap if the one you are using doesn't provide you with enough protection.  4) cold water shave: your milage may vary here (and, honestly, with everything wet shaving) but shaving with cold water can help produce a more irritation free shave.  5) leave bbs behind: if you are aiming for BBS every time you shave, you may just be putting your skin through unnecessary trauma. Just produce an acceptable shave and be kind to your skin :)  6) one-pass shaves: there was a post here about old school one-pass shaves. Very recent post. Doing multiple passes might not be good for you on a daily basis, so you may just benefit from modifying your routine to limit the amount of times your skin is exposed to a blade.  Give some of these tips a shot! I'm sure others here will chime in as well."

wicked_edge,3d0xzo,repete66219,5,Fri Jul 17 09:10:39 2015 UTC,"If you're comfortable shaving after a few days but uncomfortable shaving after one, it seems likely that you're irritating your skin when you shave. It isn't that you don't have irritation after you shave three days' growth, it's just that it isn't bad enough to bother you and heals up over the next couple of days. If you shave every day, the cumulative effect of daily minor irritation adds up.  So go back to the basics. Try different blades, maybe try a different razor, focus on your angle, and remember - no pressure. Excessive pressure is the source of irritation nine times out of ten."
wicked_edge,3d0xzo,repete66219,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:02:17 2015 UTC,"Tbh, I am still working at trying not to use pressure. Somehow though I tend to leave behind hair or tug at the hair.

wicked_edge,3d0xzo,SwordsOfVaul,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:18:16 2015 UTC,"If you're leaving behind hair, it's probably because your blade angle is wrong. And the natural way to compensate for bad angle is with pressure. Which leads to irritation.  Try this: Instead of judging your blade angle by looking in the mirror, judge it by the sound the razor makes. Listen to the way the blade sings when you're shaving the flats of your cheeks, and then listen to how it changes when you cross your jaw line. What you want to do is figure out how to keep the sound consistent as you shave around the curves.  Also, you might want to try a different soap. The ingredient list of the one you linked starts off with glycerin, and all the glycerin soaps I've used are sorely lacking in slickness. More slickness, less irritation."
wicked_edge,3d0xzo,airtightalright,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:15:41 2015 UTC,I'm the same way.  I haven't found a razor/blade/soap combo that didn't yield a great shave with 4 days of growth.  The real challenge for me in wet shaving has been to find a combo that provides a smooth shave with only 1 day of growth.
wicked_edge,3d0kuu,120inna55,8,Sun Jul 12 14:29:25 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/sI9ity2.jpg  Head & face shower shave. 2 days growth.  Technique:  WTG / XTG / ATG/clean-up.  Prep: Shower.        Soap: Wholly Kaw - ""Scent # 3"" (beta)  Brush: Ever-Ready 100T restored by Thomas Burgess with TGN Finest Badger knot  Razor: Edwin Jagger DE89 with iKon Bamboo Handle  Blade: Treet Platinum Super Stainless(1)  Post: Fine's Snake Bite  Soap review:  Wholly Kaw (/u/goodthingstolife) kindly sent me a sample of a soap they're working on.  If I understand it correctly, it's intended to pair with a splash already in production, ""Jamestown Gentleman"".  The soap is in beta.  I want a tub of this stuff now!  I wouldn't change a single thing about it with regard to performance and scent.  I'd never used anything by Wholly Kaw, and frankly, I hadn't heard much about them.  I'm not sure why they've been under my radar, because the performance stands up to anything I've used.  It provided superior protection and an enormous amount of thick, dense, paintable lather with a luxurious sheen.  I'm usually not a fan of sample sizes, but pressed down into a shallow ceramic bowl, ""Scent # 3"" loaded effortlessly.  I then started building the lather in my Nicole Pangas shaving bowl.  I do note it performed better starting out dry, but slowly dribbling in small amounts of water dialed it in perfectly.  Finally, it exploded into the voluminous lather seen in my photo.  It should be noted this is the leftover lather after a 45-second load and 3 head and face passes.  (For those of you who scoff at the 45-second load, that amount is typically what is required for me to have ample lather with some left over for post shave.  It was obviously too much for this sample.  I can't say if that's because I'm accustomed to loading from a puck as opposed to a thin sample pressed down into a shallow bowl, or if it's simply a Wholly Kaw characteristic.)  There's still enough of the sample to get me probably another 3-4 3-pass shaves.  The scent of this beta sample is, in a word, beautiful.  It started with a light, nondescript powdery floral scent in the bowl.  Working the lather into my skin, it warmed up to a definite tobacco floral aroma with warm woodsy and musk notes that never overpowered the gentle sweetness of the tobacco.  Subsequent passes held those notes.  The post-shave result was very soft and moisturized, and is easily in my top 5 artisan soaps. I finished with Fine's Snake bite because I didn't want to mask the lingering scent from the soap.  I was still aware of the scent about an hour later.  I need to do more research, but if this truly is the same scent profile for Wholly Kaw's ""Jamestown Gentleman"" splash, I need it.  I also need this soap in my rotation ASAP."
wicked_edge,3d0kuu,goodthingstolife,2,Sun Jul 12 14:31:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for testing Scent #3 and for your feedback. You are right this is based on Jamestown Gentleman scent profile without changes in the formulation.  Watch out for the announcement re production launch.

wicked_edge,3d0kuu,Unclecrow,2,Wed Jul 15 11:42:03 2015 UTC,"Wow! I can't wait. Jamestown Gentleman is my favorite in my aftershave collection. The scent is awesome and the feel on the face is perfect. The ingredient list is the same as Fine, but some how it has lass burn and more cool. I originally bought it to go with Tabac but I find it's a great follow up to many of the soaps in my collection. I will buy any soap that they make which matches JG as soon as it's available."
wicked_edge,3d2w0l,destinyofdoors,3,Mon Jul 13 02:21:27 2015 UTC,Try just loading more soap before you start making lather.
wicked_edge,3d2w0l,chuckfalzone,2,Mon Jul 13 02:35:18 2015 UTC,"Lathering is a process.  Soak the brush for at least a few minutes, then give it a gentle squeeze before loading.  The soap can be dry or, if hard, you can add a layer of water (""bloom"") while the brush is soaking.  Once brush and soap are ready, load the brush for 20-30 seconds until the hairs are inundated with soap.  Then move to the bowl and get to work.  If the lather doesn't start growing, add water a few droplets at a time (flinging wet fingers at the bowl) until the lather is just a bunch of microscopic little bubbles and it forms peaks. YouTube is your friend."
wicked_edge,3d2w0l,repete66219,2,Mon Jul 13 14:06:30 2015 UTC,"i do überlather  this morning, for example, i loaded my soaked brush with Through The Fire Tinder soap which had been sitting with water on it while I showered i made 40 swirls of the brush on the puck .   i then moved to my scuttle, where i had a small almond sized snurdle of l'occitane Cade cream and 5-6 drops of glycerine. i gave this a vigorous 50 or so swirls with the soaped brush.  i got rich, thick, moist lather. enough for more than 3 passes. There was no drying at all during any of the 3 passes.  got a BBS shave.  hardware: G20 scuttle, mergress, Gillette 7 o'clock yellow, rooney victorian super badger  i believe the soap and cream choices go far toward great lather"
wicked_edge,3d2w0l,abbyw2,2,Mon Jul 13 14:49:19 2015 UTC,"I hear you with that big brush.  I used to use the PRO48 and face lathering was a mess.  I do prefer to bowl lather.  I've also moved on to a smaller brush.  Lots of talk in here about bad soaps, and much of the advice you've received is good.  That said, I can get a usable 3-pass head and face bowl lather from just about any soap from Colgate, Williams, to Stirling, to TOBS, etc.  The difference is effort and awareness of the quirks and intricacies of each soap.  Sometimes this can bifrucate at Tallow vs. Vegan.  But even then, there are characteristics of each soap within those categories.    When you hear someone describe a soap as thirsty, listen to that.  In my experience, Stirling is one of the thirstiest soaps out there.  So, I learned to add more water.  Despite that, I found that it still took an enormous amount of effort to get a usable lather.  Then, by accident, I discovered that not only did Stirling require a considerable amount of water, but it required it from the front end.  That is to say I needed to start with more water than other soaps. Adding a little along the way just didn't work well.  One day, while shower shaving, a good splash of water inadvertently made it into my bowl just as I was starting to transfer the brush from the puck to the bowl.  Within seconds, the Stirling exploded into a rich, ""yogurt"" lather.  Some of the most beautiful lather you've ever seen.  It was effortless.  Henceforth, I've learned to use the same amount of water I've always used with Stirling, but I use it right off the bat instead of dribbling it in along the way.  Conversely, with only a sample of Wholly Kaw's soap, I quickly learned it performed better by starting relatively dry and adding more water on the back end.  The resulting lather was just as beautiful as Stirling's.  (Note these are very different soaps with Wholly Kaw being vegan and Stirling having tallow and clay), but you shouldn't infer a general rule that tallows need front-end water and non-tallow need back-end.  These are just observations, but I find they hold true to specific soap makers, not necessarily soap types.  I think this is an aspect that's often missed by this community.  I think the rationale is that it's subtle and that some of it may be subconscious.  I also suspect there are veteran wetshavers who've abandoned a soap as ""bad"" when should they experiment with front-end vs back-end hydration, they may open up a new realm of soaps they enjoy.    Also, note just the water on your skin can destroy a delicate lather.  Vegan soaps tend to be more forgiving of a wet face, but a tallow-based soap can easily fall apart.  This may in fact be what you're experiencing.  As far a hard water, you can use distilled water, but you can also sprinkle a little citric acid into your water to accomplish the same thing. Citric acid can be found in the canning section of your local department store.  I waste soap.  It's relatively cheap.  I head and face shave, so I pretty much have a bowl full of lather to start with in order to cover the large territory and 3 passes.  I think as a beginner bowl latherer, you should err on the side of too much, so load more soap on the brush than what you think you need.  Who cares if you wash some beautiful lather down the sink when you're all done.  The advice about the new boar brush is so true, and that may be your only problem.  However, you should still get a usable lather.  A broken-in boar just means less effort, but a new boar can yield the same lather an old one can.  The old one just gets there faster."

If you are getting nothing but foam you either aren't using enough soap or you are using a terrible soap.   A proper lather should have a consistency similar to Coolwhip or yogurt and shouldn't dissipate when you apply it to your face. It also shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to whip up once you have your technique down.
wicked_edge,3d2w0l,BOOM_BOOM_BAM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:18:52 2015 UTC,I'm using Col. Conk Amber soap. I think my issue is a combination of not loading enough soap and really hard water.
wicked_edge,3d2w0l,chuckfalzone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:48:41 2015 UTC,"Col. Conk has usually produced subpar lathers in my experience. But to your question, I would agree that using more soap before you begin lathering might help or trying a distilled water shave like mentioned elsewhere in this thread.   As a beginner, I would recommend trying a soft soap to work on your technique as they are usually much easier to load and work into a lather. Proraso soaps are typically recommended in this sub. This definitely helped me when I was starting out."
wicked_edge,3d2w0l,almightywhacko,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:09:20 2015 UTC,"Col. Conk is mediocre at best, that is likely part of the problem. Another thing I thought of: a new boar brush tends to inhibit lather-making until it's fully broken in. After a couple weeks of shaves it should get a lot better (and it'll feel softer on your face)."
wicked_edge,3d2w0l,goodthingstolife,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"Col. Conk Amber soap is pretty much garbage. Most glycerin-based shaving soaps aren't worth the trouble it takes to lather them. You might want to look at getting yourself something a little bit better.   If you wanna keep the price down, Dr. Jon's Soaps come in 2oz sized for ~$8. RazoRock soaps are generally around $8. Barrister & Mann's ""Latha"" line of soaps is $11. If you can go as high as $15 there are literally hundreds of soaps that offer great performance and longevity like Pre de Provence, Maggard Artisan, Wet Shaving Products, Tiki Bar Soaps, Dapper Dragon, etc.   I know there are hundreds of soap options and some of them are quite expensive, however a decent soap can really be the difference between a good shave and a face full or razor burn. You owe it to yourself to get something decent."

I sometimes use my feather shavette to touch up the back of my neck in between haircuts, but I gave myself a couple of good cuts the first time I tried it. I also do it in a bathroom that has two mirrors on opposing walls so that I can see the back of my head. If you've never used a straight to shave your face and are unfamiliar with the importance of pressure and angle I imagine trying to shave a spot you can't see would be even harder. If you don't have a brush yet, a big brush would definitely help with lathering up your entire head.

wicked_edge,3d0w6l,CoffeeFox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:39:30 2015 UTC,"A bit of googling on my part suggests that is a whetstone intended for sharpening kitchen knives.  I'm sure it would do a good job for cutlery, but stones meant for knives are usually nowhere near fine enough for razors, which require not only a sharper, but also a much smoother cutting edge."

wicked_edge,3d0w6l,IllegalMonk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"Japanese cutlery is often honed to a fine grit, which is why Japanese waterstones are so ideally suited to straight razors.

Add a stick or two of Arko, an Omega S-Brush, and a few 5-packs of blades, and you're all set for a total of less than the $13 you were looking to spend on the razors."

Yeah, there are better soaps out there (I've got a drawer full of 'em), but for somebody who's ""trying to keep things pretty cheap"" it can't be beat.  That said, if switching to the RiMei from the Weishi opens up room in the budget, something like a jar of B&M Latha or a 2 oz. tin of Dr. Jon's would be a significant upgrade."
wicked_edge,3d1es5,arbarnes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:02:46 2015 UTC,"Arko is good for the price. It lathers fine but doesn't smell very nice and I have always found it drying to my skin, which is a common complaint against it.  I would definitely try to include something nicer if the intention of my kit was to get people to adopt wet shaving. The $7 Dr. Jon's is a good suggestion.

I highly recommend Gene's for lunch or dinner, especially their rooftop on a nice day. And grab some gelato at the place north of the fountain.   Any of the bars are good right there. Tons of German beer. And a cute little shop called Enjoy that is perfect for fun souvenirs/toys if you have kids or an SO you want to grab a little gift for.   And you can also walk south to see a movie at the Davis, one of the shittiest little theaters in America. They're renovating it next year. I'd like to get back before they do to see one more movie in those broken seats that don't really face the screen.   And across the street there (still on Lincoln) is a great soul food place called Luella's Southern Kitchen. Great dinner spot. So long as you stay on Lincoln, you'll be able to see the tracks, so you won't be list.   Have a great trip!"

wicked_edge,3cxqel,Phteven_j,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:23:40 2015 UTC,This shave is based on traditional straights with a custom twist. It feels very solid in the hand as most of the weight is in the handle which makes it nice to control. My brother prefers this kind over the one with closing handle. I like both.

I have not tried the others you have.
wicked_edge,3cxh1y,Buffalo-Custardbath,4,Sat Jul 11 18:16:17 2015 UTC,"I went for Trade Winds. Very light and refreshing - great for the Summer. And what a lather, so thick and luxurious. Sherlock will be next! :)"
wicked_edge,3cxh1y,chiseledface,3,Sat Jul 11 18:41:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried the Cryogen soap, but their aftershave is no joke!  That stuff should come with a warning label!  Rediculously cold!"
wicked_edge,3cxh1y,Buffalo-Custardbath,2,Sat Jul 11 19:05:05 2015 UTC,I'm looking forward to it. It smells fairly tame in the tub but I expect the lather to be an animal.
wicked_edge,3cxh1y,Buffalo-Custardbath,3,Sat Jul 11 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"I think menthol is the only other ingredient apart from /u/chiseledface's standard soap recipe. I recall reading he put as much menthol into Cryogen as was possible while maintaining the great lathering capabilities.  Edit: With that being said, I tried lathering Cryogen yesterday but didn't succeed, to which Ron commented that I have to let it sit on the counter without the cap for a week and try it again."
wicked_edge,3cxh1y,BAMFSoB,3,Sat Jul 11 20:54:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, my other soaps all tolerate extra water quite well,  but the level of menthol makes Cryogen a bit finicky. It works well when dry, but if capped when wet, performance starts going down until it drys again. It also does not tolerate ""blooming"" aka covering with water like triple milled hard soaps do"

Definitely excellent blades.  I just had a velvety smooth shave with the Blue Birds.  Also, there is a local place in my college town called Bluebird Diner that is near and dear to my heart.

wicked_edge,3cwqfc,idefiler6,3,Sat Jul 11 13:36:31 2015 UTC,"Lady here. /r/ladyshavers is a great community, be sure to say hi to us there! I don't have sensitive legs, but I experienced ingrown hairs with cartridges as well. You're going to love DE shaving. Imo the shave last just a tad longer than cartridge, but it's smoother, feels great, and shaving is an experience in itself. Put on some music and enjoy the scents of the shave soap you've chosen.   As far as prep goes I would just exfoliate (if you can) and use glycerin soap to help soften the hairs. If you have any more questions let us know!"
wicked_edge,3cwqfc,Av33na,3,Sat Jul 11 14:14:38 2015 UTC,I was going to say the same thing. Wash with a glycerine soap and exfoliate before the shave. Also make sure to pay attention to blade angle and don't use any pressure while shaving. I'm sure you'll love it.
wicked_edge,3cwqfc,kcbeemo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:45:47 2015 UTC,Honest question from a dude on exfoliation. I have very sensitive skin on my face and neck. I'll get razor burn and ingrown hair if I don't use pre-shave oil and all that jazz... Wouldn't the shaving itself provide the exfoliating? Maybe I should sand my face before shaving?
wicked_edge,3cwqfc,BlackWhiteCat,2,Sat Jul 11 18:04:30 2015 UTC,I use exfoliating to remove the dead skin on top of ingrown hairs so that they can be shaved off and not turn into something bothersome. If you exfoliate ever time it should help to eliminate them. But I look forward to someone else's opinion as I am always learning!
wicked_edge,3cwqfc,kcbeemo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:12:57 2015 UTC,"In for comments as well - I have issues with ingrowns on my neck (after good prep, technique, etc).  I was debating the merits of exfoliating in the shower prior to shaving.  Wanted to see if anyone followed up kcbeemo's comment."

wicked_edge,3cwqfc,Av33na,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"Great! I love the glycerin soap, it's not shave soap, but you can find it almost anywhere. Whole foods has some fun ones but I bought mine at king soopers (Kroger) called Clearly Natural."

wicked_edge,3cwqfc,RazoRock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:38:51 2015 UTC,Using a brush will definitely help with mild exfoliating and also help to prepare the hair for shaving.  Make sure to finish the shave with a moisturizing after shave balm/cream if you have trouble with in grown hairs.

wicked_edge,3cy6o6,therushingmidget,4,Sat Jul 11 21:09:37 2015 UTC,"I hate saying this because it's considered impersonal, but I see it as the safest option in not knowing specifics: A gift certificate. Maggard's seems like a good choice. You could always dress up the gift certificate with something smaller you know this person would like. A shirt? A bottle of whiskey?.  If you don't know specifics about his (assuming) gear and what he likes or may like, then it's very difficult to determine "" Ultimate Shaving Gift"". In all honesty, if someone gave me a $2,000 Maggards gift certificate, that would pretty much cover the ""Ultimate Shaving Gift"". I'm sure many members here would agree."
wicked_edge,3cy6o6,Nusquam-Humanitus,2,Sat Jul 11 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I believe gift certificates and gift cards are the most convenient gifts to give and to receive.

wicked_edge,3cy6o6,RuggerRigger,2,Sat Jul 11 21:44:40 2015 UTC,I'd go for a custom straight razor package from ShaveSmith. It's basically a voucher with options that you give him and ShaveSmith makes it specifications.   That's in the ~$300 range so it'll be quite expensive.
wicked_edge,3cy6o6,EmptyAy,2,Sun Jul 12 04:54:56 2015 UTC,If budget isn't a worry and they already like straight razors you could look into buying a custom straight. Check ShaveSmith or thescottishrazorco for examples that cost some money but aren't ridiculous.
wicked_edge,3cy6o6,Greyzer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:02:03 2015 UTC,You could order a custom soap for them from someone like Dapper Dragon if you know of a certain scent that might be special for them.

Not too strong I hope.  I guess my favorite splashes now are still Speick and Tabac.  I like the Fine splashes but the scents are only OK.  Chiseled Face has lots of good stuff in their splashes but I'm not crazy about the scents.   I love everything about Mickey Lee's soap and milks so have high hopes for their splashes.
wicked_edge,3cxw21,kcbeemo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"Scent stuck around for me all day with the Grand Havana. Menthol was good, I prefer a bit more but I'm weird. I have a little bit of burning sensation from them but nothing that would keep me from using it."

wicked_edge,3cuwn4,jb270,4,Sat Jul 11 00:11:29 2015 UTC,"I was hoping that that was a sperm whale tooth. It's a shame that most people see the size of Moby Dick and write it off as long and boring, completely missing out on the incredible wit, humor, satire, and beautiful prose that fill the book. Its easily within my top ten favorite books of all time. If you gave the brush a whaling inspired name(The Pitchpole? The Try-Works? How about the Scrimshaw?) and paired it with an Ambergris scented shaving soap, my money would disappear faster than you can say ""Thar she blows!"" I'd love an update if you decide to sell it."
wicked_edge,3cuwn4,jb270,3,Sat Jul 11 00:20:57 2015 UTC,"Always good to talk to another fan of The Whale. I have a couple ideas for this brush and the presentation, but one thing is for sure.. it needs a stand and it needs to come in a box of some sort.I havent got that far yet since I'm really busy with the redesign of all my product packaging etc.. In a few weeks I'll have some time but I may pour a couple of these with the 3 knots I have If I can get them the way I want them. a little further up this post you can see the imgur album of some pics of it when I used it for a christmas ornament for a friend who is also a fan of Moby Dick."
wicked_edge,3cuwn4,jb270,2,Sat Jul 11 00:31:00 2015 UTC,"I saw that, and it looks awesome. For a box, you should put it in QueeQueg's coffin! The stand could be shaped like a whale(obviously), a ship, a harpoon, a whale's jaw, or even Ahab's leg. You could nail a fake gold coin to the stand. Now I'm just rambling, hell use a copy of the book as a stand and it'll still be awesome. The more I think about how awesome this could be, the more I want it. I can't wait to see how the faux ivory ones look with a knot attached, especially with a false patina and/or some scrimshaw designs on it."

I think that's like the biggest badger brush ever."
wicked_edge,3cuwn4,amindbullet,2,Sat Jul 11 00:41:01 2015 UTC,"That's huge! I was so distracted by the sheer awesomeness of the handle that I completely missed the size of the knot.

wicked_edge,3cxs41,dcstand72,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:43:01 2015 UTC,I've not tried Wisdom but I recently purchased SC Passion soap and matching balm. I've always been a splash kind if guy but that balm is making me rethink my position. Absorbs quickly and no greasy feeling that I typically associate with balms.  I'm considering picking up another in a more summery scent.
wicked_edge,3cxgct,I_want_the_memes,3,Sat Jul 11 17:19:28 2015 UTC,"Simpson, Rooney, Thater, Shavemac, Morris and Forndran, Dark Holler, etc are all in the higher end. (Nevermind, saw your budget) But I have my $20 Frank's finest that hasn't shed a hair either. There's really no guarantee that you won't get a shedder, but I've owned lots of brushes none of which shed after initial break in. My suggestion would be to decide what features you like in a brush and then find one that fits. I like lots of backbone and soft tips, so my badger brushes include: M&F Blonde, Thater, WD HMW, TGN Finest, etc.     For your price range though, unless you want to chance a Frank Shaving brush or restore a vintage one with a new knot, you'd be better served with a decent boar or a synthetic."
wicked_edge,3cxgct,drivenlegend,3,Sat Jul 11 17:41:39 2015 UTC,"In your price range, you're not going to get a top-quality badger brush. A Whipped Dog  silvertip or a Frank Shaving Finest are decent but IMO not that great. If you're not going to spend $50 ($100 would be better), your best bet is to get a brush made with something other than badger hair.  I like a good synthetic brush a lot better than a mediocre badger brush, and the Fine ""Angel Hair"" synthetic is only $20. You can get an Omega ""Italian Flag"" boar brush for $22, and the quality is exceptional. Ditto with the Semogue Owners Club boar, which is a couple of bucks more. A Vie-Long 13061B horsehair brush is about $30, and is another good choice. (The 12750b is also solid, and the 12705b uses the same knot in a cheap plastic handle - performance is identical, but it doesn't look or feel as nice as the others.)  If you really want to get a badger brush, consider picking up something on the used market. As far as new stuff, something like a Savile Row 3120 gives you very high quality at a price that's (barely) under a hundred bucks."
wicked_edge,3cxgct,arbarnes,2,Sat Jul 11 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"For reasons that have never been clear to me, many (most?) newer wet shavers default to badger brushes, which -- at least at the entry/budget level -- is almost universally a mistake.  Unless you have a philosophical objection to boar, I'd parrot what others have said and recommend that you look at a decent boar or synthetic.    My personal recommendation would be a Semogue 620 (or, if you'd like to save a few $) or 1520.  Vintage Scent is a good vendor of Semogues, although many vendors stock them.  Once broken in, either of those Semogues would be many orders of magnitude more enjoyable than a comparably-priced badger."

wicked_edge,3cxgct,__stringbag__,5,Sat Jul 11 17:38:10 2015 UTC,$30-$40 is still comfortably in the range of terrible badger brushes. I'd recommend a Fine or a Plisson Synthetic or a Semogue boar.

wicked_edge,3cuufj,jb270,3,Fri Jul 10 23:28:34 2015 UTC,"This is my standard shave - good proraso cream, Gillette 7oclock, Nivea aftershave, alum block. Then I rush through the shave. Every time, and it comes out nice and smooth. Another pass would give me a marginally closer shave, but more nicks and bumps."
wicked_edge,3cuufj,TJnova,2,Sat Jul 11 00:58:43 2015 UTC,I plan on shaving with this method for the next week or so. I may just wind up sticking with it. I might also add a second pass ATG since I think the first pass reduced stubble enough that an XTG pass isn't needed. Its fun to begin to experiment with my technique now that I'm experienced enough to do so.
wicked_edge,3cuufj,H0kusai,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:19:40 2015 UTC,"Hydrating your face with warm water may soften the stubble more and thus reduce cutting resistance. If that translates into a better shave would be a matter of individual experimentation, of course, but I guess it would still be a method in keeping with what was available and usual in the forties.  When I'm in a hurry, I do a very quick one pass XTG shave which for me results in a very nice, socially acceptable DFS. (I am my own boss and don't ""have to shave"", but it is a ingrained attitude of mine, both professional and personal, to maintain a certain minimum standard of grooming, so I shave daily. One may call that vanity, too.)  However, even after a full morning BBS with ATG, I will have to shave before the odd formal evening event. Not to get rid of a shadow (I have thick, dark stubble visible through my light skin even after a BBS), but to avoid unpleasant friction between skin and collar."
wicked_edge,3cuufj,tinycoldhands,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:00:39 2015 UTC,"I find that I can achieve a good shave with both warm and cold water. I believe that cold water stiffens the hair, which actually makes it easier to cut since it is less prone to slipping. The cold water was also a contributing factor to the speed of the shave. No need to shower beforehand or go through any special pre-shave treatment."

wicked_edge,3cvw6v,notcuttingmyself,2,Sat Jul 11 05:27:18 2015 UTC,"Glad it worked out. I know everybody loves ragging on cartridge razors but it sounds like you were doing something wrong if you were getting blood and razor burn for over 20 years. One thing DE does it force you to learn the proper technique. I used to get cuts and razor burn with cartridge razors as well when I first started shaving, but eventually I learned how to do it properly, and I don't get cuts anymore and get a pretty good shave with a cartridge."
wicked_edge,3cvw6v,cwaniaczek,2,Sat Jul 11 18:04:37 2015 UTC,"I actually always got a good result with a cartridge razor and canned foam, but the shave was terrible in terms of enjoyment: it was always a boring, hateful, tedious chore so long as I was using the cartridge razor.

wicked_edge,3cvm5d,simplejack66,4,Sat Jul 11 03:41:53 2015 UTC,"I face-lather, and here's what I do.  I keep a puck grated and pressed in an old bowl.  I grated the puck not to ease lathering, but to fit it into that bowl for storage.  It is not a shaving mug or a scuttle; it is just some bowl I bought at the nearby Goodwill for the princely sum of $0.99.  About 10 minutes prior to shaving, I fill the bowl with some warm water (enough to cover the surface of the soap), and let the soap soak.  When I am ready to shave, I drain the water off.  I get my shaving brush nice and wet, and shake off most of the water from it.  I get it to where it is moist, and not dripping any more water.  Then, I start gently swirling the brush on the soap surface.  I do not want to build lather just yet; I am interested in loading the brush with soap at this point.  Thus the gentle swirling.  I swirl the brush about 35 or 40 times.  It depends on the size of your brush: I use the behemoth that is the Omega 10049.  If your brush is smaller, fewer swirls should do.  You need to experiment with this part.  With Williams, more soap has to be loaded into the brush than your typical artisan soap.  Then, I take the brush to my face and start lathering.  I lather with normal / medium vigor.  I don't generally need to add more water to the brush.  In case your brush was too dry and you loaded too much soap, add a few (say 5 or 6) drops of water at a time as you build lather.  I get plenty of useful lather from the above steps, more than enough for three full passes.  EDIT: grammar, remove out-of-place word"

wicked_edge,3cvm5d,pudgycaveman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:53:49 2015 UTC,"Good call on snagging those pucks!  That soap does not get enough credit hereabouts.  Yep, grating and pressing is the safest way to go about making Williams (or any tallow-based hard puck) fit into your container of choice.  Some soaps (e.g. Van der Hagen Deluxe and Glycerin) are very amenable to melting and pouring.  You can melt them in your microwave or in a double boiler very easily, and pour them into your favorite container, and in an hour or so, they will fully set and solidify.  Tallow-based soaps, however, tend to get destroyed if you try to melt them.  If you don't want the hassle of grating, you could get a Marvy mug or an Old Spice mug from eBay."
wicked_edge,3cvm5d,maaneeack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:49:09 2015 UTC,"Just restating /u/pudgycaveman. Soak the puck, soak the brush, shake the brush out, pour the soaking water from puck to brush, shake slightly and start loading. Williams is thirsty and needs the soaking to be useful. 15-20 minutes. It won't turn to mush, just soften up."

wicked_edge,3cuwin,fsedegree,7,Fri Jul 10 23:46:21 2015 UTC,"Which razor do you have? Have you done any blade experimentation? What is your prep like? There are so many variables in shaving that many different factors could be at play here. How close is super close to you? It takes some time to achieve perfect BBS every time. A few things to try are   Shave in silence. No fan, no music, no running water. Listen to the sound of the hairs being cut. You could have the razor at an ineffective angle during one or all of your passes Stretch the skin. DE razors work best on flat surfaces, and your problem areas are not typically very flat. Grabbing the skin above my jawline and pulling it up brings the hairs that are under my jaw up and onto the bottom of my cheeks. This makes them far easier to cut. Experiment with moving your head around and stretching the skin in different ways. I also sometimes ""turtle"" my head, pulling my chin back and into my neck which helps me reach some of the hairs that are on my neck. Remember that you don't need to stare straight into the mirror and stand perfectly still like the male model on a Gillette Fusion commercial. Don't be afraid to move your face around a little.   Bonus tip! Rubbing your fingers on an alum block can help them grip, even on wet, soapy skin. Useful for stretching the skin."
wicked_edge,3cuwin,jb270,3,Sat Jul 11 00:04:51 2015 UTC,"Been using the Parker 26 open comb. I have tried different blades and it seems that Astra is my preferred(more comfortable). I usually just shave right after showering and make sure my lather is as slick as possible (I think my lathers are pretty good). I want to be able to have the shave close enough so that when I touch I feel no hairs (I have managed that only on my cheeks).     I noticed that I can hear the hairs being cut off, but what's weird is that I keep hearing them even after a few passes (maybe its my angle), I feel scared to change the angle much because I have cut myself like that already. I have not tried stretching my skin, I will try some of your tips thank you so much. I don't have the alum block, I'll have to see about getting one, I tried Walmart but they don't have any (I did not see any and the people there did not know what I was talking about). I rather not spend so much on one if it's not that necessary. Should I get one? How useful is an alum block?"
wicked_edge,3cuwin,jb270,5,Sat Jul 11 00:22:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of people like alum for after their shave. It is useful in sealing up small nicks, and is a mild astringent. When you rub it across your face, it stings when you pass over an irritated area so that you know where your technique needs improvement. Walmart definitely wouldn't carry it, but your local health food store might. It's sometimes marketed as an all natural deodorant stick. If you can't find it locally, they are usually a few bucks online in most places. Maggard Razors has them, and also have flawed blocks at a considerable discount. Consider adding one next time you order some soap or something."
wicked_edge,3cuwin,aaronmil,3,Sat Jul 11 00:29:16 2015 UTC,"I have the 26C as well, and was also anxious for the learning curve to be over and for BBS shaves to start magically pouring out of my razor like butter. So much that I kind of pushed it with trying Gillette slides and J-hooks and blade buffing, all before I really had my grain sufficiently mapped or blade angle shallow enough or best blade discovered, resulting in a lot of irritation that needed time to heal. Ironically, it was right after I gave up the goal of smooth ATG on my neck that suddenly buttery irritation-free enjoyable shaves started happening consistently. And now that I know the angles of my face better, doing things like slanting the blade for oblique passes and a well-placed J-hook here and there actually do help rather than hurt.  TL;DR: Relax, be patient, enjoy, focus on less irritation and BBS will happen by accident."
wicked_edge,3cuwin,jb270,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:30:51 2015 UTC,Will do. I actually do get alot of good enjoyable shaves. but its when I go for the BBS that I get bad shaves.

wicked_edge,3cuafe,Nusquam-Humanitus,2,Sun Jul 12 04:23:07 2015 UTC,Nope! You are doing nothing wrong. There are many types of badgers with different knot dimensions (set in the handle). It seems you just used 1 badger that was not to your liking. Look at Simpson's Chubby series and the knot width (set in the handles). These will not feel like a damp rag. Hair density also plays a part in this. There are many variables at play. I wouldn't judge all badgers on the one you used.
wicked_edge,3cuafe,pudgycaveman,2,Fri Jul 10 21:00:02 2015 UTC,"I don't have a badger brush.  I have never used one.  At least I think I have never used one.  A very long time ago (much before I knew of reddit and shaving forums), I bought a VdH brush from yonder Rite-Aid.  I don't recall if it was badger or boar, and I don't remember how it felt.  Not too long after purchasing it, the knot came off from the handle like those brushes are wont to do, and I threw it away without a second thought.  I have an Omega 10049 in rotation right now.  I think it is nicely broken in, and I find it to be delightful.  Omega 13564, 10049, S10065 and Vie-Long 12705 are the brushes I have used so far, and I like them all.  I prefer the 10049 more than the others.  Now, I am wondering if I am really missing out by not having used a badger-hair brush.  I am not particularly drawn to them -- it seems like the good quality ones are rather expensive (honestly, I don't even know which ones are of superior quality).  I am not sure if I should bother getting one or not, given the brushes I have used so far.  EDIT: added more info"
wicked_edge,3cuafe,Nusquam-Humanitus,2,Fri Jul 10 22:46:41 2015 UTC,"I also have a few boars, a couple of horses and they are equally very sweet. I would say you are missing out on a different kind of brush, with respect to hair type, performance and in silvertiped brushes: softness (in some cases). As you noted: the prices for the ""higher quality"" badgers, far exceed all other brush types."

I started with a couple of badger hair brushes and never liked them. They're just too soft. And to get a great one you have to dig deep into the pocket compared to a boar. I love how boar bar brushes are stiffer. Gives me a feeling that the lather is getting worked in much better than when using badger. Especially if you face lather which is my preference. Plus, they're so cheap! I have both a Semogue and and an Omega that I love and they're both under $15 :)"

Even though I've been giving a lot of it away, I'm still trying to find ways to just use it faster.   That said, lather hogs also tend to produce super-creamy lathers because they require so much soap to work correctly.

I somewhat recently purchase an FS Finest Badger at 26/50. I understand FS reviews vary quite considerably, but this brush is very nice. I have only used it a couple of times to date, but it has lost zero hairs and feels pretty damn solid. This brush is considered much less dense than it's Simpson's counterparts, but it's also a lather hog. I have no regrets purchasing this brush.

wicked_edge,3cuafe,drivenlegend,2,Sat Jul 11 09:23:30 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you, I'm not a fan of the floppy silvertips either. There are ones out there with more backbone you just have to keep an eye out for them. Some of the ""Super"" Silvertips are nice, as well as the Silvertip Grade A from TGN. I personally lean towards the Finest grade from TGN and similar. Very soft tips, but lots of backbone as well. High mountain white often exhibits similar qualities."
wicked_edge,3cuafe,arbarnes,2,Fri Jul 10 21:39:16 2015 UTC,"There is no hype about ""silvertipped badger brush."" Or at least not among those who know what they're talking about.  First of all, badger hair grades are not standardized. So the word doesn't really mean anything. A manufacturer can call any brush a ""silvertip"" if it wants to.  Second, even if hair grades were standardized, they'd only tell you one thing - the grade of the hair. Which is only one factor in the performance of a brush - hair density, knot diameter, and loft height all play a role too.  Cheap silvertips tend to be made with hair that's a little scritchy, so the loft tends to be tall to compensate. Couple this with the fact that dense brushes are more difficult to make and use more hair, and it's no surprise that cheap silvertip knots tend to be pretty sparse.   A knot that is lacking in density and set at a tall loft is definitely going to feel like slapping your face with a damp rag. So I'm guessing that your observations are based on using an inexpensive brush. But you can't judge all silvertip brushes by the performance of a low-end one.  I've used a lot of brushes, and the silvertips I really like all retail for well over $100. Cheaper than that, and I'll take a brush made from boar bristle, horsehair, or synthetic fibers instead."
wicked_edge,3cuafe,arbarnes,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:15:04 2015 UTC,This is the brush I bought.
wicked_edge,3cuafe,arbarnes,2,Sun Jul 12 04:22:56 2015 UTC,"Parker silvertip brushes aren't bad, and they're a decent value. But IMO they aren't that great, either. If you want a really good badger brush, try something like a Savile Row 3824, which IMO is the best value going in that category.  But $100+ is a lot of money for a shave brush. And you can get a great one for a lot less than that. If all you've ever used are badger brushes, do yourself a favor and try something different.  For $20 you can get a synthetic brush that kicks serious butt like the Fine Angel Hair. A top-notch horsehair brush like the Vie-Long 13061b is under $30. Ditto with the best boar brushes on the market, such as the Omega 21762 or a Semogue Owners Club. (Boar brushes do require a little break-in period, but your patience will be amply rewarded.) IMO any of these options will blow away either of the badger brushes you've mentioned."

And even though that attempt is largely unsuccessful, it's something to aspire to.  But while my absolute favorite brushes are made with badger hair, there's no way that my boar, horse, and synthetic brushes are ever going to fall out of the rotation. And if you take cost into consideration, I actually like them better."
wicked_edge,3cuafe,pudgycaveman,2,Sun Jul 12 06:31:34 2015 UTC,"That's why we stress YMMV on this sub. Sounds like you prefer a scrubbier brush. Try an omega or semogue boar hair brush. They are pretty cheap, and $10-15 should get you a decent brush. Build some practice lathers to break it in.

You're right that they get a bad wrap here, and it is somewhat justified: it takes a modicum of patience to get your shaves right with a shavette.

I take about 20 minutes total.  With more practice, we should be able to get our times down further.  The focus so far was to get nick-free DFS-level shaves, and I think I am there now.  I don't go so far as to use a hot towel or warm lather.  In fact, today I shaved before showering and it was excellent (normally, my shaves are post-shower).

An additional note, and this cannot be stressed enough BE CAREFUL. The shimmed razor will handle differently and will require less pressure, blade exploration might be necessary(probably not as important as it would be in an entirely new razor though). I paradoxically find a sharper blade works better than a duller blade in a more aggressor razor, but YMMV. Go slow and take careful note of angle and pressure and you will be fine"

The problem with plastic razors is that they are so light they tend to ""skip"" over your stubble rather than cut it, so you need to use more pressure with them to get them to cut efficiently which can lead to more irritation.  If you are insistent though:   Weishi 2008 Dorco Plastic Double Edge razor Laser Ultra Treet ""Platinum"" Supermax Qwik Bestshave Plastic Safety razor"
wicked_edge,3ctefs,almightywhacko,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"The Dorco PL-602, Supermax Qwik and Treet are the same razor. I have 3 of the Dorco, and I travel with it just fine. It's not the same as my Tech, Standard, or RazoRock aluminum razors, but it's certainly good. Pair with a sharp blade, light touch, and it doesn't skip.   Or at least, that's my experience."
wicked_edge,3ctefs,nobodysawme,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:55:08 2015 UTC,"If you look closely, they aren't the same razor. They are similar but different. The Dorco (and the Treet) both have metal inserts in the handle that make them a bit heavier, so they don't skip as bad. However they aren't going to shave as smoothly as a solid stainless razor. I have used a dozen or so plastic razors of different brands and models and none of them gave as good a shave as a standard pot metal razor (like a Maggards or Razorock) and those don't shave anywhere near as well as the stainless razors I have owned and tried."
wicked_edge,3ctefs,almightywhacko,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:06:09 2015 UTC,"The Dorco has no metal in the handle. It still doesn't skip. It does shave as well as the Parker I have, but you have to use a very light touch. It's gentle, and works. I shaved with one for a week with no problems using Feather blades. It's very forgiving of bad technique, as long as you don't apply pressure, and I still got very smooth shaves.   Is it my go-to? No. I'd pick a vintage triangle slot Tech or aluminum Standard as my go to. But for the travel bag for a week, it was perfect.  One of the things I really do like about the Dorco PL-602 plastic is that they capture the blade with alignment rails on the base AND capture the end tabs of the blade in a recess at the underside ends of the top cap. It aligns perfectly every time. If you need it to be slightly more aggressive, loosen the handle 1/4 to 1/2 turn."

It looked like some kind of weapon on the X-ray screen(razor was a fat handled tech for reference). On the return flight I'll leave it assembled and put it in the plastic bag with my other toiletries. Will update with results of that experiment. On another note, while unpacking my bag I actually found a blade that had gotten stuck to the bottom of my soap container, that I didn't see while removing blades from my kit.

While it's certainly possible to make razors from expensive materials, that also makes the razor itself costly. Generally speaking, consumers like low prices, so the idea is to find materials and processes that allow good products to be sold at low prices, and the popular razors do that by using a zinc alloy (not some random collection of low-melting metals): not just Edwin Jagger but also Mühle, Merkur, and Parker.   Obviously, you can also get razors made of other materials, but the popularity of the makes mention show that they are indeed well-liked by many.   Hope that helps."

The handle was purchased as a bundle with other razors and vintage shaving items through an online auction from goodwill about two years ago. I forgot about the brush since all I really wanted was the Gillette Milord from the bundle but then I realized that the brush could be reknotted and made usable again so I cut and pretty much plied out the old knot (boar hair) and cleaned and sterilized the brush handle to get it clean and ready for a new knot. I removed a layer of rubber using a drill and made several straight down drills to give the epoxy some depth to catch so the knot is secure.   After all this I cleaned out the rubber dust and put in epoxy, a nickel to make a flat base, more epoxy, and then gently put in the knot so it would fit and not let the epoxy run over."

Edwin Jagger and Mühle also used the same head, but did their own plating. But about 5 years ago EJ and Mühle designed a new head and switched to that. It's pretty obvious that a design goal would be to get a better head, and in the opinion of many, they succeeded: see this post.  So I switched from recommend the 34C to recommending the EJ. (The heads are all the same; just pick out a handle you like.) But then about a year ago, I tried the Parker 24C, which at $29 is cheaper than the EJ (or the Merkur) and which is (to me) noticeably more comfortable and also more efficient than the EJ. So that's what I recommend.  Derby blades may or may not be good for you. (EJ razors come with one pack of Derby blades, as I recall.) Read this post and get a blade sampler pack.  I recommend the Omega S-series brush in the regular size, but not the pro size. I also have found the Fine synthetic to be an exceptionally good brush, but at $20 it costs more than the S-series.

wicked_edge,3cq0i1,repete66219,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:46:36 2015 UTC,Why?
wicked_edge,3cq0i1,Ensphinxed,0,Fri Jul 10 13:26:54 2015 UTC,"I prefer synthetic brushes to natural hair shaving brushes; purely subjective.  Albeit one can easily make the argument that, for no other reason, it is inhumane to harm animals for the sake of the production of non-essential items, such as shaving or make-up brushes."
wicked_edge,3cq0i1,repete66219,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:14:28 2015 UTC,"So you prefer the performance of synthetic.  As to your second point, those who subsist on the badger meat might argue their food is more essential than the production of yet more plastic.  I do know ChiefBroom has mentioned an interest in making a synthetic brush, so that may be available in the future, perhaps for the next TSN LE."
wicked_edge,3cq0i1,Ensphinxed,0,Sat Jul 11 14:06:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, I prefer the performance of boar brushes.  I did not come here to make an ethical argument on natural hair versus synthetic bristle brushes; if you are looking to edify yourself on the subject there are many resources online that can offer you instruction.  Synthetics have come a long way and their performance is attracting many wet shavers these days.  Let us just say that the makers of the TSN 2015 LE Palladin Brush should have at least proffered an option for a synthetic version.    These days many wet shavers are turned off by animal hair brushes, as they are quickly discovering that synthetics are easier to clean, repel bacteria and dirt better than animal hair, and shed less (if at all).  Many people have allergies to animal hair.  The main turn off for me is that animal hair, being porous, can absorb bacteria; despite cleaning, the bacteria can and does remain in the bristles of animal hair brushes.  I own my fair share of hair brushes collected over the years, but I have stopped buying hair brushes and will only purchase synthetics henceforth.  Too bad the Palladin comes in natural hair only."

If you had said ""I would have preferred if they had made a synthetic knot"" there'd be nothing to say, but saying they should have used a synthetic knot implies right & wrong and comes across as moralizing.

wicked_edge,3cr3g3,Sculler4life,4,Fri Jul 10 02:31:07 2015 UTC,"The exfoliating effects of the brush definitely made a difference for my skin. I rarely need to use face wash products, save for the occasional use on my forehead. Granted my acne was light-moderate and never really bad, wet shaving seems to have improved it. The only way to know if oils make a difference is to use them for a week, not use them for a week, then decide which was better. I also apply witch hazel to my face after my shave then follow up with an aftershave splash."
wicked_edge,3cr3g3,jb270,7,Fri Jul 10 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"Try skipping the pre-shave oil a week, then use it a week, and then skip it another week. It may be that it actually doesn't produce a noticeable improvement in the shave. For a shaving soap, consider Mystic Water Sensitive Skin (scroll down at the link -- you can see a complete list of ingredients in this post).  For acne, I recommend:  a. Check the ingredients in your shaving products and know which to avoid---menthol, for example, is not a good idea. Until your acne's in remission, favor unscented shaving creams and soaps.  b. Use a high-glycerin soap such as Whole Foods 365 glycerin soap with vitamin E (that's one of several glycerin soaps they offer), $2/bar, as a pre-shave beard wash. Wash beard at the sink using your hands, then rinse partially with a splash and apply lather.  c. Rinse razor head in high-proof rubbing alcohol before and after each shave.  d. After the final rinse ending the shave, glide a dry alum block over your wet skin, then set block aside and clean up around the sink, put stuff away, etc., with the alum on your face. After a minute or two, rinse the alum off, dry, and do your usual aftershave. This step is particularly helpful: alum is a mild antiseptic. You may need to wet the block in colder climes during the winter, when indoor relatively humidity plummets.  e. Use a fresh towel for every shave. You can buy thin, 100% cotton, lint-free towels called ""barber towels"" or ""bar towels"" for under $20/dozen. They're easy to launder and a fresh one for each shave helps a lot. Here's an example. You can also use surgical towels, like these. Also, these towels from Ikea are said to be good. A wet towel is a microbe incubator.   f. Shave daily. Use very light pressure Think of your skin as being badly sunburned and the razor is an uncomfortably hot bar, but the razor still must touch the skin---but barely. That kind of light pressure. Daily shaving probably helps by being exfoliating and by the daily alum block and good aftershave---try one of the Thayers witch hazels with aloe vera or one of the witch-hazel-based aftershaves by ProspectorCo.com or StirlingSoap.com. Since the shave itself is exfoliating, I suggest restricting exfoliating scrubs to the forehead and nose and not use them where you shave---this is to minimize skin damage.  g. Buy a bunch of pillowcases from a hotel supply house and use a fresh pillowcase every night.   h. If you have choices on how you eat, try observing this diet (but without the dairy) for a month and see what happens. It works for some. Here's another description of the same diet. And here's the reason the diet is recommended."
wicked_edge,3cr3g3,Leisureguy,2,Fri Jul 10 03:39:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your recommendations. I have just ordered a dozen towels. Do you think just a rinse with water is sufficient to wash all the shaving products off of my face? Also i suppose putting on the soap/lather will take off most the oil off so I should not need to worry too much about that, especially since the oils are all supposedly non-comodegenic. Lastly before I moisturize I use a toner and apply tea tree oil as a spot treatment."
wicked_edge,3cr3g3,Leisureguy,2,Fri Jul 10 05:15:31 2015 UTC,"Unless your tap water is hard, a water rinse will remove soap easily. You can test water hardness if you are unsure by doing a distilled water shave: if the lather's noticeably better with the demineralized water, your water's hard.   One remedy: run the sink half-full of hot water (or cold water, if you like a cold-water shave). Dissolve a pinch or two of citric acid in it---not much. Use that water for the pre-shave beard wash, the lather, and rinsing the razor and splashing water on your face at the end of each pass.   Do the final rinse with tap water. Use the lather from a distilled-water shave to define the baseline quality of lather you are going for.   You can get a small container of citric acid on-line and in some stores. You want pure citric acid, not citric acid mixed with anything else. It can often be found in healthfood stores (used as a salt substitute and also to prevent mold when growing sprouts) and where canning or brewing supplies are sold.  Read this post and this post to see the difference it made in two instances.  Shaving is very much a YMMV activity, and some, after experimenting with softening the water with citric acid, find that they are happy just using the unsoftened water, while others prefer using softened water. To determine your own preference, use citric acid a week, skip it a week, then use it another week (a ""week"" being on the order of 7 shaves), and then decide based on your own experience. Preferences are something one discovers.  And preferences vary from person to person: don't assume that another's preferences will match your own. They may, or they may not. Best to experiment and get some experience with both approaches. Then decide.   When you start, do try to avoid the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make when switching to a DE razor."
wicked_edge,3cr3g3,Leisureguy,2,Fri Jul 10 14:14:16 2015 UTC,The alum seems to be kind of drying. Should I try keeping it on only about 30 seconds? It does seem rather effective though.
wicked_edge,3cr3g3,lurker83,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:33:10 2015 UTC,It's always good to experiment---try 30 seconds and see whether it's still effective. Or go for a minute and use a moisturizing balm after you rinse it off and dry your face.
wicked_edge,3cqonm,kabuki_man,3,Fri Jul 10 00:23:54 2015 UTC,"Maggards are fine. I like the mr5 and mr8 handles, but it's personal taste. In the past when I've given out a starter kit to a friend, I also put in a Gillette Tech, but you have to be open to using a vintage razor for that to be ok.  If you like your brush, use it. If you want a synthetic, go for it. Alum and styptic aren't exactly the same. I use a pinaud styptic purchased at walmart for the job, although you can get My Nik Is Sealed, or others.  The Argo is again a preference. People try all kinds. Experiment.  You're going to want to get a blade sampler. Blades are not created equally."
wicked_edge,3cqonm,nobodysawme,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:44:47 2015 UTC,So far I'm looking at this:  Maggard MR6 Fine Angel Hair Synthetic  Argo Soap Alum (not sure how this stacks up to styptic)  Any better ideas? I guess I could keep trying out my badger brush but I keep reading good things about synthetics.
wicked_edge,3cqonm,dag655321,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:32:11 2015 UTC,"My thoughts, take them for what they are worth.  The Fine Angel Hair brush is a steal at $20, even better at $18 in the kit.  The Omega brushes get great reviews and are under $10.  Personally I would still go with the Fine Angel Hair.  The Maggard razors are a great value and the handles are surprisingly nice for the price.  However, they are very mild, especially the v2.0 head.  I have not tried the Maggard Open Comb, so I can't comment on that.  The Parker razors always get excellent review and I believe are a little more aggressive (though still on the mild side) than the Maggard razors.  Given your ""thick"" facial hair it might be worth the extra money to get one of the Parker Open Comb models.  I can't comment on the Arko soap, but it often get great reviews especially in terms of value.  Of the ones listed that I have tried, Proraso white is my favorite.  I also love the smell of the Limes and Bergamont.  Alum is nice to have, but you should consider a good aftershave as well.  I like the Proraso alcohol based ones.  They sting but only briefly.  I have also tried the Maggards Witch Hazel ones.  They sting a little less than alcohol, but the sting lasts much longer.  I guess its a matter of preference.  Don't forget a sample pack of blades...or pick some out from tryablade.com"
wicked_edge,3cqonm,jb270,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:54:42 2015 UTC,I might upgrade for the razor. I forgot to mention I have the ogallala bay rum sampler aftershave I'm working through now and I love some of those but I'm always down to try some new ones
wicked_edge,3cqonm,jb270,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:02:16 2015 UTC,"The Parker 24c seems to be highly recommended as a beginner razor, check it out. Arko soap(I'm assuming that's what you meant by Argo) is absolutely fantastic, easy slick lather. The fine angel hair is supposed to be great, in fact I just ordered one to upgrade my omega s-series. A styptic pencil is a spot treatment, applied only when you nick yourself. Alum can be used as an aftershave, and can be applied to your entire face. Alum can also reveal areas that your technique needs improvement. Another little known trick is that rubbing your fingers on the block allows them to grip, even on slippery wet skin. This can be useful in stretching the skin."
wicked_edge,3cqonm,aaronmil,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:01:42 2015 UTC,Is there any difference between the 24c and 26c? That black handle is rather sexy.
wicked_edge,3cqonm,arbarnes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:07:16 2015 UTC,Personal preference. Although apparently the black handle is prone to chipping. If that's a risk your willing to take go for it. You can always change out handles later as well. Many 3 piece razors are interchangeable.
wicked_edge,3cqonm,Stevenmcqueeven,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:16:35 2015 UTC,I got the black handle. It hasn't chipped. Not sure what it would be chipping on...don't bang it into things.

wicked_edge,3cqonm,Stevenmcqueeven,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"Get the Fine brush. It's better than 95% of the badger brushes on the market, and a fraction of the cost of the other 5%.  For soap, Arko is a great value. But the Maggard Razors artisan soaps blow it away. Unless you are on a strict budget I'd recommend them instead.  Alum is a post-shave treatment; a styptic pencil is just to stop bleeding. Can't hurt to try it; if you don't like it for toning your skin after a shave you can use it as an underarm deodorant."
wicked_edge,3cqonm,repete66219,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:55:02 2015 UTC,"I'd avoid the Arko and start out with either a couple samples or a puck of some artisan stuff. Maggard, Los Angeles Shaving Soap Company, Chiseled Face, Dapper Dragon, Mickey Lee, and Barrister and Mann are all amazing.  The alum is better for a beginner than styptic in my opinion so you can see what spots burn and work to figure out why they burn afterwards. (Just be sure to rinse it off after you apply)   Good luck and welcome!"
wicked_edge,3crcya,HasturTheUnshaveable,3,Fri Jul 10 03:53:57 2015 UTC,"Good choices all around.    Brush: I'd consider a Fine Synthetic or a Semogue boar from wherever you get the soap from. Brushes from Roctraitor should be good too. Play with the shipping options and see how it works out.  Soap: Soaps are so individualized I won't even give a suggestion, pick a scent you like or think you might like.  The Numbers: Haha! I forgot what it was like to start out and let this go unexplained. The numbers are fractions of an inch, it's measured from the spine of the razor to the cutting edge.    Wider razors tend to be heavier, which means they require less pressure, whereas smaller razors are easier to fit in tight spots (under the nose). 5/8 and 6/8 are the most common widths, and the cheapest for that reason. I like 6/8s more generally, but either width will work fine.    Stropping before first shave: The edge will be pre-stropped. You want to shave with it immediately so you can see how the edge feels.    This initial shave will give you some idea of how it should feel in case you damage the edge.   Rolling an edge is done by using too much pressure when stropping, which is common. You'll be able to feel it because it will tear up your face.    Strop Width: The three inch strop will allow you to strop the entire length of the blade at once, whereas a 2inch requires an X motion.  Oil: After you shave you dry the blade and oil it. Recommend buying a large and cheap bottle of mineral oil and putting a drop or two on the blade, spreading with a tissue or clean rag. It is easily wiped off before the next shave. You don't oil the razor's scales.   I think I got everything."
wicked_edge,3crcya,IllegalMonk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:25:07 2015 UTC,Noob here too. I looked on Wikipedia but I'm curious to know what effect the different points (round vs square vs French etc) and shapes (hollow vs wedge etc) have on your shave. How does the size of the blade factor in with those variables?
wicked_edge,3crcya,whoopingchow,2,Fri Jul 10 11:59:29 2015 UTC,"Point sytles are mostly aesthetic. There was an irascible former member here who stated ""the tip only matters during sex"". If you're careful, and you should be as a beginner, there is no difference on the shave. I have a preference for Round points, but hated them when first starting.  Grinds are a different story. Wedges are heavier and need less pressure, but they also make no noise while shaving. Hollows are preferred for beginners so they can see if they're cutting hair or not by the auditory feedback. Its like a chatter because the hollows are so thin. I only shave with hollows."
wicked_edge,3crcya,IllegalMonk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:16:12 2015 UTC,I've heard before that those with heavy beards should use a wedge rather than a hollow grind.  Is there any truth to that for those of us still contemplating jumping into straights?
wicked_edge,3crcya,95whtgst,2,Fri Jul 10 15:03:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. Wedges are heavier and will be more easily able to cut through particularly tough hair. I should also point out that grinds aren't simply hollow or wedges, there is a range of extra hollow to half hollow to quarter hollow to wedge with gradations in between.   Also factor in size. Anything 7/8+ will be quite heavy enough regardless of grind. Those sizes come at a premium though.   Ask around and look for a quarter hollow in 6/8+. Should be a good compromise for a tough beard, I think.   Honestly you can start on anything well-honed, it's a learning process and it's impossible to judge preferences without experience"

wicked_edge,3cpvps,Zerimas,2,Thu Jul 9 20:38:34 2015 UTC,"First off, don't run it over your thumbnail, that can be helpful in finding microchips before honing, but I wouldn't use the test on a finished razor.   Second, that Sigma Power Select II is an amazing stone.   Third, over-honing leads to micro chipping along the edge, which I think you recognize.   If you're getting irritation and weepers I'd check to see if the bevel is evenly set along the edge. Bevel setting is 60 percent of honing.   Razors can feel too harsh off certain stones, but harshness generally doesn't come with irritation I've found and feels distinct from dullness. I also don't think just the pastes would cause it. I have messed up an edge early on by using a balsa strop with a touch too much pressure, it doesn't have any 'give' and it's possible to roll an edge.   Does it tug at all or just give aggressive and irritating shaves?   Edit for clarity!"

wicked_edge,3cqwti,willbill6790,5,Fri Jul 10 01:33:53 2015 UTC,"Try not using anything for several days, and see if you still get razor burn or irritation. If you do, your technique may be to blame, not your moisturizing lotion. If the razor burn goes away, you can say for sure it is the moisturizer. Due to the YMMV nature of shaving, experimentation is required. Remove potential sources of irritation until you find the one that is truly at fault. If it is the moisturizer, or the moisturizer makes it worse, try an alcohol based splash. I paradoxically find it much better on my skin than moisturizers. Just make sure you don't over do it with a splash, as too much can dry out your face."
wicked_edge,3cqwti,jb270,3,Fri Jul 10 01:50:51 2015 UTC,You're probably getting the razor burn regardless and the lotion is making it worse. What have you used? Perhaps we can make some suggestions for things that might better suit your skin.

If yes, and if you do not shave against the grain on a day, do you still get razor burn on that day?  Just plain moisturizing cream should not cause razor burn.  I have heard of alum blocks and alcohol splashes exacerbating the razor burn that shaving has already caused."
wicked_edge,3cqwti,Nusquam-Humanitus,2,Fri Jul 10 01:49:10 2015 UTC,"Are you using regular moisturizers or specific AS balms? It's possible specific AS balms are formulated differently. I use AS balms, and if I have any degree of burn, it's there prior to applying a balm. The balm and my application (rubbing it in) exasperate the pain. Shortly after, the condition is greatly improved.  As previously stated: Your burn is most likely there, prior to the applying anything. Especially, if you've tried many different kinds. It difficult to imagine many different products causing burns/rash to one individual."

You don't really feel anything when you put it on but I've noticed it definitely helps razor burn go away quicker and makes my skin feel good and clean, not greasy. It will help soothe your skin and will definitely not cause any additional burn, unless you're allergic to it or something."

Some people report they can stretch a blade to up to 25 shaves, most like me have 10 shaves easily. Also, the blade doesn't flex as much as a DE blade and stays more controllable, which gets rid of a lot of the weepers from DE shaving. Stay tuned on my blog, I will post more detail soon!"
wicked_edge,3coz23,FalconRazors,0,Fri Jul 10 10:30:53 2015 UTC,"Some people report that they can stretch a DE blade up to 150 shaves, that doesn't mean that doing so will give you the best possible shave.   Also the flexing of a blade is controllable by the razor. A well designed and crafted razor will prevent the razor from moving at all. Check out the Wolfman Razors for an example of how a well crafted razor holds a double edge razor completely immobile in order to provide the best possible shave.  If you make your razor using hard to get, expensive niche blades, you are just going to reduce the number of people who want to buy your razor."

The thing is that AC blades are a lot thicker than DE blades, therefore if you use both in the same design the AC blade will flex less.  Well the blades aren't hard to get at all! Almost all stores carrying DE blades have the AC blades as well. Also, you could order them off eBay from Japan with free shipping worldwide.

As with all such things, YMMV.   But it's easy (and cheap) to find out whether pre-shave oils work for you. Most of them are common stuff (olive oil, grapeseed oil, coconut oil, castor oil, etc., or some combination thereof) with fragrance added. So go to the kitchen, put a few drops of olive oil in your palm, and massage it into your beard on the way back to the bathroom. No risk, next to no cost, and you'll have a useful piece of information."

I've used a couple  brands in the past (think one was from The Body Shop) but currently I'm using one my wife tacked on to her Honest Company order that has tea tree oil in it and I really dig it. It doesn't wash off your blade well so there's a little more manual cleanup after a shave though."

Given that you wouldn't benefit from additional lubricant if you're making a good lather, it seems like just another step for those who enjoy ritual.  That said, being one who doesn't mind the odd ritual, I've been thinking about giving pre-shave another try."

wicked_edge,3cpgdt,Titus142,3,Thu Jul 9 18:47:57 2015 UTC,"I do a 3-pass shave every morning (with rare exception) and usually get BBS over my entire face. If you're causing irritation that precludes you from shaving two days in a row, the problem isn't the frequency of your shaves but your technique. Irritation - any irritation - should be the exception rather than the rule.  Have you tried a wide variety of blades? What razor are you using? Which brush and soap? How's your lather? Problems with any of these things can cause irritation."
wicked_edge,3cpgdt,arbarnes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:15:32 2015 UTC,Good advice. I will have to experiment further. I get really good shaves so I tend to stick to that but I can see I need to refine it further. Got my eye on some nice razors. Just using the standard Merkur.
wicked_edge,3cpgdt,arbarnes,3,Thu Jul 9 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"The ""standard Merkur"" (in my case a 23c) tended to cause me irritation because it didn't shave close enough. So I'd use too much pressure to compensate and end up with razor burn.  A better razor might help, but be sure to vet it with the folks here (or on another forum with experienced shavers) rather than relying on customer reviews, which tend to be very uninformed. There is no correlation between price and performance, and it's way too easy to get ripped off or to buy something expensive that doesn't shave that great.  The first thing to do, though, is experiment with blades. The ""top 10"" sampler from tryablade.com is a good place to start. With the right blade, you might be surprised how much your shaves improve.   Also, one thing that worked for me with the 23c was to shim the head. It makes the razor more aggressive in both senses of the word - it shaves much more closely, but you need to treat it with respect, because a shimmed razor is more prone to give you nicks and irritation if your technique is bad. Try it, but use a very light touch."

People have already covered the major points; here a a few additional thoughts 1. Are you sure you know your grain direction and really take that into account during your shave? 2. Hydrate/soften beard before shaving?  It can reduce the cutting force required more than 50%. Prep and building/using a good lather are important. 3. No pressure? For anything beyond WTG, I often support the weight of the razor to ""float"" it across my face.  4. Shave angle nice and shallow? A steep angle will scrape off some skin; the shave will be good in terms of beard reduction but your face can feel really irritated for the next day.  5. No bad habits such as too many passes (suggests a need to get a more efficient razor/blade), touching up without lather, strokes that are too long to keep good technique for the entire stroke, using a blade that isn't sharp enough? 6. Using something to moisturize/soothe face after shaving?   Sounds like you've developed a work-around until your practice and experimentation get you to the point of being able to wet shave for consecutive days without irritation. Good luck."

But either way, whatever works for you is the way to go. Keep working on your technique and try shaving every day again in a while and see if it's any better. You may have the same experience I did.

Not much info on the maker but I'm guessing it was a hardware store in Pennsylvania that imported razor from Germany to be resold, which was pretty common for the smaller shops.  Probably early 1900s if I had to guess."

wicked_edge,3cpzqt,Glebanon,2,Fri Jul 10 20:28:20 2015 UTC,"For shaving I add a few drops to my bar soap and it makes it lather much thicker than it does otherwise.   For showering, it's great.  A few drops in the hand and it lathers an insane amount against your skin and thus goes a long way. Alternatively a few drops on a washcloth and it is enough for an entire shower.  I find that it makes a great shampoo as well for my somewhat oily hair, though if you don't rinse it well it flakes.  My hair feels oily with any bar soaps, but a few drops of liquid Bronner's makes my hair feel very clean and bouncy without over drying it.  All around great stuff.

Sharp Dressed Man is what I would choose to smell like 24/7 all the time forever.  It is a little powdery, nice and clean, little spicy.  Like a standard barbershop scent.  It is one of those smells that when you inhale, you just feel comforted.  Bergamot Lavender was refreshing as hell.  Pretty citrusy due to the Bergamot, with a light woody floral finish.  I really enjoyed it.  Second favorite.  Bay Rum was my least favorite.  I like a good herbal, rummy Bay Rum.  I felt this one was way too heavy on the Clove spice.  It was good but I just prefer less clove in my Bay Rum.  Even with the Bay Rum though, I would highly recommend all their stuff. Super affordable and top quality!"

Their scents are very unique and not always ""mainstream"" so if something sounds like you might not like it, you probably won't.

Hold the razor parallel (not touching) to your arm just above the skin. Now pass it above the skin only touching the hairs. Razor sharp will cut the hairs without touching the skin. Knife sharp requires scraping the skin.   Also, if you've been dragging your thumb along the edge like a farmer checking a sickle (or testing the edge by cutting paper), YOU might have ruined the edge. Very common newbie mistake.

Still haven't reached the baby ass smooth, but I am on my way.  I am different in that I don't shave at home - I shave at the gym, so everything has to fit in my dopp kit. Pictured above is the following, plus other toiletries.  Razor Merkur, unknown model I basically inherited my roommate'sDE shaving kit, and he never told me what it was or what models he chose. i know it's Merkur, and that's it. I like it a lot. I clean it in alcohol once a week.  Brush Again, no idea. I'm thinking to get a portable one since it takes a bit of space in the dopp kit.  Blade Astra platinum After using a tryablade.com pack, I found out Astra are the best for me. Feathers are too sharp, and Gillette are also good but not as good. I will probably try some of the Russian ones later.  Shaving cream Pacific Shaving Caffeinated Shaving cream I'll be honest, I prefer soaps (I fell in love with Fireside from B&M but it's seasonal) but I got this from Target when I realized I couldn't have an open soap in my dopp kit. I tried Arko's stick but it was too... I don't know, I didn't like the smell. This is what I am looking to change: either a better soap, a better cream or a better stick.  Bowl A small dish I picked up from Target for a dollar  After shave Pacific Shaving Caffeinated After Shave Since I have the cream... I'm also thinking of changing this one. I prefer creams since Colorado is dry and I need the humectation  Alum block OSMA I shall buy a plastic container for it at some point.   Face Soap Cremo Wash So I got Bespoke's Refresh (ergo the dopp kitt) and it came within. I'll probably change it. Again, I prefer liquid soap over solids (like Whole Foods glycerin soap) because it takes less space.   Not pictured a washcloth, I got ten for three dollars at Target so I use one everyday to prevent acne. I keep my discarded blades in a pill bottle, but it's filling up - I change it everyday since I can't keep the razor assembled. I made my case on the Altoid tins with some packing foam - I have no design abilities to do a 3D printed one.   So, what do you guys think? Any recommendations?  Cheers!"

Don't hesitate to finish your shave with a cartridge or DE if needed.  Similar advice with stropping: go slow and focus on your technique.  Keep the blade in contact with the leather with as little pressure as possible and flip the blade over the spine.  You don't want to strop before your first shave but after that you should strop before each shave, and many of us also strop a bit after our shaves.  Good luck and keep us posted!"

I assumed SRD would have had a note stating but they might have changed their stance on that.    It's not inherently bad that you did.  If you have any problems or suspect that the edge wasn't sharpened properly then we like to rule out your stropping as being the cause of any problems with the razor.

wicked_edge,3co8ca,mdd86,3,Thu Jul 9 13:11:13 2015 UTC,"In general, a straight razor will shave smoother and more forgiving than a shavette. This of course assumes that the straight razor is honed properly and if needed, stropped. Generally speaking, I felt that straights gave me worse shaves than shavettes util I realised that I had been using an angle that was way off the 30 degrees, 30 degrees is very very little and most people have more angle than that without even knowing it. I am not saying that you have done so, only that I did it and experienced tugging and irritation. Once I had the spine nearer the skin, things improved remarkably."

wicked_edge,3co8ca,IllegalMonk,2,Thu Jul 9 18:21:38 2015 UTC,"You should probably always get it professionally honed after buying them, whether from the factory or from Reddit.  There's no guarantee that they will be shave-ready when you get them for any number of reasons, probably the opposite.  Also, your technique with shavettes may not be ideal for a straight, so you might be causing yourself some irritation without realizing it."

wicked_edge,3co8ca,IllegalMonk,0,Thu Jul 9 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not encouraging anyone to waste any money.  I'm telling him that his SR might not be honed correctly.  Just because someone sold him a razor from shave bazaar does not mean that the blade was honed well, even if that person has previously sold well honed blades.

You should probably always get it professionally honed after buying them, whether from the factory or from Reddit. There's no guarantee that they will be shave-ready when you get them for any number of reasons, probably the opposite.    More than likely it will be shave-ready. If it isn't shaving well then it's either bad technique, ruined by stropping, whatever.   Also you should probably contact the seller first before sending it out.   Huge waste of money ...... Based on what you originally said lol."
wicked_edge,3co8ca,RocTraitor,0,Thu Jul 9 21:12:17 2015 UTC,"Everywhere in this sub-reddit it's stated that factory fresh razors usually are NOT shave ready even if they say they are, and if a razor is giving a bad shave, it is either the hone or the technique, BOTH of which I said COULD be causes.  A hone costs about 10 bucks, maybe 15 depending.  It's not a huge waste of money if it's the problem.  I don't know what you think you're trying to prove here, all i did was offer up multiple reasons for why it would not be shaving well.  I didn't say anything was for certain either way.  I said there's no guarantee, that doesn't mean ""hey dude for real 100% they aren't honed right."""
wicked_edge,3co8ca,RocTraitor,0,Thu Jul 9 22:01:10 2015 UTC,"Nah that's literally what you said in the first place - it probably won't be shave ready and you should get it honed again.   When you buy from reddit and vendors like Maggards or Straight Razor Designs they're hand honed, not a factory edge.  If you don't know what you're talking about then don't give advice. You don't need to get a shave-ready razor honed again out of a paranoia when it's likely technique that would be the issue. I don't want people to waste money because some moron thinks they're giving good advice (and then backtracking and saying it only applies in some cases)"
wicked_edge,3co8ca,RocTraitor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:32:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't backtrack at all.  Keep insulting me, that makes you look very mature.  Meanwhile, read what i wrote, and read what OP wrote. Maybe his technique is fine, and the hone is the problem, or maybe the hone is fine and his technique is the problem, either way what i said was NOT in ANY way incorrect OR bad advice.  I don't know why you think you're the Jesus of wet shaving, but you need to check your ego and your attitude."
wicked_edge,3co8ca,RocTraitor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"Tough call buddy.   I've gotten irritation from shaving with a shavette because they shaved TOO close..  One thing I need to mention though is that a shavette uses a blade that is MUCH thinner than a SR blade is, so by default it is somwhat sharper. One more thing you may want to try though is finding an extra hollow blade and giving that a shot, and/or going to the opposite end of the spectrum and getting a near wedge.   I don't remember which grind I sent to you, sorry, but chime in with that I'm curious.   What's your prep beforehand?"

I finally got one a couple of weeks ago and have been hard-pressed to put it down. It may be a really good razor for a beginner to DEs but coupled with my usual Polsilver SI it is dynamite for this not at all new to DEs shaver. I took five straight shaves with mine and every single one was near BBS with no irritation at all and I am shaving an old guy's nasty, white, complex patterns beard on a one or two day interval. It won't take much more to convince me that it should be my only razor (yikes!).  There is nothing not to like about that era/design Tech, nothing.

wicked_edge,3cmxpf,I_Like_a_Clean_Bowl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"There were '38-'41 and '46-'50. Anything produced between 41 and 45 was for the war effort only, not civilian sales.  The Canadian version is stamped 1932, but that's the patent date, not production date. Many people confuse these. Canadian Tech produced in the 1950s still have the 1932 patent date on them.  Triangle slot are pre-war, oval slot are post-war. It's hard to know what was for war production unless you have a box or some other indication it was sold to the military."
wicked_edge,3cmxpf,nobodysawme,2,Thu Jul 9 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"I have always seen the Triangle Tech described as Pre-War '38-'45 (which makes no sense;-) and the Slot as Post War and therefore assumed that they were producing the former for the military during the war and if that is so then '38-'45 is probably right. If not, then they were producing the slot for the military but since they are always referred to as post war that wouldn't make any sense either. So the question is if they were producing Techs for military issue, which they did, which one would they have produced? You are right, if someone has a Tech(s) that was in its original issue shave kit(s) then we would know for sure.  That would be valuable for ""shaving historians"" but for shavers it is enough to know its either a Triangle Tech or a Slot Tech;-)."

I certainly keep buying them on impulse :-)  Finding one for $5 is brilliant. I have paid around 15 (give or take) for them.   I have several of the USA Triangle slot USA, one of the Canada Triangle Tech, and 2x of the British Flat Bottom Tech, 1 1950s, a 1973 (my dad's, Argentinian production) and a birth year / quarter 1974 Tech (Made in England.)  I was putting together a kit to get a friend started recently. I included a Maggard MR5, a freshly nickel plated Triangle USA Tech on Bakelite handle, and a Dorco PL-602 (the plastic wilkinson), along with a small sampler of blades (Astra Platinum, GSB, Feather) and some Shave Secret Oil. Hopefully that's enough to get him started in the right direction.  I prefer the Canada Triangle slot to all of them. The USA slot is also quite good. The Made in England flat bottom Tech is much more aggressive.  The one I wanted, but missed out on, is the Hybrid Tech, where it's a baseplate similar to a NEW but solid bar instead of open comb. It was on eBay, and I bid the exact same amount as the winning bid, and eBay thought my bid was a microsecond later than the other bid. Oh well.

NB: I use mild and aggressive to describe how much the razor wants to tear huge swaths of epidermis from my face. Efficiency is how well it cuts hair. The English Flat Bottom Tech is more aggressive and only slightly more efficient. I'll stick with the Canadian Triangle Slot.

wicked_edge,3cn6ia,RegalPlatypus,6,Thu Jul 9 05:15:29 2015 UTC,"The first thing to try would be different blades. A double-helping of the ""Top-10 Sampler"" from tryablade.com would be a good place to start. You may also want to be more careful not to shave against the grain.   A more efficient razor may help, too. I found the 23c so inefficient that I tended to use too much pressure, which led to irritation. A cheap and easy way to experiment with this would be to shim your razor. But be careful - a shimmed razor will shave closer with less pressure, but it's also more prone to nick."
wicked_edge,3cn6ia,arbarnes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:35:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions!  I'll order a couple of the blade samplers that you suggested!
wicked_edge,3cn6ia,Leisureguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:02:13 2015 UTC,"So I ordered and received the sampler.  I started, purely on a whim, with the stainless Astra.  Holy shit did that make a huge difference!  On the 2nd day (short stubble) shave, I'd still only give it a 7/10 for comfort, but that's a lot better than the 4 I'd be inclined to give to the Feather blades I'd been using for ten years!  What, technically, is the difference between these two blades?  I hear that Feather blades are more ""aggressive?"""
wicked_edge,3cn6ia,Leisureguy,4,Wed Jul 15 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"Could have several causes.   First, make sure your prep is excellent. I assume you're using true lather rather than canned foam or gel. True lather contains a lot more water and that, together with the soap, makes for a better shave.  Second, read this post on blades and do some blade exploration. Feather blades prove to be quite irritating for some---depending on your beard and skin, it may be that Feathers are a poor choice, but you can tell by doing some exploration.  The Merkur Classic head is not the best, IMO. I often recommend the Parker 24C ($29, and very comfortable and very efficient), but you might try a Gillette Tech, and that razor might work with Feather blades. (Blades that don't work well in one razor may work very well in another.)  Make sure you're using light pressure. Use the same pressure you'd use if you had a sunburn and the razor were an uncomfortably warm metal rod: still touch the skin, but barely. Think of the razor just barely grazing the skin, though still touching. Professional barbers are tested by having them shave a lather-covered balloon, so you might try for that: just enough pressure on your face as would remove lather from a balloon (without popping the balloon, of course :).   Sometimes men who make just one or two passes unconsciously increase pressure to make sure they get all the stubble.  Hope this helps."
wicked_edge,3cn6ia,Leisureguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:06:20 2015 UTC,"I'll try arbarnes' suggested blade sampler pack and, if all fails there, then maybe I'll swap out for the Parker 24C.    I've played with the pressure.  When I use very light pressure, especially against or cross grain with my current setup, the blade seems to just catch on the hairs; the blade doesn't pass smoothly but stutters across my beard leaving me with several pinpricks of blood and the irritation I mentioned.  EDIT: When my beard is longer (3+ days) then I can make both passes without any discomfort.  It's only when I shave with initially short whiskers that the second pass becomes a problem."
wicked_edge,3cn6ia,Leisureguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"And I assume you're using true lather.   I haven't used that particular Merkur razor, but I have used the Merkur Classic head and it's not so smooth nor so efficient as some other razors."

wicked_edge,3cn6ia,arbarnes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:47:34 2015 UTC,That takes of that concern. And the razor should glide with light pressure and a good lather. Could it be that your water is hard?

wicked_edge,3cloew,IllegalMonk,2,Thu Jul 9 16:53:45 2015 UTC,As a former Derby user....spend a couple more bucks on some better blades.  It is worth it.
wicked_edge,3cloew,beefsupreme123,2,Thu Jul 9 03:01:08 2015 UTC,Very similar setup to mine! Derby blades and all ;) I like your stand more though. I would highly recommend checking out Fine aftershave (if you haven't heard of it already). fineaccoutrements.com
wicked_edge,3cloew,specialized_SS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the advice everyone, will definitely be picking up some more blades very soon."
wicked_edge,3cloew,repete66219,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:44:17 2015 UTC,"You're already on the hunt for new blades.  I really, really, really like Voskhod.  Also try Gillette Silver Blue, Astra SP and whatever else comes to mind.  The only blade I've tried that I just don't like is the Feather.  Unless your razor is (too) mild I just don't see the point. IMO you don't need a bowl/mug for shaving, but if you want to use one you're better off with something wider and shallower, like the Captain's Choice or Fine Accoutrements bowls. Brush?  I can't tell what that is, but once you upgrade consider a Fine (Plisson, Omega, etc.) synthetic."

They are cheaper than other badger brushes for a reason, and have a scratchy/prickly feel that can be uncomfortable. Get an omega S-series synthetic instead, or a fine accoutrements angel hair synthetic. At $10 and $20 respectively, they are great brushes for the price."

wicked_edge,3cnvhc,arbarnes,3,Thu Jul 9 13:39:10 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, shipping is free over $75, so if you're looking to spend $85 on Amazon, then its really a non-issue.  My thoughts though, if you went with the budget kit configured as: MR6, Fine Angel Hair Brush, Maggard Limes and Bergamot, Maggard Alum, and then added a blade sampler even taking into account shipping (if applicable) you'd still be as cheap or cheaper than what you've got up there from Amazon. Please for the love of god don't go buying that shit-ton of blades if you don't know which ones you like. Either pick up a sample pack from somewhere, or check out Tryablade and just pick a bunch to try out. If you do decide to go with the kit up there, you may want to hold off on the razor and brush stand as well, a lot of folks decide that they are unnecessary. If you decide later that you want one keep an eye on /r/shave_bazaar and just get one cheap from someone who doesn't want theirs.      Here's another options as well, though you still may want some extra blades to try:  IB EJ89 and Proraso Kit"

wicked_edge,3cnvhc,jb270,2,Thu Jul 9 14:15:54 2015 UTC,"Take a look at this starter kit. I picked each item as the best bang for the buck. I might now recommend the Fine synthetic brush ($20 from FineAccoutrements.com), which is somewhat better than the S-Series brush from Omega.   Read this post on blades, which might surprise you, and when you start, avoid the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make when switching to a DE razor.    Hope this helps. Welcome."
wicked_edge,3cnvhc,l0stinthought,2,Thu Jul 9 13:09:04 2015 UTC,"In answer to your question: yes, it will work. Just not very well.  The brush is garbage, the razor is mediocre and overpriced, and the stand is a complete waste of money. Do not believe the Amazon reviews - that's like relying on pre-contact indigenous people for car-buying advice.   There are lots of decent options out there, but my favorite is this kit. Get the MR1 (or any of the MR-series razors - the only difference is the handle - or maybe the Parker 24c), the Fine brush, and one of the Maggard soaps. Add a blade sampler, a blade bank, and if that doesn't hit the $75 threshold for free shipping, your aftershave of choice."

I want to get a DE for my brother, but I'm not sure what types of features to look for. As OP mentioned he was looking at a long handled razor. Do these tend to be more comfortable/easier to handle/noobie friendly?  What other features should one look for when looking for a DE?  Edit: Would this be a good one? It's described to have a ""open comb"" design. The FAQ could really use a section or page talking about different features of DE's or even straights.   Edit2: Here is the one I'll likely get him since it's cheaper."
wicked_edge,3cnvhc,l0stinthought,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:21:10 2015 UTC,"I started with a merkur. It was mild, perhaps overly so but overall a decent razor. The Parker 24c is $29 and well regarded as a beginner razor, I recommend you get that instead. Throw in a blade sampler with it, and perhaps a brush and some cream and I think you'll have a very happy brother. If you aren't getting him a full starter kit, go with a brush and soap instead of just a razor. The brush and soap make the most difference."
wicked_edge,3cnvhc,jb270,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:12:03 2015 UTC,Do mild razor not give you a close enough shave? He's only shaved with cartridge razors so I feel like the milder the better. Plus he doesn't have a thick beard or anything. I'm just urging him to switch to DE shaving to help him save money.  I've been shaving with a straight for 2 years now and love that I don't have to spend so much money on cartridges.
wicked_edge,3cnvhc,arbarnes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:44:09 2015 UTC,"Some people prefer mild razors, and you can still get a close shave. The merkur was the recommended beginner model a few years ago, but has now been surpassed by newer razors with better overall performance."

Until you have your technique down, you'll want to put the most effort and attention into perfecting tricky spots. You can kinda zone out on your cheeks, but if you get sloppy and cut your lip you'll never want to shave again.  For some reason my attention to detail slips when I'm ~50% of the way through my shave. The little demon in my head is saying ""You got this far without a cut, just slop your way through the rest!"" and that's when I get nicks.  I agree with him that you want the area hydrated, but if your prep is good enough I don't think a few seconds will matter. Use your starting enthusiasm to do your mustache right! Your cheeks won't care.   A personal bias: my nose always tickles from the lather and I like getting it off ASAP."

wicked_edge,3cmnkn,jacuzzi4,4,Thu Jul 9 02:24:30 2015 UTC,"I recommend against the badger brushes in that budget kit. While I love badger, ""pure"" grade hair tends to be pretty unpleasant to use.  Boar is a viable option. I really like the Omega 20102 - it's a large brush, but the bristles don't bloom much, so it doesn't feel as huge as its measurements might suggest. And while the other boars have plain plastic handles, its wood / resin / chrome handle is very attractive. The downside to boar is that it only begins to perform at its potential once it's broken in, which can take a while.  IMO your best choice would be synthetic. The Omega S-Brush gets a lot of love, but the Fine Angel Hair knot is simply amazing. It has great density and flow-through, and does a great job of picking up soap off a hard puck even though it's the softest brush you'll ever use.  Speaking of soap, be sure to get one of the the Maggard-branded artisan soaps. They outperform the other choices by a wide margin."

The Fine synthetic is twice as much, however, and I don't know how price-sensitive you are. The Fine is close to the Plisson synthetic, which is slightly larger than the Fine (22mm vs 20mm for the Fine) and costs almost twice as much. Here's a Plisson-Omega comparison."

wicked_edge,3ckri8,Leisureguy,2,Wed Jul 8 17:58:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I find the Standard much more comfortable than a NEW."
wicked_edge,3ckri8,chuckfalzone,3,Wed Jul 8 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"It was a long-toothed NEW with a heavy handle, if that makes any difference. I find the short-toothed NEW a little rougher than the long-toothed, as I recall, but I'll try those two tomorrow. Could be the blades: Astra Superior Platinum in Standard, Personna Lab Blue in NEW, and---important---age uncertain: the Astra may have been used more times than the Lab Blue.  This does suggest an excellent opportunity to test the difference a blade can make. Tomorrow, I'll do the same shave but with a fresh (new) Lab Blue in each razor, and compare that. If the razor performs much differently, it's at least a demonstration of the difference a blade can make.  Stay tuned. (And then I'll do short-toothed v. long-toothed comparison.)"
wicked_edge,3ckri8,chuckfalzone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:09:16 2015 UTC,It really is fascinating how differently different people experience the same razors. Unfortunately I traded away my NEW a few months back or I'd try the same side by side comparison. Look forward to reading your follow-ups.
wicked_edge,3ckri8,HMNbean,2,Thu Jul 9 04:11:30 2015 UTC,"Second test with a new Personna Lab Blue blade in each showed that, for me, the long-toothed new with that blade is noticeably more comfortable than the Standard with that blade. However, the Standard might do better with a different brand of blade. Perhaps it had an Astra Superior Platinum blade in it for a reason. More experimentation. :)"
wicked_edge,3ckri8,HMNbean,2,Thu Jul 9 15:21:59 2015 UTC,"Isn't this comparing apples and oranges?

(With any new razor it will be necessary to do some renewed blade exploration: a brand that's best in one razor may not be best (or even good) in another.) I tried a heavier handle on a whim and decided I liked it.

The newer Techs are also mild but have the thicker head. Hope this will give you some help.

wicked_edge,3cmomq,Familycamper,3,Thu Jul 9 02:33:38 2015 UTC,"You may want to have an experienced honemeister fix your blades, then go back to square 1 on your maintenance routine. I find it hard to believe that appropriate honing over three years would produce significant wear. There's just no reason for a daily user with a shave-ready razor to do any honing other than a quarterly or semi-annual touchup on a 12k stone.  If you do decide to go DE only, I recommend against the Futur. YMMV, but I find that it doesn't shave particularly well. And it has a number of significant design flaws. I'd take a Progress (or a vintage Gillette adjustable) over a Futur any day of the week, and a Standard razor over any of them.  Lately, though, I've been exclusively using machined stainless razors from ATT and Wolfman. Shave quality is outstanding, and build quality is second to none."
wicked_edge,3cmomq,arbarnes,2,Thu Jul 9 15:26:42 2015 UTC,"Blades could be fixed, and if you PM me some pics I'd be happy to help you through the process. New Dovos are great steel, good grind, wrapped in sloppy edge finishing that a honemeister needs to undo (and it takes a long while). We'd have to take a look at the vintage blade to make a plan.   No harm in doing some DE shaves while you get your straights in order :)"
wicked_edge,3cmomq,RockyMtnAristocrat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"First off, I think you are overthinking the maintenance on your blades. Have them honed professionally and then just strop them and then hit them on a pasted paddle strop when you feel they are getting dull. If you cant get them back in line, send em out again to be touched up. I mostly shave with straights, but I use a DE if I'm in a rush or dont feel like going through the proper steps to use the straight. No need to give up, or to pigeonhole yourself."
wicked_edge,3cmomq,theholyblack,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"My first thought when reading your post and the 4/8 combi stone from Norton popped out at me. You can do much better than that, somewhere in the 12k range and that will give you a significantly improved shave.   To be Frank (or John?) with you, I think you should send out a razor (or both) to someone to hone it properly so you can have a reference point.   You certainly can fix these blades without much issue as /u/RockyMtnAristocrat offered! Take him up on it :-)"

The Imperial mark from Germany was probably Adolf Kastor from 1886 to 1945 (source).  Second razor looks okay.

wicked_edge,3cjnj5,Leisureguy,2,Wed Jul 8 17:52:11 2015 UTC,"The differences are in feel and some differences in how they work. For example, synthetic brushes don't absorb water, so the water in the knot can readily flow out of the knot---this means that before loading the brush, you give the wet brush a couple of shakes to remove excess water that otherwise would gush down onto the soap as you're trying to load. Boar and horsehair brushes require wetting the knot well before use and letting it sit for a few minutes (e.g., while you shower). And, of course, the brushes are priced differently due to different availability of materials.  If you want to know which you yourself would like best, you'll simply have to try the various types to discover your own preferences. They all work well (if well made) and make lather efficiently and easily.   Among commercial soaps, D.R. Harris is top notch. There are also many good artisanal soaps, and MaggardRazors.com sells samplers, which is the best way to try them."

wicked_edge,3cjnj5,Leisureguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:09:06 2015 UTC,"Not bored. It's so soft, it almost puts me to sleep in a massaging kind of way. I only have one silvertip to date and it has almost zero backbone, exasperating the softness and my resulting drowsiness when lathering. It feels very nice, but has zero scrub, that I can detect.  I do like badgers, but as with most guys, specific ones, with specific qualities. This is why wide-knotted, short-lofted silvertips (Simpsons, Thater, etc) are so damn expensive and coveted."
wicked_edge,3cjnj5,arghblech,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:07:30 2015 UTC,"Also, you probably want to try different brands of soaps/creams. If you end up not liking DR Harris then you're kinda screwed.

wicked_edge,3ck6dp,nationalhonorroll,9,Wed Jul 8 15:29:15 2015 UTC,"You can read a fair amount in the sidebar. There is a learning curve, but it can be shortened somewhat by reading (on this forum, and I wrote a guide to DE shaving---check the reader reviews and decide from those whether you think it would be helpful.  Do read this post on blades, which are probably not quite what you expect. Most novices focus more on the razor, which is indeed more expensive, but blades are (obviously) a key element.  For a razor, I routinely recommend the Parker 24C, $29, as a good starting razor because it is very comfortable (not inclined to nick) and also very efficient. I recommend this starter kit, where I picked each item as the best bang for the buck, but now I would recommend the Fine synthetic shaving brush, $20, from FineAccoutrements.com. However, the regular size of the Omega S-Series brushes is also a good brush and costs less.  I talk about the brush because most find that they get much better results in using a true lather.  ""True lather"" is what I call a lather made with a shaving brush from shaving soap or shaving cream and water. The consensus is that, in terms of shave quality and enjoyment, it goes like this:  Worst: cartridge razor + canned foam Better: DE razor + canned foam Better yet: cartridge razor + true lather Best: DE razor + true lather  Here's how I make lather, and I recommend that you make a series of practice lathers using the technique to gain experience quickly. Play with brush speed, brush pressure (firm is good), and how long you continue loading once you see microscopic bubbles. But do try the exact procedure before trying modifications.   When you do begin, try to avoid the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make when switching to a DE razor.   Hope this helps. Welcome."
wicked_edge,3ck6dp,Leisureguy,8,Wed Jul 8 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"What are they?    Well, um, they are razors.    How do they work?

Leisureguy has an excellent book on the subject as well. There is a learning curve, but it is not that great. With some youtube videos your first shave is pretty certain to be good.

wicked_edge,3cj6vv,OutlawUnicorn,6,Wed Jul 8 09:28:05 2015 UTC,The soap will last a lot longer because it not very good and you'll start to use other soaps...
wicked_edge,3cj6vv,Greyzer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:16:48 2015 UTC,Can you explain why? I have gone through a sampler of TOBS and am currently using both the cream/soap of Jermyn St. and Sandalwood cream with great results. My lather is always slick and has good volume...
wicked_edge,3cj6vv,true_curly,5,Wed Jul 8 18:26:12 2015 UTC,Use the cheese grater. Don't chance ruining the soap by warming it up
wicked_edge,3cj6vv,K-Noisewater,2,Wed Jul 8 11:02:48 2015 UTC,The hard soap will definitely last longer but may be harder to get a good lather going at first compared to the cream. It doesn't really matter if it fits. You can do a couple different things to make it fit like warming the soap until it's softer and pressing into the container. You could also use a cheese grater and grate the soap into the container and press it down to form it.
wicked_edge,3cj6vv,Lord_stinko,2,Wed Jul 8 09:49:06 2015 UTC,Another vote for grating.
wicked_edge,3cj6vv,drivenlegend,2,Wed Jul 8 11:54:15 2015 UTC,Are you lathering your cream in the dish it came with?   With my first TOBS cream I did that and found it got used pretty quickly. Since removing a dollop and lathering in the old empty TOBS dish I find it is lasting a lot longer with a lot less wastage.
wicked_edge,3cj6vv,thundering,2,Wed Jul 8 14:33:00 2015 UTC,"You are using way too much cream.  For minimal growth, I use a dab about half the size of an almond, and add water a few drops at a time to get the right mix."
wicked_edge,3cj6vv,methshin,2,Wed Jul 8 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"Wow. If you are going through it that fast then you are making way too much lather at a time. The guys who post photos of mugs overflowing with lather are just showing off, don't take it as a guide.   I make just enough lather to load my brush, which is more than I need for four passes. Shaving three to four times per week, I bet I could make a tub of cream last the better part of a year."
wicked_edge,3cj6vv,peterlcole,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:30:53 2015 UTC,"The first question on the Q&A section of that product page says that the soap is 3 inches in diameter. I am pretty sure it will fit in your ToBS cream container but you could always measure it with a ruler to be sure.  Also, if you have used up 3/4ths of a container of ToBS in 3 months and you are only shaving your face you are using waaayyyyyy too much cream per shave. You only need an almond or dime-sized drop to make enough lather for three or four passes. A tub of ToBS should last at least 6 months of daily shaving if not longer."

Hand to God, I swear the thing sold for over $17,000.  I was beyond floored, I couldn't believe someone paid that much money for what was essentially a toy.  I think it was advertised as being twelve inches tall.  But then in the same auction I remember two pairs of Joseph Rodgers straight razors, one with gold-plated silver scales and the other with solid, carved MOP scales, which both sold for over $4,000.  I learned that day that I can't even play in the same league as the big-time collectors."

wicked_edge,3chpu0,Dark_Saint,5,Wed Jul 8 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"I got my first DE razor kit today from Maggard Razors. After lurking for a while and getting some help choosing my first kit from you guys, I finally received it.  -MR6 Razor  -Lime & Bergamot soap  -Alum Bar  -Derby & Astra blades  I'll admit I was super nervous shaving this morning but I took it slow and made sure to remember all the tips you guys have been giving. I finished my shave with no nicks or burns!!!  My face is so smooth, I just can't stop touching it. I'm definitely not going back to disposable razors.  The only issue I had was that there was a bit of hair buildup caught in between the razor blade. I made sure to rinse the razor after every stroke but I couldn't get rid of the build up. After I placed the blade on I screwed the handle pretty tight, could that be the reason? Also the blade had the numbers 1&2 on one side and 3&4 on the other, I didn't know which side was up, could I have put it in wrong?"
wicked_edge,3chpu0,NeedsMoreMenthol,5,Wed Jul 8 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"If you're having trouble rinsing the razor, that usually means your lather is too dry. It may look and feel OK, but adding a few drips of water to your brush as you're building lather will make it better and more importantly, slicker."
wicked_edge,3chpu0,Leisureguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:33:01 2015 UTC,"As noted, the numbers are irrelevant for the consumer. I do caution you on tightening the razor too tightly. The zinc alloy of which the head is made doesn't have a lot of tensile strength, and with overtightening the threaded stud will eventually break. Just tighten it firmly enough so that it doesn't loosen, not more."
wicked_edge,3chpu0,NewYorkCityGuy,-1,Wed Jul 8 02:17:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you don't need to scree that handle on so tight. Just snug, it won't come off.

I just usually flip the razor when I get to the second side of my face."
wicked_edge,3chpu0,NeedsMoreMenthol,4,Wed Jul 8 00:28:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but the numbers are not for the user to keep track of anything, although nothing stops you from using them for that.  They're quality control marks put on at the factory that aids in calibrating their machinery. When QC determines that a blade batch fails, they can track it down easier (i.e. machine for surface #3 needs adjustment or sharpening)"

wicked_edge,3cllma,CoolHandLance,2,Wed Jul 8 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"The VDH is supposed to be a very mild razor. Try using absolutely no pressure. A few techniques to reduce pressure are   Holding the end of the handle, as opposed to choking up on the razor head. Then simply rest it against your neck and let gravity do the work for you.  Imagine that the razor is a hot metal rod, and that you have a very bad sunburn. Use the amount of pressure that you would use in that scenario.    You should also do a detailed map of the grain of your neck. I used to have a lot of trouble with nicks on my Adam's apple and the rest of my neck. I discovered that my hair did not grow down in a north-south direction, but rather that it grew down from my chin, then just before my Adam's apple it abruptly changed to a south-north direction. I had been shaving against the grain the whole time.   Last but not least, have you sampled any other brands of blades, or are you still using the ones that came with your razor? For me a sharper blade(feathers) paradoxically results in fewer nicks, but of course YMMV."
wicked_edge,3cllma,jb270,2,Wed Jul 8 21:53:21 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem as OP. Firstly your advise to figure out exactly the pattern of the growth is very important. Mine is a bit weird, it goes sideways under my chin and lower on my neck it grows straight up. When I had got that figured out I still got some irritation which I managed to get rid off by properly stretching the skin with the other hand while shaving. If the skin is slippery you can put some alum on the fingers to get a good grip."
wicked_edge,3cllma,Jose_Jalapeno,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:12:44 2015 UTC,"Stretching skin definitely helps. Also try moving your chin forward, instead of up."
wicked_edge,3cllma,jb270,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:31:02 2015 UTC,To me it sounds you are using too much pressure on your neck. I can get away with a bit too much pressure on my face but not on my neck. Also be sure you make the first pass on your neck with the grain not against the grain.
wicked_edge,3clk50,BNHert,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah tried a distilled water for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It makes a huge difference, especially if you have hard water.

wicked_edge,3clk50,K-Noisewater,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:24:27 2015 UTC,"Distilled water is soft, so it leathers soap better. Maybe you have hard water in your tap?"
wicked_edge,3clk50,FermentedFupaFungus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"You should try dissolving a pinch of citric acid in a sink full of water, as that can help with hard water. A huge improvement in lather quality with distilled water could indicate hard water. Citric acid may also be cheaper/easier than buying distilled water."
wicked_edge,3clk50,jb270,0,Wed Jul 8 21:43:41 2015 UTC,"As /u/jb270 says: run the sink half-full of hot water (or cold water, if you like a cold-water shave). Dissolve a pinch or two of citric acid in it---not much. Use that water for the pre-shave beard wash, the lather, and rinsing the razor and splashing water on your face at the end of each pass.   Do the final rinse with tap water. Use the lather from a distilled-water shave to define the baseline quality of lather you are going for.   You can get a small container of citric acid on-line and in some stores. You want pure citric acid, not citric acid mixed with anything else. It can often be found in healthfood stores (used as a salt substitute and also to prevent mold when growing sprouts) and where canning or brewing supplies are sold.  Read this post and this post to see the difference it made in two instances.  Shaving is very much a YMMV activity, and some, after experimenting with softening the water with citric acid, find that they are happy just using the unsoftened water, while others prefer using softened water. To determine your own preference, use citric acid a week, skip it a week, then use it another week (a ""week"" being on the order of 7 shaves), and then decide based on your own experience. Preferences are something one discovers.  And preferences vary from person to person: don't assume that another's preferences will match your own. They may, or they may not. Best to experiment and get some experience with both approaches. Then decide."

If shaving straight down (one pass, I take it) and ignoring the direction of the grain works better for you than paying attention to the grain and shaving in multiple passes, going for progressive reduction of the stubble, that's fine. Of course, you won't know whether it's better until you try both ways, but then you can decide based on your own experience of which works better for you.  Indeed, there's a fair amount of variation in shaving patterns, and as you see, some (few) men do indeed do a single pass with the grain (generally that is down) as you do."

Its been a year so as of now everything but the mug has been replaced. i dont feel thats a bad reflection on vdh. They were my gateway into a new style that i ended up liking, and even the brush wasnt soooo bad that i felt ripped off or anything. Hell i didnt think the brush was bad until i bought a new omega synth like u just did. I think the vdh set does well for new guys who want to know what wet shaving is like. The soap is better than it gets credit for, its not hard to get a good lather. I have 2 nice mickeylee soaps but ive started saving them for more special days. The truth with soaps is that its all about what lathers the easiest and best at the lowest cost, for the everyday stuff, because the smells go way once you wash your face use alum and aftershave balms and lotions.  Over the next few months, as your budget allows, get a new handle. Use the vdh to get a good idea how to shave with little pressure, thats the main difference from a cartridge. The beauty of a cartridge is you can force it down on your face and neck with less chance of burn. A good two pass up and down with a de handle matches that as long as you avoid the burn by pressing down. The advantage is that when you get good you can make that extra atg bbs pass and look crisper than you ever did and hopefully with no burn. Try a parker in the 20-30 range.   Try to see if cold water / hot water shaving makes a difference for you. I did hot water always until a month ago and now i feel like cold shaving was the final ingredient in the main recipe for me, so make sure you dont wait as long as i did before conducting that experement. Nowadays i grab an ice cube and shock freeze my face and its awesome. I look so sharp at work and i get complements. My boss one day was asking me why i look so sharp, he couldnt even pinpoint exactly what it was, but yeah people will begin to notice it.  Good luck my man."
wicked_edge,3cg1xn,jb270,5,Thu Jul 9 03:03:10 2015 UTC,"The regular size s brushes come in several different handles, so choose any one that tickles your fancy."
wicked_edge,3cg1xn,macadam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:27:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is true. As I understand it all the Omega 'S' brushes use the same knot (the bristles) so the handle selection becomes one of personal choice. I've only ever used the one I linked to, but any of them should work equally well."
wicked_edge,3cg1xn,jb270,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"They do use the same knot, with the exception of the large pro series which should be avoided.

I also have a horsehair brush I like a lot, and a badger (cheap badger, but still) that isn't bad in my opinion.   That's the thing, though, it's all opinion and ultimatley you have to find what works for you. My opinions are based on these purely personal observations:   Synthetic - lathers well, retains its shape, rinses easily and dries thoroughly and quickly, requires no soaking Boar - lathers well, feels nice on my face, rinses a little less easily, takes a little longer to dry, requires soaking (which isn't a big deal but on hurried days it can matter) Horse - Very luxurious feel on the face, slightly more effort to lather, requires soaking, hairs in the knot will form knots unless well maintained Badger - mine sheds so I don't use it much, no strong opinions   These are all my personal observations and are undoubtedly influenced by things like my water supply, my soap/cream choices, my personal techniques, etc...

If you buy good equipment and take your time learning the end result is worth the effort.   Personally I prefer vintage straight razors. You'll find several listed on /r/shave_bazaar just make sure it's sold as shave ready. If you prefer new straight razors then there are fewer options, Hart steel, Ralf Aust, Dovo, H Boker, or custom blades from Shave Smith, Joe_Edson, mastro livi, Alex Jacques etc. Avoid anything from China or Pakistan or anything claiming to be Damascus.  For your strop avoid Amazon or eBay and buy from reputable vendor like maggard razors or straight razor designs etc or from ones of the artisans here that sell vintage straight razors and make strops like /u/RocTraitor /u/RockyMtnAristocrat (shave smith) /u/SecularPride /u/Nolr or myself.   Edit shavettes are not a replacement for straight razors. They require some of the same technique to use but shave completely different and aren't comparable to a straight razor at all.

wicked_edge,3ciorz,RVmaster,3,Wed Jul 8 12:25:58 2015 UTC,"I shave on occasion with a straight razor (I actually got a tutorial in person from Lynn Abrams at a meetup last year for my first straight razor shave) but I would recommend starting out for at least a month or two with a double edge razor for two reasons:   One, so you can work on easing up on the pressure.  I was so used to using a cartridge razor the idea of using little to no pressure was surprisingly hard because I was breaking a 15 year old habit.    The second reason is to work on your skills of making lather.  When you're straight shaving, you can take a decent amount of time doing it and if your lather is weak then one side of your face can start to dry and flake while you're shaving the other half of the face.  Sounds crazy but it's a real thing when you're starting out with a giant blade on your face."

If you're buying a new production razor I'd recommend a Hart Steel from Maggard razors, I'm not sure what they carry these days. If they don't have it then go to Straight Razor Designs.   Strop: Roctraitor sells good strops. RVMaster sells better strops, imo. Very good value either way compared to buying from a vendor.   Soap: Open to opinions.

wicked_edge,3ciorz,Papander,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:55:49 2015 UTC,"You say that you want to shave with a straight razor, but you also say that you want ""to really get started with the best shave I can achieve."" The two are not compatible.  Conventional wisdom is that it takes 100 shaves to become proficient with an open blade. And in the absence of proficiency, you're not going to be getting good shaves. At least not on a regular basis. If you're going to start with a straight, you have to be reconciled to a few months (or even a year, if you only shave twice a week) of varying amounts of residual stubble while you learn how to use it.  And even when you're competent, you may have trouble getting the best shaves possible. I enjoy shaving with a straight razor, and do so on a semi-regular basis, but the fact is that for me it just doesn't shave as close as a safety razor. There are a few reasons for this: the blade isn't as sharp, it's too long to work against the grain in some tricky areas, and, to be fair, I've shaved with a DE razor several thousand times, but no more than a couple hundred with a straight.  So if you want to shave with a straight razor, then by all means start shaving with a straight razor. I concur with the suggestion of a shave-ready vintage blade and a strop from /r/Shave_Bazaar. But manage your expectations going in; otherwise you may be sorely disappointed.  If you want excellent shaves in a much shorter time frame, start with a double-edged razor. There is a learning curve, and the transition from cartridge razors is not effortless, but it's a lot easier than the transition to a straight razor. You can always add a straight to your collection later.  This isn't to say that a DE is a ""stepping stone"" to a straight razor. It's not. It's just a quicker route to a perfect shave. And if you know how to use a DE, you'll have a way to clean up the messes you make while you're trying to learn to use a straight.  As far as the other stuff goes, you don't need a mug. They serve no purpose other than to hold a puck of shave soap, and most shave soaps come in their own containers.  For a boar brush, I like the Omega 20102 and the Semogue Owner's Club. I've also heard good things about the Omega 21762 ""Italian Flag"".  For soaps, you've got an embarrassment of good options, from great artisan makers such as LA Shaving Soap Co. or Barrister & Mann to established brands like DR Harris or Mitchell's Wool Fat to super-premium options like Czech & Speake or Boellis. There are even some really well-performing soaps in the ultra-budget category (I buy Arko sticks a dozen at a time for about a buck apiece).  So give it some thought, browse around a little bit, and check back in. Once you figure out with a little more precision what direction you're headed, we can give you more specific recommendations and advice."
wicked_edge,3ciorz,arbarnes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:01:56 2015 UTC,"I recommend getting a vintage shave ready straight razor from someone reputable.  Obviously you'll need a strop, preferably one that also has a cloth strop. I like Omega Pro brushes, specifically 49, 98, 112.  My favorite shaving soap is Tabac.

I've got a good mix of products and once you learn the right soap:water ratio for each one they'll all perform quite well.  Castle Forbes is one of my favorite brands and, IMHO, absolutely worth the price tag.  It's a firm cream (not hard, but not goopy) and a little bit of product will yield a wonderful lather.    Density of the soaps and creams will vary by maker as I noted above trying to describe Castle Forbes.

wicked_edge,3ch89g,commiecat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:25:01 2015 UTC,It does affect lather but it's not impossible.  If I use a soap I almost always have to rebuild the lather after each pass whereas my creams can usually get through two passes.    You can get some distilled water and compare a lather built with that versus your tap water.  I've done it with good success but for me it's not worth bothering with separate water just for lathering.  I know how each of my soaps performs with tap water.
wicked_edge,3ch89g,Leisureguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:09:50 2015 UTC,Just curious: have you tried using citric acid to soften the water? That strikes me as much easier than using distilled water (can use hot tap water; don't have to store a jug of water).
wicked_edge,3ch89g,MundiMori,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"Wait, creams last longer? I started with proraso green cream, then a TOBS soft soap, both lasted maybe a month and a half before hitting bottom, the first hard soap I've tried I've been using for a month and it hasn't even made a dent."
wicked_edge,3ch89g,commiecat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:23:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant that a cream's lather tends to last longer than a soap's lather with my hard water.  I'll modify my comment to clarify that."

wicked_edge,3ch89g,Wickatron,3,Wed Jul 8 01:47:06 2015 UTC,"Search this sub for tips on dealing with hard water if you're having trouble. You can basically use citric acid to neutralize it's effects. Softer soaps like Dr. Jon's and Chiseled Face (haven't used CB) are pretty easy to lather with a decent brush, but it may take some practice. Creams like TOBS are very easy to lather in my opinion so I would start there and work your way to soaps. For the Castle Forbes, get some samples from Maggard's along with a few other brands to see what works best for you, along with some cheaper store bought stuff or Proraso. Then you can get a better sense of if the higher priced options really do perform better for you and are worth the extra cost without spending a lot of money upfront on something you may not like. Regarding the density, I can't really help you there. All I can say is that the density would depend on the soap. Softer soaps will be less dense and some harder soaps will be more dense. Just depends."
wicked_edge,3ch89g,Wickatron,2,Tue Jul 7 23:36:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not having trouble with hard water right now. I actually started with a TOBS cream and once I got my technique down can get a good lather nearly every time. I just wanted to know if I have a softer puck soap will I have an easier time and not have to worry about water hardness? According to the scales I was seeing, 5 gpg is lower hardness, not soft but bordering."
wicked_edge,3ch89g,robosquirrel,2,Tue Jul 7 23:47:15 2015 UTC,If you can get a lather with TOBS then you should be fine using a good soft soap. And if you do have trouble just look up the citric acid technique.

wicked_edge,3cdio9,RockyMtnAristocrat,18,Tue Jul 7 03:27:51 2015 UTC,"The simplest solution I've found is giving it its own space within a drawer, laying it atop an open towel with the omote (thicker spine looking side) against the towel, then folding the other part of the towel atop it. Simple, safe. Cigar box with the same idea works great too if drawer space is limited.   However, some of my customers have come up with really neat solutions, ranging from using a magnet in a wood plank to hold onto the handle, to toothbrush style holders that grip it at the shank."

It could work with a double hollow western grind and I may pick one up to try it out. Not too sure if it would work  with an asymmetrical traditional grind... we'll need to test it!  One thing to watch out for when trying is to make sure the edge remains untouched. If there is any contact between the blade edge and a hard surface, it will likely need a touch up (like any straight). So we'd need to be very careful putting the sleeve on and taking it off."

Lots of folks over at B&B have lengthy discussion about this (pretty much tradition vs getting the job done)."

He will show you how he does it and try really hard to explain anything to you. Artisuga is so commercial. I've heard that they have significantly lowered quality of their blades and make most of their money selling to tourists who want an engraved japanese knife. Just what i have heard from japanese friends.  Also if you do go and buy these Japanese knives be sure to know how to care for them. I live on the ocean in Australia and the salt in the air just eats carbon steel. I need to sharpen them once a week and store them in air tight containers or they rust instantly.  I have a few knives from these guys and more.

wicked_edge,3cgmaj,Captain_Anarchy,3,Tue Jul 7 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"Those are some beautiful blades!  They will definitely serve you well in becoming adept at using a straight razor.  Preshave oil: I use jojoba oil as a preshave occasionally with good results.  I originally tried olive oil, which worked well but compared to jojoba I found it to be a bit too oily and had a distinct scent.     I just want to see if an oil may work better for the blade to glide on my face versus a cream.   Preshave oil isn't mandatory and if you do opt for it, use it along with a good lather.  It sounds like you're looking to use an oil in lieu of lather and personally I'd advise against it, at least while you're learning to use a straight razor.  Cream/soap: I like Proraso as it: is affordable, works well, and has classic scents.  That said, there are many artisan vendors to choose from along with various other big name makers.  Most of the soaps and creams that you find at reputable shave sites will build good lathers.  It's more about finding a scent and price that suits you.  Razor treatment: Most straight razors use high-carbon steel which will rust extremely quickly.  Try to minimize the amount of water you use on your blade and pay attention to the pivot area (where the razor is affixed to the handles) as water likes to collect in there.  If you're using the blades regularly, say every week or two, and not storing them in the bathroom then you probably don't need to oil them after each use.  Ensure they're dry post-shave and if you do start to see signs of rust then clean them up with some polish and revisit this subject.  Hones: Learn how to use the razor first and then come back and post about hones and learning to sharpen.  It really is a subject onto itself and depending on your expectations it can be complicated and comparatively expensive.    Hope that helps!"

Can you recommend any oil treatment for my razor either while stropping pre shave or post shave?  Thanks for the help! I really appreciate it."
wicked_edge,3cgmaj,commiecat,2,Wed Jul 8 22:16:26 2015 UTC,"To protect your razor from rust you can give it a light coat of: mineral oil, camellia oil, gun oil, or any other similar oil.

wicked_edge,3cgmaj,commiecat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:28:23 2015 UTC,Awesome! sorry for the interrogation but could I use the same oil to treat the razor before I strop/shave and after I use it to prevent rust?
wicked_edge,3cgmaj,Ruff_Dog,2,Wed Jul 8 22:36:53 2015 UTC,"You don't need to oil your razor before a shave; the only reason to oil your blade is for rust prevention between uses.  Your blade should be dry before you strop else the oil/water will transfer to the leather.  Now a separate point is that leather needs to be conditioned periodically.  For reference I usually condition my strops maybe once every 12 to 18 months, so pretty infrequently.  This is a simple matter of running the palm of your hand up and down the strop a few times to let your natural oils do the work.  You can use leather oils, e.g. neatsfoot, but I wouldn't bother unless you already have it on-hand or if you're restoring a worn-down strop."

I could have made it easier, but I decided not to.  The straight handled everything so nicely.  The strop is fantastic, too.  I also use Proraso Red, but in soap form.

wicked_edge,3ci1rx,CoffeeAndWork,2,Wed Jul 8 01:55:05 2015 UTC,"WSP doesn't make safety razors, they import them. And best I can tell, what they're importing is a generic South Asian clone of the Edwin Jagger razors. In my experience they're good razors, but quality control at the factory is iffy. You might get something that looks like this.  Some vendors scrutinize things pretty closely and weed out the rejects. I don't know how careful WSP is about this, but they're a reputable company, so if you get a dud they'll probably take care of you. My only concern is that if you're just getting started you may blame your technique for problems caused by a defective razor.  TL;DR - it's probably a safe bet. Although for $20 you can get one of the Maggard MR-series razors, which have handles made out of stainless steel instead of brass."
wicked_edge,3ci1rx,arbarnes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"I see only one. Is there another? It looks to be an EJ knockoff, and the price suggests that it is. It will probably be okay, akin to the Maggard Razors. I continue to recommend the Parker 24C, but it is $9 more than the WSP (or Maggards)."
wicked_edge,3ch5n4,TenTonneMackerel,3,Tue Jul 7 21:41:36 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, and this may not be true for all brands, but blades made in Pakistan are typically of a lower quality steel, and are not recommended. If you want an inexpensive straight razor, you should check antique stores instead. I got a nice razor in great condition for $10. That being said, it would be interesting if you found and reviewed some soaps or DE razors that are only available there."
wicked_edge,3ch5n4,jb270,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I heard that Pakistan made DE blades are typically inferior, but wasn't sure if this held true for the SRs as they may not be made there necessarily.   I may just look when I come back in antique store as you suggest though."
wicked_edge,3ch5n4,jb270,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:24:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the DE razors themselves, but I would definitely avoid blades. I know arko comes from turkey, but you could always look around while you are there and see if you could get some real cheap. As far as antique stores go, just beware of vintage RAD. I've only found one straight worth getting so far, but have half a dozen vintage gillettes now."
wicked_edge,3ch5n4,game_under,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"On the flipside, Pakistan is awesome for branded DE blades.

wicked_edge,3ch5n4,arbarnes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:54:41 2015 UTC,"You heard wrong. Treet blades are made in Pakistan, and while they don't work for everybody, a lot of people really like them. There are also a number of Pakistani producers of DE razors, some of which perform pretty well.  Most people who buy safety razors use them to shave, while many people buy straight razors (or, more precisely, things that resemble straight razors) as novelties. And a novelty item doesn't need to be made of steel capable of holding an edge that will shave.  Pakistan supplies much of the market for novelty ""razors."" That's not to say that the country doesn't produce any usable straight razors; it's just that unless you get a lot more information you're more likely to purchase one that will end up being a cool-looking letter opener."
wicked_edge,3ch5n4,commiecat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:09:04 2015 UTC,"Avoid any blades branded Pakistan or ""Damascus"".  Basically the same rules as anywhere else: antique steel will be good but you need to check the condition.  New razors are best to be avoided if you don't know what you're looking for."
wicked_edge,3cf62w,DubaliciousDubs,2,Tue Jul 7 12:59:20 2015 UTC,"It is not common, not have I come across a razor where it is intended. The blade exposure on each side should be equal. I've found that by not fully tightening the razor I can adjust the blade into the proper alignment if it's askew. If you do like the side with more exposure then maybe you should look into a more aggressive razor, I'm preferential to the vintage Gillette adjustables."
wicked_edge,3cf62w,King_Hodor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:43:42 2015 UTC,Pardon my naivety but what would be an example of a more aggressive razor in the sense you speak? More blade?

wicked_edge,3cf62w,King_Hodor,2,Tue Jul 7 16:08:32 2015 UTC,Oftentimes a razor with more blade exposure is considered more aggressive as it provides a closer shave in fewer passes.  You may also hear it referred to as efficiency.  It basically means it will cut more hair with one pass.
wicked_edge,3cf62w,fighingirish169,2,Tue Jul 7 14:49:56 2015 UTC,There are some razors that even have intentional alignment that looks off but is how it's supposed to be.  Particularly some slant razors.  It would be helpful to know what razor you're using.
wicked_edge,3cf62w,kcbeemo,2,Tue Jul 7 14:11:25 2015 UTC,Razor is a Maggard MR7
wicked_edge,3cf62w,fighingirish169,6,Tue Jul 7 14:39:58 2015 UTC,Please contact Maggard Razors with this issue.
wicked_edge,3cf62w,Lord_stinko,2,Tue Jul 7 14:43:08 2015 UTC,I don't have any experience with the MR7 but I've heard that it has pretty low tolerances and a fair amount of wiggle room for the blade to be misaligned.  For now I would just pay close attention while tightening it and keep your eyes on a new razor.  I really like using a cheap old Gillette if you're looking for inexpensive and quality.  You can start getting into some good modern razors in the 30-40$ range in my opinion but you can find a good Gillette tech or superspeed for maybe 10-15$.
wicked_edge,3cf62w,GeneralKinetics,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:47:34 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem, ironically with the maggard mr8, while I love the handle, most blades are very hard to get even distribution on both sides. I did buy a standard though and hopefully that ends up better. I noticed certain blades are easier to even out than others, some are impossible to even out. I never contacted maggards about the issue but it does bother me, I suggest you do that or find blades that are easy to fit."
wicked_edge,3cf62w,BillyDonovanLand,2,Wed Jul 8 00:56:58 2015 UTC,Just take a few pictures and contact Maggards. They'll most probably replace it for you. Their customer service is excellent.
wicked_edge,3cf62w,nobodysawme,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:57:54 2015 UTC,Which razor are you using? There are certain razors that have a reputation for poor alignment
wicked_edge,3cf62w,nobodysawme,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:48:02 2015 UTC,"I once put heat shrink tubing on the two alignment posts. It made the head harder to disassemble, but the alignment was perfect every time. I can show pictures if you like.   The other thing is, now you know this is how your head behaves and can pay attention to it when changing blades."
wicked_edge,3cf62w,brandon7s,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:10:09 2015 UTC,"I should point out, some vintage razors have a little play and you can adjust the alignment of the blade - the Gillette Tech does this a little, and it's OK. On the flip side of things, the Dorco PL-602 plastic razor sometimes sold as a Treet or Wilkinson, has perfect alignment every time.   Provided you're aware of it and check the alignment when you assemble the head, it's not really a problem. I agree, it's nicer when it's right every time."
wicked_edge,3cgo1m,SquirrelBoy,3,Tue Jul 7 19:38:33 2015 UTC,"Best balms available today are from L'Occitane. Cade is honestly the best balm on the face of the earth. The rest are quite good, but not as magical. Would take some branching out scent-wise buy that could be good.   Aside from that you may want to ask /u/songwind if he does custom orders for ""Scale Polish"" like he does for Dapper Dragon soaps. Best artisan made balm I've tried.   Stirling soaps have a decent balm too and do custom frags."
wicked_edge,3cgo1m,IllegalMonk,2,Wed Jul 8 01:13:22 2015 UTC,"I'm typically not a big fan of balms but recently I found myself with a gift certificate to amazon so I picked up some soap commander ""passion"" soap and matching balm.

wicked_edge,3cgmmo,tough_edge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:28:17 2015 UTC,"I can't speak directly to the use of the Artist Club, but I'm curious about the irritation you're experiencing with the iKon slant. Is the slant one of the stainless slants or the #102? Have you done much in the way of blade exploration? (I found the stainless slants in particular to be a bit picky about the brand of blade.) And are you using a sufficiently light pressure? (I started getting nicks with the stainless slant after a few shaves and discovered I had unconsciously started using too much pressure. Once I lightened up, the nicks stopped. Use the same pressure you'd use if you had a sunburn and the razor were an uncomfortably warm metal rod: still touch the skin, but barely. Think of the razor just barely grazing the skin, though still touching. Professional barbers are tested by having them shave a lather-covered balloon, so you might try for that: just enough pressure on your face as would remove lather from a balloon (without popping the balloon, of course. :)"
wicked_edge,3cgmmo,Leisureguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:41:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have one year experience with the Slant DLC and many different blade types: Feather, KAI, Voskhod, Gilette Black, Super Iridium, etc. My problem is, that on parts of my face, the beard grows flat instead of straight up, and there are many spots where it's impossible to get adequately close (not even BBS) without using a bit of preassure in an ATG touch up pass, which in turn causes ingrowns and whiskers. Believe me, I have tried everything.  Actually, I've dismissed the Shavette idea and am now looking at some straights. My hope is that with a half hollow I might have more luck cutting those flat whiskers with much less irritation."
wicked_edge,3cgmmo,Leisureguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Boy, the range of individual differences on skin sensitivity, beard type, beard growth (tend to forget that one), prep, skill, blade choice, etc.! No wonder YMMV.  I'm very curious as to whether the #102 (different head design) would be like. I do find it both more comfortable and---though I hate to use the word---more aggressive than the stainless slant (whether plain, DLC, or B6). PM sent."
wicked_edge,3cgmmo,jb270,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"I haven't owned a slant, but I do own an FAC SS. In my experience it works very well, and mows down hair like no tomorrow. There is a bit of a learning curve, and it takes a while to learn how to get tricky contours BBS. I suggest that if you go with it you start with the pro guard blades. They help ease the learning curve, and I haven't gotten more than small weepers as far as nicks and cuts go. I still reach for a DE for my morning shave as it is much quicker, although this may be due to my technique needing improvement as I am sure speed improves with regular use. When I am feeling particularly indulgent, or have a few days of growth to take care of, I reach for my feather. Even if you keep using the slant, it's nice to have variety."

wicked_edge,3cdgfz,NeedsMoreMenthol,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:53:39 2015 UTC,First shave with the Tech went quite well. Sure it's aggressive but it's smoother than my R41. Shaving ATG was tricky and not that comfortable. Tomorrow I am gonna try WTG and XTG and leave it at that. I am pretty sure the Tech is aggressive enough to get BBS with just those two passes.   I have a bunch of other blades that I need to try. Probably an Astra or Red Personna is up next.
wicked_edge,3cdgfz,NeedsMoreMenthol,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:59:38 2015 UTC,"I found the R41, even the 2011 to be smoother than the iKon Tech. Not saying you're wrong at all, it's probably because I have lots of shaves on the R41 and only one on the iKon."
wicked_edge,3cdgfz,chanttttt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:05:04 2015 UTC,"This certainly wouldn't be the first time I was wrong.  I have been using the R41 for a few months mostly with a Feather blade. Shaving WTG and XTG with a light touch is pretty smooth. I am still not able to shave ATG with the R41 no matter how careful I am. It just tugs at my face, especially my neck and cheeks.   The Tech felt smooth immediately WTG. This might be that I am used the the R41 and was therefore very gentle with the Tech. Shaving ATG was still thought but better than the R41 (in that I could complete the shave). This could all change after more time with the Tech.   I have gone with a 2 razor approach with the R41. I use it for WTG and something else (usually a Weber Polished or Maggard closed comb) for the ATG pass. My guess is that I will end up doing something similar with the Tech. I am trying to use only the Tech for now but I am not sure how long I will last."

One important lesson in shaving is learning not to press too hard, a lesson that has a more general application: in general, not merely in shaving, it’s best to press (down, forward, up, or back, depending on the context) just enough to achieve your goal and not more. A subordinate quickly learns not to press his boss too hard, and a wise boss knows not to press his subordinates too hard. In learning to shave, don’t press yourself too hard—in both senses: razor against cheek, or yourself to improve more quickly. Being patient and paying attention produce the best progress.   I would say that also applies to the brush: don't press too hard. Press no harder than necessary to get the job done. In talking about adjustable razors, I often write that one starts at a low setting and advances to a higher setting only as required to get a good shave: look for the lowest setting that works, not the highest you can stand. The same with the brush: you want the lightest pressure that gets the job done, and that is often a fairly firm pressure, but not too firm. How to know? Experimentation. Try making lather using different pressures to find the right pressure to use: enough to load the brush and make lather efficiently, but not more."

I don't think I'm crushing the knot or anything -- this is just kind of an aesthetics thing, all the hairs on the brush don't form back together.  A stray one kind of remains a bit more 'out'."
wicked_edge,3cdwzk,Ruff_Dog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:39:02 2015 UTC,Would you recommend any other synthetic or do you consider the fine angel hair top of the line?
wicked_edge,3cdwzk,Derpin_Dots,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:26:24 2015 UTC,"Naturally enough, personal preferences come into play. Mühle (except for the HJM line) seems to have taken the course of configuring synthetics to replicate the feel of natural fibers, so their high end synthetics have a feel similar to badger. Omega in the S-Series was going for a synthetic boar brush. But the Plisson and Fine brushes are not mimicking any natural fiber but simply exploring how good a brush you can have if you exploit synthetic fibers: embracing the syntheticness, as it were.   So naturally enough, some prefer one or another. I do like the Fine and Plisson a lot, but I also like the S-Series, and I have a couple of Mühle brushes I like. They feel different, but I enjoy variety. But certainly Fine and Plisson are superb brushes that do not reflect any animal analogue."

wicked_edge,3cdwzk,chevro1et,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:42:59 2015 UTC,"Check your local antique stores for vintage gillette razors. Don't spend more than $15 dollars or so, unless it is an adjustable. Some dealers think that razors are worth a lot more than they actually are and charge exorbitant prices for them. It is best to move on and not deal with them. Super speeds and techs are pretty mild beginner friendly razors, and are very common so keep an eye out for them. If you find a gillette old type, I don't recommend shaving with it until you have your technique down. Those will bite you if you aren't careful. If you are interested in going the vintage route, do some research and familiarize yourself with the models and what would be considered good condition. A rusty, seized up razor that is on the verge of crumbling to dust isn't worth any price to add to your collection. A word of warning: Razor Acquisition Disorder is a very real disease. I started with one vintage razor. Now I have 7, and I still check my local shops on occasion. Tread carefully."

wicked_edge,3ccvd5,unicorn_tacos,7,Mon Jul 6 22:42:12 2015 UTC,"I like Mystic Water Sensitive Skin (scroll down at the link -- you can see a complete list of ingredients in this post), and she does sell samples.  For acne, I recommend:  a. Check the ingredients in your shaving products and know which to avoid---menthol, for example, is not a good idea. Until your acne's in remission, favor unscented shaving creams and soaps.  b. Use a high-glycerin soap such as Whole Foods 365 glycerin soap with vitamin E (that's one of several glycerin soaps they offer), $2/bar, as a pre-shave beard wash. Wash beard at the sink using your hands, then rinse partially with a splash and apply lather.  c. Rinse razor head in high-proof rubbing alcohol before and after each shave.  d. After the final rinse ending the shave, glide a dry alum block over your wet skin, then set block aside and clean up around the sink, put stuff away, etc., with the alum on your face. After a minute or two, rinse the alum off, dry, and do your usual aftershave. This step is particularly helpful: alum is a mild antiseptic. You may need to wet the block in colder climes during the winter, when indoor relatively humidity plummets.  e. Use a fresh towel for every shave. You can buy thin, 100% cotton, lint-free towels called ""barber towels"" or ""bar towels"" for under $20/dozen. They're easy to launder and a fresh one for each shave helps a lot. Here's an example. You can also use surgical towels, like these. Also, these towels from Ikea are said to be good. A wet towel is a microbe incubator.   f. Shave daily. Use very light pressure Think of your skin as being badly sunburned and the razor is an uncomfortably hot bar, but the razor still must touch the skin---but barely. That kind of light pressure. Daily shaving probably helps by being exfoliating and by the daily alum block and good aftershave---try one of the Thayers witch hazels with aloe vera or one of the witch-hazel-based aftershaves by ProspectorCo.com or StirlingSoap.com. Since the shave itself is exfoliating, I suggest restricting exfoliating scrubs to the forehead and nose and not use them where you shave---this is to minimize skin damage.  g. Buy a bunch of pillowcases from a hotel supply house and use a fresh pillowcase every night.   h. If you have choices on how you eat, try observing this diet (but without the dairy) for a month and see what happens. It works for some. Here's another description of the same diet. And here's the reason the diet is recommended."
wicked_edge,3ccvd5,Leisureguy,2,Mon Jul 6 23:26:37 2015 UTC,"All great advice and really interesting to see the extra non-shaving information. If you don't mind some tacked on details: For G, consider washing them with a dye and perfume free detergent or it may not prove effective. For H, check out /r/keto if you want to change your diet. I would strongly recommend any newcomers fully understand the diet before jumping in, or at least checking out the calculator."

wicked_edge,3ccvd5,Mesadoram,2,Tue Jul 7 06:23:27 2015 UTC,"Glycerin is a good pre-shave soap, makes the face a little bit more slippery (and cleans!). Alum helps to cleanse the skin, works nicely."
wicked_edge,3ccvd5,Leisureguy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"The glycerin soap improves the shave for many, but in shaving there's a fair amount of YMMV, so try using the glycerin soap for about 6-7 shaves (I'm thinking a week for a daily shaver), skipping it a week, and using it another week, then decide whether it helps your shave.  The alum block for many seems to wipe out acne. Some, however, have a skin reaction to it: their skin turns red and hot for a few minutes after using it. You can test to see whether your skin reacts to it by using it on the crease of your elbow joint and waiting a few minutes to see if anything happens.  For that skin, using very light pressure. Most find that with the regimen above, their acne dwindles. Other tips: avoid the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make when switching to a DE razor."
wicked_edge,3ccvd5,jb270,4,Tue Jul 7 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"I've found that the exfoliating effects of my shaving brush significantly reduced my breakouts, especially when face lathering. I have also had no issues with any of the soaps I've used, but my favorite(and it seems the best for my skin) is Mickey Lees Drunken Goat. Some people apparently have issues with tallow soaps and acne, but this may or may not be the case for you. I often see Proraso white and Nivea sensitive recommended for sensitive skin. You could also try a cold water shave(start with the usual hot water shave first though). My shave routine goes as follows:  Hot shower, or thoroughly wash face with cold water  Load brush and face lather for a minute or more. Make sure you take the time to build a proper lather as it really makes a difference.   Shave. 3 passes WTG, XTG, ATG  Rinse with cold water, dry face with a clean towel. Using a fresh towel for every shave definitely helps with acne  Liberally apply witch hazel to my entire face, and pat/massage it in  While the witch hazel dries, I clean up and put away my gear  I finish by applying an alcohol based aftershave.   Hopes this helps. I have actually found that I know longer need to use an acne face wash with this routine, save for the occasional usage on my nose/forehead.

wicked_edge,3ccvd5,HickorySplits,3,Mon Jul 6 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"If you are prone to acne, try Bump Patrol as an aftershave.  It's basically a balm version of Tend Skin.  It has enough glycerin to hydrate the skin, and enough salicylic acid to be effective at acne remediation.  Edit:  You might also give something like CeraVe SA lotion a go as a nightly moisturizer.  Good moisturization overnight is key to keeping my skin happy and reducing sensitivities, and I've found the CeraVe SA to be just right in consistency and the salicylic acid keeps me blemish free.

My two cents: - Most acne medications (at least, the ones I used) are alcohol based anyway, as the intent is to dry your skin, so I think an alcohol based splash would be good.  - Vitamin E can be known to cause breakouts (as it still does a little bit for me) so you might want to try avoiding it and see how it works. - The thing that really helped me once I figured it out was to stop washing my face. Seriously. Rinse well in the shower and after shaving, but all you end up doing is scrubbing dirt back into your pores and causing more problems. - Experiment with shaving oil. Village Barber is great, but maybe too expensive for your small budget. Pacific Shaving Co. has a great one and I've heard Shave Secret from WalMart is pretty good too, although I've never used it myself."

It's actually not so bad, and like I said, the performance is hard to beat.  Pinaud VIBR is not a good example of bay rum. It has way too much clove and cinnamon that it overpowers the bay rum scent.  I really like pure bay rum - I bought a bottle of Pimenta Racemosa (bay rum) essential oil off eBay and add it to my Thayers Witch Hazel."

That said, before you buy a new razor, try shimming your existing razor by taking an old blade or two, cutting the sharp edges off, and placing them between the safety bar plate and the blade.   This will increase the aggressiveness of the razor, allowing you to cut more efficiently with one pass, rather than going over the same spot repeatedly and irritating your face.  If that process works for you, you'll know you need a more aggressive razor and can proceed from there, either by getting something new, or just using the shims.  (Most of the no-name razors are based on the Gillette Tech which is a basic mild razor that is easy to produce and good to start with, but not a long-term razor for everyone [EDIT] particularly those who prefer a more aggressive razor.)"

You can sample blades from tryablade.com and buy a few 5 packs of the ones you like to work on refining technique. Right now I'd recommend either the normal size S Brush (not the Syntex) from Omega ($10) or the Fine ""angel hair""  brush ($20). Also what soaps or creams are you using? Are you using moisturizer and post shave products?   Edit: not sure what your brush preferences are. Synthetic I think is easier to deal with starting out.

What I mean by reluctant to splay is that it takes a bit of extra force to start the splay, then it splays normally.  Stiction is the wrong word, but illustrated the principle well - if you tie a rope to a brick, it takes more force to start the brick moving than to keep it moving."
wicked_edge,3cb7ib,NeedsMoreMenthol,3,Mon Jul 6 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"I bought the fine brush and I've found that it splays much easier than the S brushes, I also hate their reluctance to splay. It frustrates me!"

That said, the Fine synthetic's reluctance to splay was noticed in the first shave but gone in the second, so I suggest that when/if you get the brush, you make a couple of practice lathers. For my brush, the first use eliminated the reluctance to splay and the second use was fine---as noted in the posts at the link.

The knot dimensions are listed at 20/56. I bought it, but I was a bit apprehensive, as a 56 mm loft seems a bit high for a knot diameter of 20.  My point being the longer than average loft (for a 20 mm set knot diameter), might allow for a stretching/flexing of the fibers, which may not be possible at say the ""average"" 20/48-50.  The brush is very sweet in my opinion and has a nice amount of backbone with very soft tips (my opinion). I'm certainly not parting with mine."
wicked_edge,3cb7ib,kremesickle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:07:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I can go only on what I experienced. In the very first shave I noticed some resistance to splaying and (as you see from the links) I commented on it at the time. On the second use that had totally vanished. Perhaps it is possible that I assessed it correctly and on first use there is indeed some reluctance to splay. But if you didn't notice it, perhaps it was idiosyncratic to the brush I received.   I'm sure others will report in time. But yes, it's possible you or I did mis-assess it the first time. Time will tell.  But that does suggest it would be interesting if people did NOT make a practice lather but do the first shave with the brush fresh out of the box, and then compare that with their second shave with the brush, and let us know what they found."
wicked_edge,3cb7ib,IllegalMonk,2,Mon Jul 6 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I have only used it once and I am currently breaking in newly acquired badgers and a boar, so I haven't used it 2,3 or more times in a short enough period to make an accurate assessment. As far as the majority/consensus is regarding synthetics, they do not change (but you already know this).  I suspect it's not a ""break in"" in the conventional sense, but a natural stretching/movement of the fiber material itself (some form of plastc?).  Anyway, my intention was not to break your stones in any way. From the many assessments, opinions and/or beliefs regarding synthetic fiber brushes, it has almost been cast in stone that there is no break in period or changing of the knot's characteristics."
wicked_edge,3cb7ib,Ruff_Dog,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"I was reporting on the experience of using the brush, and something definitely changed in how the brush performed. The cause of the change is not known to me, but (as noted in the posts at the link) I speculated that it could be some sort of sizing that was washed away in the first use. But the change in feel is (to my mind) equivalent to breaking in, and it seems to be an actual change in the feel of the brush, not the kind of metaphorical ""breaking-in"" that can happen with a razor. (At first the razor seems inclined to nick and is not very comfortable, but as you continue using it, the shaves improve over time until you have no trouble at all.) That ""break-in"" is clearly a result of unconscious adjustments made in technique as you ""learn"" the razor---tiny alterations of angle and pressure and so on.  The change in the Fine brush was not that. It seemed quite distinct to me, which is why I posted it. And since you actually have not used the brush a second time, may I suggest that you are jumping the gun somewhat? You might perhaps have tried a second shave to see whether you also observed the phenomenon. (Of course, I used the Fine brush in consecutive shaves, so the direct comparison was for me pretty easy; if it's been some time since your first shave, I would guess it might be more difficult to notice any difference. But perhaps we'll hear from others.)  I was particularly struck by your assumption that, if a mis-assessment happened, it would be me rather than you who mis-assessed the situation, but I now understand: since you've not done a second shave with the brush, you were not in a position to assess whether or not such a change occurs.  The majority opinion is less convincing to me than is my own direct experience, and sometimes it can take me quite a while to become aware of my own experience. For example, for years I assumed that a boar brush ""broke in"" by have the tips split and thus the knot becoming softer in feel. It was only a two or three years ago that I took notice that new boar brushes---and now I've seen the same phenomenon in a new silvertip badger brush---can be quite lathercidal, to the point that when you pick up the brush for the second pass the lather's gone. I watched one boar brush lose that property, shave by shave, over a week. After a couple of shaves the brush would have lather for the second pass but not the third, and by the end of the week the brush held enough lather for all three passes. It was exactly as if some lather-killing substance was being washed off the bristles by the lathering in each shave. I don't know that's what it was, but what I observed was consistent with that.  Withe the badger, the second shave was much better---much like the Fine synthetic---which made speculate that in manufacturing something like sizing might be used.  I've not seen anyone else comment on this before I noticed it, and so if I were going solely by majority opinion I would not have noticed it myself.  Try doing the experiment and see what you experience. One reason I constantly exhort people to experiment in their shaving is to make decisions based on their experience, not on the opinions of others. In a YMMV activity like shaving, in which someone else's experience may not match your own, majority opinion is not so helpful as it may seem.  edit: typo"

Judging from my past experience with other synthetics, plus the majority of opinions, assessments and dare I say ""beliefs"" on the nature of synthetic brushes, it was a possibility.  Again, my intention was not to break your stones. As far as the Fine Angel hair is concerned, it's too late for me. I used it once last week and pretty much forgot the finer points of it's behavior.

The bristles would always bend as a whole to one side and then swirl around my face rather than splay.  I was a little reluctant to get another synthetic as I thought this may just be the backbone that goes along with synthetics, but I thought I'd give the fine a whirl because of its classic look and reasonable price.  I'm very glad I did because this is an amazing brush.  So soft with great backbone but still splayability (?).  I really enjoy it.  Might be looking to get rid of my pro s-brush now... haha"

wicked_edge,3cb7ib,almightywhacko,2,Mon Jul 6 19:05:20 2015 UTC,"Today I compared the Fine and the Plisson. Details of the review are at the link, but in short: The Fine seems exactly like the Plisson except for feeling a bit firmer, with the Plisson feeling a bit larger and more cushiony. And indeed I find that the Fine has a 20mm knot and the Plisson is a 12, which is a 22mm knot. I imagine the Fine's slightly smaller knot creates the sensation of slightly greater firmness (same total pressure over smaller area). But the two are definitely brothers, IMO."

wicked_edge,3cbxf6,Leisureguy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:59:33 2015 UTC,"Synthetics tend to hold more water than natural bristles---or it seems that way since they do not absorb any of the water. So in making lather with a synthetic, it's best to give the brush a couple of shakes to avoid having a small gush of water flow from the brush onto the soap when you begin loading. Note the two shakes for the synthetic in this video, prior to loading the brush (which took 10 seconds, using a dried-out puck of MWF).  A little practice will enable you to find the sweet spot, but in view of the discussion on whether the brush has more resistance to splaying on the first use, it would be very interesting if---should you get the brush---you use it fresh out of the box for your first shave; and then use it for another shave and let us know whether you notice any difference between the first and second shave. I did, /u/Nusquam-Humanitus did not. Let us know your experience (if you do get the brush)."

wicked_edge,3casl4,Stikmann,12,Mon Jul 6 13:24:20 2015 UTC,"Never soak your razor in vinegar, it just isn't necessary.  Vinegar is an acid, and even a diluted solution can quickly dissolve a pot metal razor. For plated brass razors prolonged soaking can damage the plating.  If you have a new razor, the only things you should be cleaning it with are an old/spare toothbrush and some dish soap. That is all you need and these two items won't damage your razor at all.  If you have an old razor to clean up, Barbicide is the way to go. A properly mixed solution will dissolve organic matter like old shaving foam residue without damaging the metal underneath."
wicked_edge,3casl4,almightywhacko,2,Mon Jul 6 15:09:52 2015 UTC,Does barbicide also help if there is a bit of rust beneath where the blades go?
wicked_edge,3casl4,taylor-in-progress,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"It should as long as it is just surface rust from your blade and not the razor itself rusting.   Honestly though the toothbrush and dish soap should take care of any surface rust with no problems. If you need to, you can make a gentle polishing compound using a little dish soap, some baking soda and a little water. Just mix about equal parts dish soap and baking powder so that you end up with a paste, and add a little water to soften it up so that you can use it. That should be enough to take care of light staining on a new razor."

wicked_edge,3casl4,taylor-in-progress,7,Mon Jul 6 17:00:12 2015 UTC,"That's too much soaking in an acidic solution, and too often. If you get really bad hard-water deposits on your razor, you might soak it for an hour in a 1:4 vinegar water solution (water = 4) every few months to loosen the deposits, but certainly not for the day. And in any event, if the water's that hard I would certainly recommend softening it with citric acid, which could eliminate the formation of the hard-water deposits: run the sink half-full of hot water (or cold water, if you like a cold-water shave). Dissolve a pinch or two of citric acid in it---not much. Use that water for the pre-shave beard wash, the lather, and rinsing the razor and splashing water on your face at the end of each pass.   Do the final rinse with tap water. Use the lather from a distilled-water shave to define the baseline quality of lather you are going for.   You can get a small container of citric acid on-line and in some stores. You want pure citric acid, not citric acid mixed with anything else. It can often be found in healthfood stores (used as a salt substitute and also to prevent mold when growing sprouts) and where canning or brewing supplies are sold.  Read this post and this post to see the difference it made in two instances.  Shaving is very much a YMMV activity, and some, after experimenting with softening the water with citric acid, find that they are happy just using the unsoftened water, while others prefer using softened water. To determine your own preference, use citric acid a week, skip it a week, then use it another week (a ""week"" being on the order of 7 shaves), and then decide based on your own experience. Preferences are something one discovers.  And preferences vary from person to person: don't assume that another's preferences will match your own. They may, or they may not. Best to experiment and get some experience with both approaches. Then decide."

And I agree with /u/almightywhacko that the first effort should not involve an acidic solution, even one so weak as I suggested. First try the soft toothbrush plus non-abrasive cleanser (e.g., Scrubbing Bubbles) route. Use the (relatively brief) soaking in 1:4 vinegar water only if the mineral deposits don't respond. (An ultrasonic cleaner is a big help here: it blasts hard-water deposits off instantly with absolutely no harm to the razor.)   The citric acid trick may obviate the problem altogether by preventing mineral deposits int he first place."

wicked_edge,3casl4,nobodysawme,-1,Tue Jul 7 13:48:15 2015 UTC,I'm surprised that the vinegar damaged the threads. I would have expected finish damage but not that.   Did you try and run a die over the threads?   Do you have a picture of the threads?  Parkers are brass heads with nickel and chrome plating. I think you could salvage this depending on what the threads look like.
wicked_edge,3casl4,almightywhacko,2,Mon Jul 6 16:54:06 2015 UTC,"Zinc is dissolved by vinegar, especially if it were exposed for hours. That explains the thread damage. If the plating weren't perfectly intact, it wouldn't have protected the zinc from the vinegar. Plating doesn't survive well on threads where the act of screwing the handle on crushes or abrades the threads.  More reasons to stick with stainless steel, vintage, or aluminum parts. All of those could still have been damaged by this treatment, but zinc / zamak seems to me to be the worst. The conflict is, what do you recommend to people starting out that isn't zamak? I guess my recommendation would be vintage, but that clearly isn't suitable for all people."
wicked_edge,3casl4,nobodysawme,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:20:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly the problem isn't the razors, it is the people who abuse them by soaking them in acid or letting soap scum build up on them which breaks down their plating. I have several zinc DE razors that are almost a decade old and still in mint condition because I take care of my stuff."
wicked_edge,3casl4,Leisureguy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"Well, yes. Taking care of stuff is the way to be. But many don't (whether it's mistaken care like this or accidental drop damage, etc. ) I would still say that I have had abused vintage pieces that clean up despite plate loss and can be brought back more easily than something made of zinc.   This isn't just a bias I have for razors- I changed out zinc for a stainless steel tailpiece and bridge on a guitar as well. On a bass, I changed to brass saddles. I would agree it's a different application- (razors aren't under string tension and don't have to resonate sound) but I prefer not to use it."

wicked_edge,3cb74k,gruffguss,3,Mon Jul 6 15:42:41 2015 UTC,"The black handled one is a Gillette Techmatic.  The giant cartridge had a spool (or ""band"") of sharp shaving metal.

Many people consider this to be the worst razor design ever.  Of course, I have also found one person online who loves these things.

I imagine acrylic chips off a lot nicer than wood because of the material's consistency so that's probably why you've noticed a difference. There are tons of other influences like the sharpness and angle of your cutting edge as well as the relief angle. Could also be the rpm, either too fast or too slow.

wicked_edge,3cb8de,arbarnes,4,Tue Jul 7 03:16:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other posters that you can't use a honing steel to put an edge on a straight razor, but disagree that you'll seriously damage the razor if you try to use one. Of course it's easy to damage the edge if you don't know what you're doing and/or if you're careless, but simple contact with a honing steel won't necessarily cause problems.  As /u/commiecat correctly notes, a traditional butcher's steel does not remove metal. All it does is realign a deformed edge. But it's intended for use on much softer steels with much steeper bevels; a leather strop is the appropriate tool to realign the edge of a straight razor.  Lately most ""steels"" have ceramic or diamond abrasives and do actually sharpen an edge a little bit. But the hones I've seen are 1200 grit, which is only appropriate for setting a bevel on a straight razor. A progression of finer stones (eg, 4k, 8k, 12k) is required to create a shaving edge.  If you're looking for a low-cost alternative to a set of razor hones, consider using lapping film. Here is an article discussing the process."

They do have a Parker 26C and the new RazoRock Bamboozled RAKE which features a stainless-steel handle.  West Coast Shaving seems to have the Cadets in stock.  Ooops they say these are discontinued.  For a Canadian vendor, Fendrihan has a private-label open comb in stock.  They also carry the Merkur 15C  You could also check out the Maggard-labelled razors from MaggardRazors.com.  They're available in open-comb, and you could also buy a spare safety-bar head for variety.  Out of all of these, the Fendrihan-branded razor is probably closest to the JAWS (open comb, low price, Canadian vendor.)  But you might be interested in some of the other options too."

wicked_edge,3ca9uh,RichD94,2,Mon Jul 6 09:29:48 2015 UTC,"DE is cheaper. Requires very little to no maintenance. Is easier to learn how to shave with. And it doesn't really matter where you buy the razor.  Below in the quote is information about straight razors:   Check this post about starting with a straight razor. Also there's good information on an English shaving forum called TheShavingRoom, read the three part sticky post and the razor brands to avoid post.  There are no good pre-made SR kits. You have to make your own kit. Below is some places in Europe where you can get the razor:   Revisor. Some say they come shave-ready. Others say that they come almost shave-ready, needed few passes on a finishing stones. The website is kind of funky, you need to email them the product number of the razor you want. They sell vintage razors too. Theinvisibleedge. Another weird website that is somewhat hard to navigate. The razors should come shave-ready. I don't think that the pre-made kits are particularly good. And perhaps avoid the Thiers-Issard razors. Apparently TI has had some quality control issues. Basically take a look at the Dovo, and Böker razors. Ralf Aust. I haven't really followed if the users consider these as shave-ready or not from the ""factory"". Wacker. Same as above, and apparently communication through email can be poor due to language barrier. Just something I read on a forum, no personal experience. If you register to http://www.theshavingroom.co.uk/forum/, you can PM user UKRob. He has a photobucket album of vintage razors that are for sale.   For the strop, in Europe it's actually kind of hard to find a strop that is 3 inches wide, and has both the leather and the fabric strop. In my opinion the 3 inch strop is worth it, it would make it easier for you to strop. With the 2 inch strop you have to strop in an x-pattern to cover the length of the blade. I have heard good things about Westholme Razor Strops. I believe he operates through Facebook.  This video by Lynn Abrams on straight razor honing/refreshing is a good watch. Oh and note that honing stones need to be lapped before use.      In UK these shavelounge DE kits are pretty good value. Not sure if code ""SR10"" is still valid for a 10% discount. They have free shipping in the UK as well.  Just note that boar brushes have a break-in period, and that they need to be soaked before every use. This old post has general information about shaving brushes. It's missing the S-brush synthetic recommendation as the post is somewhat old and those brushes are somewhat new.  Also like most modern razors the Edwin Jagger is made out of zamak and won't withstand drops, etc. If you want a more durable DE razor you need to look into vintage Gillette razors (eBay, etc.). They were mostly made out of brass.  Another alternative kit for roughly the same amount would be:   Parker 24c razor. Omega 10065 boar brush. Or slightly more expensive synthetic Omega S10081. Palmolive shaving soap stick from your local supermarket. It should cost about £0.50. Palmolive shaving cream is another option. I don't live in UK but look into stores like ASDA, Tesco, Poundland, Sainsbury's, Morrisons etc. Blade sampler.   The razor matters. Different razors shave differently due to: blade gap, how much the blade is being bent, blade exposure, open comb, closed comb, slant, the overall geometry of the razor head...and so on.  I'd guess the average is 3-5 shaves per blade. But some people have gone to almost 100 shaves with one blade. Basically it depends on your skin, beard, razor, blade, technique, etc.  Shaving brush should last many years, maybe even decades.   Shaving soap lasts roughly 3-9 months. It depends on the soap. How big it is. How hard it is. How much the user loads the brush with soap. How many times a week the user shaves with the soap..."

You should definitely avoid pure/black badger brushes. I made the mistake of purchasing one when I started after hearing that silvertip badger brushes were the best, not realizing there were different grades of badger hair. Black badger brushes are too scratchy for my preference, and replacing it with an omega s significantly improved my shaves and reduced irritation."

Some people(mistakenly) assume that open combs are more aggressive, but this is not always the case. The razor /u/leisureguy recommended is an example of a mild open comb. One difference I do find between them is that my open comb razor(gillette old type) seems to handle longer hair better than a solid bar razor. If I have a few days of growth, I reach for that or my straight razor. This isn't to say that solid bar razors can't handle long hair, I just find it hasn't removed as much on the first pass. If you like the look of the 24c, go for it."

With a regular razor, head mass is helpful since the cut is with compressive force. Moreover, bakelite is brittle and somewhat fragile---but since it's also light, it might not break if dropped, but it's prone to breaking.  My own recommendation, given the price, is to go with the Parker 24C, a much sturdier razor that is also both quite comfortable and quite efficient. It's £1 more, but IMO is a much better buy."

wicked_edge,3ca002,ILikeLeptons,9,Mon Jul 6 07:03:42 2015 UTC,Too much pressure
wicked_edge,3ca002,IllegalMonk,3,Mon Jul 6 11:32:45 2015 UTC,This is the main cause of irritation when I shave poorly as well. It is VERY easy to accidentally use too much pressure.
wicked_edge,3ca002,brandon7s,2,Mon Jul 6 15:02:23 2015 UTC,"Usually it's either this, a very aggressive angle, especially with the SR, or trying to jump the gun to ATG too soon."
wicked_edge,3ca002,Gnomish8,2,Mon Jul 6 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"Too shallow an angle with a straight will not work; too deep generally won't irritate, it'll cut.   It's pretty easy to tell angles with a straight if it's well honed. It's also possible to never get good shaves and a lot of irritation if the honing is poor because you have to use additional pressure."
wicked_edge,3ca002,IllegalMonk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:33:42 2015 UTC,"If we're talking extremes, absolutely. Of course a 5° angle won't cut, but 20° will. Just the same, of course 40° is more likely to cut you, but ~35° will cause irritation. Of course, YMMV and all, and when you use those angles makes a difference, but there's grey ground that absolutely can cause a SR to cause a metric shit ton of irritation. Been there, done that.  Granted, yes, it's not only possible, but likely, it's the hone on the razor. But, to rule out technique with the information the OP gave (basically only getting bad shaves with both DE and SR) is silly. Especially since the same thing is happening with both a DE and a SR. Could it be both of them conspiring against him? Absolutely. I'd almost bet it was technique, though..."
wicked_edge,3ca002,Gnomish8,2,Mon Jul 6 15:38:28 2015 UTC,"Without knowing the gear specifically it's hard to say for sure. Could be the hone is poor or they damaged the edge stropping. Not sure how much irritation the middling angles can give, didn't experience that once I got a good hone. The razor sort of let's you know the angles to use by feel. Mild DEs tend to invite beginners to apply pressure rather than more passes as well.  I'm going to put my money on it being a pressure issue.   Maybe the poster can weigh on and we can get some closure :P"
wicked_edge,3ca002,IllegalMonk,2,Mon Jul 6 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"i suppose i need to use a lighter touch. i can get my arm incredibly smooth with no irritation, but with my face it is very different.  i don't get a very close shave though, i suppose that comes from practice then?"
wicked_edge,3ca002,Gnomish8,2,Mon Jul 6 17:01:53 2015 UTC,"Everything comes from practice. The hardest thing for people to adjust to, though, is pressure. With cartridges, we're almost trained to use a bit of pressure here, some more there, just to get a closer shave. With a SR or a DE, that's a sentence to razor-burn purgatory. Let the blade glide, don't use pressure. Imagine you have a really bad sunburn, but still have to shave. That's the pressure you're going for."
wicked_edge,3ca002,Gnomish8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:14:33 2015 UTC,"my problem is i don't get a good shave when i let it glide, does that mean my angle is too steep/shallow?"
wicked_edge,3ca002,xman1971,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:25:03 2015 UTC,"Usually too shallow if it's not cutting close enough. But, it could also be the blade needing honed. If it's the same with both a DE (and you've tried multiple blades) and a SR, I'd bet it's angle. For my SR, here's how I shave.  Obviously, you want good prep. Hot towel/shower, whatever, I usually just shave after a warm shower. Use good soaps/creams, etc... Most of this stuff, I'm assuming you know. If you don't, let me know and I can be more specific. I usually start out with a low angle WTG/XTG/ATG pass (I'd guess ~25°), and then a much more aggressively angled ""cleanup"" pass (another ATG pass, but instead at ~35°, I've found that much more aggressive than this, it just slices your face instead of the hairs, but pressure is crucial at an angle that high). Getting that aggressive with a 2nd ATG pass allows BBS, but if I do it on my first ATG pass, I end up with some nasty razor burn. That said, that's only for my face. My neck is incredibly sensitive, so I settle for a DFS there instead of pushing for the BBS and suffering for it."
wicked_edge,3ca002,zaphod777,8,Mon Jul 6 17:34:28 2015 UTC,"Hey listen, it may be blasphemy for me to say this on this sub BUT if carts work well for you and the $$$ to buy them aren't a problem, then it's perfectly OK to keep shaving with them. They are quick and give a passable shave for many and you may be one of those people. My advice though? If you do stay with carts, DO keep using a brush and shaving soaps or creams. I really do think that either of those is far better than smearing the canned propellant stuff on your face."
wicked_edge,3ca002,Leisureguy,3,Mon Jul 6 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"What type of razor, brush, soap, and aftershave are you using?   First map out the grain of your face. Start by shaving with the grain, then across the grain, and if you need it against the grain but maybe after you have gotten more practice.  Also make sure that you are not using pressure, just use the weight of the razor. Second try adjusting the angle of the razor until it cuts well rather than dragging on the skin. Try a variety of razor blades to find the right one for you and your razor (http://tryablade.com)."
wicked_edge,3ca002,arbarnes,2,Mon Jul 6 07:24:57 2015 UTC,You really don't give enough information.  What is your prep like? Are you using canned foam? or true lather? What razor are you using? Have you done any blade exploration.  Take a look at the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make when switching to a DE razor and see if any of those are relevant.
wicked_edge,3ca002,repete66219,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:39:33 2015 UTC,"Pick one tool and learn how to use it. A safety razor is easier than a straight, so that's probably the way to go.  Expect there to be a learning curve. A DE razor requires you to find the correct blade angle and use minimal pressure. Get either of these things wrong and you're going to have irritation. You're also more likely to get irritated if your lather is less than perfect - again, it's a skill you need to learn.  If you stick with it, pay attention to what you're doing, and commit to mastering the technique involved, you should be able to get close  comfortable shaves. (This assumes that you have acceptable equipment.) It's just going to take some practice."
wicked_edge,3ca002,GeneralKinetics,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"As others have stated, too much pressure may be the culprit, but nothing bothers my skin more than a poor lather.  Some of the soaps can be finicky."
wicked_edge,3c9r0d,beanbusbay,6,Mon Jul 6 05:12:13 2015 UTC,"That's a known common failing with that razor (and one reason that my standard recommendation switched from the 34C to the Edwin Jagger DE8x series and later to the Parker 24C, which is more comfortable and efficient than either and costs $29). Contact your dealer and request a replacement: it's a defective razor."
wicked_edge,3c9r0d,Leisureguy,2,Mon Jul 6 13:41:07 2015 UTC,"Some razors suffer from this, some don't. If you google something like ""razor blade alignment"", or ""Merkur blade alignment"" you will get some search results. You have to manually align the blade with your fingers before you tighten the razor."
wicked_edge,3c9r0d,Papander,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:59:12 2015 UTC,"When you load the blade, are you setting it directly in the center of the head? It may seem tight, but several thousands to one direction or the other can make a big difference in blade exposure, blade angle etc also, the tolerances aren't very tight to begin with. That's my theory at least for your issue. I'm sure someone else may have more advice."
wicked_edge,3c9r0d,crexor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:00:27 2015 UTC,Interesting..I just drop it in and assume it's as centered as its gonna be. Tomorrow when I shave my head again I will drop a new blade in and take note. Thanks!

As far as the example you provided is concerned, I see this as a design flaw and I would hope most would agree: A blade should be placed into a designed matrix and there should be absolutely no need for adjustment.   I also understand that ""lower quality"" razors also can suffer from this disease, but again....... No one should have to worry about or adjust the blade prior to closing up the head. This should be of the most importance to any razor manufacturer.  Peace, Papander!"

wicked_edge,3c8ry9,zaf1864,5,Sun Jul 5 23:34:08 2015 UTC,"If it's a sentimental item, which I'm guessing it is, you could probably use epoxy / JB weld plus a 10-32 / 5mm tap to fix it, and that can be done without too much time/effort. If you really wanted to get fancy and have access to a drill press or a machine shop, you could get an M5 sized helicoil and then drill out the handle and insert the helicoil.  Alternately, you can buy a replacement NEW OC on ebay, but that wouldn't be as much fun or give you the same sense of accomplishment."

wicked_edge,3c81wx,drivenlegend,3,Sun Jul 5 20:52:18 2015 UTC,Yes it is an excellent razor. If you've ever shaved with a Rocket 500 or any other aristocrat it provides a very similar shave. I love the shave it gives and it's been one of my favorite razors. I actually just had it replated in Rose gold and I haven't used another razor in weeks.
wicked_edge,3c81wx,Three_Fifty,2,Mon Jul 6 12:19:57 2015 UTC,Ermagerd... you did it in rose gold? I'm gonna need to see that.

I will say that a Gillette Tech with a Feather blade is for me very comfortable and also very efficient, much like the Parker 24C. And if you put that head on a heavy handle, it's even nicer."
wicked_edge,3c81wx,Leisureguy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:45:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was made in England.  A Tech is a three piece razor though, right? On your blog I see you have some experience with Gillette twist-to-open razors - how would you compare them to the Parker?"
wicked_edge,3c81wx,Leisureguy,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Tech is a three-piece razor. That in fact is how you are able to swap handles, a significant advantage of the three-piece design. (With TTO razors, you of course cannot use a different handle.)  I find the Parker 24C more efficient and comfortable than the three Gillette adjustables (Fat Boy, Slim Handle, and Super Adjustable), but the adjustables are quite good and many like them a lot. There's a certain amount of YMMV in razors; for me, the 24C does feel and perform a little better.  With any new razor it will be necessary to do some renewed blade exploration: a brand that's best in one razor may not be best (or even good) in another."
wicked_edge,3c81wx,roasted_peanus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:17:47 2015 UTC,Thank you for the response.  One more question - on the first picture I noticed the doors of the razor do not open symmetrically. Could it be a sign of any problems or damage to the razor?
wicked_edge,3c81wx,roasted_peanus,3,Mon Jul 6 08:26:03 2015 UTC,"that's a sign that one or more of the endcaps holding the doors is bent in slightly, which is very easy to fix. more info here: http://badgerandblade.com/vb/showthread.php/148656-Lazy-door (my advice, don't do anything to it if you're not confident. it does not affect how the blade is held by the razor)  i tend to think that these old british gillettes, especially these rocket family razors, are some of the best razors ever made. check out this post: http://theshaveden.com/forums/threads/gillette-rocket-the-refined-de.8590/  unless the price is unreasonable, there's absolutely no reason not to get one when you have the chance."

wicked_edge,3c81wx,merepekking,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:41:14 2015 UTC,$15? You can easily resell it for at least 5 times that. this is a no brainer.
wicked_edge,3c81wx,almightywhacko,2,Mon Jul 6 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"It depends on how severe the problem is. If one door just lags slightly behind the other, and both open fully, it's not likely to be a problem. If one door won't open fully, that would not be convenient. But the real test is to use it for a shave. If it feels good and performs well, then there is no serious problem. (Three-piece razors do not, of course, have this sort of problem. The three-piece design is generally quite robust.)"
wicked_edge,3c81wx,almightywhacko,2,Mon Jul 6 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"It is not a Super Speed. It is an Aristocrat. I have heard they provide wonderful shaves but I don't own one so I can't verify it. I say if you find it within your price range, go for it.  Edit: Link for more info"

Everything in the gift shop is pretty over priced but you can get a haircut and a shave which will be one of a kind.   $40 for a hair cut and $40 for a shave but you get a beer or a glass of Jameson.   I live in New Orleans and have visited the shop but never personally gotten a shave or haircut.   My brother in law had a shave and haircut from them. He said it's definitely something I need to try at least once. We had a few drinks that day but he also told me his shave was with a cartridge razor. I did feel his face and it was extremely smooth.   He could have been mistaken about the shave but before you spend the money you may want to ask what they use to shave. Besides the cartridges they do the whole barber shave process (warm towels on your face etc...)

wicked_edge,3c6ki2,arbarnes,2,Sun Jul 5 13:36:52 2015 UTC,"Every ""Bluebeards Revenge"" brush I've seen has been pure badger, and the one I was able to examine closely had clipped bristles. It was really pretty bad; I certainly wouldn't want it anywhere near my face. Everything else you're using is high quality, so if you're using a pure badger brush, that's the obvious candidate for replacement.  (Of course, as others have noted, you should sample a variety of different blades if you haven't already. But that's not a matter of upgrading so much as fine tuning. Tryablade.com is your friend.)"

wicked_edge,3c6npb,Muffinsteeze,7,Sun Jul 5 10:00:13 2015 UTC,"No.   The reason that it is recommended to shave in a certain way is to avoid irritation (razor burn, ingrown hairs, razor bumps). But if you don't get irritation then it doesn't matter how you shave.   The only way to cause any permanent changes by shaving would be to shave so badly that it causes scarring. Which is not very easy thing to do."
wicked_edge,3c6npb,Papander,-1,Sun Jul 5 10:44:49 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true. If you got razor burn you may catch an infection, which might have any of the symptoms that infections might cause (including death). So keep your bathroom and equipment clean!"
wicked_edge,3c6npb,emilvikstrom,19,Sun Jul 5 11:28:35 2015 UTC,"As a physician, I call that far fetched, if not fear mongering. Razor burn is a very superficial erosion that easily and quickly heals even without any treatment.  One may construct circumstances under which a person might be more prone to an infection, like immunosuppressive treatment, but even these people shave routinely without problems.  That doesn't mean that basic hygiene isn't a good thing, but I see a lot of germaphobes here going amok with completely unnecessary disinfection routines."

wicked_edge,3c6npb,emilvikstrom,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:06:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting this! As one of those germaphobe-types I do already know this but it's still reassuring to read every once in a while.
wicked_edge,3c6npb,FlyingDiLasso,3,Sun Jul 5 19:57:49 2015 UTC,"There's no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to shave, and short of slicing yourself open you're not going to do any permanent damage. The conventional wet shave (moisturize first, build a lather, shave with multiple passes) is the easiest way for most people to get the closest, most comfortable shave possible.   So give it a try - you might find that it works a lot better for you. But so long as you're satisfied with the shaves you're getting, you aren't doing anything wrong."
wicked_edge,3c6npb,arbarnes,3,Sun Jul 5 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"No permanent consequences, but I think it's important to experiment with different products and processes in order to discover your own preferences. For example, try getting an inexpensive brush (one of the regular size Omega S-Brushes would be good, but the pro sizes are not so pleasant, I find). MaggardRazors.sells these brushes and also samples of shaving soaps. Practice making a good lather, then use lather for 6-7 shaves, skip it for 6-7 shaves, and use it again for another 6-7 shaves. See which you prefer.  Generally speaking, the ATG (against the grain) pass is most pleasant and comfortable if the stubble is reduced as much as possible. Again, experiment. The most common shaving pattern is a pass WTG (with the grain), rinse, relather, a pass XTG (across the grain), rinse, relather, and a final pass ATG---but there's quite a variety. Again: experiment.  Finally, I recommend that once a month you try a new brand of blade. If it's better, switch to that as a regular brand; if it's not, continue with your regular brand for another month; then try another new brand. More blade details in this post.  The idea is to make the shave not only effective but also so enjoyable that you look forward to it each time.  Welcome."

I'm pasting my review here for the sake of /r/wicked_edge.   Move over Muhle R41 (2011), there's a new Beast in town, an his name is the iKon ShaveCraft Tech.  I received this razor yesterday in an exchange with /u/Leisureguy and couldn't wait to shave with it.  This razor has the largest blade exposure of an DE.  So, how did it shave?  Miserably!  Leisureguy wrote about it on his blog and pretty much hated it.  I was intrigued since I like aggressive razors.  This one is different - it doesn't glide.  No matter what angle I tried, it just wasn't a smooth and comfortable shave; it was grabby and unpleasant.  The last razor I had that was this bad for me was the Valet AutoStrop.  No cuts or weepers.  I broke with tradition and went with the alum block post shave.  Fire and brimstone!  I'll pull out this razor once in awhile in the hopes that I get more comfortable with it, but for now, this one will sit under the sink in the Tier 2 razor box, and won't make the starting line-up."

wicked_edge,3c48gm,Shadoscuro,11,Sat Jul 4 16:56:38 2015 UTC,"Full disassembly after each shave isn't terrible, it just has some potential problems. You're more likely to cut yourself and/or to dull the blade, and you're putting unnecessary wear on the threads (the only wear point on the razor).  Do not soak your razor in alcohol or anything else. If you want to swish the head in alcohol before setting it to dry, that's fine.  But the fact is that you shouldn't be getting a buildup of shave soap and cut hairs. You say you've ""got it down now"" in terms of your lather, but I'm not so sure. Lather should rinse away easily and take whatever stubble you've shaved with it. If it doesn't that tells me you aren't using enough water."
wicked_edge,3c48gm,arbarnes,2,Sat Jul 4 17:53:02 2015 UTC,Alright then I'll just try again with the lather. I thought if it was any more wet it'd just run off my brush lol. But okay thanks for the feedback on everything.
wicked_edge,3c48gm,arbarnes,5,Sat Jul 4 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"Here's what I like to do with any new soap. Load the brush, then start building lather in your off palm. Start with a relatively dry brush and add water very gradually, paying attention to how the lather feels. A good soap will go from dry and sticky to slightly slippery to slick and cushiony the wetter it gets. But don't stop there. Keep gradually adding water until the slickness goes away and the lather falls apart.  You might be surprised at how much water your soap will hold. You might even be surprised at how much it requires before it reaches maximum slickness. And you'll have a good sense whether the soap you're using is particular about how much water it needs or whether it has a big sweet spot.  Here's a video of /u/mantic59 taking a soap through its paces, although he uses a bowl. I prefer palm-lathering for the additional tactile feedback. And because I don't keep a bowl in the bathroom."
wicked_edge,3c48gm,perthfan,3,Sat Jul 4 20:09:50 2015 UTC,"oh man, based on this video I think my lathers have been too watery, which is interesting because I haven't been adding much water.   I'll have to play around with it some more."
wicked_edge,3c48gm,arbarnes,3,Sat Jul 4 21:12:12 2015 UTC,Go by feel more than look. You want it to be as slick as possible.

You don't (or at least I don't) get that kind of irritation with a Standard razor unless you're pushing too hard. Back off and let the razor do the work.

This is how it looked straight out of the box.  Now, granted, at the right angle, they're not visible, but I expected a perfect finish especially given how much they belabored the longer processing time to account for finish inspection, etc.  If this is what I should expect, then so be it.

I still haven't heard anyone who actually has the mirror finish chime in and say that's normal or not.  This is just like polishing swirls on a black car done by someone who doesn't know what their doing. In some angles, it looks great, while in the right (or wrong light) all the swirls in the clear coat show up and look terrible.

This is something that can be fixed easily with some time, very fine sandpaper and lapping film....so if for some reason Mongoose doesn't come through for you, at least you have other options.

I have a solid bar on order, though, so we'll see if that's a bit more my speed.  The blade is held in such a way that it doesn't chatter, similar to the operation of a slant. It's got these neat little posts that make it easy to align and keep it from going anywhere. The head is slim and very nimble, and has about the smoothest threading action I've ever felt on a razor.

It should hold enough lather for 5 or 6 passes easily.  Here's how I make lather, and I recommend that you make a series of practice lathers using the technique to gain experience quickly. Play with brush speed, brush pressure (firm is good), and how long you continue loading once you see microscopic bubbles. But do try the exact procedure before trying modifications."

I am a face latherer as well. You just need light pressure and more swirls on the puck. If you like, you can bloom a hard soap by letting a skin of water sit on it for a few min before loading."

The bowl is not the problem, everyone that sells textured bowls is basically selling snake oil.  Think of making lather like making whipped cream or merengue, a mixing bowl for a stand mixer is not textured.  Yet you can still whip air in.  That's all lather is, a combination of air, soap, and water.  The more water you can whip in without destroying the lather the more slick it will be.  There is of course a tipping point with any soap, and you should experiment to find it."
wicked_edge,3c1yjk,CommanderNightHawk,5,Sat Jul 4 00:36:21 2015 UTC,"In terms of result the answer is an emphatic NO. You can get completely smooth with either method.   First off, you'll need a soap and a brush. Boar or synthetic if you want to start off cheaply. It'll run you about $30 for a boar or Fine Accoutrements Angel Hair Synthetic with an artisan soap (Barrister and Mann, Mickey Lee Soapworks, Dapper Dragon, ChiseledFace, WhollyKaw, etc.).  Secondly, a DE razor can be as cheap as $25 for a Parker 24C. Blades are dirt cheap, experiment by ordering from Tryablade.com. You'll get easy, cheap and happy shaves.   Thirdly, a straight razor is more expensive and, for some, more rewarding. It'll take a while to learn, but remember to use no pressure and make sure it's well honed and you won't do any damage. You can start out with just one With the Grain pass and then add more passes. You'll need to strop the razor on leather before use. Oil the blade after use to prevent rust.   Fourthly, don't go with WhippedDog. I've bought 100+ razors and all of the best shave-ready razors have been from shave_bazaar. You can't go wrong with /u/Roctraitor or /u/RVMaster. WhippedDog honing is to a low (and rather uncomfortable grit). They're also ugly as sin and some have dangerous imperfections.   Fifth. Honing. Don't buy a full set of hones, you won't need them and they're expensive. Buy a 10k+ stone for refreshing an edge, which is a simple procedure. Pretty straightforward. If you damage the edge and initially you'll need a professional hone."
wicked_edge,3c1yjk,IllegalMonk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:22:58 2015 UTC,How often do you need to replace blades on a DE? GHow often do you need to hone an SR?
wicked_edge,3c1yjk,IllegalMonk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:39:47 2015 UTC,Depends on your hair and technique. As a beginner every 3-5 shaves as a general rule.  Hone two times a year approximately if you apply pastes to the backside of your strop. Pastes like Chromium Oxide delay time between honings by refining the edge.   Use the pastes when the blade starts to tug your hair instead of slicing through.
wicked_edge,3c1yjk,IllegalMonk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:44:38 2015 UTC,Would you recommend DEs or SRs to a beginner?  How much do 10k grit stones cost?
wicked_edge,3c1yjk,themadnun,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:55:02 2015 UTC,"Depends what you want. If you're looking for a straight then get it, but if you're looking for a cheap and practical shaving solution then go DE.   High grit stones can be $40-$100 and much higher."
wicked_edge,3c1yjk,maddozzy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:05:05 2015 UTC,"Naniwa Pro 10k is £144 ($224). You can also get a £62 ($97) Naniwa Specialty stone, but it's thinner so won't last as long. Though frankly, if you're using it twice a year you'd probably not manage to wear the Specialty down.  edit fun factoid - there is no regulation/standardisation on Japanese waterstones above a certain point, I believe it is either 8k or 10k, and after that you've just got to trust the company you're buying from that they actually are supplying you a proper stone, that's why I picked out a Naniwa - reliable. You would probably be able to find a 10k+ cheaper but unless it's a reputable company, you might not actually receive what you pay for."

wicked_edge,3c1yjk,Ruff_Dog,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:12:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, why not?   I'm a pretty new guy to wet shaving, but I can offer you some tips from what I've read and all that and via talking to other wet shavers on here.    I went from a cartridge razor and canned foam (both Gillette's) to the poorly done straight razor (see one of my other comments, I made a thread about it...) and canned foam.  I then returned the straight razor, went back to cartridge.  Then recently, I bought a shavette and used DE blades with canned foam.  As of a couple days, my brush and cream came and I love them.  I can shave pretty much every day.  And after a couple shaves with that, I purchased a straight from Roc.  He's the man.  It should come Monday or Tuesday.    So.. why not start with a straight?  More power to you.  But, be ware, that you might want to have a cartridge or DE on hand IF you don't feel comfortable shaving a part of your face/neck.  Also, try and do it with both hands (right hand shaves right side, left hand pulls the skin taut.  Reverse for the left side of face).  Some people recommend starting out with only shaving the cheeks of the face, and getting comfortable with that.   I went all in with the shavette and straight (though, I returned it, but I'll continue when my new one comes).  I did everything -- face and neck -- WTG, XTG, XTG, and ATG.  Go for it, if you want to.  But, I'd recommend, if you don't already, getting a brush and soap/cream also.  It makes life more fun.  People will recommend you certain brushes or whatever.  I can show you what I got, though."

wicked_edge,3c0wqb,KillerPenguinz,5,Fri Jul 3 19:46:58 2015 UTC,"I will second this. Actually, you're probably causing more irritation because the shave itself is a physical exfoliation. A scrub will exfoliate you skin, getting rid of dead skin and exposing new skin. When you put a shave on top of that, you are just agitating the skin and potentially causing harm to it.  Additionally, putting the DE in boiling water might not be the best thing. I'm not sure what your goal is, OP, by doing that, but dousing the DE in alcohol will keep it nice in clean, too. I lightly douse mine before and after a shave.   Lastly, with the ""several passes,"" be sure to rinse and lather up in between each. Assure that the water isn't too hot (it doesn't need to be very hot; mildly warm water is just fine, as anything too hot will agitate the skin), rinse off, and then reapply your lather, but you shouldn't be taking more than two passes. As someone who has extremely sensitive skin why wont you ever clear up... , too many passes will just irritate it more and cause inflammation. You may not ever achieve the BBS, but you will look just fine."

wicked_edge,3c0wqb,cronycapitalist,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:24:10 2015 UTC,"My routine to prevent razor burn is the following:   use a sharp razor. I use a straight that is well honed, and I don't put it under water. Ever.  I wipe the cream off with a hand towel or paper towel. Proper stropping should remove any micro-residue that remains.  I don't use soap (regular soap or shaving soap) before or during my shave because it's removing oil from my skin and drying it out. The goal to preventing razor burn is to reduce friction, and removing oil from your face is counterproductive to that goal.  use a shaving cream with moisturizers and oils. I use St. James of London's Mandarin and Patchouli shave cream. I can't get it to lather worth a damn, but it does two things very well: keeps my skin moisturized, and smells great.  use a toner as an after-shave. I use Thayers Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera. It's alcohol free so it's not drying out my face post-shave. use vitamin e moisturizer"

wicked_edge,3c0y1m,wvva,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"I never see that type of discoloration on my classic Gillettes come off easily. Try a little (very little) Flitz on a rag.  Stroke the head of the razor across the cloth.  Stop frequently to check if it's working.  Brasso's for brass!  You're polishing nickel.  If the head turns copper-colored, the only recourse is to have the shaver replated.  I stick with nickel on replates.  The results are impressive.  Using polishing compounds and motorized tools will wreck that finish almost immediately. That nickel plating is thin, and has already seen a lot of wear.  For handles, I use Flitz and a toothbrush, alternating with Scrubbing Bubbles.  Brass brushes are overkill.  Oddly, the nickel plating at the base of those tiny pyramid-shaped handle grips on Gillette adjustables goes before plating on the tips.  That's why those old TTO handles almost always have a slight golden tint, even after careful cleaning.  Get a little 45X jewler's microscope.  The kind with built-in LED's.  They're not expensive."

I have hard water and have to load their soaps a little longer than normal, but once you get the water-to-swirling ratio down it's a really nice lather.  Work on your lather first and then start judging your shaves.  The razors come pre-sharpened properly and I believe they offer one or two free re-sharpening with new razors.  It's more likely that your technique is causing the dragging so let's work on that before we consider having the razor re-sharpened.  Have you used your strop yet?"

wicked_edge,3c06qz,Greyzer,2,Fri Jul 3 19:03:41 2015 UTC,"Okay I can give you some tips. I'd recommend watching the traditional shaving evangelist, he makes a really good lather every time.  Pre soak the brush for a couple of min and shake it two to three times. I'd also recommend putting some water on the soap to let it bloom and create an easier lather.  Load your brush for 10+ seconds until the bristles are all pasty and clump together.  Start lathering on your face and you'll probably have to add a bit of water. You don't want the lather to be thick and clumpy, you want it to be smooth but not runny.   If you follow those general steps you will have a nicer lather. It might a while until you get a perfect lather but everything takes time.  Now onto the straight razor. Stretch your skin always, and go with the grain. So you're going to want to map your beard growth. Especially with a straight take your time and be careful.  It'll be awkward for while but you'll build up your muscle memory over time.  If there's anything else you'd like to ask please do. We're all on the same journey along the path of traditional shaving."

wicked_edge,3bzvzp,GendoSC,6,Fri Jul 3 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"Shaving itself is probably the best exfoliating treatment available. Women everywhere are paying big bucks to get shaved - the people doing it call it ""dermaplaning"".   You state that you've been wet shaving for a month. How are your WTG and XTG passes going?  If you are irritation free, then your problems with ATG passes may be due to improper technique or sub par lather. If you are still getting some irritation from your first two passes, then forget the ATG for now and work on your technique and lather until you get smooth, irritation free shaves.   Smooth, irritation-free 3 pass shaves don't come automatically. It can take awhile for your skin and beard to become accustomed to DE shaving. Don't become obsessed with chasing the BBS shave. The idea with wet shaving is to help reduce skin issues and enjoy shaving. Relax, slow down, and enjoy the experience. It can be a great way to get away from the rush and hurry of life. Keep at it, and one day, it will all click."

The lather consistency got worst since i've started but i never shave when i feel the sleekness isn't there and rather add water or start again.

I have occasional dry skin around my mouth and I like The Body Shop's Body Butter for that.   Also, you don't say what soap or cream you use and some of those can contribute to dry skin. I suggest you give Barrister and Mann's Latha a try. It lathers quickly and easily, has lots of good skin care ingredients and at $10 for 4 oz. it's a great value.   Edit:  also, remember that during ATG passes, you're working at what can be awkward directions and a different grip on the razor. Be extra mindful of the razor angle - be sure that your angle of attack isn't becoming either too shallow or too steep."

wicked_edge,3bzxva,POTATOESNGRAVEE,3,Fri Jul 3 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"90% of honing a straight razor is setting a good bevel.  I would go back to your 3k and work that edge until it easily and effortlessly pops through forearm hair which is how I test my bevels, I don't do the thumbpad feel test or HHT.  A 3k stone is a bit too high to be a proper bevel setter but if you are only doing a single razor then it might not be worth investing in a 1k or 400 grit stone.  If you did want one though then look at the Naniwa SuperStone 1000 or 400, they are both pretty cheap.    As you seem to have found out, the new production Fromm razors are pretty low quality.  They say ""Made In Germany"" but my feeling is the blades are made in Pakistan and China and only the scales (handles) are attached in Germany which lets the company say ""Made In Germany"" when it's only assembled.    Your best bet might be to invest in a quality razor, like a restored vintage that comes pre-honed so it is shave-ready.  Then ask if it was honed with electrical tape along the spine or not and then you should have everything you need to maintain the edge yourself forever as long as you use the same amount of tape to match the bevel angle."
wicked_edge,3bzxva,goldragon,3,Fri Jul 3 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the advice.   I will probably pick up a 1k, I intend to have a few razors down the road.  I also am going to get a vintage honed as well.   I will let you know how the fromm turns out once I've reworked it on the stones."
wicked_edge,3bzxva,runninscared,2,Fri Jul 3 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"a few things....  a 6k stone isnt going to give a shave ready shave. sure you can shave off it, but you can also shave off a 1k. its just not going to give a comfortable smooth shave.  there are too many variables here. the HHT isnt end all be all and wont for sure tell you if the razor will shave well. or you could have actually done a decent job and you just arent used to SR's yet so your angle is off(common w/ the chin) but you said you use a shavette and if its just gliding through the chin area and you are using a shallow angle w/ the sr and its tugging like mad then its most likely your honing.  or you could have not properly stropped it( a common thing with beginners)   there are just too many factors here to be able to narrow it down. if i was you i would probably do 1 of 2 things: buy a shave ready razor from a reputable seller, someone known to put out a very good edge. it will come shave ready, dont strop it and give it a go. or 2. send that razor off and have it honed by a reputable honemeister. so you know how it should actually feel when honed properly.  also some food for thought, most people say an 8k can get it there. but that takes some skill. 10k is right around there. alot of guys will take an 8k-12k edge and tweak it with chromium oxide for that extra bit of keenness."
wicked_edge,3bzxva,runninscared,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.   I will do some more stropping with it tonight and try again to see if that's the issue.  I will try a bit of chromium oxide as well.   I have ordered a couple vintage razors in good condition that I am going to have professionally honed.  As you say that might give me a good benchmark? I want to use the razor I have now as my ""project razor"", for learning the art of honing, etc."
wicked_edge,3bzxva,BabyEatin_Dingo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:17:37 2015 UTC,"what i mean by improper stropping is maybe you rolled the edge. and any amount of stropping wont bring it back.  what i mean by that is. did you keep the strop taut and not use much pressure, just enough to keep the edge in contact with the strop? if it was loose or you used excessive pressure it will probably need to be rehoned. or if you turned the razor too early and it nicked/cut up the strop then the edge could have also been damaged.  as long as you keep the strop taut and use a light touch to begin with, you should be fine. if you already did that then it most likely needs to hit the stones."
wicked_edge,3bzxva,Phteven_j,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:26:28 2015 UTC,You're probably right...  I did nick the strop slightly at one point. I will have to take it back to the stones.  Practice makes perfect!?

wicked_edge,3byxt7,commiecat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:57:10 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty good.  Metal polish, e.g. Maas, Flitz, Simichrome, should clean it up pretty well and you can use it in the scales, too.  If you plan on shaving with it then send it out to a professional for proper sharpening.  Some great info on the maker here.  Eary 1900s American steel and should make a great shaver once cleaned and sharpened."
wicked_edge,3byxt7,sighere,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:06:36 2015 UTC,Use a buffing wheel with polishing compound.  Looks like it has pretty light hone wear and the blade is in good shape.  Get yourself a set of stones and a good strop and sharpen it yourself.  It's part of the experience.

wicked_edge,3c02fm,arbarnes,2,Fri Jul 3 17:07:18 2015 UTC,"Personal preference. I own one modern DE, one modern Feather shavette, a vintage straight, and 5 vintage gillette DEs. It really comes down to personal preference. I like the build quality and head geometry of the vintage gillettes, but some may not. Don't get one off of eBay unless you want a particular, hard to come by razor, as they tend to be( at least in my experience) overpriced. I haven't needed to spend more than $15 on a razor from an antique store. More than that and you are getting ripped off( unless it's an adjustable or a rare model). Look for a gillette superspeed or tech. Both are widely available and good, mild, beginner friendly shavers."

wicked_edge,3c02fm,almightywhacko,2,Fri Jul 3 18:48:55 2015 UTC,Everything is YMMV. I have vintage razors that I love and some I hate. Same goes for modern razors. Age doesn't matter.
wicked_edge,3c02fm,BuckeyeML,2,Fri Jul 3 22:06:56 2015 UTC,"Both have their advantages. Some will not use any secondhand razor because of hygienic concerns, so of course vintages razors (except NOS) are beyond the pale.   Some modern designs are quite wonderful, plus modern materials offer an improvement, but these tend to be expensive. And some modern razors resurrect vintage designs that may be quite difficult to find in the original---e.g., Phoenix Artisan's double-open-comb razor (the cap is also a comb design), which brings back (with some modifications) a vintage design now hard to find. The Stealth makes available a design much influenced by the Merkur bakelite slant, but unfortunately the Stealth itself is hard to find and the bakelite slant is now gone.  The epitome of a fine DE razor IMO is that it be both very comfortable and also very efficient. You can find that in vintage razors (a Gillette Tech with a Feather blade does it for me) and also in modern razors (the Parker 24C at $29 is the least costly razor with those characteristics)."
wicked_edge,3c02fm,Leisureguy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"I say both. Some shavers buy one set of good gear and save big money for the rest of their days. I applaud them, but I can't roll like that. Buying vintage is a relatively cheap way to experience different razors while you experiment to find your favorites, while many new razors are top designs and should also be experienced"

Do it in the shower with some canned shaving cream (I used some Nivea Men canned foam stuff. Just as long as it's not super shitty gel cream) and do it after you hydrate the area for ~5 minutes or so.  Treat it like a face with 4 quadrants. Top/bottom left, top/bottom right. Definitely pull the testicle hair as much as you can while you do that. Around/on the shaft, I find it's easier if you're erect when you do it since that will stretch the skin too."

There are harsh and unpleasant razors as well as comfortable and efficient razors with each type of guard. It's not the guard that determines a razor's feel and performance, but the overall head design.  I've been recommending the Parker 24C ($29) since I discovered how very comfortable and very efficient it is. The Parker 26C has the same head, but the black coating on the 26C's handle can chip.   Other razors as comfortable and efficient as the Parker 24C cost a little over twice as much, but you certainly can learn with an Edwin Jagger or Maggard Razor. I myself resumed DE shaving about a decade ago with a Merkur 34C, but the Merkur head has been superseded by newer designs."

Yes!  *lots of unruly thick lather*  SWIPE!  *a ""strip"" of clean soft smooth skin*  That's also the reason I don't find the Parker 24C all that impressive.  In fact, I find shaving with it a little messier than with other razors.  Each time I rinse that razor under running water, it seems to catch some water in it that trickles down along with lather, when I bring the razor to my face.  This happens despite what I think is plenty shaking-off after rinsing it.  Mildly annoying.  I don't find this happening with, say, my Maggard closed-comb."

What am I supposed to gather from this remark?  I shave with the blade too, as do several others.  And I have been doing so for about seventeen years now.  I have had excellent shaves from several razors.  The Parker 24C is a good razor, just not the best one for me.  I fully realize that you are very fond of this razor.  The original post in this thread of comments was referring to the few trails of lather that get left behind by OC razors.  Do you never have lather trails from your OC razors?  Is it not possible that people can find no-trails-left-behind satisfying?"

Those who find lather in the shaved portion of the razor's path apparently are not finding that the blade removes the lather. Certainly no criticism was meant or implied. I'm simply trying to understand what is observed.  In other words, I have not experienced lather left in the wake of shaving with any razor, bar guard or open comb, and was somewhat surprised to learn that some do. It is certainly possible that people can find no-trails-left-behind satisfying---were you really in doubt on that point? I do, but my point is that I get no trails left behind with an open comb, and was trying to figure out why. As I mentioned, I'll shave with the 24C on Tuesday just to observe again what happens, watching for lather trails left behind in case my memory is wrong.  I do understand that even with razors there is some YMMV, and that some indeed do not like the Parker 24C (or any other specific model)."

The News are the only vintage Gillette OCs that I have so far so I can't comment on the aggressiveness of say an Old Type. What I can say is that New is way less aggressive than my Fatip Piccolo which is also an OC. I also use a Red Tip Super Speed that is slightly more aggressive than a Flare Tip or Blue Tip. I guess it is also necessary to mention the Gillette adjustable razors, which, by design, are mild to aggressive.

The Merkur 34C is a very old design at this point---it was my standard recommendation a decade ago, but 5 years ago Edwin Jagger and Mühle came out with their new head design which superseded the Merkur Classic head they had been using (same head as on the 24C). The EJ/Mühle head is definitely more comfortable and efficient, but the Parker 24C takes it up another notch---plus the 24C is a very reasonable price: $29 most places.

I've been using it for about 4 months now, and I'm not having any problems with it (other than the time I tried Feather blades on my 37c and had 4-6 cuts along my jawline and neck).  Just get used to the idea of applying NO pressure while shaving. Let the weight of the handle do all the work. With that said, just get the razor whose appearance you like best or matches your budget, sample different blades, find one you like, stick with it, sample different soaps, find one you like, stick with it for a couple months, and then you can decide whether or not you want to buy another handle.  I'm by no means a wet shaving expert. That's what I did, and I haven't missed cartridge shaving. I now totally look forward to my shaves, and I'm saving a ton of money not buying cartridges."

I find the Maggard open-comb so mild, it is almost unusable.  All of this is with respect to a Feather blade, which seems to give me the best shaves in DEs.

I won't deny that vintage razors are excellent, I own too many of them to count, but I feel that this 'dislike' towards EJ is slowly becoming a circle jerk. They do products that are well liked such as their synthetic brushes and I know of people who use their creams/soaps."
wicked_edge,3c07ly,merepekking,13,Fri Jul 3 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"To answer your question: Edwin Jagger razors have a very nice head design and many find the aesthetics of their designs quite pleasing. And some, of course, will not even consider using any secondhand razor and thus must use new razors. I have quite a few Edwin Jagger razors; none have broken. I don't think they break so frequently as it seems to you, and with reasonable care they last for years and years.   But it seems as though you're not really asking with an eye to getting information."
wicked_edge,3c07ly,Leisureguy,5,Fri Jul 3 16:19:14 2015 UTC,"Would it not be better for someone who is starting to wet shave to just buy a vintage razor online or at a flea market   I don't think so. Someone who's just starting out would be better served acquiring practical shaving knowledge instead of learning about all the various vintage razors out there and how much they should cost before hitting the second-hand stores. Someone who doesn't educate himself (or herself) is liable to overpay or purchase a damaged razor.  While EJ razors aren't my favorite, they will also last pretty much forever with proper care. Just don't drop it and you'll probably be fine."
wicked_edge,3c07ly,arbarnes,6,Fri Jul 3 17:11:34 2015 UTC,"I am a recent convert to DE wet shaving and I have a EJ 89 razor and love it. I bought it before I found out about this wicked_edge forum on reddit. I got it off of Amazon after reading the reviews there. After seeing some broken razors here lately, it just reminds me to be careful and not to drop it."
wicked_edge,3c07ly,paulcool,5,Fri Jul 3 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first three responders, and to add: a person just starting in traditional shaving doesn't have a lot of hardware knowledge yet. Buying vintage, especially off eBay, is a gamble until you've done quite a bit of reading/learning.  Regarding EJ specifically: I haven't had another razor with as nice a level of finish as the EJ i started with. They're flawless."
wicked_edge,3c07ly,RuggerRigger,5,Fri Jul 3 16:55:45 2015 UTC,I have had 2 EJs for over 2 years. Neither have broken. Anecdotes and anecdotes.
wicked_edge,3c07ly,Richman777,5,Fri Jul 3 17:12:44 2015 UTC,"The EJ has great head geometry and is very pleasant to use. It has a known issue of the screw breaking off if you drop the razor, because the metal is a relatively brittle alloy. That's a price point trade-off, though--stainless steel razors are unavoidably more expensive to manufacture, and thus cost more.  I have to say, though, that today I would recommend one of Maggard's razors to someone starting out. Their V2 head is similar to the EJ's, equally comfortable, and they are a bit less expensive. I was able to get one of the colorful ones for my girlfriend, and it's all she uses now.  But as to your point about the vintage Gillettes, I do not recommend that people buy them for starting razors, because I find them to be lousy shavers. I have not tried every model of every Gillette or anything, but I have five or six different models, and I find it difficult to get a decent shave with any of them. It is cool to have the vintage razors and there is a certain amount of charm in using them. But if I need a good, no-fuss shave, I would take the EJ over a vintage Gillette any day."
wicked_edge,3c07ly,vambot5,3,Fri Jul 3 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"Edwin Jagger razors don't actually break more frequently than other pot-metal razors. You just see it more often because Edwin Jagger is one of the most popular brands of razor. In the past people used to post tons of broken Merkurs, but since Merkur has fallen from popularity you don't see it as often. I have also seen broken Maggard and RazoRock pot metal razors. The simple fact is that if you don't care for your gear it will wear out faster.   As for why people buy EJ razors? Because they delivery a very comfortable and efficient shave and they do so at an affordable price.  Many (but not all) vintage razors are great. However there is a limited supply of vintage razors, and I have seen prices for them steadily rise over the last few years. Also, the quality and condition of used razors varies quite a bit and a new shaver may not know what to look for to make sure they aren't getting damaged goods.   All of this is compounded by the fact that there are no really reputable retailers who sell good condition vintage razors at fair prices. There are a few people who sell restored vintage razors, but they sell them at prices that often rival modern new stainless steel razors."
wicked_edge,3c07ly,almightywhacko,3,Fri Jul 3 18:46:09 2015 UTC,"Some people don't like the idea of using a vintage razor - someone else has used it, someone else may have cut and bled on it, just the notion that even if it's cleaned and sterilized, it's not new to them is icky.  And that's OK.  EJ seems just fine for a lot of people. Yes, we've seen a couple of threads on breakage, and I have a hard time imagining breaking a vintage top cap. Even so, it comes down to the usual factors:  Is an EJ what a person wants? Is the price right? Is the shave pleasurable?  Then the EJ is the right answer. If you had one, liked it, broke it, and the price was right, you'd be just as likely to consider getting another, wouldn't you? (For me, it'd be 50/50 - If it was the right, desert-island-razor for me, I would, although I'd question myself after the breakage.)"

wicked_edge,3byp70,arbarnes,3,Fri Jul 3 06:32:52 2015 UTC,"It'll stop sucking after a dozen or so lathers, but I'm thinking it'll take 50+ before it really comes into its own. One possibility at the beginning is to make a practice lather with the Semogue every time you shave, but use your other brush for the actual shaving."

This could also help improve my shave soap lathering technique (which currently sucks bad).

wicked_edge,3byp70,russkhan,3,Fri Jul 3 18:52:30 2015 UTC,Loading from a sample container is a recipe for disappointment. It works better if you remove the sample from its small container and smash it across the bottom of a normal-sized one. I use small round food storage containers.

I do feel some scratchiness, but it's not really what I'd call uncomfortable or anything. I am looking forward to finding out what it's like after breaking in, but I don't mind what it is now."
wicked_edge,3byp70,Greyzer,2,Fri Jul 3 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't so much discomfort (although there is that) as inability to build and hold lather. Some boar brushes are completely unusable at first - my 1460 would just kill the lather no matter how long I loaded or how hard I whipped the suds. But larger brushes seem to work a little better out of the box than smaller ones, and while the 1800 isn't huge, it's still bigger than the 1460 and the 620."
wicked_edge,3byp70,drivenlegend,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:33:09 2015 UTC,"Oh! I thought I just sucked at making lather. I've been finding I need more soap or cream by the second or third pass lately, but I didn't think to connect it to the brush. I even switched soaps today to see if that helped. I'm a bit of a slow learner sometimes.   I think I will take up the method you recommended and just keep making practice lathers with the new brush while using another for my actual shave lather."

Though I'd recommend getting the nicer handle on the 620, the 1438 has the same knot for a few bucks less if you're looking to save money. Break in isn't bad, just do some test lather/drying cycle runs a couple times then go to town. It will continue to soften up for probably the first 10-15 uses?"

If it helps, my Semogue BC Cerda was usable after 2-3 test lathers. It started getting really soft tips at around the 10th use. It's probably still getting better but I can't imagine how it could."

wicked_edge,3by4kl,drivenlegend,3,Fri Jul 3 11:30:34 2015 UTC,"There's also Jlocke98's formula: 1/4 cup liquid Dr. Bronner's soap, any fragrance, and 2 tsp oil. Shake well before each use, and wash beard at the sink with about 1 tsp, rinsing partially with a splash and then applying lather. I keep mine in a pump bottle.   I've used emu oil, lanolin oil, olive oil, and jojoba oil; other oils guys have used are almond oil, frequently used in therapeutic massage, and grapeseed oil. Lanolin oil has a couple of potential drawbacks: some are allergic to it, and if you mix up a batch the lanolin oil clots over time (as does olive oil). (Jlocke98 mixes each application at the time: a couple of drops of lanolin oil in a small amount of Dr. Bronner's in his palm. I like to have it already mixed.)  I have settled on emu oil: it mixes well, and I like its therapeutic qualities. And now I make up larger batches for an 8-oz pump bottle, using the same proportions: 3/4 c Dr. Bronner's (I use Rose) and 2 Tbsp emu oil---that is, 1 oz of liquid soap + 1 tsp emu oil, which makes it easy to figure for any amount. Shake well before each application."
wicked_edge,3by4kl,Leisureguy,3,Fri Jul 3 13:06:54 2015 UTC,Well I heard about it from /u/Leisureguy and the original recipe was from /ujlocke98. LG and I have both tried different oils. He uses emu oil. I skipped olive oil because it doesn't slide well for massage. Grapeseed oil is used for massage so I tried that and stuck with it. Some local therapists use holly oil but I haven't run across it.   Anyway I have it pre-mixed in a bottle and wash my face with it just before I load my brush. Then I give a quick rinse of water and start my lathering and shaving.   I find I get a better shave with this. It also won't destroy Lather like pre-shave oil alone.   In a pinch I've added a few drops of pre-shave oil to bar soap lather.
wicked_edge,3by4kl,ACMEanvils,2,Fri Jul 3 13:40:18 2015 UTC,That actually helps quite a lot! I do generally enjoy using a pre shave oil of some sort but you're right a lot of them interfere with the lather. So I've taken to wiping most of it off before lathering anyway.

wicked_edge,3bwt3u,GeneralKinetics,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:16:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! I will have to keep that in mind next time. I think shaving against the grain on my neck and chin will help but I am not really comfortable with that yet.

wicked_edge,3bwt3u,Leisureguy,2,Thu Jul 2 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"Lather chin and upper and lower lip first on each pass, and shave them last on each pass.   Experiment (carefully) with the angle, both blade angle and the angle of the path with the grain. For example, on the XTG pass, right under my jawline on either side near the chin, I steepen the blade angle a little and also change the path from XTG (90º to the grain) to a kind of slanted path, halfway between XTG and ATG. (I didn't even realize for quite a while that I was doing this.)  With careful experimentation and close observation of what results, you will unconsciously adopt the most effective techniques, though conscious analysis is also good. But generally your unconscious works out a solution and just does it."
wicked_edge,3bwt3u,Leisureguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:26:34 2015 UTC,I really appreciate the help!! I guess I will just have to keep working on finding what works best. Is there a reason behind where and how I lather first?
wicked_edge,3bwt3u,arbarnes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"The reason is that lather makes the stubble easier to shave, and by lathering the toughest parts first and shaving them last in each pass, you give the lather more time to do its job. For much the same reason, you spend more time before the first pass working up the lather and working it into your stubble than you do before the 2nd and 3rd pass.  Here's how I make lather, and I recommend that you make a series of practice lathers using the technique to gain experience quickly. Play with brush speed, brush pressure (firm is good), and how long you continue loading once you see microscopic bubbles. But do try the exact procedure before trying modifications."
wicked_edge,3bwt3u,Cadinsor,2,Thu Jul 2 20:35:32 2015 UTC,I've found that the best way to judge blade angle is by the sound the razor makes as it shaves. It's pretty easy to get the angle right on the flats of your cheeks; if you can keep the razor singing as you go around the curves you'll be all set.
wicked_edge,3bw02a,retrobuddha,7,Thu Jul 2 16:38:16 2015 UTC,It's a nice razor. You'll have to have it honed though. There are guys on this sub who can do it for you.

wicked_edge,3bw02a,SmashBusters,4,Fri Jul 3 00:11:46 2015 UTC,I don't know for sure but most vintage razors have been sitting in a drawer for 20+ years. It's always a good idea to start with a well honed edge and maintain it with a strop. Most guys who have never used an SR don't know how sharp it should be.
wicked_edge,3bw02a,Nostradamus1,3,Fri Jul 3 00:23:41 2015 UTC,"That's the answer to a question I've always had. I've actually been wondering about that for a while now seeing as that is the automatic response for any new razor post. Now I'm wondering how sharp a razor should be. I inherited my razor from my grandfather (don't worry, he's still alive) and as far as I know he just sharpened it by himself using a stone (natural, no idea what kind, about the size of my palm) he also gave me. He showed me the basics and have been doing so ever since. There is no ""shaving culture"" here meaning no honemeisters so I just make do. It really does get me wondering.  Edit: here is the stone http://imgur.com/5UGu51o info is much appreciated"
wicked_edge,3bw02a,heybennyscrewyou,3,Fri Jul 3 15:31:37 2015 UTC,If you're a DIY guy there's this option. You can hone your razor using lapping film on a thick piece of glass or a granite or marble tile. I had no experience with razor honing and it worked like a charm. A strop is still necessary.        http://www.amazon.com/Zona-37-948-Polishing-11-Inch-Assortment/dp/B001BHGC7G/.        This video shows how: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dsp2u7L_WuY.

wicked_edge,3bw02a,PhilthyCasual,2,Thu Jul 2 17:23:33 2015 UTC,Is stropping something a guy could master on his own or is it more refined than that?
wicked_edge,3bw02a,IllegalMonk,3,Thu Jul 2 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"Stropping on leather is a requirement for straight razor shaving. About 30 passes before the shave. Pretty straightforward, but you'll need to go slow when starting out.  Honing is different, when a razor starts to tug you'll need to remove metal with a hone (whetstone). If you've had it professionally honed initially (highly recommend) then you can maintain the edge with just one 10000+ grit stone. The technique here is pretty simple too, but the precise number of strokes depends on the razor and the stone.  Honing from dull is challenging because setting a bevel (the most important part of honing bar none) can be tricky with some razors. Not to mention that a full set of stones can be very expensive!"

wicked_edge,3bwcj7,MyManifesto,3,Thu Jul 2 18:12:49 2015 UTC,"I can't tell the difference, and I've used both quite a bit. Of course, to some extent it depends on the slant. For me the Lutz (twisted blade) and the Mulcuto (no twist) are harsh; the ATT S1 (twisted blade) and the iKon Shavecraft #102 (no twist) are extremely comfortable and extremely efficient, as is the hard-to-get Stealth.

wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Wickatron,3,Thu Jul 2 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"A twisted slant does three things:   slants the blade roughly 4 degrees stiffens the blade through torsion presents a continuously changing cutting angle along the blade axis; steeper on the ""droopy"" side - see exaggerated pictorial   A tilted slant (AKA humpback) only does #1 above, and 4 degrees is not very much of a guillotine effect - see pictorial.  To simulate a 4 degree slant with no twist, take your regular razor, offset the handle about 1/4"" from vertical and see if that makes a difference for you."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,NeedsMoreMenthol,2,Thu Jul 2 19:09:12 2015 UTC,May be a stupid question - but how would you go about offsetting the handle? New to DE shaving so if you have an ELI5 how-to that would be appreciated. Thanks!
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,pudgycaveman,3,Thu Jul 2 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"There are no stupid questions. When shaving your cheeks, instead of pointing the handle straight down while pulling a vertical stroke, point the handle about 1 handle diameter forward or back.

wicked_edge,3bwcj7,NeedsMoreMenthol,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:11:34 2015 UTC,"You know, the asymmetry of the hump is not trivial. The blade is being bent more like half a cornucopia than half a cylinder. If you pay attention and make sure the full surface of the curved hump on the head is touching your face while you shave, the blade has a pretty different interaction with your face then it would if you just angle your regular razor."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Leisureguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:42:53 2015 UTC,Now that's a piece of information that I never knew. Does that mean that it's not just a tilted razor? Does the blade angle vary along the blade length?
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,aaronmil,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:18:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about blade angle, but it does seem that it might be a conical rather than cylindrical curve."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,NeedsMoreMenthol,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:23:09 2015 UTC,"By definition, if the radius of curvature is different at the two ends of the head, then the blade has to be exiting the cone at different angles at each end. The end result is not that different from the twisted slants, the difference being that there is no change in blade exposure along the length of the humpbacks, but there is with the twists."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Leisureguy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:47:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting! I never knew the curve profile was a cone; I always thought it was a cylinder. If this was common knowledge, I completely missed it.  My expectations of the #102's performance has completely changed as it's no longer just a tilted head."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,RuggerRigger,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:17:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting, and I see what you mean: the curve is sharper at the top of the hump than at the bottom, I think---or vice versa. But right, not a cylindrical curve. More a conical curve."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Nusquam-Humanitus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:22:24 2015 UTC,"Your best bet, if you're in the market for a slant more costly than the Mercur, is to buy a iKon 102. Some people really like them, and some have mentioned having some trouble. Either way the build quality is very good and the resale value is great. So if you manage to get one, you can resell if you don't like it.  Well, now that I've typed that I realize the same goes for any of the slants currently in production. The only modern slant that has a slight resale issue are the iKon slants with DLC costing (no longer produced) because the coating could chip.  So basically, buy a slant! They're great, you'll probably like it, and if you don't just sell it at /r/shave_bazaar."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Leisureguy,2,Thu Jul 2 18:30:29 2015 UTC,That's the razor i had my eye on and just wanted clarification about the differences. Thanks for the reply.
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Nusquam-Humanitus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for any humpback slants. I absolutely, 100% believe that twisting a blade changes it's behavior considerably, outside of the actual slanting itself. The blade becomes much more rigid, eliminating any flexing (chatter)."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Leisureguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if you try a #102 and a good twisted-blade slant (as I have in fact done), the difference is not detectable---certainly not to me. I've shaved with the #102 a lot (and the Walbusch, another non-twisted slant) and I've shaved with the 37C, the iKon stainless slants, the Stealth, and the ATT. I simply do not detect the difference you describe. I would encourage you to try an untwisted slant (the Walbusch or the #102) if you ever get a chance. Direct experience sometimes has surprises for expectations in the absence of experience, even when the expectations make sense. (Cf. my example of Aristotle's belief that heavier objects fall faster. When this was (finally, after 2000 years) subjected to experience, the experience was quite different from the expected behavior.)  In other words, your belief about how the blade's behavior changes has not been subjected to the test of experience with the razors themselves.  edit: omitted word"
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Nusquam-Humanitus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:34:02 2015 UTC,"It is true, that the ATT S2 head is the only slant head I have used, so my assessment seems hollow given my experience. That being said, I have read other opinions and reviews reflecting the idea that torqued blades reduce chatter and flexing. Blades that I have used in all of my others razors that didn't tickle my fancy, felt very nice in my S2 head. I based my previous opinion in this context. The actual slant may also play a significant part in this. The only problem: I don't think any manufacturer makes a torqued, non-slant. Why would you? I liken it to a thick/heavy blade, which I have come to enjoy very much: Merkur and Bolzano. I'm going out on a semi-limb by stating that thicker/heavier blades have less flexing/chatter. Or it certainly seems that way."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Leisureguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but at least some of those opinions and reviews are done by people who have not actually used the #102 (or Wahlbusch)---/u/NeedsMoreMenthol, for example. I am suggesting that, particularly with the YMMV nature of shaving, direct experience is much more reliable than expectations, particularly expectations shaped by those whose experience may turn out to be very different than your own. (Cf. reviews of razor blades.)  I can't quite picture a torqued non-slant. That would seem to require a blade whose edge is slanted wrt to the alignment cutout.   Certainly one of the claims made in favor of single-edge razors is that the steel is thicker (thus no requirement to bend the blade for the sake of rigidity). But I've not detected any flexing or chatter (and I do use SE razors from time to time, so I would perhaps note a difference if there were one).   I of course am limited by my own experience, but that experience has not found chatter or flexing to be a problem nor even present. Perhaps I tighten the razor more than those who detect the phenomenon. Are any particular razors mentioned as being prone to this problem? or is it a universal problem that affects all non-twisted DE razors?"
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Nusquam-Humanitus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:33:12 2015 UTC,"As far as flexing/chatter: The R41 head is probably the greatest culprit. The greater the blade exposure, the greater the level or potential level of chatter (flexing).  I would say chatter is not a universal problem, relegated to all razors. I would imagine there is a blade exposure limit to any potential for chatter."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Leisureguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting point. I didn't know about the R41 tendency to chatter because that razor is so uncomfortable for me that I didn't/don't use it much at all---it suddenly strikes me that the source of the discomfort might well be chatter---I didn't use it enough to be sure, but I did not like shaving with it at all. Maybe the razors I find very comfortable and very efficient have too little blade exposure for chatter to be a problem---but though would include the #102 (and the Standard and the #101 and the ATT R1 and the Feather AS-D1/2 and the Parker 24C and others). All of those see quite comfortable and efficient and of course none use a twisted blade."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Nusquam-Humanitus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:50:29 2015 UTC,I have an R41 Grande and I haven't used it well over 6 months. I have a decent selection of SS razors and it's highly unlikely I will use it any time soon. It is a beast of a razor. I would also state the ATT R2 head can also be a mean bastard. I absolutely have to be more blade selective with the R2 head. My iKon Deluxe OC's are accepting and very comfortable with almost any blade (relatively mild) along side my ATT S2 head.
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,NeedsMoreMenthol,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:31:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I decided that the R2 and S2 were just not for me, but the R1 and S1 have been extremely comfortable and very efficient from the gitgo."

It took a while to get mostly burn-free shaves. I purchased a Colossus S2 at a later date. The C-S2 was a breeze, given my prior experience with the R2 head. That being said, the R2 can still be a mean bastard and will always have that potential."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,NeedsMoreMenthol,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:45:14 2015 UTC,"There's so much chatter in my 2011 R41 that it's almost like shaving with no bottom plate. This is one razor where shimming has the net result of making it more comfortable because it stiffens and better supports the blade, thus reducing chatter. Yes, it also gets more aggressive due to the increased blade gap, but the gap is so large to begin with that the effect is negotiable.  The only way I can shave smoothly and comfortably with my R41 is using the shallowest angle possible. If I'm not paying attention and go a few degrees too steep, it's like a belt-sander loaded with 80 grit."
wicked_edge,3bwcj7,Leisureguy,2,Thu Jul 2 21:36:06 2015 UTC,Now I'm wondering whether that was the reason I had trouble with the iKon Tech. I'll be interested to hear what you think of it.

Once I found a good blade, great razor, figured out how to lather a good soap and nailed my technique I no longer bled much at all.  But good technique takes time.  That's part of the fun (and, to be honest, intimidation) of this hobby.  And it's best to view it as a hobby with a learning curve rather than a quick and easy swap for cartridge shaving.

Any time you want to adjust the razor, unlock the bottom knob first. You don't have to open the doors, just give it that quarter turn.)

Well, the point of a shavette for a beard in a barber shop is so that you can replace the blade every shave. I was under the impression that it's illegal 1 in the US and Canada to use a straight in a barber shop for the exact reason that the blade is not replaceable, and therefore a risk of blood borne disease transmission. The original point of a shavette was to cut hair, though; the first generation of shavette was never meant to touch a beard. Later shavettes, such as the feather, changed that.  1 After some (brief) research, it seems that it may or may not be illegal in the states on a federal or state-to-state basis. Similarly, in Canada, it's illegal to use unhygenic equipment in a barber shop, which I believe a fixed-blade straight counts as, due to the difficulty of cleaning them between clients, but IANAL."

This whole thing boils down to being absurdly careful with who you let hold a sharp blade against your face.  There are only 2 people, aside from myself that I'd trust to do that.  And those 2 live an ocean away.  So that pretty well narrows it down for me."

wicked_edge,3bsgbe,5t4k3,5,Thu Jul 2 05:07:07 2015 UTC,I believe it's due to hygienic reasons that they won't use a brush to apply the cream.

I thought this might be a way for me to spend less money on shaving, but it probably won't be since I'm sure I'll be buying soaps and brushes and all sorts of stuff.

Feathers are touted as the sharpest blades out there but can easily be tamed and balanced by a mild/moderate razor such as the Merkur 34C.   Yeah, they make shave creams in tubes, tubs, and pump jugs(Kiss My Face). With the Taylor of Old Bond Street in the tub, you can either spoon a bit out and put it on the brush or just swirl the brush a couple times on top of the cream. It takes very little Taylor of Old Bond Street cream to build up enough fabulous lather for 3 passes. The 150g tub should last you about half a year."

You are not the only one. I for one feel/felt like a lot of guys got screwed on the shaving front. I still believe a lot of guys in N. America have little to no idea about this ""world"".

wicked_edge,3bvrpo,Nusquam-Humanitus,2,Thu Jul 2 15:49:09 2015 UTC,"You know, I always think back to my first shave. I just went to the store, picked out some cartridge shaver and barbasol.   I remember when I saw my dad the next time, and he noticed I'd shaved. I was a semi-oblvious teenager, but I still recall him being disappointed he didn't get to teach me to shave. I never needed to learn - there was nothing to it with the carts and goo, but it just felt like something was lacking.  My father's father probably taught him to shave with a DE razor, but my father and I didn't have that experience. Practically speaking, that coming of age moment that is seemingly rendered unnecessary with the quadruple blade plastic stuff that gives you a foolproof shave, but at the price of any depth. There's nothing to teach; you slather the goo and go. But it is necessary, and I saw it in my father's disappointment: we missed something because of this.  If we have a boy (planning for it now), I will be gifting a razor to my son as a coming of age gift, and I will teach him how to use it. There is something to teach there that goes beyond just learning how to shave your face. You learn to groom like a man, and you learn to respect the process of doing something every day and doing it well. You learn to make an art of life, and that's something that's worth a hell of a lot more than a foolproof shave."
wicked_edge,3btj0p,120inna55,8,Thu Jul 2 00:53:47 2015 UTC,"Ghost Skulls Shaving Bowl by Nicole Pangas Ceramics  I almost exclusively bowl-lather.  Being a head and face shaver, I prefer to have a bowl for the extra volume.  Over the years, I've used various bowls from thrift shops and garage sale finds, but I've never actually owned a bowl that was intended be used for shaving.  In my experimenting with various vessels, I've defined some criteria that needs to be met, and they're pretty simple.  I need the sides to be relatively shallow so I don't ding up my brush handle should I get a little aggressive in my whipping up a lather.  The sides need to be designed such that lather won't easily creep over the sides.  It needs some form of ridges or texturing to facilitate lathering.  I need it to be easy to hold on to and for it to be an attractive piece because it's going to be in plain sight.  Finally, it needs to be thick to hold warmth.  I considered scuttles, but since I'm a shower shaver, I really needed a smaller footprint.  For months, I've perused eBay and Etsy along with the B/S/T.  There were some close calls in which I almost pulled the trigger, but I'm glad I waited.  On Etsy, I finally came across some very nice pieces by NicolePangasCeramics.  I won't go into all the offerings in her shop, but my list was narrowed down considerably.  She has a ""Ghost Skulls"" line that struck my zombie fanatic chord, but at least attempting to appear to be a grown man, I wanted to steer away from that line despite the coolness factor.  Then one bowl caught my eye.  Within the Ghost Skulls line I found one adorned with a more subdued version of the skull motif.  It stood out from the others in that instead of the skulls having a pale blue appearance, they were more grey and bled into the black base in a much more subtle fashion.  It's done in such a way, that you don't initially see the skulls, but then they catch your eye.  She provided excellent pictures in her Etsy shop, so I pulled the trigger for $40 plus shipping. I placed the order Saturday evening, and received it today (Wednesday).  The packaging could not have been more protective with rather dense wrapping with tissue paper followed by lots of bubble wrap and then peanuts.  All this was in their own box which was then mailed in a USPS box with additional packing.  I found no chips, rough spots, bubbles, or imperfections.  The glaze is uniform.  While it's clearly handmade, the handle doesn't reflect any irregularity, and the mouth is perfectly round.  The bottom has a faint ""Pangas"" signature impression before the glaze, and there are four evenly spaced patches left ""raw"" that effectively prevent it from slipping on nonporous surfaces.  The paint job and glaze look even better than her excellent pictures.  The 4 subtle ""ghost skulls"" are perfect.  The one thing that kept me from purchasing the Fine Accoutrements shaving bowl was that it looked beautiful hanging on a wall, but appeared a bit industrial when viewed from other angles. This bowl is attractive from all angles.   The inner diameter is 4-3/4"", and the inner height is 1-3/4"".  This does not vary from the description in her shop.  The dry weight of the bowl is 1.0 lb.  I can't effectively measure the thickness of the bowl due to the rounded nature, but it's much thicker than anything I've used before.  There is a moderately deep swirl in the bottom of the bowl and equally deep vertical ridges on the wall.  One attention to detail making it an effective lathering bowl is that while these ridges and swirls clearly facilitate turbulence, they have a fairly shallow crest.  As a result, the soap isn't trapped in these ridges.  She offers angled handles for left or right-handers as well as vertical handles.  Mine is vertical because this particular bowl wasn't available in an angled handle version.  However, she made the vertical handle large enough that it fits quite naturally and comfortably in my hand.  I proceeded to put my new bowl to work, so I washed it, then filled it with hot tap water and soaked my badger brush in it while I showered.  When I began to lather, I immediately realized what I'd been missing by not having a bowl with ridges.  Using a soap with which I'm familiar, I would say I managed to obtain a usable lather in about half the time.  Despite the absence of an appreciable lip around the top rim, the lather did not creep out of the bowl, and I use a rather large amount of lather for 3 head and face passes.  The warmth was maintained a little longer than usual.  I was probably nearing room temp on the third pass.  I couldn't be more pleased with this shaving bowl from NicolePangasCeramics.  I highly recommend it for it's perfect marriage of form and function.  If ghost skulls aren't your thing, she has a variety of other offerings."
wicked_edge,3btj0p,CheeseFantastico,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:53:54 2015 UTC,I have one too! From back when the handle loop was vertical instead of horizontal. I love it soooo much!! The shape of the bowl is perfect.

wicked_edge,3buaah,rickulous,3,Thu Jul 2 14:29:30 2015 UTC,"Dull is a very relative term.  Dull compared to what?  Yes, it was duller than a new blade, but I find after about 5-10 shaves, the blade reaches a buttery smooth state superior to a new blade. I actually hate using a new blade for those first few shaves.  This only works if you shave using a very shallow angle and have perfect technique.  Aggressive razors help too.  Your blade starts to feel dull after 4-6 shaves because you're using a steeper angle (more raking, less slicing).  Absolutely nothing wrong with that technique; many people (including my dad) prefer shaving that way.  Steep angle is not really compatible with blade longevity as it tend to dull a blade really fast. Bottom line is go with what works for you and gives you the most enjoyable shaves."
wicked_edge,3buaah,rickulous,6,Thu Jul 2 14:42:01 2015 UTC,"Why was I downvoted? Is this the wrong forum to talk about a blade I liked?

My face just loves 'em in every razor I've tried."
wicked_edge,3buaah,ACMEanvils,2,Thu Jul 2 07:01:46 2015 UTC,"I was considering trying Personna. But I got a little overwhelmed with the reviews, some people preferring the US versions, some preferring the foregin (Russian?), personna red, personna blue, it was just too confusing for me to try it! haha  Happy about the Wilkinsons. Can you give me any clarity on the difference between the Personnas? I just remember seeing a lot of people disagreeing about which is best.  As for Astra, my roommate and my little brother both like it. The price is really good, about 10 cents per blade IIRC. I just really had a bad shave, had razor bumps from it. I never get razor bumps. Tried it again and it just felt awful against my skin. And I got a nick. Gave up on it, went back to the blue bird to finish the shave and it felt way better. Night and day!  But maybe that's just my face/skin. Different strokes, different folks. Obviously I'm a little picky, considering most blades I've tried I didn't like very much, other than the blue bird and now Wilkinson."
wicked_edge,3buaah,zensunni66,2,Thu Jul 2 07:13:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert so I don't want to disseminate misinformation, but I'll give it a shot. From what I've read the Personna Red pack and Crystal Super's are made in Israel.  Crystal is a brand under which the Israeli Super+ blades are sold in the USA. Don't quote me on that bit, though, I've read different reports.   Both the Persona Blues are made in the United States, differentiated by the treatment of the blade after manufacturing. The Med Preps go through a further sterilization process than the Lab Blues because they're used in hospitals.   Some people can't tell a difference between the Lab Blues and the Med Prep's but to my face the Med Prep's are better.  I don't usually knick myself with a blade that doesn't agree with me, but I get razor burn so bad I have to take a few days off. Mostly on my neck.   I like Astra's well enough, but they're not in my top 3 as of yet. I need to try them out in a few different razors. Different strokes for different folks is exactly right. I'm still amazed that a blade that I think is near perfect would be considered trash to someone else. I think it's the most subjective part of wet shaving. You're the second person I've seen rave about Blue Birds, though. I wish I could give them a shot."
wicked_edge,3buaah,N0thinBett3r,2,Thu Jul 2 07:42:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the info!  Yeah, Blue Birds were amazing. I don't know what happened to them, they're just not available to reasonably purchase anywhere. I bought them on Amazon a couple years ago. They're made in Turkey, so maybe their exports were affected by all the civil unrest?   There's still places that sell them, but awful prices ($1 each here) or as part of a sampler pack with other blades.  That site says that Blue Birds were discontinued. :(  I'm only interested in buying in bulk, 50+ blades.  A couple years ago I bought 50 blades for about $10-$15 or so on Amazon."

wicked_edge,3bu8v2,fawkesmulder,2,Thu Jul 2 05:35:27 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I totally agree with you. I was rushing while I was shaving a few weeks ago, because I was running on short time to get to a suit and tie event. As I moved my DE razor to shave above my mouth, I nicked my nostil, taking off a bit of skin too. It would NOT stop bleeding! So I ended up doing one of the most painful things I've ever done. I ran the alum block under water, and then pinned it against the open wound, alternating with a paper towel with alcohol, and then going back to the alum. After about a minute of severe pain, the alum completely filled the cut and there was no more open bleeding. I made it on time to the event blood free.  But yeah, that sucked. Took me a couple weeks for my nose to completely heal.  Tough luck on the stitches."
wicked_edge,3bu8v2,HickorySplits,3,Thu Jul 2 05:19:18 2015 UTC,"When I saw the blood at first, I reached for the alum. Once I rinsed the wound clean with water though I could clearly see that it was a lost cause for any kind of home remedy."

These are usually the normal men's barber shops that appear to always be empty.   There also seems to be a direct correlation between how run down the place is with how good the guy is, also, if they don't speak a lick of english and looks like a character out of GoodFellas, it's probably going to be an amazing shave."

wicked_edge,3bruya,Hemingr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:02:29 2015 UTC,I've had some very good shaves that start with an electric. When you have a month of beard to contend with it helps.
wicked_edge,3bruya,Bongson,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:33:12 2015 UTC,I guess the point of the electric shaver is that it's  just less messy to deal with long hair when it's dry. Long beard shaves look badass on camera (especially with an SR) but it's a bit gross to deal with lumps of curly shaved hair covered in lather... think wife's hair in the shower drain kind of gross.

Eton College is a little too ""preppy"" for me, and the Sandalwood and The Saint James Collection smell a bit too grandpa-esque for my liking.

If I would have to guess, it may be one of the plant ingredients or the fragrance.  You could try a more simple aftershave like a splash. Simple splashes are just water, alcohol, fragrance, and menthol. Fine Aftershaves makes some good simple splashes. I'm also a fan of Folsom & Co.   It's a shame the Nivea balm does not work for you, it's one of my favorites. I prefer the soothing nature of balms. Have you tried the Dove Men's blams? Proraso may be another product to try. If you have senstive skin you may want to try Proraso White or Proraso Blue."
wicked_edge,3bt2r1,Its_Probably_Me,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:38:26 2015 UTC,By any chance are you using their active comfort version they released a couple of years ago before changing to this alcohol free formula? If so both me and my dad suffered a similar reaction to it but no problem with the other formula.  Also if anyone can make use of my remaining unopened bottle of this formula then if is yours for the price of shipping or I am happy to including it if you are buying any of my stuff in the bazaar.

wicked_edge,3btox6,TheCuriousDude,2,Thu Jul 2 01:45:57 2015 UTC,Based on the handle and not having a date code it looks to be a 1940's Super Speed Gillette.  http://mr-razor.com/Rasierer/One-Piece%20solid%20guard%20bar/1947%20Super-Speed%20with%20Speedpak.JPG
wicked_edge,3btox6,illiquidassets,2,Thu Jul 2 02:02:32 2015 UTC,That is a 1940's style Super Speed. Your particular razor was made between 1948-1950. The date code started on these models in 1951. The center rail that the blade drops down onto has notches at both ends. This feature started in 1948. I have one exactly like it. It's a great razor.
wicked_edge,3btox6,Old_Hiker,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:26:03 2015 UTC,"Gillette Superspeed, love them. Very mild razor so great fit for a beginner. You may find that you need a more efficient razor as your technique progresses, and you (like me) may not. It appears to not have a date code though I'm on mobile so the screen is tiny. If it doesn't have a date then it's an earlier model, pre-1950 iirc?    As far as the kit goes, only real suggestions I have would be that the Fine Synthetic is a really cool brush for the money, and get a blade sampler pack. Otherwise you'll want to try a few soaps and etc to find out what you like best. Of the soaps listed there I'd go with the Proraso green or the Maggard Limes and Bergamot."
wicked_edge,3btox6,drivenlegend,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:02:39 2015 UTC,It is a great razor. It's a Gillette Superspeed from the 40s or 50s. Here's some more info on the razor - http://badgerandblade.com/vb/showthread.php?t=4913. It's been around longer than you and will probably out live you so no need to replace it until RAD takes over.  Maggards is the way to go if you want to get other supplies. If your looking to start on a budget just pick up a cheap omega s brush (under $10) or if you can spend a little more get a Fine Angel Hair brush. They're only $20 and supposed to be great. For soaps it would be a good idea to buy some samples. I'd recommend getting a variety of different brands rather than a lot of different scents of the same brand. Each company performs differently and it's a good way to see what you like. The same case could be made for aftershave. There are so many great ones to choose from its hard to make a single recommendation. You'll also want to buy a sample pack of razors. They all work differently for different people so finding what's right for you is key. Enjoy!
wicked_edge,3btox6,Unclecrow,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:08:54 2015 UTC,"I think I'll get:   the Fine Angel Hair Synthetic Brush and the Maggard Razors Alum from the Starter Kit the Maggard Double Edge Razor Blade Sampler (50 blades) Nivea For Men For Sensitive Skin After Shave from my local Walmart   I don't think I can afford to buy several different brands of soaps, so I'll get all the DR Harris Shaving Cream Samples. For future reference, how do I tell the differences between different soap brands other than through smell?"
wicked_edge,3btox6,Leisureguy,2,Thu Jul 2 04:20:21 2015 UTC,"When you use the soaps, you'll notice differences in how easily they lather, how good the lather is, and (as you mention) the fragrance. The differences may well not be in the direction of differing quality, just different characteristics, and in using them your own preferences will gradually take shape. D.R. Harris shaving creams are good and their soaps are also excellent. Maggards sells a variety of artisanal soaps, all good, and you can also try samples of those.  Take care to avoid the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make when switching to a DE razor.    Welcome."
wicked_edge,3btox6,Unclecrow,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:13:33 2015 UTC,Mainly just in how they work. Some will lather easily for your water and some won't. Some might bother your skin while others won't. Some that are widely loved by many haven't worked well for me.  I often see people buy multiple samples from the same company rather than just single samples from a couple different companies. I can't imagine the cost differential is very significant. No matter what you decide to do you're in for a lot of fun.  PM me your address and I can send you a few samples of different soaps if you're interested.
wicked_edge,3btox6,uhgly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:14:45 2015 UTC,"in my research it looks like it might be an early 1950 superspeed.  because it says ""pkg"" instead of ""package"" it was after '49.  there are some v-3 date codes started with w-1 were more widespread  there were many different transition periods in this time, of course all this is moot if there is a date code we cant see"

wicked_edge,3bs0nt,NeedsMoreMenthol,2,Thu Jul 2 16:35:59 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a matter of time investment to be able to lather modern Williams - you just have to know to soak the crap out of it.
wicked_edge,3bs0nt,pudgycaveman,3,Wed Jul 1 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"Basically, you hit the nail on the head. I grated mine into an Old Spice mug, covered it with water, and let it sit for a few days till the water was absorbed.  It worked very well if used every day, but not so well if used once a week unless re-soaked."
wicked_edge,3bs0nt,maaneeack,2,Wed Jul 1 20:05:45 2015 UTC,"I seem to have had a somewhat opposite experience, at least with the ""new"" Williams soap.  I keep the puck bone-dry, wet the brush and shake off so much water as I can (until I don't hear any more water falling off when I shake the brush), and start loading the brush with it.  The moisture is enough to let the brush (boar) ""bite off"" soap into itself while not building a lather.  Then, I add a few drops water to the brush and take the brush to my face (I face-lather).  As I build the lather, I add a few drops of water, and at a sweet spot, I have good lather.  Any more water, and the lather quickly deteriorates into suds.  I feel this soap has a narrow window of soap-to-water ratio.  While the soap is hard when it is dry, the surface seems to become soft and slick with a small amount of water, enough to let a brush bite soap into it.  Too much water / blooming the soap has only ever rendered suds for me.  All that being said, I should also admit that I have used Williams some four times so far, with results getting better each time."
wicked_edge,3bs0nt,pudgycaveman,3,Wed Jul 1 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"I just dropped it in a large mug (soup mug) and soaked it for 15-20 mins while I showered, or before I shaved, when I was using it. A squirt of KMF unscented helps but isn't required. My problem is that it drys my skin out. I haven't used it in months, too many artisans on my shelves now."
wicked_edge,3bs0nt,maaneeack,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:52:18 2015 UTC,"It appears that everyone that has had success with Williams has soaked the soap.  I have not done that yet because soaking a soap seems like it would make a mess.  I will give soaking a shot today and see what difference it makes.  Fortunately, it does not dry my skin out."
wicked_edge,3bs0nt,pudgycaveman,2,Thu Jul 2 23:18:11 2015 UTC,"Soak it, soak the brush, dump the soap water in the sink, shake some water from the brush then load up."
wicked_edge,3bs0nt,maaneeack,2,Thu Jul 2 23:29:50 2015 UTC,"Soak it, soak the brush, dump the soap water in the sink, shake some water from the brush then load up.   Thank you so much for these pointers!  Just finished my shave!  I did as you advised, and good heavens, the soap exploded into thick cushioning lather!  There was noticeable improvement between today's lather and my previous lathers with this soap.  It was very easy to face-lather too!  I suppose the soaking allowed the surface to soften up, allowing me to load more product into the brush with greater ease.  With my earlier technique (loading a moist brush for longer starting from a dry puck), I guess I was doing the same thing but with more effort and spending more time.  I was hesitant to soak the soap itself because I felt I would end up with a gooey mess.  Not the case at all in reality!  Typically, when I try a new soap, especially something that I do not suspect will work right for me the first time itself, I switch to a ""safe"" razor and blade combination.  So, the last four shaves were with my Standard + GSB.  The shaves were great, no doubt, but I have had better.  Today's shave, however, easily ranks among my best shaves.  I used my Parker SR1 shavette with Pol Silver today, a blade I had never used before.  When I do such a ""risky"" thing, I switch to a ""safe"" soap (something that lathers quickly and stays stable for three passes).  Today, I decided to be a little adventurous, and used Williams.  It stood up to the challenge just fine: stable thick lather for four full passes.  I found that the lather was thicker and creamier for the second pass, after it had been sitting for a while in the brush.  Is this typical of this soap?  A little lather did dry up on my face here and there (a lot lesser than in my previous shaves with this soap though).  However, that was not all bad!  With a few drops of water, it made for an incredibly slick yet non-lather-y layer that I could use to shave really close with the shavette.  Williams is a winner for me all round.  Very unfortunate that it had to be discontinued.  Once again, thanks for the pointers!  EDIT: minor phrasing fix"

I should write a review of the First Canadian Shave Co. soaps one of these days.

To turn away other options in order to fully enjoy one item and gain the most out of it until there is nothing left.  This can refer to anything from electing to use one salad dressing until it is used up in lieu of opening up the other bottles in the fridge to referencing the idea of not starting any other books until you have finished the one you are busy with.  This term is used most often in traditional wet shaving forums where it references the use of one single shaving puck to completion before starting the next. This is a strategy most often employed by users who have accumulated so much stock of varying products that the daily choice of which item to use can become a burden and could detract from their ability to truly appreciate any single item.

The larger value, IMO, is that Williams is a gateway drug of sorts.  It's cheap enough to maybe get people to try it who might not otherwise go out and buy a luxury traditional shaving item.  I'm certain it got many men interested in learning about traditional shaving.    It also has a long history, and is a literal connection to the shaves of our fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers in the same way the Clubman or Old Spice are.

That, along with the ease of availability due to the internet helped people to realize that better choices were available. To the point that a 150 year old icon was killed off. Personally, I would have liked to see them revert to the old tallow formula, mount a decent advertising campaign and raise the price to $5 or so.

wicked_edge,3btls7,Wickatron,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I like slants.  Until the Stealth came alone, the iKon #102 Slant was my favorite.  The Stealth has surpassed the iKon for me.  There were 2 things going against the Stealth before I bought it.  For one, I usually hate light-weight razors, and two, I wasn't a big fan of the Baby Smooth.  The Stealth looks so much like a Baby Smooth except for, of course, the head.  This razor exceeded all my expectations, despite my preconceived ideas."
wicked_edge,3btls7,vtmax,2,Thu Jul 2 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. My only issue with the stealth is actually getting one without buying a used one on eBay for 120. I'll probably just ""settle""  for a 102 or merkur 37C."

wicked_edge,3bts8y,junderdawg,2,Thu Jul 2 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"It's perfectly safe to use a vintage straight, particularly one sold by the members of this subreddit. Just be aware that what you get will not be aesthetically perfect. Don't let that deter you. A vintage straight obtained from one of these guys will serve you well and will most likely last a lifetime. Also, don't break the bank on your first strop. You will nick and cut your first strop until you learn proper technique.   For cream/soap, I recommend Barrister and Mann Latha. It's ridiculously easy to lather, very slick, provides great cushion (both desirable qualities for straight razor shaving) and at $10 the price can't be beat for a top quality artisan shave soap.   Edit: The problem with buying a new straight razor is that a lot of places you buy from do not sell truly ""shave ready"" straight razors. They will come with a factory edge, which is not sufficiently honed. Trying to learn to shave with a straight that isn't properly honed can be frustrating, painful, and darned near impossible. And if you decide ultimately to purchase new, whatever you do, do not let someone who only sharpens knives hone your razor. Razor honing goes way beyond knife sharpening in both the skill set and the tools used. Learning to hone isn't terribly difficult, but like so many things, it is a learned skill and not every person who can sharpen knives has learned the skills necessary to hone razors."
wicked_edge,3bts8y,arbarnes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:42:51 2015 UTC,"As others have noted, a vintage straight will be better steel for less money.  When it comes to brushes, the Semogue 620 is a great for face lathering once it's broken in. But it really sucks at first, and damn if it doesn't take a long time to break in. Learning to shave with a straight when you have a brush that won't hold lather is going to be ... let's just say challenging. I recommend a good synthetic (eg, the Fine ""Angel Hair"" brush) to start with.  For lather, TOBS cream is good (I shaved with it this morning) but not great. Amazon reviews are meaningless; you can do better. If you want a mass-market product consider DR Harris, Mitchell's Wool Fat, or Pre de Provence (or even Tabac or Cella). There are at least a dozen artisan soapers that make great stuff too. I'm fond of LA Shaving Soap Co., Barrister & Mann, Mickey Lee Soapworks, Dapper Dragon, and Maggard Razors, but there are plenty of other good ones out there."
wicked_edge,3bts8y,arbarnes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'm looking into vintage razors now :) ill keep the 620 on order i have found a couple synthetic brushes dont know if these are reputable so any info would be nice, B101 Synthetic, Fine 20mm Angel Hair brush, Omega S-Brush, Perfecto Synthetic and Simpson Chubby Synthetic.  As for cream i was looking at DR Harris's Almond or Windsor are these good ones and worth the price? Thanks again for the help here!"
wicked_edge,3bts8y,IllegalMonk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about the B101 or the Perfecto, but if the Perfecto badger brush is any indication you want to steer clear. The Chubby synthetic was heavily hyped before its release but got a lot of negative reviews and has pretty much dropped off the radar. And it's really expensive. The Omega S-Brushes are a good choice if you stay away from the ""Pro"" series (S10049, S10083, and S10108). But of all those you mention, my choice would be the Fine ""Angel Hair."" Word is that it performs almost exactly like the Plisson L'Occitane brush, which is my favorite synthetic by a very wide margin.  I haven't ever used DR Harris cream, but the soap is a great performer. And it's triple-milled - much harder than most other shave soaps - so you use a lot less per shave, resulting in a per-shave cost that's very reasonable. Love the smell of Windsor, and the matching aftershave is great too."
wicked_edge,3bts8y,IllegalMonk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:07:06 2015 UTC,"If you go with that Semogue (and I'd say go for it) then you'll want to rub it vigorously and frequently on your palm to help the fibres split. Boars are difficult to lather with when they're not broken in.  Everyone is saying vintage, and I agree, but if you do go for a new razor I'd recommend Hart Steel (which is American made if that is a requirement for you) and will have better steel than Portland (I may or may not have read some criticisms of them, not sure, do your research definitely).  I wouldn't go with a TOBS cream, I'd try and get any other artisan soap. Dapper Dragon Signature or Barrister and Mann Lavanille are my favorite scents, but obviously scents are a personal feeling and everyone has an opinion. I can also recommend Ghost Town Barber or Sherlock from Chiseled Face Groomatorium if you're into a darker/more ""manly"" scent profile.  Let me know if you have questions. I do also think vintage is a safer bet for budgetary reasons, you can always upgrade later!!"

wicked_edge,3bsxau,thegigglepuss,4,Wed Jul 1 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"There are tons of options out there, but IMO it's hard to do better than this kit with a MR1 razor, Fine brush, and any of the Maggard soaps. $51.35 plus shipping."
wicked_edge,3bsxau,arbarnes,2,Wed Jul 1 22:10:18 2015 UTC,I second this. Wish I'd known about Maggards when I started out.
wicked_edge,3bsxau,jb270,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:05:38 2015 UTC,"I wish I had researched or asked a few more questions starting out. My first razor was too mild. My first soap was cheap trash that wouldn't lather without adding a blood sacrifice. My first brush shed worse than my cat. Now, I'm all Barrister & Mann, Maggards, Merkur, Fine Angel pubes that currently smells like Lavanille, and my face seems to have settled on Derby's.

Only to find that the vendor lists items that aren't provides terrible customer service, and flat-out lies to its customers.  I delete these listings as soon as I notice them, but that doesn't change the fact that the wiki is susceptible to abuse by shady vendors, and is actually abused by them.

wicked_edge,3bsxau,ihadabadidea,2,Thu Jul 2 00:51:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, in both cases you AREN'T getting what you pay for. These are both generic razors you can buy online for a fraction of the price; you can pick up a dent and scratch Maggard for less.  If you really want to go cheaper than that, a Lord L6 or a Weishi can be had for $10 or less: the former has a decent head and a crap handle, while the latter has a great handle and a so-so head.  Edit: Cannot English"
wicked_edge,3bsxau,--Edog--,2,Thu Jul 2 01:33:41 2015 UTC,+1 on Maggard dent and scratch razors ...i have a few. Wish I had started with one
wicked_edge,3bsxau,arbarnes,2,Thu Jul 2 13:40:45 2015 UTC,"The Microtouch One and Van der Hagen razors are cheap Chinese clones of the old Gillette Super Speed. They're not bad razors, although I find it hard to get a close shave with one. My main objection is the price - they're charging $20 for a razor that's readily available for $5 or so.  With razors there is little correlation between price and performance. You can actually get a pretty good razor for just over $2, or you can spend nearly 100 times as much for a pot metal razor that's liable to break if you drop it. The $200 razor is a lot prettier than the one that costs $2, but IMO the shave isn't appreciably better.  Ditto with brushes - that $20 Fine brush leaves plenty of $50-100 badger brushes in the dust. And blades - the most expensive blades I've ever seen (Merkur) are also the worst I've ever used. Although YMMV.  If you want a razor that's machined from stainless steel, then you're going to have to pay a lot for it. Ditto if you want a brush made with the softest, most resilient hair harvested from rare badgers high in the mountains of Manchuria. And it's true that by spending a lot you can reduce the odds that you'll end up with crap. But the smart money buys stuff that delivers high quality for a low price. Like the items in the kit I recommended - they aren't cheap, just inexpensive."
wicked_edge,3bsxau,nobodysawme,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:34:44 2015 UTC,"My concern here is, there's some variance between these Van Der Hagen and Micro Touch One razors in quality.  What do you spend on shaving supplies in a year for cartridge shaving? Suppose it was the Fusion Proglide, 8 bucks for the razor, and then 19.47 for a 4pack of cartridges. Suppose you stretch a cartridge to last a week, even though it begins to tug at your skin by the end of that week - that's 253.11, or 261.11 if you include the 8 for the razor.  Figure 100 Feather blades cost 24-ish bucks and many others are cheaper - (you shouldn't buy 100 at all, or at least until you've worked through a blade sampler) perhaps you can afford to spend a little on the razor itself.  Maybe a Parker 24, 26 or 91R would fit the bill here."

wicked_edge,3bsxau,nobodysawme,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:53:36 2015 UTC,This kit will do it! I would also buy a blade sample so you can try different blades.
wicked_edge,3bsxau,arfreeman11,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:43:54 2015 UTC,"Like many things in life, sometimes you do better by buying items separately than in a kit.   I like Standard Razors, but they're 45 on massdrop. Out of budget. I also like old gillette tech from eBay - usually around 15 dollars, and work well paired with a sharp blade. But these will only work for you if you can wrap your head around using something pre-owned.  Other good options are Parker razors."
wicked_edge,3bsxau,joshamania,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:07:49 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give is don't be in a hurry to get everything all at once. Spend a little more money on a slick soap and good brush and keep using whatever razor you have now. Save a little more and get a Gillette Slim from eBay for $30. Then you can dial in your shave. Get a variety pack of blades. They're cheap. Hell, my face likes derby blades and they're 5¢ a piece. Don't cheap out on the equipment. A good brush like Fine Angel Hair, a good razor, and a slick soap will get you a long way. Don't forget aftershave or balm. You'll need it."
wicked_edge,3btju7,SethCurryWithTheShot,2,Thu Jul 2 01:01:02 2015 UTC,If arko works from a shaving perspective for you then just get a good face lotion or balm to add moisture afterwards. You can also try a little jojoba oil in your lather or on your face after.
wicked_edge,3btju7,Wickatron,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:24:13 2015 UTC,I think balms and lotions make me break out so I stay away. I remember reading somewhere that people put in some glycerine with drying soaps?

Balms or aftershaves might have some weird ingredients that could irritate your face. I use thayers witch hazel right after and it's great and shouldn't make anyone break out unless you are allergic, plus a little face lotion. Glycerine will help bolster your lather but I don't know if it really adds moisture."

wicked_edge,3btju7,mattdoesntwearhat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:35:11 2015 UTC,Stop is about all I've used for a year or two now. Add olive oil. Just a few drops when you lather. Works like a charm. And a good balm.

wicked_edge,3btju7,GeneralKinetics,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:34:37 2015 UTC,"A had a similar experience with Arko. What I found I had to do was 3-fold.   Make certain you are using enough water in your lather. Arko is forgiving of water levels for shave performance, but will dry your skin more if it's dry. Rinse more carefully/thoroughly than with other soaps Still use a light balm rather than a splash."
wicked_edge,3btju7,Cadinsor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:28:07 2015 UTC,Just use a hair and beard oil or a face lotion after. Not a big deal.
wicked_edge,3btju7,Airrogant1947,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:32:41 2015 UTC,"Arko, even when you add more water, is generally pretty hard on the skin for many of us. You can of course try to create a lather from Arko and another cheap soap like Kiss My Face, but that does mean spending another few dollars.  The drying effect seems to be worsened if you are vigorously face lathering for all three passes, at least I found it so, because you are just working the soap into your skin and leaving it on for longer. One thing which worked a bit for me was to do a thorough cold water rinse at the end of the shave and immediately apply a good skin balm. See if that works for you.  Sometimes in life we have to part with the things we love, and this might be one of those times, my friend. If the soap simply does not work for you, pass it on to somebody else and then buy a limited quantity of something else. You could of course also go for one of the many fine soap samplers out there."
wicked_edge,3btju7,Airrogant1947,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:31:45 2015 UTC,What are you doing after you shave? Drying could be a sign of a poor post shave routine not adding the appropriate moisture back into your face.
wicked_edge,3btju7,mattdoesntwearhat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:06:14 2015 UTC,"Alum block (though I might hold that off for shaves using Arko) and then Imperial Barber after shave. I really liked the after shave so I stocked up on it, I'm not the biggest fan of balms and like I said above the nivea one really gave me a bad reaction. Edit: I should add my other soaps/creams don't dry my skin out."
wicked_edge,3bs7fl,eztarget896,4,Wed Jul 1 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"Use cool/cold water in lieu of hot/warm water during your shave: use cool water to prep, dry your face, apply lather built with cool water, then a cold splash after.  The reasoning is that cold water makes the whiskers more firm and thus easier to cut.  Not sure if that's scientifically sound but people have tried it out with mostly good results."
wicked_edge,3bs7fl,commiecat,4,Wed Jul 1 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right.  Simply replace warm water with cold in your regular shave routine.  For some people(like myself) it will help with irritation, but for many it won't.  As all things shaving, YMMV."
wicked_edge,3bs7fl,GreatMontgomeryScott,3,Wed Jul 1 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"1.You could soak the brush in cold water and it'll be ok? Cold water also doesnt seem to wash off the razor as much, should I just use warm water then soak the razor in cold water afterwards?"
wicked_edge,3bs7fl,commiecat,5,Wed Jul 1 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"Cold water won't affect the brush.  If anything it's more concerning to use water on the hot/boiling end in regards to damaging the brush.  There's no specific ""correct"" way to do it.  The premise is to keep the whiskers cool during a shave rather than warm.  You can try using cold water splashes in between warm lathers, or do it all cold as I mentioned above.  Experiment and see how your skin reacts."
wicked_edge,3bs7fl,Wickatron,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"Ya as people have said just don't take a hot shower or use a hot towel and wash your face and prep with regular/cold water. I've started doing that and it's really helped me. While the heat and steam can soften whiskers, I think it also softens your skin and makes it more vulnerable to razor burn (at least in my experience). I've noticed any razor burn is pretty minor now using cold/regular water. You can then just hop in the shower after."
wicked_edge,3bs7fl,Wickatron,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"I shave after I shower, would that still be fine?"
wicked_edge,3bs7fl,GeneralKinetics,0,Wed Jul 1 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"If you take a hot shower then your skin and face will still likely be hot, unless you take a cold shower. If you have to shower before you can just splash cold water on your face to cool it down, but you can always just shave and then shower afterwards. The main point of a cold shave is to not need the hot shower to soften up your whiskers."

wicked_edge,3bpcv2,Nostradamus1,5,Wed Jul 1 03:03:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think a big part of that is tools and techniques. I believe RMA is primarily a smith for his blanks whereas I do mine entirely on the grinder right now. So for any given razor, I plan out how I'm going to have to adapt the design to suit the tools I have. Something like the tang on yours would probably be much simpler to smith than cut/grind. You can definitely see elements of this in the blade profile: 4"" diameter wheel for the point, 1"" wheel for the thumb area, 8"" wheel for the monkey tail, 1/2"" wheel for the finger notches. Then I kinda pulled the curve on the bottom out of my ass knowing it needed to connect to the tip of the tail and the end of the thumb area. Whereas on an anvil, you can bang out that curve in a few seconds and have it be much more organic.   Definitely keep us posted with the rest of the customs you commission!"

Otherwise they're $7 or $11 for closed/open comb respectively in Maggards' regular safety razor section.  Either way a great option if you're short on cash and don't want to buy a whole new razor.  Maggards' regular house brand of razors have nice handles though, and would be worth the extra in my opinion."
wicked_edge,3bqbt2,redrider_99,2,Wed Jul 1 14:08:51 2015 UTC,Are handles/heads of different brands interchangeable? Would an ATT head work on an EJ Handle?
wicked_edge,3bqbt2,eatcitrus,2,Wed Jul 1 16:10:15 2015 UTC,It should be. My EJ head broke and I bought a head from maggards that fits perfectly.

I was a bit nonplussed when the threaded post came loose from the handle, but apparently that is expected behavior so I got some locktite. There was a bit of a screw up where they only sent the 5 pack of blades and the razor came a few days later.

wicked_edge,3bqbt2,OnaBlueCloud,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:08:13 2015 UTC,"I also used LocTite, on the threads that screw into the head, making it possible to swap handles easily. It should be pretty efficient, but play with the angle and listen to the cutting sound as you move handle farther from and closer to your face. Also, with any new razor it will be necessary to do some renewed blade exploration: a brand that's best in one razor may not be best (or even good) in another."

If you want to try to get away from the problem you can pick up a vintage Gillette but the TTOs are still vulnerable to drops on bathroom floors and there are many open comb Gillettes that have bent or damaged combs due to drops.

wicked_edge,3bqqg4,GeneralKinetics,3,Thu Jul 2 00:11:59 2015 UTC,"I tried a bunch of different products with varying success.  Mapped out ingredient lists on a giant spreadsheet, did all sorts of sleuthing to isolate problem ingredients and products.  The solution ending up having NOTHING to do with shaving cream/soap.  It was all about prep.  Not prep 15 minutes before shaving... prep in the days leading up to shaving.  In other words proper general skincare.    It turns out that despite my forehead, nose, sides and back of neck, all tending to get oily, the rest of my face & neck were undermoisturized deep down inside.  And that left me prone to reactions from various products (ALL of which I can use no problem now!)  I stopped using face soap (only a drop or two of Cetaphil if I'm actually dirty, but otherwise just a warm water scrub), started using CeraVe every night before bed, and a couple of drops of sweet almond oil to wash my face in the shower each morning.  No more reactions, and my skin has a nice gentlemanly glow to it.  I also have less need for balms and lotions after shaving.  A quick splash of Clubman or the like burns for a few seconds but my skin settles right down in minutes.  If it's dry and/or sunny out I'll put on Nivea Sensitive SPF face lotion but a lot of times that's not even necessary."

wicked_edge,3bqqlw,berserkergang217,6,Wed Jul 1 11:34:16 2015 UTC,"I really do have sensitive skin and I constantly fight with pimples – especially on the chin and around the mouth - the day after shaving and grown in hair. One of my hopes is that changing to a safety razor might make all that better. I already saw on the FAQ that the switch to a safety razor can take care of this. My question now is, do I need certain blades or a certain razor for it? Or is this due some kind preparation or treatment before/after?   Switching to DE may help. Regular skin care routine may help as well (cleanse, exfoliate, moisturize). Avoiding shaving against the grain may help too. /r/SkincareAddiction may be of use.   I also do shave my head, how is that working with a safety razor? Is this more of a bloody undertaking or does it work rather well?   It's difficult, but doable. And depends on your skin/hair type, and head shape.   Also I do shave my upper body. Problem here is that because of my sensitive skin I really do get problems and sometimes look like I have some kind of sickness or rash. I guess this is kind of the same questions as for shaving the head, but to be on the save side I wanted to ask it separately: Is shaving the body with a safety razor a doable thing?   You can shave any part of your body with a DE. Impossible to say for sure if it will solve your problem or not. Maybe consider just trimming your body hair with the shortest setting on your electric hair clipper. Having little bit of stubble is better than having tons of irritation that looks like a sickness/rash.   Hardware - I was thinking of buying this[1] setup for my first try. It is 10€ which is fine for giving it a try. Will I get a good shaving experience with that or would it be better to get something else to start with? I do live in Austria so I would stick with what is available at amazon.de (just in case you have some different products in the US which are not available here).   It's a cheap rebranded Chinese razor. You can search reviews of it under these names Ming Shi razor, Derby razor (not same as the blade), Shaving Factory razor. There's probably others as well. I have not tried it. But at the same time I wouldn't recommend it. Go to eBay and find a vintage Gillette razor instead. The common models like Gillette Tech, or Super Speed, etc. shouldn't cost a lot. For a new production razor look into the Parker 24c. Blade sampler pack is highly recommended, as explained in this article by Leisureguy. For a shaving brush, look into Omega/Semogue boar brushes, Mühle black/silvertip fibre synthetic brushes. And for the shaving soap, Haslinger schafmilch is made in Austria, you should be able to find Tabac as well.   Technique - Now the biggest question I guess: How do I not end up with “Scarface” being my new nickname? :) I really would be thankful for any help and advice that you guys can give. I tried the search here and also Google of course but it kind of only raised more questions that it answered. If I missed a post where all this is already cleared up I apologize. Maybe you could provide the link to that one? :)   It's hard to harm yourself with a double edge safety razor. Even harder to cause any scars. And if it at any point hurts to shave, just stop.  Check out the sidebar FAQ. Consider buying Leisureguy's book. Watch videos from Mantic59, Geofatboy, Michael Freedberg, PaulHFilms, Nick Shaves etc. in youtube."
wicked_edge,3bqqlw,Papander,2,Wed Jul 1 12:26:49 2015 UTC,"Sensitive skin - I too have acne issues around the mouth (and a history of staph), so I use both an alum bar post-shave and an alcohol based aftershave splash.  The only other prep I do is wash my face before shaving. Acne is infected pores.  An easy way to get infected pores is from nicks and cuts.  A good way to avoid nicks and cuts is with a comfortable razor, a blade that isn't too sharp (i.e. Feather), a good lather (not easy to do with some soaps) and, finally, good technique."
wicked_edge,3bqqlw,repete66219,2,Wed Jul 1 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"The key for sensitive skin is to soften the whiskers as much as possible prior to shaving and protect the skin against the blade by thick, slick lather.  I recommend washing face with regular soap, rinsing, and using a pre shave product or hair conditioner to soften the whiskers. I recommend investing in a proper razor.  I like Edwin Jagger 89 series razors.  They're forgiving and the finish and quality is great.  Or buy a vintage Gillette TTO such as Red Tip or many others.  In my opinion a blade sampler is essential. Not all blades are created equal.  A blade sampler should include Personna Platinum, Astra and Feather blades.  Those are high quality, well proven blades.  You gotta make the investment to have a decent chance at success.  If you don't end up liking any of the gear you can sell at a minimum loss. Technique: The most common mistake beginners make  is they use too much pressure. Let the weight of the razor do the work."
wicked_edge,3bqqlw,shavereadynet,2,Wed Jul 1 16:49:04 2015 UTC,"As someone who is still fairly new to shaving with a DE i don't have as much experience and knowledge, but I'll share the little bit I have learned that may be of benefit.  Hardware - It's possible to get a decent shave from a cheaper set. I started with, and have been primarily using, a set that a family member got me as a gift. It's a pretty cheap set that I've seen many people  on this sub say it's not worth the money and you're better off to put a set together yourself.  The Razor in question and the rest of the set.   There is definitely some truth to that. It works and does a decent job and has helped me get my feet wet. However, this past weekend I was at a festival and picked up a Gillette Tech for $8. I used it this morning for the first time and the difference was immediately noticeable on how much easier it seemed to do the job and it seemed to not really irritate my neck when going against the grain (something I've done sparingly with the other razor because it would cause my neck to bother me for an hour or so).  I'm not saying that you need to go get a vintage razor or that a cheaper razor won't work, but I'd suggest looking at a bunch of the posts in the sidebar and consider spending a little more, or a little more wisely as the razor does make a difference.  Technique - A lot of this information can be found in the sidebar (which is where I did my research before starting), but I'll be trying to add some of my experience as I was just starting out. You're likely to see a lot of people mention that you don't want to use too much pressure and let the weight of the razor do the work, and I will echo that because it is so important. Even knowing that I wanted to use as light pressure as possible, I still started out using too much pressure. It's something that you will learn the feel of as you use your razor more. I'd also suggest you consider not going against the grain your first couple of shaves. Your shave won't be as close, but that's where I've experienced the most potential for irritation. Another thing I learned while starting out with a DE is that, while I thought I knew which direction my hair grew at various points on my face, I wasn't accurate and needed to let my facial hair grow out a bit to correct myself.  You'll need to learn your face's contours even more than when you were using a cartridge razor. It's so easy with a cartridge razor to apply whatever pressure you want and shave at any angle you want, but that's because of how poorly they cut. You're the one doing all the work and (for me at least) it seems to take forever to get a close shave with a cartridge razor. A DE requires a little bit more finesse, but the end results are more satisfying and require less effort/time.  It's really difficult to hurt yourself anymore than with a cartridge razor. The only suggestion i'd make on that topic is to be aware when you're turning/positioning your razor that it's not against your skin or that you're sliding the razor blade along your skin in a cutting motion. The only time I hurt myself was because I was re-positioning my razor at my chin and had it against my skin when i moved it in a direction that the blade was cutting, and even that cut was pretty insignificant. It'll take a short bit of time to get the feel on how to position/rotate your DE to utilize both sides, so don't get frustrated if you feel a little awkward with it initially.  If at first you're feeling a little bit of irritation or discomfort after shaving, try to take a look at your technique.     Ask yourself if you could have used a lighter touch. Did you have enough lather on your face? Did you do a second pass somewhere where you've already removed your shaving cream/soap and forgot to re-lather? With a cartridge razor you can get away with multiple passes because of how dull they are in comparison. It took me a few shaves before I really broke this habit. How did you move your razor in relation the the grain? This is important if you're trying to use an against the grain pass in your routine and noticing when your irritation starts or how it compares to a prior shave.   I've rambled a bit more than I originally intended, but I hope that what I've been able to add is useful information from a fellow beginner's perspective. It has a lot of similarities to cartridge shaving, but there are important differences. You will likely need to pay more attention to your shaving, but the end results are well worth it."

wicked_edge,3brdfh,dlipsonian,6,Wed Jul 1 15:12:29 2015 UTC,"It is a nice razor that provides a comfortable shave at an affordable price. It is also made mainly out of aluminum which is a step up in materials from most pot-metal razors.  Generally the razor itself can be had for between $40-50, and the stand usually costs around $25. However you should watch for sales and daily deals as this razor gets discounted quite often.  Massdrop.com currently has the Standard Razor available for $45-50 depending on color selection, and this set includes the stand for that price. Deal ends tomorrow."

wicked_edge,3brdfh,Nocturnx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:04:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any particular hype, but if you have a link, I will try to respond. The Stanford razor is a very comfortable and very efficient razor that has a minimalist sort of modern design. It's made of aluminum, and the stand is nice if you want a stand---the stand holds the razor on its side or standing upright, as you choose. (I don't use the stand.) It's $70 in gray and $80 in black, and it sometimes shows up on Massdrop or in the BespokePost.com Barber box at a discount. I don't know what the prices are for reselling used Standards.  Quite a few like the Standard. I swapped in a heavier handle, but it works fine with the standard (lower-case ""s""---and, I suppose, upper-case as well) handle.   With any new razor it will be necessary to do some renewed blade exploration: a brand that's best in one razor may not be best (or even good) in another."

Being an adjustable means you can kind of tweak how aggressive the shave is because you can control the blade gap. Bigger gap = more aggressive shave. A razor with a longer handle like the BB's makes for a good adjustable because the longer handle gives you a lot more control. In fact, the BB was born because Gillette got word that guys were stealing their wives' longer handled razors. Congrats on the find! You'll enjoy it!"

Looking forward to the next shave!"
wicked_edge,3bpey8,zombioptic,11,Wed Jul 1 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"Also, have it open, or at least loosened when adjusting to a different number. If it's tightened down, i.e. locked, and you force it to change the number, it'll break internally. And that would be bad."

wicked_edge,3bpey8,abekon,7,Wed Jul 1 15:34:52 2015 UTC,"With adjustable there are two schools of thought for how best to use them.    Find a setting that works for all passes for you and leave it there.  Use a different setting for each pass either going less aggressive or more aggressive. Example would be 3 for WTG, 5 for XTG, and 7 for ATG (or vice versa).    When you are changing the setting, it's usually a good idea to open the doors before you change the setting. This means the adjustment mechanism isn't under as much stress (you are dealing with an antique, after all)."

wicked_edge,3bqsse,MegaPantera,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:02:27 2015 UTC,"It's called Gillette super adjustable. It's the newer model because the underside of the razor is plastic.

wicked_edge,3brguu,Granny_Squirt,3,Wed Jul 1 15:38:18 2015 UTC,"May not be what you're looking to hear, but here it goes: While shaving soap lather can smell great, it isn't supposed to have a lingering scent on the face.  As such, any AS splash/lotion you use should ""pair"" well with any soap because all you should be smelling is the AS.  So find an AS you like and go with it regardless of the soap you use.  My favorite it Fine American Blend, which in my experience pairs well with all soaps.  Enjoy!"
wicked_edge,3brguu,repete66219,2,Wed Jul 1 16:03:09 2015 UTC,How is that not a popular position? o.O That's basically accepted wisdom here.

wicked_edge,3brguu,repete66219,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I'm not of the view that those are necessarily the same issue, but I definitely see your point."

wicked_edge,3brguu,repete66219,2,Wed Jul 1 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"I like to pair my soaps and my aftershaves not because they will have to mesh together, but rather because I like to keep the scent on an even keel throughout the whole experience. While I by no means think it's necessary, it's just my personal preference to, for instance, use a citrus-based pre-shave, soap, then aftershave.   Again, not to say either of us is right or wrong, but it's what I enjoy. To each his or her own!"
wicked_edge,3brguu,hawns,3,Wed Jul 1 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"So, not to build one scent on another, but to maintain a theme throughout the process?  Makes sense."

I like Captains Choice Cat o nine tails, but captains choice regular is nice too. I also recommend you get a bottle of pinaud clubman. It's a classic manly barbershop scent.

wicked_edge,3bq5g2,songwind,2,Wed Jul 1 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"It's probably more technique than anything, unless you accidentally got paint scraper blades.  Since the blade is much thicker, there's no give at all. That makes it less forgiving of unnecessary pressure than the average DE."
wicked_edge,3bq5g2,NeedsMoreMenthol,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"I have one, and pretty much every other major SE. It's aggressive as hell, so you need to be careful. Use the shallowest angle possible and no pressure at all.  Make sure that when you load it, the blade is under both stops and not straddling one of them (which can happen if you're not careful). Also, check for bent razor; when you put the blade in, all edges and gaps should be even and aligned.  Also, the first three or four shaves with a new blade well be much harsher than the following shaves with some blades, then the edge mellows out.  The Shovelhead is my second favorite SE after the Damaskeene - you got a nice razor, now it's time to tame the beast."

Which is a really good deal.  But frankly, the first thing to upgrade would be your brush. The Escali isn't just unpleasant to use, it tends to fall apart. The Fine Accoutrements ""Angel Hair"" synthetic would be significantly better in every way, and it's only $20."

wicked_edge,3bshsu,MassdropBot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:48:34 2015 UTC,That seems like an ok deal. I've used the brush for quite a few shaves now and haven't had issue. Is it really that bad of a brush? The 20$ doesn't seem bad though if it's a big step up. Planned on venturing into some aftershave as well perhaps something from the chiseled face. I think my soap will last me another year though haha.
wicked_edge,3bshsu,repete66219,3,Wed Jul 1 21:32:43 2015 UTC,"Fine Accoutrements makes the best aftershave (IMO).  The American Blend is fantastic.  And that synthetic brush is nice, as is the lather bowl.  Knock yourself out."
wicked_edge,3bshsu,arbarnes,3,Wed Jul 1 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"The Escali brush has a number of problems. The knot is machine-made and clipped into shape, so the tips are very prickly. The manufacturer attempts to compensate for this problem by using a knot with very low hair density (which makes it less effective at building lather) and an excessively tall loft (which makes it prone to tangling). These measures don't really work, though - it's still unpleasant to use compared to a decent brush.  But that's strictly subjective. There are objective problems, too - most notably, the brushes tend to fall apart. After a while, big clumps of hair will probably start falling out.  Until this happens, there's no compelling reason to get a new brush. But there's no compelling reason to get a new razor, either. And you'll probably notice a bigger difference by changing brushes than razors.  Good aftershave is available over a huge price spectrum. IMO Clubman is the best value out there, but I love the splashes from Barrister & Mann, Fine and Mickey Lee, too. Chiseled Face is on my short list of things to try when there's room available in the medicine cabinet."
wicked_edge,3bshsu,arbarnes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:06:20 2015 UTC,So it looks like I may invest in the brush then. I'm currently letting my beard grow and only shaving my neck so I mostly wanted some info on what to look into seems like a brush will serve me better.
wicked_edge,3bshsu,pudgycaveman,2,Wed Jul 1 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"Well, now that I've convinced you, let me argue the other side. You should definitely buy the Fine brush, but you can do that any time. The Standard razor is seldom available at all, and $45 is a helluva price. But it's a limited-time deal. If you don't like it, you can easily sell it used for what you paid new."

wicked_edge,3bshsu,riverstyxxx,3,Sun Jul 5 05:10:22 2015 UTC,"That's a Rimei, and it's not a bad razor, particularly in the bang-for-the-buck department.  I think you'd find the Parker 24C ($29) a significant upgrade, though: the 24C is extremely comfortable and also extremely an efficient, a combination that generally costs $70 or more.  With any new razor it will be necessary to do some renewed blade exploration: a brand that's best in one razor may not be best (or even good) in another."

I can't confirm that, just passing along what I heard.  Of the others you mentioned, I've used:   Simpsons Best, a Duke 2, which was not comfortable on my face. And I say that as someone who does not have a problem face lathering with a boar that's not fully broken in yet. Simpsons Super, a Chubby 2, which is fantastic but very pricey. Semogue 2-band badger, an SOC, which is a very nice brush, great handle, great backbone, soft enough tips, but a bit scrubby.   I also have:     A Rooney 1/2 Super Silvertip; the tips are comparable to the SOC's in softness, but with a bit more flop. Not too floppy, I still like the brush, but a bit paintbrush-y. A great bang-for-the-buck brush to consider is a Vintage Blades Finest. My favorite badger brush. Tons of backbone, tips are as soft as Simpsons Super, goes for under $40."

It has hooked tips (so no scritch), decent density, and plenty of backbone.  It holds its own against the top-notch brushes, including Rooney, Savile Row, and Kent silvertips. It's less prickly than Simpsons best and WSP silvertip, and blows Edwin Jagger and Parker out of the water."

Simpson, Rooney, Thater, Shavemac, Plisson & Kent are the primary players in the higher end badger market.  (I'm speaking generally here as there are nice brushes made by Semogue and Omega.)  I've heard good things about TGN knots, though I have no experience with any myself.  I know some guys get the knots to set themselves or send them to someone like Rudy Vey for a custom design."
wicked_edge,3brf8w,repete66219,3,Wed Jul 1 15:59:51 2015 UTC,"Semogue 2-band badger is pretty nice. I prefer my 2-band SOC to my Rooney super silvertip, and it is miles better than Simpsons Best, which I was pretty underwhelmed by."

wicked_edge,3brf8w,OnaBlueCloud,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"SOC is Semogue's flagship brush so should be compared to Simpson super, not Simpson best.*  Regardless, I was speaking generally about a subjective topic.  There are personal preferences and, as usual, YMMV, but if you're going higher end (""Finest and up"") then Semogue and Omega usually aren't in the picture.  *I realize badger hair grades aren't an exact science."
wicked_edge,3brf8w,repete66219,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"SOC is Semogue's flagship brush so should be compared to Simpson super, not Simpson best.   That's completely arbitrary. At well under $100, The SOC 2-band  compares in price to the cheaper end of Simpsons Best range.   You told OP to forget about Semogue; I suggested they make a brush that's very much worth considering, especially in comparison to what you recommended."
wicked_edge,3brf8w,chuckfalzone,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"Not completely arbitrary. Best of Semogue vs. best of Simpson in the context given by the OP--Simpson Best isn't ""finest and up"". Also, SOC 2-band is $95 (WCS anyway). I'm not going to argue what you like. I've heard some great things about the SOC. It seems like a very good value."
wicked_edge,3brf8w,repete66219,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:47:30 2015 UTC,"I have restored a few brushes using TGN Finest badger knots and sold my other brushes including Simpson in best.  The only ones I have kept are high end silvertip brushes from Shavemac, Savile Row, Kent...etc. If you get a TGN Finest brush I recommend washing it with dish soap, rinsing then lathering it with a shaving soap that has lanolin in it.  Leaving it overnight, rinse and let it dry for at least 24 hours before using it.  This will make the hair tips much softer."

wicked_edge,3brbif,almightywhacko,4,Wed Jul 1 14:57:44 2015 UTC,"I am a designer by trade, and I work with stock photography sites all the time. I was searching for vintage tools and my eye got caught on this set of ""vintage"" shaving tools (even though some items are new, like the Omega brush).  I was trying to identify the razor because the head looked unusual when I realized.. it is a tech with the base plate installed upside down.   Now I just can't bring myself to use this photo.  Has anyone else's shaving addiction ever got in the way of their job?"
wicked_edge,3brbif,pudgycaveman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:59:49 2015 UTC,"LOL, that razor's baseplate!  Still, brought back some memories.  I remember those mechanical clippers -- it is what the local barber to whom I went as a kid, used.  My dad insisted that the barber uses them instead of a blade for post-haircut clean-up.  And I always wanted a blade because it would make the back of my neck feel nice and smooth for about two days.  We'd argue about it and I'd mope because dad always won.  Good times."

wicked_edge,3brbif,pudgycaveman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:25:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know for certain, but I think that is an old curling iron. The kind you would have to heat up using an external heat source and then wrap someone's hair in."
wicked_edge,3brbif,chiseledface,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:35:36 2015 UTC,"Ah OK, thanks, they do resemble curlers.  Here I was, wondering what hedge shears would have to do with men's grooming :-)"
