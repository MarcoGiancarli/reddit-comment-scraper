TeraOnline,3e4c89,YiliaTheMystic,3,Tue Jul 21 21:35:13 2015 UTC,Doesn't really work for reaper as one the main powerlink skills also heals the reaper.   Carving should change to focused. Forceful is fine on reaper as you should have the back time to keep the 15s power buff up constantly. If not you need to work on positioning as it is possible to be behind all 3 vault bosses for the majority of the fight.   I had a top 20 score in all three vaults last patch on my reaper with keen disco weapon+12 and disco +12 gloves.

TeraOnline,3e4c89,random4lyf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:47 2015 UTC,"Never skip Focused. Never skip Focused.  Don't use Carving, you shouldn't need the crit rate if you have Schisma and Edge gear already. Skip it for a Pounding. Pounding/Savage/Bitter/Focused.  What consumables are you using? I use Nostrums, Noctenium, Onslaught Scrolls, Canephora, Heaven's Elixir, and Lamb Bulgolgi. Also mana potions. You need a lot of mana potions.  Watch some videos on Youtube so you can learn the attacks. You can shave off precious seconds knowing which attacks to Retribution so you get behind the monster and which ones not to (because they'll jump off somewhere else).  What do your rotations look like? Need to tell us more than just a weapon and hitting 2 buttons."

If you have the correct consumables and buffs, you should get 6700+ easily.   Most people in the top 10 also use slaying crystals in lieu of a pounding. As a reaper, I usually get 6750-6770 without slaying, and 6770-6780+ with it on."

Charms make everything go faster, especially if your teammates are not skilled.   Honestly 1k isn't anything, other than making sure you have your consumables, all your gear can be found for free in dungeons, and your avatar weapon can be found anywhere you fight appropriate level monsters. By the time you hit 65 you should have somewhere around 5k probably, and you can make much more than that per day as a 65.   Just don't blow it on weapons or armor right now because you will level so fast it will be useless in a few hours."

The weapon will renew with another quest to build a new one ever few (4 or 5 I think) levels.  Always enchant it to +9 when you can.  I'm kind of new too but others can correct me where I'm wrong on the details."

TeraOnline,3e25rn,Goorman,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"I couldn't tell you, I went to sell my newbie 7 day gold charm on the trade channel and the guy said he'd give me something ridiculous like 5k. While I was travelling he double checked if it was 50 or 100% and I said 50. He said he wasn't interested because he thought it was 100, thus the insane offer.   I mentioned that it's not super effective at my level so I decided to sell it for some starting money. He mentioned it sells for 100-150 on the market, then offered me 300 for it. When I got there he refused to take my item and traded me 1000 gold, and told me to buy some inventory slots. I was shocked.   Global chat was leaving a bad taste in my mouth (lots of racism, pointless arguing, slurs and name-calling) but I think posting here and having that experience showed me the (far) better side of the Tera community."

I'd consider gather the random nodes you see when your leveling. The uncommon and rare drops you get from them can net you 1-2k by level 20 so you have more than enough to +9 Avatar as soon as you get the weapon.   If you really have some spare cash to throw around on your first run, charming (purple) campfires and Greater Charms help out while leveling as well. Someone mentioned an EXP boost, which is a great option as well."

TeraOnline,3e27w2,Mr_Conman,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:40:59 2015 UTC,Wounded World gear was good enough for fate of arun phase 1 but it wasnt good enough for fate of arun phase 2. It was still possible to clear in Archetype gear for Sky Cruiser Hard and what else there was. But it was difficult.  Phase 2 FoA gear is good enough for the current content patch..

TeraOnline,3e27w2,xTiCT0C,4,Tue Jul 21 12:53:19 2015 UTC,Maybe you don't have weapon well rolled? Maybe you don't have enough crit to support it?  Anyway there's no doubt that schisma +12 should do way more than fulminate even though fulminate has good rolls.

Keeping in mind not wanting to minmax and having g 6 alts to gear.   It completely depends on you. If your like me and prefer to buy costumes and run dungeons casually, then obviously don't bother. If you going to eventually run the hard core dungeons anyway? Meh why not. Just don't worry about breaking the bank for perfect rolls. If you have to be top DPS and the best of the best? Then obviously it's worth it."
TeraOnline,3e1e83,phoenixaflame17,3,Tue Jul 21 08:21:27 2015 UTC,In a nutshell:   It's easy to get. It's order of magnitude worse to reroll if you are after particular combination of stats. Functionally - in context of this update - not worth it (if you're in disco you don't need anything in this update)
TeraOnline,3e1e83,dstuff,3,Tue Jul 21 11:20:35 2015 UTC,"TBH, Tick-Tock is easy to get, and unlike the cascades/signets, they are rerollable, so its mich easier too get at least 1 good roll on them.   A 20 crit signet for example took hundreds of VoA runs, even more.   Also if you mix the old and new sets you can get a much better overall crit rate. But if you are asking for a healer, the new rings are not good because they are missing endurance on them."
TeraOnline,3e1e83,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:08:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. What mixes do you suggest for dps? Just out of curiosity if I decide to spend SES on these things...
TeraOnline,3e1e83,fluffy-tails,4,Tue Jul 21 06:12:59 2015 UTC,"Most will go for a 3/2 Edge/Force combination. If you're going for max crit and forgoing power, you can do 3/2 Edge/Deathwise. Obviously the 3 being Xtock Ring, Xtock Earring, Xtime Necklace and the 2 being Ytock Ring, Ytock Earring.   Best ring rolls are 4 power/4 crit factor. Best earring rolls are 4% hp/4 endurance. Best necklace roll is 4 power or 4 crit (4 power is probably the better one).  Gunners will be more focused on power and will probably go for a 3/2 Force/Edge combination."

TeraOnline,3e1e83,Lilliu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:26:59 2015 UTC,They are substantially more expensive to reroll than other jewelry. In fact the new jewelry is my last priority in this patch above all else because of it.

TeraOnline,3e1p4x,mejai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:57:45 2015 UTC,IMHO kumas should just always let the fed team win. That makes for a quick game (3min maybe) that 10/13 people win instead of   a drawn out 10-15min game that 10/13 people win a full 15min game that 3/10 people win

TeraOnline,3e1mb7,badlizz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:30:22 2015 UTC,The best is to have 3 life pieces (earrings that can be rolled for +4 endurance and necklace) and 2 river rings. You are losing 8 endurance with life rings (if both rolled for +4 endurance) and it really doesn't heal for much more.

TeraOnline,3e1dwc,Kumasylum,2,Tue Jul 21 05:19:42 2015 UTC,"I primarily play zerk as dps, but I do enjoy tanking on it from time to time.   Currently I have an intense vm4 axe rolled for dps (flat/back/enrage/crit). I typically switch out my crystals to 3x threat, keeping focused. I also have schisma defense gloves but have been using my offensive disco more and more because of the crit. I've been able to hold agro with similarly geared players (+15 vm4 equivalent) with out a properly rolled weapon.  If I could have a second weapon for tanking but also viable for dps, I'd probably do something like this:  Schisma (4 rolls): aboveline enrage (maybe crit), crit/enrage/flat  Vm (5 rolls): aboveline enrage (maybe crit), crit/enrage/flat/attackspeed.  I'd be using crit etchings aswell.  I like having high crit while tanking, for me that is around base+200. I use edge/death jewelry with carving vyrsks. The reason I prefer to have my tank set up like this is to hold agro through damage. Crits on flatten/counter/punishing strike will deal around 1m. And you will often find time to throw in a TS doing 2m+. I use crit power scrolls rather than swift (I do love the attack speed though).   Chest rolled for TS would be best if you plan on switching between tanking and dps. Flatten doesn't benefit dps at all, while TS can benefit both roles.  Edit: forgot to mention CD rolls. Both tanking and dpsing, a zerk will hardly ever have probelms with skills being on CD, making that roll on weapons not very effective. Could be better replaced with flat/as/enrage/crit.  Sorry that this is super unorganized/structured/not in depth, writing on my phone sucks."

TeraOnline,3e1dwc,megatonfist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:27:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm true. The clear for TSHM we got was with a zerk tank in full wroth, so the flatten dmg wasn't needed, and that would benefit TS a lot more.   Assuming: CD|CD/Flat/Enrage/Crit rate or damage for last roll if rolling VM"
TeraOnline,3e1dwc,Goorman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:31:13 2015 UTC,"I'd go crit since zerks benefit most from it with crit glyphs, and it'll help slightly with aggro"
TeraOnline,3e1dwc,heiltdo,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"for dpsing you should never be using Flatten unless you need to knock down the boss. Optimal rotation is   Cyclone -> Auto -> Raze (Glyphed to increase TS Charge) -> TS -> repeat (using Vampiric when it's off CD)  I think on Weapon you'll want Enraged/Crit Factor or AS/Enraged/Flat.  Chest looks fine, but you should use TS not Flatten  I don't think CD is good on us zerkers, since we always have abilities off cooldown as it is and nothing is really a ""Must CD"" ability, it might be for tanking, but if you want hybrid rolls, CD would be a dead stat as dps."
TeraOnline,3e1dwc,Goorman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:12 2015 UTC,You can't cyclone while in tanking stance.  You use Flatten on your rotation as it has a very low CD and triggers off Raze. The damage is pretty nice.

TeraOnline,3e0876,arielzhou,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:59 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar position to /u/Acerolion in having not tested double CDR but something occurs to me. Arcane Barrage seems very sensitive to where you detonate it. It's not simply a case of back/front side. I often see a little further backwards/forwards will yield a slightly different result, sometimes as much as 10% difference. And of course if you detonate really late a back hit becomes a front it (if fired from behind) or a back hit becomes a miss (if fired from the front).  With an Attack Speed roll plus poor ping you might find yourself struggling to make the most of AB. So I Probably go with single CDR (until more is known about double CDR) and increased enraged over attack speed."
TeraOnline,3e0876,hlycia,0,Tue Jul 21 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I find that AB is pretty sensitive to the position, sometimes detonating it at a 30 degree angle to the center of mass of the boss at his back yields a slightly reduced amount of damage.  Personally I prefer 9.3% enrage top line, 6% flat, 6.9% back, 9.3% enrage and 0.3 crit power on my weapon. I just feel that the 7.2% cdr alone is kinda underwhelming, especially with 15% cdr from nostrums already, reducing the actual cdr to 6.12%."
TeraOnline,3e0876,Acerolion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:46:16 2015 UTC,I've been wondering about stacking a bit more crit power across weapon & accs (more than I have currently).
TeraOnline,3e0876,hlycia,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:11 2015 UTC,"Crit Power should never be a stat you should be wanting to roll on a PvE weapon. Your crit power is already around 8x with back crit crystals, and getting a CDR roll will increase your DPS by quite a lot, especially if you find yourself in situations that you have nothing to cast for a bit often. Going from 8x to 8.3x will not increase your damage by that much, even as a gunner when you have almost all your skills critting often.  On accessories, there's no way that 0.04 crit power is going to be better than 4 power or 4 crit factor."
TeraOnline,3e0876,fluffy-tails,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"Nostrums don't reduce the cd of replenishment though (at least the ranged one doesn't, have to try the melee one and see if it does).

TeraOnline,3e0876,Acerolion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:18:03 2015 UTC,"Most gunners don't actually use the double CDR roll. It's a new concept that the advent of ""Go Berserk"" has ushered in due to the rerollable top line on Schisma/Lucid. As it's pretty new, most of it is untested and unconfirmed, but there have been many videos around showing the gameplay. No hard calculations and dps comparisons though.  As I haven't personally tried the double CDR weapon rolls I cannot tell you exactly whether it is the best roll for gunner, but the 9.3% enrage damage roll is probably better than the 9% attackspeed roll in terms of dps. However, if you feel like you desperately need the smoothness of blast cancelling and skill chaining, the 9% atkspd roll isn't a bad option.  From what I've heard, the top crusade rankers are still those who are running the standard intense + 3 % rolls (i.e. 2x 6% flat, 2x 6.9% back, 2x 9.3% enrage) on their weapons. But of course I may be wrong, and if anyone is able to provide proof otherwise I would gladly take my statement back."

TeraOnline,3e0876,Acerolion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:31:34 2015 UTC,"I would definitely use all pumped etchings.  In my opinion, attack speed really does little for gunners. We don't have much combos to use, mostly dpsing via a priority system that varies our rotation on how often our Arcane Barrage crits.  As you mentioned you have high ping, attack speed is surely not the way to go. Perhaps some people will see success in fluidity of skills but high ping = crappy combos. What I've found to great success as a 250-300 ping player is focusing my dps on landing the perfect Arcane Barrage and Bombardment. All the other skills can be omitted as the inherent ping disadvantage will make you unable to chain the filler skills during your main skills' downtime. If you insist on adding in fillers, you may actually extend the time taken to get off your skills regardless of whether you have +15% attack speed simply due to ping issues.  Granted, this is not optimal, but is sufficient. There will definitely be people who do well with higher attack speed, but for higher ping players like you and I, concentrating your damage into your hard hitting skills is good enough.  TL;DR Attack speed isn't optimal if you have shitty ping."

TeraOnline,3dzj3m,Miseror,3,Mon Jul 20 20:15:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what server you're on, but on Tempest Reach, just about everybody runs AIHM. That being said, it's all done on LFG. Wouldn't really recommend IMSing for AIHM (only do it for AINM). If you're a healer on TR, you're ALMOST guaranteed to find a group on LFG for AIHM. Don't really know. Maybe variance. Maybe IRL/other reasons. On one occasion, someone left mid-run in AIHM (hadn't wiped yet) because they had to go duel, lol. Unless wipe, usually the whole group stays until the end.  AIHM is very easy if you have a competent group to do it with. If everybody knows the mechanics, healers are healing correctly, tank is keeping aggro, DPS are popping consumables and eclipse potions, it's generally going to be a smooth and easy run. As long as everybody is on board and knows what's up, AIHM is very doable.  It seems like you're using Instance Matchmaking for AIHM, which is something that I would strongly recommend against. It is better to find an LFG group, because with LFG, groups are constructed reasonably well. With IMS, it's just a gamble to see who you're with. Additionally, it should take less time than IMS since no one really does AIHM IMS. As for if there is being a reason to run AIHM, you have to ask yourself: ""Am I going to aim for Lucid/Tensus/BiS VM5 gear?"" If the answer is no, then Schisma gear WILL BE your end-game gear for this patch. Schisma gear will be the Disco of this patch for a majority of the player-base. Schisma is considerably better than Wroth at +12 due to extra skill lines, and other reasons. Admittedly it is very difficult to fully get the gear to +12. However, if Schisma is your last stop in gear progression, then you will not have to ever really focus on acquiring and enchanting new gear until the next major patch hits.  I have seen a number of people with various pieces of Tensus/Lucid gloves/weapons/chest. Even saw some occasions of +15 Lucid weapons. However, I have not yet seen a full set of Tensus/Lucid. Should be sometime soon, though. People want that gearrrrrr."

TeraOnline,3dzj3m,liberatelatios,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"That's probably just variance. That type of thing won't happen in every run. Besides, LFG is probably more reliable in the long run."

The ones that already have Lucid are the ones that run in statics and and the static passes on the rolls to allow them to take the stuff the need.   Also the players farming for Lucid are likely to be +14/15 Gen players, they will not replace their gen weapon until they get their Lucid weap to +14 at least.

It's also highly dependent on your healers being actually able to output healing so that everyone is healthly all the time on Duras.  People generally run to get their Schisma gear, and the piece most people are missing are the chest. A lot of people will simply queue for IM to get just a single piece of gear (most of the time chest), and will leave after said boss since the clear bonuses are crap and the last boss is a pain with an unknown group."

AIHM isn't worth the time if your squad seems likely to wipe tbh.  It doesn't even give vanguard points, so people are often discouraged and ragequit early. I wouldn't call it too hard. Running it with undergeared people however makes it very hard.  Nothing gets done when people do low damage and hit the floor more than the boss. If you want higher chances to roll for schisma armor in particular, AIHM might be worth it.

Often enough those folks do not research gear to find out ahead-of-time what they're going to want, so they roll on everything so as not to hold up progress.  I've seen priests roll on and win tanking/dps jewelry and players absolutely lose their shit over it.  Then they'll immediately try to get the priest kicked, and if they fail at that, they'll throw a tantrum and sit up on the wall for the final boss and refuse to help in any way.  They can't be kicked often enough because they queued with a partner who nixes every attempt and both will refuse to participate until they get their way (kicking a technically competent, but loot-ignorant priest), or the group simply finishes without them.  I think I'll probably start each run by a little blurb in chat about which sets are for which archetypes so as to avoid problems.  I don't actually care about the jewelry because it's all stepping-stone stuff anyway.

TeraOnline,3dz4hw,Vishavix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:10 2015 UTC,"Someone posted a guide for making money on a fresh 65 here the other day,  if you can't find it I can post a link later today when I get home.  Edit: This  Just to enforce my suggestion more, right at the top of his guide :p    The #1 Rule of earning gold in this game is to get elite, be it via subscription or elite vouchers off the broker (roughly 20k or so). This is roughly a 3x-4x increase in gold earning compared to doing without elite. Don't worry about the 20k spent on the voucher if you are not subscribing, treat it as an investment. You'll earn back that much gold in no time at all.   Edit again :x and yeah, when you get 65 you can get idoneal, but I suggest going straight to fulminate with vanguard credits (You get enough from the storyquest doing 60-65 without elite, but with elite you get alot more credits so you can then buy MWA boxes for money or buy some crystals/glyphs) and then running AINM like it says on that guide for your schisma wep (As an elite, every time you run AINM using instance matchmaking, idk if you get it when you don't use IMS, you get 2 schisma weapon boxes at the end which have around a 50% chance to drop a schisma weapon, might take a while to get a lance though, took me 11 runs on my gunner to get a schisma gun and as a non-elite player you only get 1 box and less runs per day), dismantle any other schisma weps you get since they bind to you when you open the box so nothing else to do with them for T7 feedstock, and with the vanguard credits you can save the MWA for yourself so when you get your wep to +9, then mw it you'll have t7 feedstock/mwa already to +12 it. You can also run shattered fleet/vault of kaprima for upgraded jewelery, and then once you think you have AINM down you can try AIHM, if you're able to do that then from that you'll be getting your schisma armor drops (Schisma is only 1 teir below this patch's best pve gear(lucid gear))."

Suddenly 1 hit from bosses kills them and they actually have to learn their iframes.  Bosses have loads of HP, so they have to learn about consumables, crystals, mana, heals, positioning.   Healers and tanks suddenly realize that they are the most needed classes in the game.   So dont worry; if you like playing support, tera is probably the best mmo for support classes because they are always in demand and playing them is actually loads of fun due to the mechanics :)"
TeraOnline,3dzt6p,Akiris,2,Tue Jul 21 06:26:55 2015 UTC,Just because the rest of the party is good does not mean you are bad as a healer. People screw up from time to time and while a party might be able to avoid damage entirely if they play perfectly a healer providing a safety net makes the run a lot less nerve wracking. If you kept the party alive through the run you did your job. Don't fret the details.
TeraOnline,3dzt6p,Bryanarby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:38:07 2015 UTC,"It's just gunners in pre-endgame dungeons. Even in endgame they're pretty self sustained. Take AINM for example. Instance matching will create a composition of tank, 2~3melee, 2 healers, rest range (4 gunners with that is ridiculous; both for the damage ).   You'll be focussing on keeping the tank/melee alive most of the time, unless the ranged people don't know how to iframe the major damage.  Personally I run CDR gunner (double CDR on weapon, and CDR on chest. You can go deeper, but my ping/fps are a bottleneck.) Insane utility and rapid bursts of damage. You get your big moves on 2~3 minute cooldowns, your main damage move 8s max with every 4sec a chance to reset the cd while regaining a huge chunk of mana, an iframe with less than 5seconds cooldown.. which has a 45% chance to reset on use. All this with a semi-permanent healbot healing you (you have to re-cast it every 30minutes, it does not even take damage/decay.)  Are they the strongest? Depends on skill. Are they balanced? Probably still overtuned, even with the deserved nerfs from last patch."
TeraOnline,3dzt6p,ZonerRoamer,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"TBH gunners cant avoid all damage, if you need to iframe 3 things in a row (which is rare, but occasionally happens); a Guner has no option but to take the hit or try to walk out, or use balders.  And neither are they OP now; I have a +14 warrior & a +14 gunner; warrior is out-dpsing the gunner by at least 20-30%; especially in AI where the bosses move/turn a lot.   Gunner's AB dooes around 2-2.5kk, warrior is dealing 1.5kk blade draws every second sec and a 4kk scythe every 7 seconds, even dumb stuff like combative strike is now 500-800k and ROB is over 1kk damage on a 3ish sec CD.

The veteran players doing these, rush ahead in dungeons, waste everything before the rest of the group even catches up, etc.  They are pretty unfair in PvP unless you play perfectly, while they can still waste you and have a leisurely time.  If you are a tank, they will absolutely kill your fps, make you miss blocks, dodges etc. do to fps lag. Even lowering the settings doesn't help if there is more than one.  Healers are not obsolete to anything, gunners are just that op.  EDIT* Keep the downvotes coming. You all know it's the truth, that's why you downvote it."

In endgame dungeons if a gunner rushes ahead his team gets locked out of the room and he gets to die to the boss alone while everyone sits back and laughs. Gunners are really strong in low level PvP still but in endgame PvP (which is where the majority of PvP takes place) they are balanced. They do a lot less damage after the nerfs and are still easy to kill once you catch them."

There are tons of dungeons to run and master, and PvE is a good money-maker as well (perhaps not so much for this patch). PvP is another world entirely, and has a plethora of BGs/GvGs/Arenas.

PvE is dungeons, solo-instances (ghilliglade, etc), and some arenas (Theres a PvE arena).   For PvP, there is 20v20 Corsair Stronghold, 15v15 Fraywind Canyon, 15v15 Gridiron, 3v3 Champion Skyring, GvG, and openworld PvP if you're on a PvP server. Plus Alliance PvP.

Once you get higher levels you will be finding that you are contributing to the DPS, not by attacking the mobs, but by making g the group hit harder. As a mystic/priest you will both be providing massive support as well as healing as needed.  If I recall a priest mystic combo technically boosts group DPS by something like 50-60%? Atleast that's what I recall reading but I am too lazy to refind that source to take it with a grain of salt. Basically healers will always be wanted in groups."

TeraOnline,3e08ub,Chiral_Systems,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:35:03 2015 UTC,"I disagree. BV sacrifices positioning, which the gunner's opponents can then abuse and subsequently lock the gunner down. For example, when exiting the BV animation, gunners can either recall to HB or wait out the animation and get dumpstered (similar to the lag time on warriors landing after DFA). The gunner's only option to escape lockdown is to recall to the HB, which EVERYONE can see. You are placing too much emphasis on the immediate benefits of BV, and ignoring all of the after-the-fact penalities associated with it. Lastly, its now very difficult to execute 1-shots with BV, especially in Grid; 100-0's require a backcrit, and atleast gear equal or above that of your target. Yes, backcrit or not, BV hits like a truck -- but the windup, cooldowns, and consequences I mentioned previouly account for that damage."

That being said, your character/camera has to be facing towards the center of the AoE when you push block, otherwise it'll hit your back.  Thus, if there's only one circle on the ground, that's easy, just block. If there's more than one, you'll have to take a look and possible reposition yourself so you're one standing in that one circle to block  Personally, as a warrior tank, this fight is probably the easiest fight in the game. I can iframe the lightning attack almost completely with DFA (I may get hit by a single 10k tick at most), and the rest of the rings are just iframed."
TeraOnline,3dx5ew,Purple_Engram,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"it's also the easiest as dps, since all the damage is tankable and you can just have your priest(s) leave his/their circle(s) under your group behind the boss. and if you have a mystic they can just boomerang heal through the dps and to the tank."

As a lancer, your backstep won't be enough to iframe both the additional red circles and the one below him.  However, as one person said; the aoe circle below him can be blocked.  The additional circles cannot be blocked. Only iframed.    On that boss, I tend to stay in the circle he spawns below him and just block that attack. I'll usually get hit by an overlapping circle that can't be blocked, but I typically trust my healer on that one.    If you don't trust your healer, your safest bet is to find a clear spot and maintain aggro briefly with rally cry and challenging shout until they're gone."

As a tank, I just pop Iron Will if its up and just DPS while the damage is going through. Healers should top you up after healing the DPS.   When she wraps her snakes around her and shoots a purple AoE is when the many circles appear on the ground. Wait until they all appear, backstep to a safe area, wait until the lightning drops, charge back into place. The single lightning drop on the Tank is blockable, so do that.   Honestly, the only attack that should be hurting a tank is the flip into multi-shockwave attack."

The huge blender AoE where the boss screams like a manic, I was able to backstep out of it without any harm, and it's not blockable 100% unless you're near the circumference (one time I was near the edge and didn't take damage while ""block success"" kept popping)... I just block > shield counter or shield bash > onslaught to get reduced (1/2?) damage while attacking.

Some people don't waste their time on +12 wroth and go straight for Schisma but it really isnt too hard to MW and +12 so its your choice.

TeraOnline,3dw8dl,Acerolion,2,Mon Jul 20 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"Do Schisma +12 weapon minimum to help hold aggro better against +15 gen/+12 Schisma dps.

Skipping wroth is a good idea, unless you are desperate for gear improvement and can't seem to acquire schisma. Yes, but it'll be hard on you and your party. Vanguard Merchant. But only if you're desperate, since the conversion is something along the lines of 1credit:2.5g which is quite a big sum for newer players."
TeraOnline,3dw8dl,stealthrazor,2,Mon Jul 20 02:24:08 2015 UTC,"AINM schisma boxes will get you your schisma lance. +12 that for sure, and try to go for some aggro wrists.  My lancer currently wears Schisma lance, top (dat skill line doe), and boots +12. His wrists are +12 wroth, and his belt is also wroth.  I've been very unlucky with finding schisma tank wrists, but the aggro bonus from +12 defensive wrists is essential for your job as a tank.  If you're trying to save a bit of money but still want to be effective, maybe settle on a couple wroth pieces since they're insanely cheaper to +12.  Wroth aggro wrists are far better for you than schisma offensive wrists.  Schisma is still what you should prefer if you had a choice though. Remember that. No. If you're running with a squad that isn't doing enough dps to take aggro from a fulminate lancer, you're highly likely to fail anyway. A squad with enough dps would be too much for you to properly tank for anyway, so I'd say steer clear of AIHM/TSNM until you at least get your schisma lance. To be honest, decide if those glyphs are things that you will need.  If they're not, you could just run MC for them whenever you get bored.  I try to avoid spending vanguard on anything besides MWA and vyrsks these days."

TeraOnline,3dw8dl,Acerolion,2,Mon Jul 20 17:07:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely aggro.  Some tanks when they get ridiculous gear prefer their crit vyrsks, but I would say the amount of difference the crit ones do doesn't exactly outweigh the aggro effect since damage is only half of aggro generation.  The other half of gaining aggro is your actual threat.  Crit vyrsks will up your damage per second, and effect half of your threat generation, but aggro vyrsks multiply by the damage you do, AND the aggro generation from the skills themselves (especially the ones that don't do damage such as your shouts).    The farthest I would move towards offensive crystals while tanking would be the focus crystal (crit multiplier against enraged monsters) in my weapon.  The extra damage against enraged monsters is pretty big, since the multiplier is high enough to often outweigh a standard aggro crystal and I haven't seen a boss that wasn't enraged since the patch."
TeraOnline,3dw8dl,Goorman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:34:56 2015 UTC,"Aggro lol.  As a new lancer you'd want to stack as many aggro crystals as possible, then start swapping them out for dmg (power/focused/whatever) when you are able to keep aggro without breaking a sweat."
TeraOnline,3dw8dl,fluffy-tails,2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"1) Schisma  2) Depends on who you're running with, our guild can run AIHM with whoever and it's still a faceroll, TSNM is also a faceroll (atleast for us).  3) You can spend Vanguard Credits on Glyph Tokens or whatever they're called, those allow you to pick which glyph you want.

TeraOnline,3dy5bk,Priest_Dps,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:53 2015 UTC,"To expand a little, the brawler ""block"" is their combo finisher. Brawlers have a combo system a bit like a fighting game. LMBx2 + RMB (finisher/block) will do one move, while LMBx3 + RMB will do a different move. This works for a few different combinations. During the skills triggered from this combo, you're also blocking attacks. So essentially how it works is if you hit the block button, you're also finishing whatever combo you're on and attacking at the same time. The blocking is like a secondary effect from the combo move."
TeraOnline,3dy5bk,canada432,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"That's always suggested and it just doesn't work. Content is balanced around all the other classes. You can either nerf one class, or buff every other class and then also readjust all content so that it matches the new power levels. Both result in the same net effect, except that one takes exponentially more time and resources. It's just not a smart move."
TeraOnline,3dy5bk,canada432,3,Tue Jul 21 02:27:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't made it to any endgame content, just tried it out for a few hours, but it seems really overpowered at the moment. You can basically gather up unlimited numbers of anything that's not a bam and then juggle them in the air nearly indefinitely so you take no damage at all, yet you still do dps class level damage. Add in that you pretty much passively block because your block is also your combo finishing move, and you're basically a tank and dps simultaneously. Tons of fun, but from what I can tell not that balanced yet. Check out some of the videos posted online to get a better idea for yourself."

TeraOnline,3dw3tt,Mr_Conman,3,Mon Jul 20 00:47:46 2015 UTC,"AIHM:     First boss is pretty damn annoying-- I don't like fimbrilisks in general. But all you really have to do is try to hold aggro at your best- it doesn't really matter where, just not under Acheron's hand. I've seen KTERA lancers tank there sometimes though. Volcanic lizard and mob thingy are damn annoying when you lose aggro and the fact that you get damage leakbut yea, it's either left or right corner. Just hold it down, and you should be fine.  You really don't want to wall tank that one. In KTERA, they specifically said to tank near the center at the best of your abilities because there is less chance of dying from the thunder strikes since there are much more room to spread. It's really not that hard to dodge thunder strikes either. Just stop a bit when it begins the attack pattern and walk back a bit, look at the pattern and back step to safe spot. On the fire pathway, you can just get on your mount and go as far as you can, then when you get hit, use iron will, charging lunge, shield bash > Onslaught. I usually have more than 60% HP by the time I pass it, and it is the fastest way I've done so far. It does help if you use Adrenaline rush before Shield bash > Onslaught since onslaught movement speed is based on attack speed. Keeping in the middle is best. if you get off center, not everyone will get to the vent, but it does take a while for the lava to come in. Usually I would expect ranged DPS and healers to be other side when we're off center but i guess everyone just want to play it safe for themselves.   TSHM:   To tank Eremes, the best way is to be behind it before the orbs explode. You will be in a tight place to tank, but gives plenty of space for your team whenever there are orb's curses inflicting them (Ring/Circle AoE explosions, Orb Haze, and DoT).  This one takes practice, but it's generally a circle tanking + wall tank combined in a sense. You have to circle tank and make it face toward the wall so that the breath is near the walls.  You don't really have to do that since everyone will have to look around anyways, but you do want to be the last to get out from the cage in case you need to stun it.   But overall, your tactics are fine from what I'm understanding."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,Idi0ticGenius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:04:40 2015 UTC,"Not-so-secret bug for AINM/AIHM.  You can actually glitch the fimbrilisk by mounting the whole way. Run into the arena on your mount, draw aggro and start running away from him until he starts plodding after you (not jumping/leaping/pouncing whatever). If you do that, somehow you will never lose aggro no matter how much dps is being dealt. Then you just keep running in small circles and allow your dps to chase him around and kill him without him using a single skill.  If you get hit, the glitch will stop and the fight will continue as per normal. Running on foot works as well but the extra movespeed from the mount really helps."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,Acerolion,2,Mon Jul 20 05:06:42 2015 UTC,"Don't do this for AINM, it's not worth the loss of backcrits, and it makes the run go much slower. However, if the whole group is unfamiliar with the fimbrilisk's attacks, this is a safe workaround."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,xSetsuko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:19:10 2015 UTC,"^ Yeah, usually this is done for AIHM to ensure a deathless run for first boss so no one gets demoralised and throw a hissy fit.  It's good to know, though."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,Acerolion,0,Mon Jul 20 05:21:31 2015 UTC,"It's definitely good practice just to get the glitch down pat, but once you get it going you should break the glitch and get it over with. Nearly every AIHM run does this glitch, just to avoid the endless deaths of leather/cloth."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,xSetsuko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:39:46 2015 UTC,"ehh... I don't really like it. it's boring to do merry-go-round with Fimbrilisk. Really, it kills the joy of being a tank, struggling to block and hold aggro for party/raid. I'd really rather chase down a BAM to get aggro back than doing this ""glitch"".  But yea, it's great for a run with people who aren't experienced and/or are not really comfortable fighting it."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,Idi0ticGenius,0,Mon Jul 20 06:57:06 2015 UTC,"It's definitely for people who aren't comfortable with fimbrilisk movements. Groups that I've run with can't read its dashes, and many of them end up dying to it constantly. It's just safer overall in a PUG'd LFG."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,xSetsuko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:18:50 2015 UTC,"This 100x, but for AIHM too, the boss isn't hard enough to justify doing this for your bad dps/healers. We kill him in about a minute tops if the tank keeps him facing one direction. If you do this every run you'll never get used to a fimbrilisk."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,Goorman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"It's more if people are wiping during the double dash. I only glitch it if there's more than 1 or 2 people dying every dash. Usually it's the slow people on Leather/Cloth classes, or undergeared Metal classes."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,xSetsuko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I just want to clarify one thing. When you said I should tank the AIHM 3rd boss in the center to avoid dying to circles, did you mean me or the dps? I've found tanking him near the wall means he can't put a circle behind me so I can just block and be fine."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,Idi0ticGenius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:48 2015 UTC,"If that's easier for you, then it is fine. I just find it inconvenient to wall tank because I see the circles overlap on the blockable one, ultimately killing me with 40k per hit on those circles. I mean, it looks like you haven't had that experience, but I had really bad experience where the circles literally overlap where I couldnt escape and ended up eating 40k damage 3 times to the face and die."
TeraOnline,3dw3tt,Goorman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:26:12 2015 UTC,"Try not to tank near the entrances for Kuma/AI Bosses, as the bosses sometimes will go past it and reset. As I'm not a tank I wont give you ill advice to more specifics."

TeraOnline,3dx616,Luke5815,2,Mon Jul 20 07:18:28 2015 UTC,+12 Wroth gloves + Wroth belt with Schisma weapon and full fulminate is the most effective budget build for good damage. MWing Wroth and +12ing it is MUCH easier than +12 Schisma. I kind of almost regret MW+12ing my Schisma gloves and just rolling with a Wroth set for the rest of the patch. There really is no DPS difference.
TeraOnline,3dx616,Caekie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:32 2015 UTC,"Schisma chest is a pretty substantial boost due to the skill roll, the schisma gloves are slight at best, giving like 2.25% aspd.  Of course you gain both of these bonuses with Disco itself as well, so if you're already in disco armor there's not really any point in upgrading to anything besides gen or lucid."
TeraOnline,3dx616,Xivaxi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:14 2015 UTC,"If possible you'd actually prefer getting a +12 gen/lucid glove for the bonus 3% damage.

TeraOnline,3dx616,Acerolion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:22:58 2015 UTC,"Wroth is only better than Fulminate if you enchant it, and even tho, the improvement is not very high, so yeah, as DPS, you could just focus on Weapon and Gloves and go for Schisma directly, as it will save you a lot of gold"

TeraOnline,3dx616,Idi0ticGenius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:25:43 2015 UTC,"generally, the good rolls on gloves for DPS are: 1. Crit factor 2. Power 3. Attack Speed 4. Endurance    I'm not putting them in ""priority order"" since some people rather have one over the other, but you really want top 3.  Endurance isn't the best roll, but some people roll it instead of Crit Factor... well, at least, I've seen quite a few around. I honestly prefer top 3 though."
TeraOnline,3dx616,Roukanken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:26:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely top 3, since they are only damage-increasing rolls."

TeraOnline,3dw49s,AhriKyuubi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"What is your current gear? Innerwear is the most cost inefficient source of crit there is, so unless you get lucky from a loot box, I would buy your innerwear last.  I would focus on getting good rolls on all of your gear. If you have Schisma/Gene weapon and gloves, buy at least T2 permanent etchings. If you are in lower tier gear, buy a bunch of 3 day etchings.  If you have all of that, then yea save up for innerwear. But save up for the yellow innerwear. If you are going to save and buy innerwear, buy the best of the best. On AV the average value is like 50k, so it might be some work, but you don't want to buy lower gear that you will want to replace later anyways.  Lastly, are you making use of the crit glyph on Nova? Iirc a Sorcs rotation opens with: Celerity > Nova > OC > Fireblast. This is to give Fireblast both OC and the bonus crit."

TeraOnline,3dzf0t,tfhcn,10,Mon Jul 20 19:47:54 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that your assertion isn't quite right.  It depends on how you use Reddit.  If you use the front page and numerous subscriptions, then posts which get higher scores will take the top slots and posts with lower scores can get pushed off of your front page.  If you mostly stick to one sub and go directly to that sub's page, then you're correct that it has little effect on a lower volume of posts.  As for how to vote, well, top level submissions are supposed to be voted on based on a user's preference for the material.  Maybe some conflate the Reddiquette guideline not to vote on comments based on preference but rather on contribution with text submissions which can and should be voted on your preference for that type of submission.  I understand that individuals may come to believe that it's personal (they might think ""I got downvoted"", rather than ""my post got downvoted""), but that isn't how Reddit is supposed to work.  When a text submission is made (as opposed to a comment) that receives downvotes, it is probably better to ask oneself how to improve submission quality in the future.  You can use a sub like a petri dish for posting quality and let your submissions live or die by the vote, but each sub has its own culture (pun intended) and often it's best to feel out what kind of stuff is acceptable first before diving in.  If you see a downvote of your submission as a personal affront, perhaps you just don't understand Reddit.  Finally, it should be noted that if a question is particularly low effort, then please help us out by (hopefully politely) directing the user to the resource and reporting the post.  Low-effort posts are against the sub rules and we'll remove them at discretion.  The criteria I typically use are:   Google or Reddit's search quickly answers it with current resources.  The sub isn't a search engine for lazy people to get others to do research for them. It's super broad or really subjective to the point of uselessness. They obviously did no homework at all on their own question.  Example:  tell me everything about TERA while I install the client."

Then, gather the following: if weapon: ores and essence if armor: ores, hides (drops from mobs in which tiers depend on level, but you can buy from broker now for cheap on low tiers), and fibers if alchemy: ores, essence, and fibers. if Etching: Scarabs (rare material found from gathering), titan's ease/ember (rare drop from end game dungeon or battle ground reward boxes)   Crafted gears are not worth it unless it's end-game gear, which is currently Wroth and Schisma. They aren't different from the wroth/schisma that drops in dungeon. Lucid is another end-game gear that's the best in this patch and it is only crafted, but that will take a lot longer since you have to grind a lot for the materials. The materials are dropped from various dungeons, but you first have to get <Ancient Smith Rune> or something to get the quest for getting the gear designs."

TeraOnline,3dwrlp,r1bsteak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:28:54 2015 UTC,"Alchemy crafts consumables like potions, scrolls, heavens elixir, and such. They make constant income by selling the highest tier potions and scrolls only.  Etchers make an Etching which is like a scroll adding a bonus status to weapons and armors. It is extremely important for endgame players and very hard to make so it makes a big money if you are lucky with permanent etching."

Those two are the highest tier gear and require quite a bit of grinding to get full set.  Okay. Etching is an item that applies to your gear that grants a bonus line of stay yo your weapon/gear. If you Inspect some other heavily geared player you might see a line that says Pumped etching, energetic etching, keen etching, etc. It basically adds a whole new line of stat depending on what kind of etching it is.  You will see: Weapon: Energetic: increase attack speed and decrease cool down (some low tier don't have cool down reduction) pumped: add power. keen: add crit factor.    Armor: Grounding: add endurance. Unyielding : add crit resist (mostly used for PvP only)"

But gathering materials never hurts, it gives you nice buffs and if you don't use the materials you can still easily sell them :)"
TeraOnline,3dwrlp,Wakabala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:48:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, gathering materials. You should also keep any hides and runes, they're used for armour/weapon crafting. Optionally you might want to keep any uncommon materials that you collect while gathering (like god tears and idyllic leafs), these are used for late game stuff, but you might want to sell them on the broker for now.    Once you've reached the skill limit for one particular type of crafting (weapon crafting for example), you can sell/throw away the materials and refined materials that were required for that skill level, you won't need them again.    An example would be krymetal ore. Refining these into krymetal ingots will get you up to skill level 50, after which they become useless, so you can sell them and move onto linmetal ore, which will take you up to skill level 100. Be sure to use them to level both weapon crafting and armour crafting to skill level 50 before getting rid of them. You can use ore for alchemy too, I think they can be used to make scrolls, but it's best to make healing elixirs, as these are more profitable.    Ore is used for weapons and armour, fibers are used for health potions, and essences are used for mana potions.    Crafting can be very expensive, but you can make a little profit while doing it. For weapon/armour crafting, the, cheapest and most profitable way is to refine the ore into ingots, selling the ingots on the broker. For alchemy, the best way is to craft healing elixirs - make about 30 and keep these for yourself, selling the rest on the broker, the later level potions sell for quite a bit."
TeraOnline,3dwrlp,oristomp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:03:25 2015 UTC,"yeah, i'm level 53 gunner and over time i've gathered many ores, hides and runes from killing monsters. most of them are cheap so i just bank them, but the more expensive ones like the scarabs, god tears and the leafs, i sell them on the broker to get some gold; did i do the right thing? or should i have kept them?  also another thing about skill levels, i'm assuming the whole point of levelling up ur skil level is so you gain access to better gear? cuz right now, i don't really see a point in crafting, why not sell all your materials and just buy the gear you want from the broker? wouldn't that be easier? why do people still craft?"
TeraOnline,3dwrlp,r1bsteak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:16:08 2015 UTC,"You can sell that stuff on the broker if you want, they're not too difficult to farm, and by the time you need them, you should have enough gold to buy them yourself from the broker.    The whole point of crafting is to get to master skill level (artisan), so you can craft end game stuff. The skill level cap for each of the 5 areas (weapons, armour, alchemy, etching and alliance) is 500, after which you take a test which needs to be completed through crafting tasks, after completing the test the cap is raised to 800 and you become an artisan of that area.    You can only master one area at a time, if you've mastered weapon crafting but decide to master armour crafting instead, you have to use an item that will reset your artisan status for weapon crafting. The item can be purchased for about 20g from one of the vendors in each crafting area, I forget what it's called but it's a fruit of some kind, it lowers your skill level back to the 500 cap, and you lose all the artisan recipes you learned (some rare recipes cannot be bought from a vendor). A way around this is to have additional characters, mastering each crafting area.    Once you've mastered a particular area, you can begin to craft end game stuff, it costs a lot, but you can make a lot of gold from selling the result on the broker. If you master alchemy, you can make stuff like tier x healing and mana potions, or hijka oil - which is used in crafting master level weapons and also sells for a lot on the broker.    Mastering armour crafting will allow you to craft end game armour, which also sells for a lot on the broker, and if you hit a crit while crafting the gear, it can result in additional enchantments.    It costs a lot of gold and time to get there, but once you're an artisan you can end up making a lot of gold from it."
TeraOnline,3dwrlp,oristomp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:27:00 2015 UTC,and being an artisan in any of the 5 areas are all profitable? like is there one area where you can get a lot of gold from

Also, gear can and will drop and dropped versions will get masterworked easier which saves u money. So u save money twice not using crafted weapons (ofc VM is crafted only but thats another kind).  The only reason to have a profession is to make money using up your PP, that´s it.  Everything else is situational and not worth it for you, i maybe even doubt weaponcrafting being usefull for most of the people that are using it."
TeraOnline,3dwrlp,iLoveKuchen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:48:27 2015 UTC,"Youre contradicting yourself a bit with the first statement. If a guildie or friend is crafting it for you then it isnt useless at all, it holds some significance at that point. I've crafted ambit/disco armor for my friends before because I had a lot of mats for those laying around. I can even craft wroth and maybe schisma if I can get design, though I've not seen but heard.   Weapon crafting and armor crafting are indeed still in dad for oils. I need weapon crafter's ostatak oils to craft while ethers néed my Aterstod oils. I make good money too, sometimes as low as 70g per oil or upto 150g each at highest I've sold. Trust me, oils sell extremely well. Hell, even brooches used to be worth it, being 90k+, which now dropped to like 45k,  Also, you don't just use pp if you're etcher. You are literally sacrificing nearly all of your potential gold making materials, risking failure to hopefully succeed in making permanent etching for profit or make an ephemeral etching with great loss."
TeraOnline,3dwrlp,Idi0ticGenius,2,Mon Jul 20 10:30:33 2015 UTC,"You're not giving enough information on what you need help on specifically. What you said is a bit too broad to help out, but generally crafting is pretty easy. First, if you haven't done so, there's a crafting quest for you ""first crafted weapon"". It's nothing much but it'll tell you very basics of crafting.    As for gathering materials, it is painful since you kinda do have to sit around finding hides, ores, fibers, or essence. just go outside in the map and gather whatever you find and refine them.     If you mean crafting some gear that you've found from some dungeon, they aren't worth crafting. Only thing that is worth crafting for Armor and weapon are schisma (maybe wroth, but I'd stick with fulminate set until schisma).   If Alchemy, you want to gather a lot of ore, fiber, and essence, preferably more of higher tier ones. I used to stock up on these just to get my priest get master alchemy in 2 days or so. (because I also had crafter's cure stacked from elite perks.).  for Etching, this one is literally give or take, you can profit a huge load or lose a lot of gold trying. This one takes a real luck on RNG tbh... materials are hard to get by too. they're also RNG drops from gathering (scarabs) or rare dungeon drops (titan's ember/ease). Also you have to crit to get another material you need for crafting (white dendrite, titan's fire/peace, etchings)..."

Some areas like outside dungeon entrances or in towns. Otherwise no matter what, stunning backhand keeps them in the same place meaning that there's no room for desync. In this scenario, Overhand strike can move you forward enough that you miss the hit box entire if the target is right in front of you. Only was to have desync is if they moved away somehow while stunned and unless they're a gunner that can't happen, so just aim where they were you stunned them."

TeraOnline,3dvqqm,gr00grams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:51:46 2015 UTC,"Better where? You don't need enrage when you can keep the boss' back to the dps the entire time (imo). I see this skill touted so much, but I don't think it's that important unless you can't maintain aggro. It's a dps spike, sure, but nothing you can't make without. It would be overpowered on zerk, because of the infinite block.  Where does it out play?   I have all three tanks, and honestly don't see it. Lancer has some group buffs, but those to me do not outweigh how much nicer it is to PLAY zerk tank. Like, playing as the tank, zerk is easily most enjoyable, simply because you have no mana/RE management. The only thing you need worry about is aggro.  If you mod your glyphs right, I feel they are just as/if not MORE tanky as the others too, especially warrior. 16 Endurance on the one shout, mocking shout immune to KD and stagger, 3 giant heals, immune to death for 8-10 sec, you can lock a boss in place with doom shout, on and on.  For me playing as a tank, there is just no comparison."
TeraOnline,3dvqqm,fluffy-tails,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:01 2015 UTC,"Having no Infuriate and 3% less endurance debuff is actually really big. Infuriate isn't just for restoring aggro. Enraging bosses when they're not enraged during shield phases is very important (Dreadspire Mayana 15% shield phase, Sky Cruiser Endeavor bosses, even when Nightmare Yana gets the Sun buff and loses enraged status). Every tank can hold aggro perfectly fine tbh, it's just a matter of skill and not being undergeared. And besides, warrior tanks hold aggro way better than zerk tanks.  Lancers have 25 endurance glyph on their shout and Rallying Cry, and Warriors still have more survivability with more Rolls, DFA, and more mobility in general. The only thing that zerks better survivability wise is Unbreakable."
TeraOnline,3dvqqm,gr00grams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"Untrue most of it (not the enrage part);  Mocking shout gives 40k weakening res, makes immune stun and stagger.  The no decay shout gives 16 endurance, and with tank stance matches the same endurance totals as lancer/warrior. You can check yourself to verify.  Unchained heals you for 10k. Tenacity doubles balance, and heals you for 12% hp. Vampire heals over 15k. Unbreakable: cannot die for 10 sec. Doom shout: Nothing can move.  I have all three tanks, and zerk/lancer feel equal in tankiness, but warrior is definitely a distant third. Not even close to zerk/lancer after their update. Zerk has evasive just like warrior, infinite block, heavier armour. Axe counter is also a 50% reduction in damage taken.  I will concede the enrage bit, I still think it minor, but it is a point."
TeraOnline,3dvqqm,Angelicel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"Enrage isn't as unimportant as people think, and for one just simply being easy doesn't make it better. Your losing alot of dps and 3% endurance from the get go that zerkers cannot supply.  With the new schisma sets being able to roll double enrage damage this just makes this an even bigger loss."
TeraOnline,3dvqqm,gr00grams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's all fairly equal to be honest. EDIT* I don't think enrage is unimportant. I think it's valued to high is all. It's not a make/break skill. It's nice, but nothing you can't live without. With high dps, bosses will be enraged most of the time as is.   I can say for certain, zerk in tank mode deals way more damage than the other two still, this is using axe counter off block, with the 20% power on block glyph (which is always on for how much you block). This I feel equalizes the 3% loss. A zerk tank still deals incredibly high damage for a tank.  Being easier does indeed make it better. It's no different than priest is better because it's easier. It has better skills for the situations. Zerk is the same. I have both Priest and Mystic, and priest is waaaay easier to carry a whole group with, and the reason is because it's easier. Same for gunner as dps. It's tops because it's the easiest class in the entire game.  A live example for zerk, is you can round up a whole group of mobs and put your back to a wall, and hold block. Other tanks can do this, but have to eat a lot of hits to keep their RE up. Zerk doesn't. From my healer perspective, I can easily see this getting them almost killed many times. I've also dealt with it as the tank on the other classes.  For instance, to proc axe counter, you don't even need to let go of block. You can hold block, do axe counter to raze to flatten while never releasing the block key, so you are immediately blocking after. It's on a 5 sec timer, and also a 50% reduction.   On my warrior, after Death From Above, you have to eat hit(s), because of the animation. There is a 1-2 second window where you cannot do anything. Same for Torrent of blows, you have to eat hits even with the 50% reduction to maintain RE. Warrior has to eat a lot of hits that zerk just doesn't. You don't need to eat any hits as zerk.  Enrage would be incredibly OP on zerk tank because of how easy it would be to manage the enrage. No RE/mana management is a huge deal, and should not be underestimated simply because of how easy it makes things. It can be extremely hard to manage enrage on my warrior due to RE management. It can get you wasted."
TeraOnline,3dvqqm,TheMantello,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:33:58 2015 UTC,"Having no enrage is a pretty big loss.   Enraging at the beginning of a fight allows DPS to utilize the focus crystal damage throughout the entire encounter.   Zerkers can only do 6% in endurance reduction, compared to 9% Lancer Debilitate and 8.4% warrior TC and CS. I'm not sure how long the cd is on evasive roll, but Lancers have a 4 second backstep and warriors have 3 rolls and a dfa for iframes.   In a perfect setting, Tanks will be blocking/iframing everything and shouldn't be taking damage in the first place so the Zerker healing is irrelevant."

I think it's what the player prefers;  Enrage is nice. I will not dispute that. However, tanking on zerk is so much nicer than either warrior or lancer. I have all three, and it's night and day. No RE or mana is massive, massive.  6% endurance on a skill that also gains aggro, and can be glyphed for an additional 100%.  In a perfect setting, this is how easy zerk is;  Hold block. Counter with axe when it pops up every 5 sec, with 100% aggro glyph on it. You really don't need to do anything else.. it's that easy.  The healing is never irrelevant because it's also tied to other things, and you're going to take chip etc. damage. It's unavoidable.  Best answer I can give you, is try it. You see it right away.

TeraOnline,3ducrt,13moonsago,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:02:57 2015 UTC,It makes healing so much easier when people take less damage because they have the correct crystals.  Armor crystals that make you run faster and regen health don't help when you get one-shot because you don't have enough defence.
TeraOnline,3ducrt,cerb20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"when they don't have the right crystals, they're kinda making it a worse run for everyone else, because the healer has to heal them more than the others and res them more often. It takes time away from doing other stuff, like healing other group members or buffing them or providing them with mana. All that just because they couldnt take a minute to study that login window, that tells them exactly what crystals they should be using."

TeraOnline,3ducrt,psithyrus,2,Sun Jul 19 19:34:51 2015 UTC,"Sadly there is no way to measure a good healer. You can tell the tank is good because they won't lose aggro and will have great positioning, the good dps won't take damage and we'll they will kill things fast but no one notices the constant uptime of e-stars/triple nem or the mana charge being used off CD. It's the sad truth.. if you want to be recognised for playing a class well healers do get the short end of that stick. Most priests however don't even use half their kits and it blows my mind when I ask myself what the hell they are doing with their downtime.. I'm able to do all of the above I mentioned and I still find myself standing around so when I see priests auto attacking instead of mana charging I do cringe."

For some reason they decided we didn't need a tank and we could just have more DPS instead... We truly did our best with a group of people that ran off in different directions and wouldn't listen to anything...

Had to push out so much healing due to idiocy that I went OOM in seconds, we wiped, half the raid wouldn't resurrect and then did only to start the boss early and lock everyone but 3 people out (I was stuck outside the gate too).

The fourth combo is on the numerals above w. Please rebind your combo key to something else. Don't want to execute Death Spiral when you want to jump.

This makes it look like SS hit to the side of the target despite actually landing in front of him. However, the aoe first appears on the spot where the animation lands, but it disappears shortly afterwards without ""exploding"". So, it basically takes a few seconds for the game to realize it messed up and move the aoe to the spot where SS -really- landed.  I've never had that happen to me, tho. Maybe I'm just too slow :P"

To answer your question, no, there's no rolls on weapons or gloves the reduce aggro. However, like mentioned above, there ARE eclipse potions, and your Feign Death to help you.

I know about the positioning, but when I'm playing my sorc and aim for the back crit on a move that has a long cast time and the boss suddenly turns, or if I balder's on my gunner and suddenly I hit him from the front and do 1/10th of the damage, it's just a little depressing. I recognize that it's probably my fault though, expecting bosses to stay still for so long."
TeraOnline,3dui9f,HuntertheMaster,-4,Sun Jul 19 18:27:32 2015 UTC,Generally speaking tanks should be able to wall tank without problems. What can hinder it though is if the tank lose aggro a lot. Most of the time the tank losing aggro resluts in some boss juming across the map and the tank having to chase it around to regain aggro. If the tank is geared enough for his/her DPSes wall tanking is easy (as long as the tank can handle the horrible visibility that comes with wall tanking).

TeraOnline,3dui9f,HuntertheMaster,2,Sun Jul 19 21:23:35 2015 UTC,See my reply on the parent comment for why wall tanking is not optimal.

TeraOnline,3dui9f,Chiral_Systems,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:05:12 2015 UTC,"Wall tanking is bad habit to get into.  When the boss turns around, you're putting the DPS in a situation where they can't get back damage/have higher risk.  More mobile classes can dodge behind the boss, but not all classes have iframes to spare just to do that."
TeraOnline,3dui9f,neotheone87,4,Mon Jul 20 01:56:28 2015 UTC,"Eh it varies from group to group, specifically who is tanking, but I find that even with eclipse I will always rip aggro. Most +15 gen gunners will. It just comes down to the +15s slowing down their rotations for the benefit of the raid, or if they see that the raid's dps is completely abyssmal (floormats etc), they will simply solo the boss for you. There are very few attacks that geared individuals need to dodge, so they have considerably greater dps uptime than other players. Eclipse helps, but it has its limitations and primarily relies on the tank properly holding aggro."
TeraOnline,3dui9f,Purple_Engram,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:18:37 2015 UTC,+14 gen gunner here. I rip aggro from anyone not running at least +12 schisma (or really good tanks with +12 disco or better) and then promptly place myself next to the tank so boss at least stays in the same general location. I'd just rather dps all out and move to a more optimal position for other people to dps as well. Idc if a lose a little dps in the process as much of mine is coming from AB anyway and I can reliably back crit most bosses from the front with AB.
TeraOnline,3dui9f,Purple_Engram,4,Mon Jul 20 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"If, as a tank, you are finding DPS pulling aggro even with Eclipse V's, then you should think about investing in some Nostrums, Crit Power Scrolls and Bravery/Canerphora potions yourself."
TeraOnline,3dui9f,Purple_Engram,-7,Sun Jul 19 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"As a tank I have Attack speeds scrolls, braveries and nocs up 100% of the times(unless I'm the one overgeared).

TeraOnline,3dui9f,nevu,3,Sun Jul 19 21:22:44 2015 UTC,"To exaggerate: I half-gave up on taking aggro back in AINM/AIHM tbh... and there's not much need since majority of people don't care. There are some who throw such a huge bitchfit about it and become butthurt to everyone too.    To be serious: It hurts to see that I can't hold aggro. Sometimes I question whether I should really spend all my MWA and feedstocks to try to go for +15 on my VM4 lance. A lot of times I hold pretty decent, but sometimes, especially in raid, idk whether it's me or DPS because I can't see half of the team's buff bar to check if they have eclipse potion popped.    But to be fair to them though, I can take aggro back easily when I just pop either infuriate, quickcarve/empowered brooch, or adrenaline rush, but really the CD on those are 5m /3m /2m respectively. It's still not enough with the increased threat generation buff lancer just got, though it does take aggro much faster.   Neither the OP nor I are saying  that eclipse should be a must, but please be considerate for the tanks that wants to learn the dungeon. I know we like to clear the dungeons fast but if you have a new tank, clearly they won't have the same consumables as experienced players, who would have scrolls, food items, nostrums, canerphora or bravery pots, etc. Sometimes it's safer and faster to not pop everything and go extreme ham.   Seriously, if you're not going to be considerate, please don't flame tanks.  now, if the tank is literally doing nothing but block and/or dodge, that's a whole different story.... ...I used to be one so I know;;;"

TeraOnline,3dui9f,random4lyf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:30:20 2015 UTC,"Please don't forget, I've noticed a lot of players over looking this. When a player dies, aggro gets reset. so the next person to cause dmg after someone dies gets aggro, the boss gets moved around and it's easy to lose aggro this way. If no one dies in the group it should be relatively easy to hold aggro permanently. With these 10-man raids a lot of people get singled out and picked off like flies,   It's up to the DPS and the healer to help you maintain aggro also!  I saw this situation a few days ago everyone kept dying and blaming the lancer for not holding aggro, but what I saw is that the dps was face tanking every hit and dying to much, so I stuck up for the lancer, called out the dps and just dropped."
TeraOnline,3dui9f,lazybutter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:06 2015 UTC,I've never had an instance matched tank that I didn't rip aggro from while doing regular DPS with no consumables except Eclipse. At this point I just pop everything and do half of the damage myself while also holding aggro.

Just because you see a zerk tank with fulminate, doesn't mean they can't hold aggro if you help them out a bit. All I ask for is Eclipse III+ and it seems to work."

With Berserkers being the exception, that there is no DPS loss with going 100% Crit on all pieces of gear because of the way their Crit Glyphs behave.

Ring AoE Explosion (Left Orb) 2. Circle AoE Explosion (Right Orb) 3. Orb Haze/ a.k.a stun or sleep (Top and Bottom Orb) 4. DoT (Top and Bottom) or 5. Orb buffs dragon. (Top and Bottom from what I've tested so far during fight with Hemera)  First 4 curses appear in the first room with 3 orbs as random targeting.   That AoE is not casted by the dragon, but the orb. The orb will rotate while the AoE appear. This is completely normal and during the fight with Hemera, it always target the person with the highest aggro as the center-- which should be the Tank 90% of the time. This is only in fight with Hemera and the AoE explosion ""curses"" only. Orb Haze and DoT are inflicted on all party members.  When you fight Eremes though, it's complete RNG which orb curse your party will suffer, as well as random target on AoE explosions."

If you really want to, you can start to gather any nodes you find lying around to level up your gatherings.  For early level warriors, you really don't get a good feel of warrior until levels 28 and 60. At level 28, you get Traverse Cut and Blade Draw, two of your most important skills. At level 60, you get Scythe, which is going to be about 30 to 40% of your DPS end game. At level 21, I would just start to focus on basic chains, such as Combative Strike into Rain of Blows (it doesn't say this on the tooltip of RoB, but CS speeds it up too).   http://i.imgur.com/wsVyx6r.jpg - These are my keybindings. You don't have to copy them exactly, but it's a good start to learn which skills are important. Also, I do not recommend pressing your Spacebar for any skill except Retaliate.

TeraOnline,3drvu7,w0bbelr,-7,Sun Jul 19 05:23:58 2015 UTC,"They play the easiest class, then they say they are playing the hardest class. Every problem they have is easy to fix, but they are so focused on doing it another not as good way. And every Warrior ever can take more than half your hp in 1 stun lock that takes absolutely no skill, there is no aiming, there is minimal thinking, it's all in timing which is so fucking easy.  When I see a warrior talk about Giga Leash being good and Binding Sword is not I instantly know that he is not thinking hard enough on how to play his class.  Warriors are the class you should go to if you are bad at the game mechanically, since everything they do is decision based, which is super easy. It's just, it's so easy to not be dumb, but to land abilities, and close gaps against good kiters, that's actually difficult stuff that requires skill. Unless ofc your a warrior, training wheels take care of that."
TeraOnline,3drvu7,ThePurpleKnightmare,2,Sun Jul 19 16:09:49 2015 UTC,"Apart from ping constraints, there are no classes that is mechanically challenging in PvP as long as you can aim. 100% of PvP beyond being able to aim, dodge and execute class bread and butter combos is decision based for all classes.  I honestly will never understand a reaper complaining that there is no skill, no aiming for warriors. I'm pretty sure I can hit everything with my eyes closed on my reaper in a 10m radius."
TeraOnline,3drvu7,Garandou,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:31:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's all aiming, aiming, and kiting is all the skill in this game with exception of a few combos which require quick hands and muscle memory. Such as Berserkers basic attack-block.  Warriors however take away all that skill, there is no aiming on a Warrior, it's easier than tab target cause you don't even need to press tab, you literally just need to hover over the enemy while rapidly spamming the abilities, it's like playing Ryze in LoL, just press W. Beyond that Warriors are the hardest class to kite, and easiest class to not get kited as. They have so many gap closers, and backstab is just so easy. At least with Slayers, if they backstab you can mobility out of it before they do anything meaningful. Warriors press a button and they are on you and nothing you can do.  As for your reaper comment, there are two un-aimed abilities as a reaper. Shadow Burst and Death Spiral, one is on a massive cooldown and is pretty easy to iframe if you aren't CCed, and the other just does no damage. You aim Cable Step, Soul Reversal, Smite, aka the 3 reaper stuns, and while most of their abilities are wider range, they aren't effortless, you still do have to land Whipsaw, Double Sheer, Grim Strike, and Sundering Strike. It's not like I can just press cable step without thinking and then instantly gap close, if I do it without aiming it correctly I will miss and be punished for it. Warriors on the other hand just gotta spam the button it's on."

It sounds bad, but I have to say though, getting 1v1 pick offs actually contributes a ton to the team's score, without being too difficult either.   As a Sorc, I do contribute with team play (throwing down Hailstorm, follow up cc, crippling heals, traps, etc.) but I find my leading contribution to be solo pick offs, whether it be stopping a more experienced/geared player's massacre streak or speeding up our victory by quickly slaughtering lost newbies.   Furthermore, due to the fact that Warrior and Sorc are both two of the most slippery classes, we can easily get away from counter engagements or sticky situations that other classes would normally feed in (and thus, hinder a team's chances of victory)."

TeraOnline,3dr2es,doubleporing,2,Sun Jul 19 14:23:24 2015 UTC,"I rank 1 pretty consistently as a Warrior.   Warriors are never great in large group PvP. If you go with the general strategy in Gridiron and sit in the middle to zerg, you're not going to do well.   IMO you should be running around and getting those crystals, while picking off the lesser geared people with 100-0 backstab combo. Once you get some crystal buffs, you can begin assisting any zerg that is fighting. If I manage to get Toxa+Barrier, I can literally just dive into a zerg and get a few kills.   I tend to take the acceleration statue to move around and secure the crystals better. If you're about to go balls deep, take that anti-stagger statue.  They are also pretty good in a roaming-zerg kind of thing, but that only happens when you get a few good players/healers from your guild and whatnot.   The buffs are really strong for 1v1s and 3v3s, but not so much for larger scale PvP."

Backstab whiffs 50% of the time, due to clipping on invisible walls. Fps drops make it near impossible to take full advantage of attack speed. Even if the stars align and you manage to land a backstab and get a full combo off without desyncing, chances are you will be 100-0 bombed while you are standing still stunlocking someone. Dont get me wrong, warrior is in a pretty good place atm, but Gridiron is trash."
TeraOnline,3dr2es,Forgotten_Aeon,2,Sat Jul 18 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this. If Tera ran the way it was meant to, I think you'd see a lot of what you (and many others) were expecting. But it doesn't, and the result is as sammsorensen said. Any skillshot, non-lock ability suffers (more than they do, I should say- it can still be a huge cunt to lock into anything in that slideshow clusterfuck)."
TeraOnline,3dr2es,Garandou,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"Because it's mass PvP. I'm always in the top 10 even if we lose and often top 1-3 in Gridiron as a warrior but honestly I'm pretty useless in a zerg. AoE effects are simply superior when a lot of players are involved, but if you lurk near the outskirts of the fight you can quite easily 1 combo people (+15 weap and chest, full VM4/5 might have something to do with that lol).  Does it matter when you 1 combo people? Not so much. The gunners, sorcs, archers on your team probably blew their entire team up in the zerg. Or their gunners, sorcs, archers did if you're on the losing team."
TeraOnline,3dr2es,rare,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:15:32 2015 UTC,Honestly at the end of the day it depends on the player.  The reason it's more common to see archer is because they have one of the easiest skill to secure skills.    Range class with aoe will always excel on top. Personally as a sorc I'm always top 3 as well. After that are melee with good aoe skills that are geared enough   It's just the mode honestly and the equipment and play style.  I've seen warriors at the top if they know how to properly pick up kills.

Now what could have happened was an employee knew to seperate the manual with the code before putting the box on the floor and a different employee didn't know to include the manual with the box when it sold to you. Or no one knew to separate the manual and someone stole it out of the box before you bought it.  I'm very sorry that you bought it without knowing you need the manual for the code on the back. Bring the box into the store and say that there was no manual and you need one, they should know most pc games need some kind of code in the box.

TeraOnline,3drtit,Obliu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"Well, let's see.  In CS, it's still mostly the same. Kumasylum is the same, but going away soon AFAIK. In Gridiron however, the most dangerous classes are Gunner/Sorc/Slayer/Reaper. Gunner's have insane damage for the area, and a wonderful kit for just general aoe damage in small closed spaces. Sorc's also have wonderful damage, you can sit on the top and just nuke people. Slayer's have amazing mobility, and great spike damage. This means if you play Assassination Slayer you can get a kill then run away without many problems, making you wonderfully effective at securing kills. Reaper's are, as many have mentioned, highly mobile and hard to kill, with good damage. Reaper's are powerful. Nuff said.  Warrior's in Gridiron are also pretty dangerous, but the top 4 are worlds more dangerous. Priests and Mystics are terrible in Gridiron, and Lancer's/Zerker's really don't do that well. Archer's are pretty strong too, but some of their nerfs make them a lot easier to deal with than the other top 4."

People follow whats op.. When slayers were OP everyone rolled them. Now that its warrior, people are just going back to their old toons. There are still a large diversity of people playing different classes but you'll most likely see more warriors and berserkers in the scene. Just like last patch you saw more Slayers."

I can agree with the list above, put gunners between warrior and zerkers. I am curious why there isnt more sorc and reaper, they got sick buffs and can own a lot if played well. Archers too...such a strong class and yet very few of them, by FAR the least played non healing class and maybe there is even more priest than archers."
TeraOnline,3drtit,zDarkAuroraz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:01:16 2015 UTC,sorcs are op but they just have to land their sleep. if they do not land that its over. You may see some sorcs going on killing sprees but thats just because of the skill difference. If both were evenly matched [Mechanic/Skill wise] it may go in favor of the opponent. Gunner could be placed either with Berserker or Lancer. Gunner DPS/kit just makes it a viable pick in PVP. I dont see it next to warrior because the Warrior class is a combination of Lancer/Slayer. It basically does what both of those classes can do now.

If you can fit in Reaping Slash before Cascade ends, you get another stun. The vault timer doesn't start if the boss is stunned or KDed. This lets you a lot of free time to deal damage. I can very easily get 6770+ with my +15 Tank weapon and Disco1 gloves.  Replace Pounding with Slaying. You should not get a lower score with Slaying unless you don't get crits.

The CDR also effects Iframes and movement skills and larger CDS, even racial actives. It's flat out just better. Then there's the attack speed added to it for a benefit of getting skills off faster.

Gunners are PvE gods, they can do everything as a dps. Warriors are the best PvE tanks, Priests are the best PvE healers.  PvP you can really play whatever you'd like to play.  Watch videos of each class doing end-game content to decide which one looks to be best suited for you, the first 60 levels are not always a good representation of how a class will play. They're all viable, the one's I've listed are just considered the best.  Before even starting change your default key-binds to whatever you use for MMOs or whatever you think you'll be comfortable with so you can get used to it.  Leveling to 65 might take a few days, or weeks depending on how active you are.  If you're looking for a BR specific guild go for it, but from what I've seen the quality of them are lower than the guilds that look for anyone that's skilled, if you're comfortable speaking/typing in English (your post looks pretty solid) you should just try to find a good guild, not a BR exclusive one.

TeraOnline,3dr0eg,narrill,3,Mon Jul 20 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"By not using chain skills I am referring to using spacebar to combo skills together. Combos are dynamic and what portions of combos you should be using change constantly through boss fights. Sometimes you need to gapclose into stun, or skills reset and you need to use the reset. A really interesting example on slayer is overhand strike, when using a ICB it has no cd so the way to get the most dps is to use a skill that chains into overhand. This speeds up the animation of overhand. You than cancel the skill before it hits using overhand, preserving the skill's cd. You repeat this until the steroid runs out. That would be almost impossible using a spacebar so it must be done manually. Using spacebar inhibits learning of mechanics like that."

Sure guides can get you ahead in the end game but if you are starting player, just ask around and people will help you.   I remember when I first started I kinda quit for few months, not because I had a potato computer, but my friend wasn't very willing to help despite him inviting me to play sayin he wanted to level up (he was level 40s at the time).   When I returned, I began to ask around since I knew my friend isn't helping, and learned alost everything I needed to know in just few hours. It took much longer to learn my own class since that is a bit based on your experience so give yourself at least a month to feel comfortable in controls after you reach level 65. That's when you really pay attention to skill rotations, gearing, glyphs and crystals.  To get good gear, you don't have to spend a penny or grind your tits off at all in this patch. Go to Bathysmal rise normal mode after you get idoneal gear to get fulminate, call out ""need"" for the stuff you really need. Then with full fulminate, you can go to acheron's inferno normal mode to get wroth (I would not get it though since it isn't much worthy) or practice for Acherons inferno hard mode- where you get schisma gear. With full schisma you can go to Timescape normalmode and get schisma belt if it drops. And so on.   But to be fair, getting lucid or tensus will require grinding or spending or both.

TeraOnline,3dpvq7,Lethal1313,2,Sat Jul 18 08:11:34 2015 UTC,While doing dungeons at lvl 58-60. That frame can be quite the grind sometimes. Level 60+ story quests by themselves grant enough exp to reach lvl 63. Marcelious Catacombs give quite bit of exp so you can reach max level in a few runs afterwards.
TeraOnline,3dpvq7,pieshels,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:51:06 2015 UTC,"Everywhere that involves monsters. Mainly dungeons.  I am assuming that you are questing while queuing, so basically you have almost no monster-mashing downtime."

Time saved will never be identical."
TeraOnline,3dpvq7,Garandou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"Suppose I grind from 1-65 without doing a single quest doing the best mobs available at any level. The total time it takes to get to level 65 from 1 can be X, X is a sum of a series of uneven level speeds based on how good that level is.  No matter at which point I use the XP boost, the time saved will be identical. E.g. if it's a 2 hour XP boost and the total grind time from 1-65 is 20 hours, it will take me 18 hours no matter when the boost is used."

I don't believe they do but I could be wrong, if I'm wrong you're correct.

Aspd is only really noticeable with mana missiles cast time)"
TeraOnline,3dmt5w,Xivaxi,2,Fri Jul 17 17:01:43 2015 UTC,I've seen this animation cancel thing mentioned a couple of times so if anyone could make a short explanation i would appreciate it T-T

TeraOnline,3dmt5w,hatarkira,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"Yes you can animation cancel a lot of skills with the robot. In a real time situation where you could gain a net dps by having your robot placed at the right spot, or perhaps just sit in an aoe instead of regularly iframing out of a hit, you are able to gain a lot more dps by using it in that fashon rather than just using it to cancel animations regularly."
TeraOnline,3dmt5w,Xivaxi,2,Fri Jul 17 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"I'm talking just baldurs vengeance.  Not generic canceling with robot.  You commented baldurs glyphs aren't worth it because it's dps is comparable with ab... Which it only is if you let that full 3+second wind down occur.  Cancelled baldurs trump ab by quite a bit, and with both glyphs you can usually get 2 monster crits in one fight (at least you could in schm, tshm bosses wouldn't survive long enough so glyphing cd there is kind of pointless  They aren't the greatest glyphs but I mean I have literally seen no use for aspd on a gunner outside of missiles, and would gladly take ANYTHING over those glyphs."
TeraOnline,3dmt5w,Purple_Engram,3,Fri Jul 17 17:25:05 2015 UTC,BV does something like 2x AB damage... once or twice a fight. I don't think spending 11 or so glyph points on that is worth it.
TeraOnline,3dmt5w,Xivaxi,2,Fri Jul 17 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"BV does roughly 2.5x AB damage, 3x glyphed  The issue is there are almost no other worthwhile glyphs for gunners.  Once you have all the main ones, what else are you gonna glyph?  Turret duration/cd?  Aspd?  Stun bomb cd/damage?  I'm skeptical any of those glyphs will provide more damage than having an extra BV or having your BV hit for 2-3m more, though on absurdly short fights like basically everything this patch, bv cd becomes less of an issue since you'll never get to bv twice on anything except possibly dragon and yana."
TeraOnline,3dmt5w,Chiral_Systems,3,Fri Jul 17 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"The reason the glyphs aren't great are because of how many points they take and for what little they really give. The actual value in terms of glyph points it takes to get those per glyph point isn't as highly as valued as the rest. The AB Attack speed glyph is subject to change per person, but as I wrote in my guide I feel it's mandatory for the things you can do with it. Such as when you have the opportunity to stand at 10+ meters, you can AB > Scattershot > Detonate, and still back crit. You can AB > Point blank x2 > Detonate (Getting behind a target if Rocket jump is on CD to do the same thing). Take it if you wish. It's just my guide. You don't have to follow it :)  TLDR: It's worth animation canceling BV for sure. I never do BV without using Recall. It's just not worth picking up glyphs for it whatsoever unless you're doing vault runs or perhaps solo bam farming."
TeraOnline,3dmt5w,ZonerRoamer,2,Fri Jul 17 17:35:29 2015 UTC,"I for one still would disagree taking that AS glyph. From my understanding, the longer AB is in the air (not being detonated), you are losing dps. Yes, filler skills do count for damage as well, but the sheer consistent burst of AB accounts for the majority of gunner total damage output. You yourself mention that replenishment takes priority over filler skills, so in the grand scheme of min/maxing, I only see the glyph and playstyle hindering. Most of the competent gunners I see position themselves at melee range to maximize dps."
TeraOnline,3dmt5w,Garandou,2,Sat Jul 18 01:01:32 2015 UTC,"While you can be at melee range sometimes you may shoot an arcane barrage at a boss that just jumped away and in order for you to get to him faster you need to rocket jump and shoot a blast, or a time bomb before detonating, giving you that extra speed on those attacks. It has it's advantages when things don't always go according to plan. That's why it's useful for those 3 points compared to anything else."
TeraOnline,3dmt5w,heiltdo,2,Sat Jul 18 02:06:32 2015 UTC,I agree with not taking the Balders glyph; even with CDR the 5ish second CD for the skill is way too long and it in fact does lesser damage than a full clip of burst fire.

The collector's edition includes all perks of a regular founder account, plus an exclusive mount (regal frostlion) and some level 15 and 40 jewelry you can claim as many times as you like (only useful for levelling). If you purchase a physical copy of the CE as opposed to just a CE key you also get some physical goodies: a map of Arborea, a Tera-themed compass and a letter of marque from Commander Seir as well as the soundtrack on disc.  And don't forget to enter the code in backwards to get some more free stuff.  Account-bound mounts place the skill book under the account items tab of your item claim. These items are untradable but can be claimed as many times as you like, and hence given to all your characters present and future. The only exception is the Terminus mount (founder mount), which is automatically applied to all your characters, present and future."

The fact that it gives 50% crit chance and 50% cdr hugely changes the values of crit, aspd, cdr, and power while it's active, and particularly influences the choice of brooch you'd use during it.  It seems significant to me considering your dps almost doubles while its up (at least it feels like it), so maximizing output during that timeframe seems like a good idea (or calculating how much of your dps comes while its up compared to while its down)"

TeraOnline,3dmf0f,helpdiene,3,Sat Jul 18 04:05:09 2015 UTC,"Does Vortex -> BD chain DPS value account for the time it takes to do an evasive or DFA? That's the sole reason why I don't force a blade draw in that way as a priority; it takes too long. You might want to mention that if it's the case that it doesn't account for it.  Besides that, nothing in your guide is ""wrong"", but some things I would disagree with doing in practice just because theory tells you to. For example, having a CDR roll at the top and the bottom. It would work great for a target that doesn't ever move, but in practice it's near, if not actually, impossible to get enough rotations out to justify. Even for Nightmare(now-neutered) Darkan/Tempas, the two most back-time friendly bosses, you have to re-position yourself or dodge secondaries enough so that the second CDR doesn't have an impact greater than the other potential rolls - especially with the now lowered cooldowns. Since Warrior chains have the hardest hitting skills at the end, having that 9% attack speed roll at the top is very beneficial for getting out as many rotations as you can before you're interrupted, and in the time to re-position or iframe, your skills will come off cooldown leading back to your most effective chains becoming available again without the need for double CDR.  I'm not talking as a completely intuitively player either, because I'm the same type of theorycrafter as you. I achieved the same mathematical conclusion as you but when I tried it in practice I found it to be underwhelming. It could possibly yield(arbitrary number pulled out of my ass just for the point) 2% better DPS in perfect conditions, but since conditions are never perfect, in even very favorable conditions, double CDR or enraged lines gives results that are at best equal to attack speed.  The same can be said for crit. Although this is a much easier comparison since the other variable is power, which leads to two basic and easily comparable variables that lie in a simple equation. The main issue is that we don't really know how crit rate works. I can't blame you for using *.0018 though, since that's become a standard for measuring crit chance. I can't really objectively say it's wrong either due to a lack of information. I can tell you though that the actual chance is statistically significantly lower than that and it varies from boss to boss; the fact that crit resistance is a stat should make this fairly obvious. This fact skewers the graph in favor of power. The only reason I mention this is because in the guide it was said that Edgetock + Deathwise is the best when I found it very underwhelming sitting at +291 crit. The end tradeoff for using Deathwise instead of Forcetock was something like 36 crit for 26 power, which is a poor ratio for crit. The rest of the choices are fairly straightforward and good though. There's also the whole thing where crit loses most of its effectiveness when not hitting from the back, but I won't use this argument since it's actually feasible to re-position to always hit the back, and this time the time taken to re-position doesn't directly affect the potency of the crit stat itself unlike how this issue did with CDR. There's also the tragedy of when you iframe E-Stars which inevitably happens no matter how coordinated you are with your priest, making power a more valuable stat during that time. A side effect of this point is that it also makes the attack speed line previously discussed more valuable in the cases where E-Stars was dodged.  Those things being said, you did a very good job on ordering the priority of the rotations to show other people which ones are the best. I do understand that this is an objective mathematical based guide, but perhaps you should mention my points above. Basically, showing things like crit vs power, or the what highest DPS rotations are work well in both practice and theory, but things like CDR and attack speed don't. I think you should keep the part analyzing the value of those things in theory, but at the same time mention what they do in practice."
TeraOnline,3dmf0f,CelestialRice,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:40:11 2015 UTC,"I was going to type up mostly the same points, mainly the edgetock + deathwise and the vortex > BD chain.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that he's assuming that it doesn't include the DFA/roll time, which would be ok if the boss doesn't turns around often, since you'd pretty much constantly have be able to use it.  In the case of bosses that don't turn much, this is more difficult since you still have to fit in roll/DFA for the attack speed uptime, but the glyph page he linked doesn't have DFA glyphed for attack speed.  I haven't done actual math to know if it's better to DFA or dodge to try and proc the attack speed, but DFA is guaranteed damage and higher proc chance, albeit slower to pull off.  I'm assuming that in this case, you'd want to dodge and animation cancel into scythe (requires low ping to be optimal).  In addition, I don't think the bonus damage from being lower HP is taken into account for rising fury damage.  I often take hits on purpose to increase the damage on this, but again, I don't have any solid calculations on how much of a difference it actually makes.    Overall, though, very solid guide with plenty of details on the math behind things, which is exactly what I like to see."

Yeah, that's what I figured. You should clarify that in the guide.   If you can consistently do red rotation without double CDR, then roll enraged damage. I will add this to the guide.   I think you don't get my point. Math makes you objectively right in theory, but not in practice. You just restated what I already knew from my own calculations, and from reading your guide. Enraged damage is better on paper, but I'm telling you that in a practical situation attack speed is better in most cases. If you want to swear by the math, more power to you, but I'd suggest not writing it in a way that suggests that it's absolute and ""objective"" because due to the nature of AI and other variables in practice, the objectivity in theory does not translate to objectivity in practice. If you want to talk about it in terms of your red and blue rotations, CDR won't help you do the rotation due to aforementioned reasons, and Enraged damage won't let you finish the end of the rotation before the boss turns.   Preliminary DPS meter results from last patch suggest the real value is very close to 0.0018.   Hmm, is that so? If this is true then it may be worth always having 10 crit on belt instead of 3/6."

Enraged damage is better on paper, but I'm telling you that in a practical situation attack speed is better in most cases   I can see you saying attack speed > CDR because of dodging but I cannot see attack speed > enrage. Why? Because unless it's something about making dodging easier, enrage simply gives a better % damage increase compared to attack speed EVEN if we ignore the fact that attack speed forces you to use more fillers.   Hmm, is that so? If this is true then it may be worth always having 10 crit on belt instead of 3/6.   If you check the graph for scythe accounted power vs crit it is quite reasonable to be near the line where 1 power = 1 crit, so 3 power isn't a huge issue compared to 4 crit."
TeraOnline,3dmf0f,CelestialRice,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:38:12 2015 UTC,"I cannot see attack speed > enrage. Why?   Ok, so for example, let's say you're fighting Tempas. He's in the middle of his breath attack, meaning that the tank is about to rotate the boss 90 degrees. With the attack speed roll, you're able to complete a charging slash -> blade draw -> scythe on the back before Tempas completes his turn. With an enraged damage roll, you would need to evasive roll after blade draw to re-position yourself before scything in order to get a back crit. This situation is actually extremely common on all bosses, but sometimes it comes in the form of having to interrupt your chain with an iframe instead of a rotation.  Oh, one other thing I mentioned. I don't think edge = 1000 base damage is a proper value. Blade draw has ~4500 base damage with the chest roll and glyphed, and the second hit ONLY of my blade draw hits ~1.4m while my scythe hits ~2.9m. You may want to test the damage some more to get a better accurate base damage representation for scythe."

With an enraged damage roll, you would need to evasive roll after blade draw to re-position yourself before scything in order to get a back crit.   With energy star or speed proc alone an average warrior functions at 170~ attack speed, this makes 9% attack speed even in ideal situations worth about 6-7% faster animations. If it takes 2 seconds for the boss to turn, the difference between accidentally front critting scythe from a charging->bd->scythe because of enrage roll is a window of just over 0.1 seconds out of 2 seconds. I don't think this scenario is really that common if we look at it from a probabilistic perspective.  And what difference does your scenario even make? I'm doing charging->BD->scythe->roll behind->rotation or charging->BD->roll behind->scythe->rotation. No difference at all.   Oh, one other thing I mentioned.

Blade draw has ~4500 base damage with the chest roll and glyphed, and the second hit ONLY of my blade draw hits ~1.4m while my scythe hits ~2.9m.   Hmm. I've tested it myself, gotten 2 other people to test it, read a few tests on the internet and now this. Essentially nobody's testing matches up. I'll do more testing in the near future, however the difference between edge stack in combo was very small, and the skills that don't generate edge in the filler section are all miles behind.  My BD hits less than you but scythe hits more than you in a standard dungeon this patch during enrage. I'm using Rene+15.  I have a lot of confidence that altering the edge value by even +- 30% will have negligible impact on the actual conclusions derived. Because of the nature of those numbers."
TeraOnline,3dmf0f,Kourinn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:02:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think this scenario is really that common if we look at it from a probabilistic perspective.   It's not really about the speed at which the Kumas turns, but at which you can finish one entire chain of skills. One chain like that (cs -> bd -> scythe) takes like two seconds, but if you factor in all the time before that, it's the difference between fitting in a theoretical combative -> traverse -> bd(reset) and then cs -> bd -> scythe which gives you a very large lee-way in the case of time before the kumas turns.    And what difference does your scenario even make? I'm doing charging->BD->scythe->roll behind->rotation or charging->BD->roll behind->scythe->rotation. No difference at all.   The difference is that you scythe earlier, so the cooldown starts ticking earlier for next use. Even if edge does not build up off cooldown, the point still stands if you were to end the chain with blade draw, for example.  Another related thing I forgot to mention is say for example Blade Draw has ~3 seconds off cooldown. Let's just say for argument's sake to show my point that combatitve + rob takes 3 full seconds. Charging slash takes one second. That means without that attack speed, you will effectively have one entire second where BD is off cooldown and you're not using it.   Hmm. I've tested it myself, gotten 2 other people to test it   I just took some pictures. I was wrong with my actual values, but still correct in saying that scythe is definitely not 10000 base damage. See this album. The first picture is a 10 edge scythe at 2966001 damage. The second picture is the second hit of blade draw at 1136670. The third picture shows the combat log for the blade draw's first hit at 66823. Multiply it by 8 for if it were to crit it would be 534584. 534584 + 1136670 is 1671254. Blade draw has a base damage of 4564 meaning each base damage provides 366 damage. That ends with a result of 8099 base damage for a 10 edge scythe. Although with the whole double crit thing, I guess modelling it for 10000 damage is a reasonable assumption."

I've actually updated the guide for low ping players top roll that enrage is approximately equal to attack speed in effectiveness after someone brought the issue of dodge up on the TERA main forums. I can accept it as a good roll if you have low ping, but I still don't think it's a superior roll.   That ends with a result of 8099 base damage for a 10 edge scythe. Although with the whole double crit thing, I guess modelling it for 10000 damage is a reasonable assumption.   A loss of 200 damage per edge won't bump any skills up or down meaningfully but can affect precision of the scythe adjusted graphs by reducing the amount scythe adjusts for. I'll edit this later after a bit more testing for perfection sake, however I am confident no conclusions will change."
TeraOnline,3dmf0f,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:03:49 2015 UTC,I still don't think it's a superior roll.   That's fine; it's probably personal preference at that point. The way I think of it is that it provides equal DPS while providing better utility so it's better in my opinion. That's why the 3 best Warriors on my server and the majority of the following top 7 all have attack speed.

The formula they used for back crit chance against a bam of the same level was:   MIN(0.24*Crit Factor/Crit Resist, 0.50)   From this formula, assuming bosses have on average 125 crit resist  (this is just a guess and is probably inaccurate), having more than 260 crit factor is useless about 50% of the time.

You would expect 834 DPS because double speed, but it's not, because attack speed does not reduce your ping delay."

TeraOnline,3dpnzv,Wakabala,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:20:35 2015 UTC,Yeah and it makes sense since they're ranged DPS. It wouldn't make sense if ranged DPS can't.
TeraOnline,3dpnzv,Sarisae,-2,Sat Jul 18 09:47:38 2015 UTC,"Most ranged DPS actually lack the range to hit an airship mid-flight, whereas gunner skill ranges are just long enough to make contact. Same as with gunners being able to shoot the top of a ladder from the bottom of a ladder. Nothing expressly wrong with gunner skill ranges covering ladders - that was needed. But generally airships were the main point of siege turrets on a defending team, and I feel it takes away from the coordination required in order to successfully defend if a gunner can stand on mid and land just about guaranteed hits on airships."

TeraOnline,3dpgkc,KikuChan,16,Sat Jul 18 04:40:12 2015 UTC,It's kind of a skill you use to pretend that you're helping when everything is on cd and no one needs a heal.
TeraOnline,3dpgkc,SomniareSolace,9,Sat Jul 18 04:57:53 2015 UTC,"It's a good buffer for chip damage and DoTs. It is not a main heal, but it's nice to have as a filler.    It's your largest AoE heal so you typically get more people in this than your other heals, especially in raids. (Though it heals for little). It doesn't share cds with your other big heals.  It lasts twice as long as resto burst (10s vs 5s). Basically, if your party/raid is taking constant chip damage, regen circle will ""protect"" them for 10s, while resto burst will only do 5. (But again this is only for smallish damage).  It baits people. You ever have trouble getting people to be within cleanse range? Start casting regen circle first, and people will be able to see the circle and walk into it.   But yea as far as heals go it's our least used one. You can definitely go through the entire game without ever using it. It's just nice to have in some situations and if you play a more HoT heavy playstyle."

TeraOnline,3dpgkc,EndlessRambler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:24:43 2015 UTC,You can use it as a buffer in some situations when there is nothing better to do and you want to negate chip damage from some mechanics.  Casting it during kaprimas giant aoe and you are all in the skull negates the bit of chip damage your team is taking for example. Or keeping people alive during the flame pillar traps in Akeron's Inferno. I actually found it pretty useful to drop during Dumas burning aura dot since dropping this when it starts combined with your HP regen buff will basically negate all dot damage for awhile on practically your entire raid.  Usually there is no reason to cast this but if you have a really good guild team or static sometimes there really is nothing better to do.

I seem to recall the game starting you off in some sort of battlefield on some dark beach, and then transporting you to the island of dawn, which just stood out in my mind as being so much prettier than the contrasting starting area from before. I was really surprised when I logged onto my old account again a few months ago and started a new character for none of these to be in the game anymore, and for half of the Island of Dawn that I had remembered to no longer be there (there was some hill that you had to climb for a quest that I remember giving you really pretty view of the whole island of dawn that you can't get to anymore )."

TeraOnline,3dlwn1,N0rthWind,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:51 2015 UTC,well when cosmetics are bought for female characters at nearly a 10:1 rate vs males it gives reason. Tell me who would you cater to if you had to work 40 hours for your work week cater to males characters and get $15 for the who pay or cater to female characters and get $400. Also the classes are being released based on race/gender popularity of play. SO Elins where most played thing so we got reaper then next highest population was FEMALE Elf and Castanic so we got gunner following that is FEMALE human so we got brawler. If i remember the stats right male characters only made up 7% or so of the games population and where also they spend less on cosmetics then a female counterpart. SO the TLDR to few people play them and no one spends money on them so why make it?

TeraOnline,3dolu6,SirPseudonymous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"My character will use skills randomly as if it's being chained   If you're holding the key for a given skill down when you die, when you revive it'll fire every time it's off cooldown, as if you were holding the key (at least that seems to be the cause). The solution is to hit the relevant key again, so you get a key-up event to fire and make the game realize the key isn't being held down. It happens to me in CS matches fairly often.  Don't know what the problem with the crits is, because I went from the fulminate gun to +12 schisma and started seeing 1-2 mil backcrits, depending on the enemy. Is this happening to the same enemies you saw 1mil crits on? Are you sure it's landing right, because I see a lot of ABs that look like they should be backcrits, but give front crit damage, where it's just placed slightly wrong, although even there it's usually something like 500-600K, not 200K."

Use a Master Enigmatic Scroll on the piece of armor or weapon you'd like to use, then use an Intricate Identification Scroll to identify it.   This gives you new +3, 6, and 9 rolls. You might have to use a ton of MES since there isn't a 100% guarantee it'll work first try.

TeraOnline,3dlowv,Chiral_Systems,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:48:17 2015 UTC,Scorched Scar (HM Only): Scorched Scar is the heavy bleed damage that Perimos puts on you after taking the blue laser. To get the achievement you need to take two blue lasers back-to-back without cleansing the first one. The chances of dying and wiping are high if you do not have HP pots and other HP regen consumables and heals up between the first and second laser. Your healer may cleanse right after the second one hits. You will still get the achievement if you die to the second laser.

TeraOnline,3dky4e,iLoveKuchen,5,Fri Jul 17 23:46:57 2015 UTC,"Gear prices? If you mean VM5 PvP that is expensive as its meant to be; but other PvP gear is more or less easy to get, not being a PvP person myself I cant give you exact details, but the amount of time required to get PvP gear on NA and EU should be the same or similar. RNG boxes exist on NA too, cosmetic prices in both versions of this game are dependent on how new the particular cosmetic is; a brand new thing with high demand and low supply will always be expensive. Slightly older stuff is 5-15k on the broker, which a average player can make in 1 day or so. But EU has tons of fashion coupon drops now, like every instance gives you 40-60; so you can just get the free consumes. This game is quite generous when it comes to costumes actually. I don't know what you are talking about here because I play 2-3 hours a day and with every new patch I am geared in the new gear within a week. With the recent changes +12 has become really easy, basically every dungeon drops 4-8 mwa per person along with some tokens that can also be exchanged for MWA; for PvE players 100-200 MWA per day is quite doable if you run instances efficiently. For PvP players fraywind has a jackpot system that gives 100ish mwa to all players on the winning team (need this to be confirmed, again dont pvp much). The vanguard Rep has a MWA box that gives 17-80 vmwa. On a side note, VMWA is good because it does not let the prices of MWA drop, so if you want to sell MWA to make money you can. Almost every dungeon drops 2 MES, if you run GG 3 tiles a day (It takes like 2 min per run); it gives you 3-9 MES and 15ish spellbind and 30ish MWA. CCB is free from the token shop; you just need 12 tokens. Only problem left is SES, these are generally being distributed through events; since many of these events have been held recently, I have like 30-40 ses in the bank. Dont think killian is dead by any stretch of imagination; from what I know its slightly more populated than fraya and fraya itself has plenty of players. Now the number of players are not as much as NA especially since NA got all the steam players, even the ones from EU that didnt know the version on steam was the NA version; so you wont find 4 pages of LFG, more like 1 page; but finding groups is not hard at all. There is a event held like every weekend now; the one last weekend was especially fun with the GM spawning BAMS outside velika. Generally the types of events are; a. Boxes scattered around the map, these give you cosmetics and perm/temp mounts; b. SES drops - All dungeon final bosses drop SES (ongoing atm); c. Fashion coupons - You get free fashion coupons for every hour you play. d. Mount / Cosmetic drops - Instances drop mounts and cosmetic stuff, both perm and temp.   For PvP I most definitely recommend EU since ping is quite important; for PvE either is fine."

I had an instance where I accidentally discarded a tuxedo top costume, I got it back within 3 days. At another time I transferred servers and forgot to bring my VM4 recipes. I did a live chat and the GM worked with me step by step to get my quest reset so I could make my gear. Best experience was when I canceled my elite sub during the limited time $10/monthly elite deal. After the price went back up to $15/mo I decided I wanted elite back. I sent in a ticket asking if it was possible to get back on the list, now I'm paying $10 monthly and love it.  Unlike other games where I'm kept waiting for months, even YEARS in one case, I get a response in about a week tops. And the reply always has been good news.

Thing with EU rng boxes is that they incude a lot of other cosmetic stuff that you dont want, so after 20 boxes you actualy get a permanent item and its the one that has been in the shop since the last 4 months. So just dont bother at all with those boxes.  Fashion coupon shop weapon skins are few like 3-4 If i remember but a couple of them are quite nice, better than most cash shop ones anyway. There are plenty of armors though.  Last event I had like 3-5 FPS on my 780ti, so yeah a lot of people, someone even made a video of it.

The kelsaik one(?) we had since the start and the visionmaker/regent/conjunct weapon skin they just added a while back.

TeraOnline,3dm6ik,eruwaedhiel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:10:59 2015 UTC,"Asking if anything is ""expensive"" is a pretty unfair question because everyone has a different definition of what ""expensive"" is. If you don't have gathering mats saved up in preparation of what you need to craft, then yes, it might be costly because you will have to buy things like Fine Pilka on the trade broker. If you have a good amount of the lvl 65 gatherables, then you won't be paying much - just for the kits. Etching and alchemy master tests are the two that require crit in order to gain points - so it's heavily RNG based."
TeraOnline,3dm687,SC2Towelie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:52:01 2015 UTC,"Don't level them all I made this mistake. I got my weapon and armor to the artisan test at the same time, and realized I had no ores left to actually take the artisan test. And since you can only artisan and master one skill, my armor crafting is basically useless. Unless you want to gear alts...but relic weapons and dungeon drops will be better anyway.  I just got my weapon crafting to 800 this morning, and made another post about how worth that was at almost the same time as you so hopefully someone replies. But in my journey to 800 weapon crafting I found it not worth. I don't have the gold to enchant and reroll my T7 weapons anymore because I spent it all on mats. I'm going to master alchemy or at least artisan it on an alt I heard that is easier.   One thing I can say is selling oils CAN net you a profit, you need to have passed artisan test for that. But the mats for oils are difficult to farm for since its RNG based, and expensive on the broker.  Overall I would I think I wasted time and money crafting. Selling the mats probably would have been more profitable."
TeraOnline,3dm687,potatoatak_pls,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:09:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well that's disappointing to hear. Are there any benefits late game to having all the professions leveled? Like in WoW, leveling up each profession gave you a different advantage. (blacksmithing allowed you to add extra sockets your own gear, for example) But so far it seems like everything that I'm making from crafting, I could just farm/buy the mats and have someone else make it for me. Is there any inherent bonus to having maxed out crafting?"
TeraOnline,3dm687,potatoatak_pls,0,Fri Jul 17 12:18:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think you get anything like that but I could be wrong. Like I said, I mastered it today, and got 100 gold in the mail, and have a cool sword next to my name.   A benefit of having all skills would be oil crafting. You can only artisan and master one skill per character, so you will need alts.   But weapon crafting needs oils that an artisan alchemy bro makes, armor smithing needs oils made from weapon crafting artisan etc..  I think in the LONG LONG run, I will be glad I mastered it, but its a big investment. But it is definitely NOT an immediate return on your investment.  If you want to avoid paying an arm and a leg make sure you gather absolutely everything you see. If you get all gathering skills to 300 you get an extra inventory slot so thats nice. I have alts that I also gather on, just to give materials to my main. So the materials I spent money on were the mats that only drop in dungeons.   I've read if you want to craft for money, do alchemy, its the cheapest and easiest to level. I'm doing that next to see for myself.  All in all do what you want. I think with future patches, and finally being at 800, I will eventually be glad I got it that far. Its just a brutal journey.  TL;DR   Don't level all up at once on same character. Pick one to artisan and sell the other mats. Alchemy is most often the most profitable (low risk low reward whereas etching is high risk high reward) I don't think you get any stat benefits for mastering but I cannot confirm."

TeraOnline,3dm8j0,BigBallsBitesBack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:19:14 2015 UTC,"Welp, I personally don't think most of the given answers are sufficient so here:  1) Mystics can be a HUGE contribution to the DPS if used properly. First off, have Aura of the merciless on at all times. Next off, endurance debuffs. You have 2, Contagion (lowers endurance of the initial target ONLY) and glyphed Volley of curses (this one is a bit iffy and can be taxing on MP so most ppl don't use it, but it will be buffed soon). After that you have thralls. Wrath can cut the time of boss battles quite significantly and should be cast whenever possible. It's a bit of a dum-dum and sometimes won't attack the boss even if ordered to, but getting hit by the boss generally works (should avoid that tho). Also it's not very mobile so be careful when you cast it (usually during bosses ""imma lay down and not move"" phase). Vengeance can help out a little bit too, if you have MP to spare, but be careful where you put it - it can be killed quite easily. And then there's Titan wrath.  2) YES. Well, you should try to. Keeping it on your DPS as much as possible, but don't endanger yourself to do it. Glyphing it for extra range helps quite a bit, and you should glyph it for extra duration as well.  3) 1) answers most of this. Some boss must be dispelled, but it is situational. Regression has just slightly less rage then you'd think it does btw. Stun bosses that can be stunned and slow ones that can be slowed. Also, Boomerang pulse is mainly for healing, not damage dealing.  4) Ppl can be dicks when balls are involved. They could pick them up when they are at full HP, or not pick em up at all. Don't be too harsh on them if they're noobs, just nicely explain it to them. And, yeah dropping a few before the boss spawns can be helpful, if your teammates aren't dicks that is.  5) +9 avatar weapons carry an attack speed bonus, which can be helpful (since it lowers your cast times), but they're not mandatory. It's not too difficult to get them to lvl 9 tho, so you might as well.  6) Soloing bams with mystic is super-easy, but can take a while. Wrath can waste a bam in seconds , but the 5 min cooldown is, well... a long cooldown. (And no, you shouldn't use wrath without the cooldown reduction glyph). Otherwise, you tank with Protection or kite with Vengeance while spamming basic attacks (glyph it for dmg), and stunning/sleeping them if you need to recast your thralls. That aside, as a healer instance matching is a way to go most of the time, but killing some bams is a nice change of pace.  Oh and an extra tip. Watch your MP. This goes without saying, but with auras and constant spamming of balls/Titan Wrath/Boomerang etc. you can easily run out of mana. Despite not being much late-game, mana infusion can be used when you have nothing to do (which isn't often, mind you). Also mana balls recover more than they cost, so you might pick em up yourself (most of your teammates will be fine as long you have your MP aura on).  Hope I helped somewhat. Good luck and have fun with that awesome class of yours :)"

What skills can i use to stun bosses? I think i dont have one yet  How about crystals? Right now i am using 3 brilliant hex and 1 swift hex on my weapon to compensate with the MP consumption."

You get Thrall of Wrath at level 38. Another important skill you will get at level 42 is Vow of Rebirth, glyph it so you and a party member get a free res, be careful when casting it because it doesn't always go on who you want it to.  Aura of the Merciless you get at level 50 along with Shara's Lash a stun.  Contagion is at level 61 and Boomerang Pulse is 63, the endurance debuff glyph for Volley of Curses is also usable at level 63 once you get it from the glyph dungeons."

Endurance reduction glyph is from Sabex Armory/ Macellarious Catacombs, but again it's not a reliable skill for now.  Oh, and DO NOT use Metamorphic Blast/Smite on the boss. Most of the bosses later on will be able to one-two shot you and you should never take such a risk.   Your wpn crystals are quite fine. 3xBrilliant + Swift is a setup I use late game as well, tho some ppl say they like to throw in a Carving one for crit-heals."
TeraOnline,3dm8j0,Daiug,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:36:26 2015 UTC,"As a main (and only) Mystic:  Just reroll a priest, do yourself a favor. Roll mystic if you want to do exclusively PVP. Priests have and will have (KTERA patches) the same buffs that we do, while having insane heals and shields. What we have is just the Crit Aura, that is nowhere as useful as whatever a priest can bring.  Now to answer your questions:   No. You'll never deal any damage whatsoever: While any combat class will deal 150k per hit even with no gear, your spells/pet will dead 50k max. The only subpar ""DPS"" spell is the Thrall of Wrath, and his only usefulness is helping out with a phase if the dps is somehow low: A classic example is the shield spells that many bosses have in the dungeons. Yes. You'll find yourself spamming that and the Endurance Debuff (Volley of Curses) over and over between heals. Volley of Curses with the gliph to reduce endurance. Note that while we have to spam it three times to get a mere 9%, the priest has the same thing, reducing endurance by 10% and just on one cast. People will never really bother with the balls. It's a lost cause. And they are amazing since they heal quite a bit and remove debuffs. Still, try and spam them if you can. Usually it's super cheap rolling the weapons. But honestly you can just save the stuff till the idoneal and forward. No. You don't have any damage as i said before. Your only dps spell is the Thrall of Wrath, that has a 5min cooldown (glyphed) and the AI is just bad. He'll often stop and do nothing, skipping spells.   Honestly, i love my mystic to bits, but it's just bad right now. They gave everything that made him unique (the buffs) to the priest, and now all you really have is a shitty boomerang heal that the players will dodge (often not even realizing it), some pets with a super dumb AI and an useful crit aura that is completely overshined by the buffs, heals and shields of a priest.  TL,DR: Just do yourself a favor and roll a priest."

I can't answer most of these questions, but one thing a lot of low level players don't know is your orbs cleanse. So if you're running a dungeon with some nasty DoT effects remind your party that orbs cleanse.  Also dropping balls before fights is a good idea, but in most cases, you won't have time. Use your orbs though, I see some mystics just not dropping them at all, don't be him."

Yes, keep it up 100% but be careful how much you use it. Only use it when it's about to run out because it takes up a lot of mana. The cooldown is like 3 seconds but the effect lasts 25s or so.  Glyph your Volley of Curses for endurance debuff and keep it stacked at all times.  MP balls are more useful than HP balls unless your party is really bad OR there is a need for cleanses and your party tends to be scattered around. Experienced people will pick up balls when they need them, but you need to yell at newer people and explain what they are most likely. Eh might as well.

TeraOnline,3dm8j0,GobstopperHand,0,Fri Jul 17 13:38:08 2015 UTC,"I am currently leveling a mystic so these answers just come from personal experience. :)   Primarily, you're gonna want to set up your thralls - Thrall of Protection, Thrall of Vengeance, Thrall of Wrath will be your main contributions to DPS. If the boss tends to be stationary, you're gonna want to use Thrall of Vengeance. If the boss likes to move around, Thrall of Protection. Thrall of Wrath is the strongest Thrall, but also doesn't last that long and has a 10 minute cooldown. The ranged skill that you can use is Volley of Curses. Rebuff as often as you remember Stuns, Volley of Curses, debuffs. Tell them in the chat.  Always always always +9. alkahest is cheap on the trade broker and the merchant.

Yes, you should try to keep your power buff on your DPS at all times. Until you get endurance debuff glyph on your poison, there's not much you will do to help dps bosses. You're doing it right. It's just bad players who don't pick up motes. Also, try to position to the side of the boss. It gives you clear view of the tank (in front) and dps (behind). Upgrading mats should be easy to get all the way up to level cap. Just disenchant any drops you get that you aren't going to wear. Alkahest drops fairly commonly and isn't expensive at a merchant.

Titanic wrath is 40 power at 65 and priest buff is 25 power.  You should try to keep it up but heal and drop motes first.  Later on in the 60s you get to glyph your dot for it to debuff monster endurance by 3% up to 3 stacks."
TeraOnline,3dm8j0,Priest_Dps,0,Fri Jul 17 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"I think it is better to not worry about the damage you contribute as a mystic, when I was leveling I barely had time to heal everyone, drop motes, and apply Titanic Wrath to the party.  If everyone was full health and had Titanic Wrath then I would throw a Thrall of Vengence or Thrall of Wrath(once I unlocked it).  I found that the way you play a mystic changes a bit once you get max level because many glyphs and skills that are key to being a mystic are locked until level 60-63(a lot of the skills/glyphs people in this thread mentioned do not unlock until then).  Some useful places to check for general mystic information are the mystic section on the forum and nan0teck's mystic guide(I believe glyph builds are outdated since last patch)."

If your party is super op and needs no heals, then by all means go and have fun with your pets, but it is not the rule. Some mystic use Thrall of Whrat, I find it very disturbing so I rarely use it but I guess that's personal prefference. 2) Yes, it should be up 100% of the time. On higher levels you will get a glyph to make the duration longer and the area of the buff, it's not hard to buff your whole party at once if they are properly place. 3) You should use Volley of Curses, stack up to 3 times, get used to this now cause at lvl 65 you will get the endurane debuff and you will have to use it yes or yes. If the boss has adds on their sides at lvl 61 you will get Contagion, put it in the boss and see the mobs dieee  (This  2 skills wont put you in combat). Ocasionally you can use stun ball or sleep if the mechanic calls for it. 4) You cant really force anyone to pick up the balls and in higher levels Balls are more a cleansing tool than a heal one. 5) It's pretty wise to renew your gear, at least your avatar weapon since it will improve your healing.  6) I don't see why not, you can solo bams while being in queue, that's how I level my characters, go to the bam quest that is set up in your vanguards and repeat while you are in queue. Mystic with the proper avatar weapon have 0 problems at soloing bams, just care for your mana.

Thrall of wrath does 2-3 million if he gets his full combo off, not a negligible amount of damage.   Your party does far more damage than that, so your primary job as healer is still to support the team.

TeraOnline,3dm4n9,MrSnowShow,5,Fri Jul 17 12:01:40 2015 UTC,"Alright this will take me some time so please do read it. I am ignorant of a much in Tera but that does not mean I know nothing. Everything I type after this will be entirely true, but I may leave gaps in odd places if I do not know the information.     There are 10 different classes as of right now. A new one called 'Brawler' is on it's way (though the time of release is unannounced to my knowledge).  These classes can be separated into different groups based on what they can feasibly do. For example, Berserkers can tank, but they certainly are not the best at it. So within these groups some classes may be placed more than once because they can do more than one thing. Also, they will be placed in order of effectiveness at that role in their group.  Tank - A player who will attempt to hold agro (which means they will want the boss focused on them) and stay alive while doing so.   Lancer: The best tank in my opinion. I haven't played one so I cannot provide deep insight into them. From my experience they hold agro very well and can block most damage. Warrior: I'd say Warriors are now the second best tank because they can tank and put out the most damage while doing so (even more than zerker tanks) Berserker: Can tank reasonably well, but (again, not from playing them, but for playing with them) tend to lose agro more frequently than Lancers (perhaps similar to Warrior. I, unfortunately, haven't played warrior tank, or played with one). Can block with no mana cost so they can survive well, their damage while tanking is not great.   DPS - Damage Per Second. These players will attempt to deal the maximum damage possible. (This is a very opinionated tier list of DPS and many will probably not like it, but take it for what it is)      Note: This is for PvE assuming you have a tank   Gunner: Their individual hits (excluding Balders Vengeance, a 6 minute cooldown that hits massively) are less than Berserker, or Warriors with full edge but in terms of DPS they can dispatch of enemies cleanly, from a range, with their main ability critting basically every time. Being a ranged gives them a great edge as well, when a boss runs from one side to the other, a gunner simply turns their camera while all the melee scramble to catch it. Berserker: Their strongest ability hits VERY high, one of the absolute highest hitting skills in the game. The problem I have with zerkers is that they must charge. It can be quickened with skills and glyphs but generally, charging an ability for a few seconds leaves a good amount of time of 0 damage output. Though I do think they hit hard enough to be qualified at a close second (perhaps on an unmoving, no skill casting mob they can out DPS a gunner but without that I consider them below gunner) Reaper: They are at a close third, perhaps they are above zerks in raw DPS, I'm not sure. But they have simple PvE combos that hit hard and get massive cd reduction for 20 sec every 3 minutes which is a big deal. Since Go Berserk they have become a top contender for DPS. Sorcerer: I am not entirely sure where sorcerers are after the most recent patch. I assume a great sorc can put crazy DPS out, I am putting them here because I know the least about them. I have heard from people that they are now overpowered, but who knows? Certainly very strong. Warrior: After Go Berserk warriors saw a ~50% damage increase totaled through their entire combo and are now put out pretty solid damage. They are necessary in a party for their endurance debuff on bosses which makes everyone hit a lot harder but for their own DPS they are solid but I would certainly saw behind the ones above. Archer: Great at PvP, 1v1 and beyond. But in PvE they are simply... meh. Being ranged helps... but still certainly in a noticeable tier below the above in PvE.   Support/Healers - Support the members of your party with constant healing, strong attack, defense, regenerating etc. buffs. Keep everyone alive, resurrect those that aren't.   Priest: In PvE, Priests are 100% better. Their damage pales in comparison to a mystic, but that doesn't matter. Their buffs are very excellent (energy stars yummm), they can heal a lot and have a friendly pull (which has saved my ass many times). Mystic: Buffs aren't as good, heals aren't as plentiful, no friendly pull. As a support they are often sufficient but in my experience completing a dungeon with a mystic is much more difficult than with a priest. In PvP though (besides, perhaps, large scale pvp like corsairs) I may go as far to say they are preferred. Their Thrall of Wrath they can spawn does INSANE damage but doesn't last long so that's great. They certainly output a lot more damage than a Priest, but generally... that doesn't matter.     Leveling   Leveling is fairly simple:   Story line until level 13 Grind at first Vanguard place until 17 or 18 Grind at trees by Bastion of Lok until 20 Complete one instance of Bastion of Lok with a group Solo it until level 26 (If your class can solo, it should only take 2-3 runs) Run dungeons in 2s or 3s if you can, if not just instance match your way all the way until 52-54 Grind at a place called Devans until 60 (not sure what level it is a vanguard teleport, but it will be for sure by like 56) Do quest line for a ton of vanguard credits, exp, and gold (should get you to 63, very close to 64. Run dungeons through instance matching until 65     I initially wanted to create a ""what to do when 65"" section here but I think it would be smarter to first explain some things first: Gear progression (and how to get each set), and how to make money (and a bit of what I think you should do with it).   Gear Progression - In Tera, like many MMOs, there are sets of gear. A PvE set, and a PvP set.  PvE Goes: Idoneal, Fulminate, Wroth, Schisma, Lucid.  Though I recommend very heavily that you skip Wroth, it is awful imo.   Idoneal Gained by reaching level 65, it is sent in the mail. Un-enchantable gear, you will get fulminate soon. Fulminate Can be gained through Vanguard credits or running the dungeon ""Bathysmal Rise Normal Mode"". This gear is superior to Wroth until Wroth is heavily enchanted which still is not worth it. This gear is also un-enchantable. Wroth If you do want it after my warnings, then run the dungeon ""Akeron's Inferno Normal Mode"" until you get all your pieces, then shell out tons of money to enchant them. Schisma A respectable gear set (when +12d). I reccomend making the jump from Fulminate to Schisma. You can get your weapon by running the dungeon ""Akeron's Inferno Normal Mode"" through instance matching. After you get your weapon, enchant it to +12, and then run the dungeons ""Akeron's Inferno Hard Mode"" or ""Timescape Normal Mode"". (Prioritize gloves after weapon) Lucid This gear is the absolute best PvE gear set in the game as of now and can only be obtained through crafting (except the belt, which you can get through the dungeon ""Timescape Hard Mode"") I don't know for sure, but I don't BELIEVE you need to have any crafting skills to create Lucid, just the materials and the recipe (I haven't done it myself).   PvP Gear used to go: Controvert -> Defiance -> Renegade. The patch added Deviate and Tensus. I am not heavy into the PvP world so I simply don't know much about it.   Deviate Known also as Controvert II (so its not very good, I don't think most people get this gear set). Middle tier PvP gear, worse than Renegade for sure. Obtained through the Bellicarium Credit Merchant. Tensus The best PvP gear in the game, obtained only through crafting (except the belt which is obtained through the Bellicarium Merchant though you must have 1100+ gridiron rating (15v15 pvp). If you are a PvPr at heart, and dont want PvE gear you have to get a ton of Bellicarium and Killing Spree credits and like ~200k gold and you can craft all the pieces.     How to make money (assuming Elite, anybody who is anybody has elite, save up 20,000g and purchase 30-day elite from the broker, or buy it from someone selling EMP (the currency that requires real money to obtain, people sell it for 1 emp to 10g usually):   Ghillieglade four times: With elite this will net you ~1500g per day. AINM (Akeron's Inferno Normal Mode) x6 a day through instance matching (capped at 2 per day but you can get by that by: doing it twice, using an instance reset scroll, then doing it twice, then using an elite instance scroll, then doing it twice) instance reset scrolls only have a 5 hr cool down so you can do it more if you are dedicated. Capping out on Vanguard Dailies (doing certain dungeons or PvP arenas, or killing certain monsters, gathering items etc. (found by clicking H) will give you Vanguard credits) then spending your Vanguard credits on Masterwork Alkahest boxes (open them then sell whatever you get (guaranteed 16 mwa (masterwork alkahest) per box))  **Note: Corsairs Stronghold (20 v 20 pvp arena) gives the most vanguard credits out of any daily, so do this a lot if you have time to (you gotta win though!). CS Also gives you a sea chest on your first win which is worth ~800g depending on your server. Run 15 v 15 Gridiron arena, winning (and I think even losing sometimes? not exactly sure) nets you a box that gives at least one master enigmatic scroll and some other stuff)"

TeraOnline,3dk4x7,Priest_Dps,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"win condition is:  Damage to Crystal > Time Taken to get to = Damage to Crystal  So if your team gets the crystal to 0 health in 5:32, the other team has 5:31 to get the crystal to 0.  If the round ends at 7 minutes to get to 35k health, the other team has to get the crystal to 34,999 health before the game ends, time is irrelevant.  Because of how this works, being on Offense first is generally better, since you know exactly how long it took you to finish the round. For example, if you finish in 3:30, you can just guard inners and have people on siege mid to destroy SS/NS because backdooring is the only chance they have to win faster than you."

As for your self-fulfilling prophecy, it was years before the first gender-locked class was added. The bias towards female characters is well established.  At the end of the day this business with gender-locking has come about because BH saw that players overwhelmingly played female characters. The number of female or male costumes purchased, while ultimately where the money comes from, will always be determined by how many players are playing which gender characters. Players don't buy costumes for genders they don't play.  We'll get male-only classes when people start playing male characters. Period."

Elins being the first, then castanic and high elf females, and thirdly human females? It's literally just a reflection of the user base as a whole."

One is where people say, ""I rolled a gunner"" or ""Thinking of rolling a priest"". This just refers to choosing to play as a gunner or priest or whatever.  However, stat rolls are different. Certain stat lines can be randomized (they have a spinning arrow next to them), so you can ""roll the stats"" to hopefully get a better one.  Does this explain it? :)"

TeraOnline,3di76s,Turmoil4Fun,3,Thu Jul 16 13:58:27 2015 UTC,"You don't have 12+ gloves that will give you an extra ~25% aggro from attacks. I'm seriously doubting you will get into an AIHM with Fulminate gear as the tank.   You need to pop noc, onslaught scrolls, bravery, etc on bosses too. Etchings help too. Also, 12+ chest + boots gets you 12 more endurance which is huge.   BTW, what rolls did you get on your weapon?  What crystals are you running? And what do you have glyphed?  Make sure you glyph shield barrage for 200% more aggro generation, dmg on wallop and spring attack, increased aggro where you can and +dmg on attacks, and shield counter whenever possible, and glyph for shield counter increased aggro too.   Also, generation geared dps can easily pull aggro off of you if they don't eclipse pot. If they don't hold back a little, it's unlikely you will hold aggro against them in a standard tank and spank. Shout when up, you can save infuriate too, pop adrenaline rush, use empowered or quick carve brooches to get aggro back."
TeraOnline,3di76s,Spiffymooge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:11:05 2015 UTC,"would you say its worth it to upgrade wroth gloves to +12 then for the aggro rolls?  i use nocs and bravery. gotta buy some scrolls and work on getting etchings.   I have attack speed rolls increased damage when attacking and increased aggro rolls so i think im pretty good there.   I use 4 threatening niveots and 4 threatening zyrks. pretty sure i have all the aggro glyphs. will double check that I have the damage buffs on my hard hitting skills. pretty sure i do though. Do you have an image of the ideal glyph setup by any chance?  I recently got a quick carving brooch so i guess i'll have to play around with that a bit too.  I feel like aggro just gets pulled off me too often. I can usually get it back fairly quickly though, as long as the boss doesn't go flying across the room the second I lose it."
TeraOnline,3di76s,Spiffymooge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely get wroth 12+ gloves. They're easy to enchant and MW.  Swap out a threatening niveot for focused, you'll crit much harder and the aggro from dmg is better. I'm trying out crit factor and crit power scroll still, I feel like crit factor is better but not sure yet.   Lancer set up is pretty straight forward. You won't have many glyph points left over after aggro and +dmg glyphs.  If I were you I would get 12+ wroth except the weapon. Reason being,with good rolls and extra endurance, you can afford to take more hits to keep hitting the boss for increased aggro.   Also, I would go for forcetic and forcetock earrings over ire earrings. You get 20 power from force earrings which is much more superior to the measly 4.5% aggro and 4 endurance if you got full ire 4 and 5 piece set bonus.   You get a lot of back time on bosses too, use those. Remember to keep debilitate up too. And lock down strike can hit very hard too."
TeraOnline,3di76s,Spiffymooge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:49:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you very much. I definitely can't tank an HM so I'll start working on getting Wroth gear. Should be pretty easy."
TeraOnline,3di76s,InRustITrust,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"You can tank AIHM but were I looking for a tank, I definitely wouldn't invite you because you can get all your gear in about 1-3 runs of brnm and as low as 1 run of AINM.  Don't worry too much about briefly losing aggro. It happens often enough especially if you had to block a lot in a short amount of time. Or dps popped CDs. It shows you have good dps which is great news."
TeraOnline,3di76s,InRustITrust,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:00:34 2015 UTC,"It sucks that it's the case, but it pays as a tank to carry a stack of eclipse pots to hand out to others if you know threat's going to be an issue.  Experienced DPS should know if they're going to need it and be carrying them anyway, but sometimes need a nudge to remind them to use it.  If you start out with ""if you think there's a chance that you'll rip aggro from a Lancer in mostly fulminate, please come over to me and open a trade window and I'll hand you some eclipse pots to reduce your aggro.""  If you're losing aggro to Archers, Reapers or Sorcerers, then remind them that they can and should threat drop (Feign Death, Shrouded Escape, and Stone Skin respectively) when aggro changes to them.  Aggro is everyone's responsibility, not just yours.  I'm sure there's work you can do tightening up your rotation, glyphs, re-rolling your gear, etc.  All of that's daunting for a new player, but hang in there.  If you like tanking, you'll never be wanting for a group. :)"
TeraOnline,3di76s,shojikun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:41:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I've thought about carrying around eclipse pots to give out. Thanks for the tips. I do enjoy tanking. It just stresses me out a lot when aggro is constantly being pulled off of me.
TeraOnline,3di76s,Valanor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:49:08 2015 UTC,Are you using Niveots or Cruxes on your gear?  Niveots are obviously better and you should get kitted out with them if at all possible if you haven't done so already.
TeraOnline,3di76s,annoyedGamer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"get gloves, and niveot threat and zyrk threat if its very hard."
TeraOnline,3di76s,Spiffymooge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:02:54 2015 UTC,"You'll need the aggro gains from +12 gloves. Also get the iretic/tock rings, you'll gain a lot of aggro from each ring along with the 3 piece set bonus. Farm iretic from Vault of Kaprima and buy iretock with 40 cosmoshards unless you can find groups to run Timescape normal. Roll the rings to include Power+4  if you can afford to though it's ambitious to try to get Power +4 and Power +2. You can go dps earrings or do full iretime, that debatable.   Also use 3 threatening and 1 focused niveot. Use etchings, i use energetic (attackspeed/cdr) on weapon/gloves and grounded (endurance) on body/feet. You can use the cheaper 3-day ones on your fulminate but should invest in a rare permanent one for your schisma weapon.  Use scrolls, I personally use attack speed scrolls but crit power is good too.   Lastly, against really good dps, gen+15 or what not, you will lose aggro consistently especially if they don't use eclipse. But hope is around the corner (a 6 month corner) as Lancer and tanks in general have received a significant boost in Ktera this week. Whisper me in game if you want to talk about lancer. Sylow.p"

TeraOnline,3di76s,nillionare,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:14:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly if a dps is consistent pulling agro and yet doesn't use eclipse, the dps is being a dick. If he complains abt agro and blames you without using eclipse, he's just being an asshole. Depending on the dungeon or boss, it might not really be an issue, esp if it's an easy run like brnm or ainm(biggest joke of a 10man atm) sometimes dps just want to not give a shit and get feedstock. Don't take it to heart.   That said, if the dps is using eclipse and you're still losing agro, it's very likely due to you not attacking enough in between your blocks. None of the agro rolls will be of any use until you hit something with it. Relying in shield counter for agro really isn't enough. Lancers roll all that attack speed precisely to get more hits off between blocks. Also infuriate isn't the end all of agro spells. If you don't start attacking or adding on other agro spells after, you will quickly lose agro again.  I also find it much harder to regain agro than to maintain agro mainly because sometimes the boss just runs after the person with agro, and when that guy is ranged and doesn't have the balls to run through the boss towards you, you're gonna be running a lot. Which sucks."

Was sitting at about 1200 myself last season with a kd ratio of about 14:1  The combos are pretty much the same; you can do them a little more often now.  Zui's guide is still relevant. The biggest change from the patch was that now when you hit confirm with double sheer stagger you will do more than just tickle them.  In terms of glyphs I think I threw mine into powerlink on spiral for Cs and hp regen on double sheer for duels/3s.  Take what I say with a grain of salt. I play on 260 ping and what I do is only what I find works for me.  Good luck. Reaper is really strong now so abuse it!

On vm gear i would take crit rate, but with the current  8% attack speed roll i dont know how it would fare.  Armor:  - % reduced damage. - % reduced damage from enraged monsters. - % HP.

Aggro will always be about the gear and skill of your group and yourself."
TeraOnline,3dgl7s,fluffy-tails,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  You don't need (NOT recommended unless you know what you're doing) full agro equipment to hold agro effectively. I tank TSNM/HM with full crit (2death/3edge) accessories and almost never lose agro if the dps are using their eclipses. Plus running like that you can really end up a fair amount of damage for a tank. I really enjoy their kit for tanking, it's a handful of low cooldown, fast casting, chain-able skills. Sneaking in skills between boss attacks has never been more satisfying!  Like others have said, their down side is they are unable to force enrage bosses and their endurance debuff isn't as good as lancers/warriors."
TeraOnline,3dgl7s,AboveArcadia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"Berserker is one of the top2 dps and the worst tank. Yes u can tank, yes u can hold aggro to some extend (not like warrior, maybe same level as lancer) but u lack infuriate which to me means zerk tank is only viable if the real tank cannot come and play."
TeraOnline,3dgl7s,iLoveKuchen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:01:46 2015 UTC,"A good combo (if the warrior doesn't want to tank, or the zerker isn't as geared as the warrior) is if a warrior enrages the monster, and the zerker takes over tanking, while the warrior keeps up all debuffs and has free dps. Aside from not being able to enrage, and not having a higher endurance debuff, Zerk tanks are fine. A Zerk could also tank TSHM, although you won't get the same endurance debuffs other tanks give, and get a slightly lower score."
TeraOnline,3dgl7s,Kumasylum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:12 2015 UTC,"Is the berserker capable of tanking? Yes. And it's actually pretty straight forward. Basic combo is Double punishing strike, raze, flatten. Use Fiery Rage when it's off cooldown. Block and use Axe Counter. That's really mostly it.  Berserker tanks are held back by not being able to do two things, though: Endurance debuff not as good and enrage. If there's a warrior in the party you should be ok though."
TeraOnline,3dgl7s,spaghetticatt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:19:42 2015 UTC,"This is why I love seeing a zerk as my tank, I'll supply the endurance debuffs and enrage while they give me a back to tear apart.

However, the brawler class does have a bit of a combo system. LMB + RMB will give you a leap forward punch. LMBx2 + RMB does an uppercut that tosses the mob into the air. LMBx3 + RMB does a whirlwind spin aoe. LMBx4 + RMB does a huge jab with a knockback. So while the actual combo hits don't seem to do anything, there is actually a combo system slightly more complex than the normal skill chaining. It's really cool, class feels like it's out of a fighting game."

TeraOnline,3dctac,Meganezuki,10,Wed Jul 15 14:14:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's really a question of masculinity, but more the fact that the past three new classes have all been female exclusives and people are getting tired of the trend.  I personally don't care, I'm going to make a brawler regardless. But I know that a lot of people are upset with another female/race-locked class especially because in an interview with the developers, Rhodos was stated to be a ""preview"" of a new class in the works. Lots of people thought they were getting a new male class."
TeraOnline,3dezgf,reruff,3,Wed Jul 15 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"Well, here's a guide Tooru and I made, but we're in-progress in revamping it (delayed date because we're still confirming few things): http://forum.teratoday.com/topic/1011-timescape-nmhm-guide/#entry9250  It's a bit messy right now since it was released before the patch was out. It should help out in understanding the dungeon. Please do check other posts on that thread too since it also gives tips.  for 3 Dragon orb room at the start, all you have to do is break all orbs. Most parties now just hit the shielded orb on the left, then non-shielded orb on the right, then the remaining middle orb. Be careful with shielded orb because it will reflect 10k flat dmg. There are flashing AoE, to dodge those, you have to iframe at 5th blink. It only blinks 4 times, but if you iframe on the timing for 5th, you should be okay. It takes a bit of practice so don't worry.   Hemera: All you have to do is to go near the left orb before you fight so that you or your party can pull it there. You have to wait for the shield to wear off because it will reflect 10k flat damage. The left orb is best to start since it's easiest location to tank, where the orb will put Ring-shaped AoE. Just burn the boss until you see a text saying ""the orb will explode soon"", then you move to the other side diagonally. This orb is circle AoE, so you have to iframe it. The AoEs are targeted on the person with highest aggro so make sure you have aggro most of the time. Aggro control is very important. If the party can't defeat Hemera within these two orbs, it's going to be difficult for non-skilled healer on the other orb.   For next mobs, you just have to gather them up and kill them until the bar fills 100. Usually healers go to the obelisk to clear this part so dont worry. your job is to either tank mobs or burn them.  Tempas: This one is kinda hard for me to explain, but you want to watch out for breath attack most of the time-- others don't really matter much in Normal Mode. you want to perform circle tanking instead of wall tanking to get understand how the breath attack work. Read the guide for further info, but it just leaves off a puddle. You want to circle tank but if breath attack goes off, you can't exactly circle tank, plus it's hard for others to move around. I find that a mix of wall tanking and circle tanking is easier. You just have to constantly move to different wall when Tempas use breath attack. But watch out-- if there are balls floating near the wall, it sometimes explode and cause some kind of small AoE. Don't wall tank too long if there are balls floating everywhere. Basically, tl;dr: Circle tank but try to have Tempas use breath attack toward the wall. this gives room for the party and yourself to tank/burn.  Yana: Read the guide to understand the attacks. The tile rotation relies on teamwork, but really, it's just a matter of assigning someone to do certain part. I've seen people just assign and don't talk to others at all, which is fine, but sometimes you have to mention someone to do something so calling out time to time is good too.  But Yana is easier to tank, it's just the cage that gets a lot of tanks. in NM, priests can just pull them out but from my experience, yana performs 4~6 attacks before it uses wipe mechanic in the cage. You just have to get out at 4th attack using black hole. If you lose aggro, it's no big deal until Yana turns its back to you (damage loss from DPS back crit is huge). Just use adrenaline rush (and/or empowered/quick carve brooch) to get your aggro back."

TeraOnline,3dezgf,Bobmoneydbr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:36:08 2015 UTC,"What do you do as a tank in NM to help with the tile mechanic if possible? Maybe it's just me but I find it hard to keep track of what tiles need to be moved etc when I'm tanking the boss. Should I zoom out more? I mean how much responsibility do tanks have to move tiles? I can tank Yana fine but I want to be able to carry a group as much as possible, it's just difficult to do blocking and avoiding the little exploding guys. BTW do you have a trick in avoiding those guys? They don't do much damage but it can be rough sometimes. Thanks! Love your stream. -Ing"
TeraOnline,3dezgf,Idi0ticGenius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"I personally love to tank and handle inner, as well as taking in part of mid.  It is difficult for tank to do tile mechanics but once you get used to ""reading"" Yana's attack patterns, it's pretty easy to take over inner and mid. Outer have to be done by someone else. If you can tank Yana just fine, it should be okay for you not to worry since our job is to just tank most of the time. Carrying as tank though, it can be tough to do outer as we don't have as many mobility moves-- I don't think leash is strong enough to break the gears.  This is easier to practice if you have teamspeak, skype, raidcall, ventrillo, etc to have you and your friends/guildies/other partymembers to communicate while playing instead of typing stuff out.   Zooming out is unnecessary but very helpful. I keep my FoV at 100 or 120. In NM, tanking and taking care of inner is very easy. To keep track of the tile, you have to pretty much hold block on attacks like juggle and look around. Losing aggro for up to 5 seconds is forgiving for most parties, but it's really easy to take aggro back with adrenaline rush > Barrage x2 > Spring > Wallop > Block > Counterx2 > Barragex2 > Spring > Debilitate.   The trick with bombers, usually warriors help out with binding sword but if they don't, there are two ways I do it.    I just get away from Yana to gather them up around mid-tile area, ""tag"" them to trigger them. Then I use Iron will (to be safe) and back step toward Yana. If I get damaged and my HP is below ~80% I use Second Wind. This works in HM, just a bit harder since there are more mobs. I just let them bombard me and have healer heal me. This is only when I'm burning Yana at around 20% below, and/or there is no need for switching tiles. You really have to trust your healer for this, as well as watch your own HP while doing so. This is only for NM.    And wow, thanks for watching my stream;; I've been in embarrassing situation a lot though lol. Stupid tempas..."

TeraOnline,3dde9o,KlanxO,2,Wed Jul 15 11:51:31 2015 UTC,"Well for starters, you need to play it a bit to get the hang of the skill names im gonna mention here.  Blade Draw is a warriors bread and butter; so your rotation will be mostly spamming mini-skill chains that end in BD; these are,   Charging Slash> BD Rising Fury > BD Combative Strike > Traverse Cut > BD ER > Vortex Slash > BD DFA > Vortex Slash > BD   If your BD is on CD, you can do Combative > RoB; or if you have 8 edge, Poison Blade (with infusion) > Scythe  Which of course brings us to scythe, which you must do when you have 9-10 edge.  Now scythe in turn is faster after RoB, Blade Draw, Poison Blade or Evasive Roll, so you should only ever use scythe after those skills.   Personally I recommend only playing warrior if you really like the play-style because even with the recent changes it is still one of the hardest classes to master."

TeraOnline,3dde9o,ZonerRoamer,3,Wed Jul 15 13:15:00 2015 UTC,That's why you don't use spacebar for your BD counter. Stop using spacebar.
TeraOnline,3dde9o,VerticalRadius,3,Wed Jul 15 14:36:37 2015 UTC,"BD is the ONLY skill I chain, because keeping track of its resets is hard, so effectively space-bar IS my dedicated blade draw button.  I have been playing this game for 3 years, and have tanked everything in it quite well without any issues on my war. Your advice is for a new player. I routinely run with some of the best DPS on my server and I have no issues keeping up in DPS or holding aggro.  Not chaining skills makes sense for most skills but don't act like a sheep here; having BD on chain means you can ACTUALLY SEE if its off CD or not without taking your eyes off target."

TeraOnline,3df2hz,Spiffymooge,2,Thu Jul 16 15:10:31 2015 UTC,I would enchant the armor if you're not in 12+ Disco or above.   Or at least 12+ gloves.
TeraOnline,3df2hz,Spiffymooge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:46:50 2015 UTC,"ok, im only in fulm gear, so i guess i might aswell +12 the armor pieces and not give af about the wep untill schisma"
TeraOnline,3df2hz,SirPseudonymous,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:04:48 2015 UTC,Sounds good to me.
TeraOnline,3df2hz,MildLife,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:37:54 2015 UTC,"No, absolutely not. Just go for the schisma weapon and use wroth for fodder."
TeraOnline,3df2hz,SirPseudonymous,0,Thu Jul 16 00:16:24 2015 UTC,Depends on the situation. Wroth is easy to masterwork and +12 making it great cheap gear for your alts.
TeraOnline,3df2hz,Caekie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:56:23 2015 UTC,"You're still flushing many thousands down the drain for the most marginal benefit. At least with schisma you're getting a benefit in line with the cost, but with wroth it's ""well, if I dump 10K+ gold into this it'll be slightly better than fulminate""."
TeraOnline,3df2hz,GunslingerAZ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:14:13 2015 UTC,I agree. Fulminate armor and boots give amazing % damage reduction lines. The only Wroth gear I would even consider are gloves + Belt. Wroth gloves MW +12 would probably get you maybe +3 more power? But only if you also have a Wroth belt as taking two pieces away from Fulminate assuming you have Schisma weapon would take away the +5 power set bonus.
TeraOnline,3df2hz,Kumasylum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. It masterworks easily (1-5 MES) and also goes to +12 very easily (0-5 total failures, maybe 10 if unlucky).  With Wroth +12 and especially if you get Schisma weapon you will be able to do all of the endgame content except maybe TSHM."

TeraOnline,3df23a,BigBallsBitesBack,2,Wed Jul 15 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"PvE:   If you're close enough to Close Quarters, you can fill with Trap skills (particularly Incendiary) if your other spells are on cooldown. Final Salvo should only be used to cancel Radiant Arrow and later on Thunderbolt, but if all your other big DPS skills are on cooldown, it can function as a second Rapid Fire.  Every DPS skill in your arsenal should be used. Learn to line up Penetrating Arrow and use Incendiary Trap for the time being until you get more skills. Also, you won't get a big AoE skill until around Level 58, IIRC.  For the time being, just drop all your damage skills on the back of the boss. In general, use anything that isn't on cooldown. Later on you can worry about rotations. If you must know the full general rotation at 65, it's Velik's Mark > Rain of Arrows > Radiant Arrow > Salvo cancel > Penetrating Arrow > Salvo cancel > Thunderbolt > Salvo cancel > Close Quarters > Breakaway Bolt > Penetrating Arrow, though obviously using a specific rotation is always situational and it's always better to adapt to the situation.  Yes.    PvP:   I've only played equalised PvP (honestly, it's more fun to be on equal footing anyway) so 1 is a bit irrelevant in that sense. But to answer the question, +12/+15 on anything will tend to be expensive anyway. Non-equalised PvP is certainly going to be gear intensive. Even in equalised PvP, your crystal setup is going to matter, though crystals are much cheaper than PvP gear.  Would love to know the answer to this as well if anyone's willing to offer it. I've heard Archers are capable of 100-0 on people with certain combos but I've never found a reliable combo myself.  Most important thing is your aim. Radiant Arrow is a big part of your PvP kit and you can almost instantly kill someone with a back crit with the right crystal setup, but you need to have your cursor on them to actually hit them."
TeraOnline,3df23a,Heratikus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:32:22 2015 UTC,"Regarding:   Is it expensive to decently gear an Archer for PVP? Are we gear intensive? Do +12/+15 a must have to be good or at least decent?   I bring this up because, from a time investment standpoint, I think this is worth mentioning.  From my experience with the game, if you want to be the best in non-equalized PvP, you need the best gear. And the best gear is either really expensive or really time consuming to get.  I'm not hating, I really do like Tera; but that's just how it is.  Etching/Enchanting is going to be expensive regardless though:   The best permanent etchings are going to cost 35k+ each, and some of them can really impact how you preform. For example Reapers and attack speed. Getting +15 means you need the latest feedstock, which you won't get at the same rate as the lower tier feedstock. Which makes it more expensive. In order to get +15, you need +12 which means masterworking. If you want perfect stats on your weapon, you will need to spellbind or go through a million scrolls. Spellbinds cost a TON. Getting +12 alone is expensive, because unless you want to fail enchanting x1000, you need to buy premium alkahest. Premium Alkahest naturally are expensive, but have a higher chance to successfully enchant.   I could go on, but you get the idea. There are plenty of FAQs that will explain what I'm talking about much better. My point is this, every class is expensive to gear on the topend. And everyclass is going to preform the best when you have +15."
TeraOnline,3df23a,redsleven,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:57:17 2015 UTC,"But in estimate, do lots of people have the +12/+15 equipment? Or is it just top tier people? I just want to ask this because i want to know if how often am i getting devoured in pvp."
TeraOnline,3df23a,redsleven,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:36:09 2015 UTC,"So in gridiron, for example, you only get equalized gear up ilevel 197. After that it's your own gear, and I almost always see a fairly large number of people with +15 in that bg.  In the popular wPvP areas, like lumbertown, usually the majority is +12/+15. Same with outside Velika where people like to duel.  Getting PvP gear is actually a lot easier this patch though. You can get a full set of the credit-only gear pretty quick, enchant it and then you'll do OK in Gridiron.  You kind of have to run Gridiron if you want the best PvP gear because otherwise it will take you a million years to enough points to purchase the tokens need to craft the top gear."
TeraOnline,3ddhzq,Bobmoneydbr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:31:57 2015 UTC,i just tank it like the lancer in the video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYxpacamnnY Wall tank it and dodge when u see the beginning of the breath animation and try not to get hit by it and then move alittle to the side and wall tank again. make sure u dont wall tank it at the entrance else it resets lol.

TeraOnline,3ddhzq,Chiral_Systems,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:34:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you have any aspirations to tank TSHM, you cannot wall tank. Lasers in TSHM are not iframable, and blocking breath will generate balls. If you feel confident that you can learn to circle tank the boss once starting TSHM, sure you can wall tank. Its a very similar situation to darkan in SC; yes you could tank him all over the place in NM, but HM required on point positioning and focus if there was any hope in clearing. Just some food for thought."
TeraOnline,3ddhzq,Xivaxi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:24:48 2015 UTC,"You very much can wall tank tshm, and it is much easier than circle tanking.  Dps spends too much time running around catching up to the boss when circle tanked, and bad ring with breath frequency can block off your path, leading to longer fights more prone to get hit hard by rng."
TeraOnline,3ddhzq,canikizu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"This. You can wall tank just fine. All you need is to look up to the kuma face and pay attention to his breath animation. If he does breath, you can backstep to the side and reposition yourself pretty easily."
TeraOnline,3ddhzq,stealthrazor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:07:15 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue attempting to wall tank this guy was that the walls are seemingly curved inward at the top, meaning that you can't angle your camera to see from above and identify animations.  When I did this last night with a squad, I found that one of the biggest keys to getting this done in a clean fashion was having ranged dps who was well geared enough to kill balls quickly when mistakes were made.  When the balls stacked up, it became a nightmare for everyone.  We wiped a couple times, but eventually succeeded when we brought in a higher dps for balls and I tanked it in a circular fashion around the room.  Having a priest pull you out of the corner actually sounds like a really good idea. I don't know how long the cooldown for a priest to pull is, but that might make matters easier.  I only stopped wall tanking because I couldn't tell when the breath was coming."
TeraOnline,3ddhzq,kwspall,2,Wed Jul 15 15:26:51 2015 UTC,"he uses breath attack when his bar shows red skull, the other time he uses red skull is for storm animation  there is another breath-like attack that actually does nothing before he jumps back, and it doesnt show as red skull."

TeraOnline,3ddhzq,warriorgriffinheart,0,Thu Jul 16 10:35:16 2015 UTC,"You can try wall tanking Tempus if you have your priest watch for breath and pull you out when he does it, then you can reposition a little further down the wall. If there gets to be too many puddles and they directly block your way when tanking (especially circle tanking) your healer can clean it up a little by stepping on one or a couple and have your dps take care of the balls"
TeraOnline,3dgbkh,Miseror,5,Thu Jul 16 01:23:02 2015 UTC,"So you want 2 versions of corsairs available at the same time? So a level 65 could either queue with lowbies or their own level.

You have to accept that there will always be people who don't know what to do in both teams and try to be as friendly as possible. Raging in chat only fuels toxicity. Not saying you do any of this but there's just so many people who will not take lead, then start giving orders as soon as the game starts. There are also people who blame everyone for not being at ladders instead of taking ladders themselves. Instead of blaming others, you have to take initiative. That's really the only thing you can do about this situation. Making corsair's 65 only would make ques even LONGER to pop, and I'm sure you probably cs'ed before 65 too."

TeraOnline,3dcjvl,xSenbon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:09:39 2015 UTC,I would use spellbinds and reroll top to 9% attack speed. Use spellbinds because you already have perfect rolls on the bottom.

Spellbinds are expensive and it might take you a lot of tries to get it.  On the other hand, if the source that I found is correct, there are only 4 different options for the top line, and if you're okay with 2 of them, then it's a 50/50 shot to get the right one. If you think that spending 68 spellbinds on taking that shot is worth your money, then go for it.  I'm just not sure if it's better to do that, or if it's better to roll for your perfect top line, and spellbind just that stat and keep rerolling for the bottom 3. It's late and I don't have enough knowledge to do the math. Sorry."

Generally for equipment that needs 4/4 rolls correct, you should use spellbinds or suffer for an immensurate amount of time rerolling via MES.  Not to mention, you just need the top line, which has about 6 different rolls. Meaning you'll almost certainly spend less than me (I was rolling for a bottom line)."

TeraOnline,3dbury,TehAwsum,2,Wed Jul 15 01:53:32 2015 UTC,"5% CDR from energetics would get you an additional 0.4 seconds off of Replenishment.    2xCDR (weapon) + Stat-line CDR + 2x Energetics vs 2xCDR (weapon) + Stat-line CDR + 2xPumped.  In this case, this is simply the difference between using energetics or pumped.  3.7 / 3.3 = 1.121 giving you 12.1% more Replenishment usage. This is 6.05% more AB/SS usage and 12.1% more willpower/mana regen compared to someone who is using pumped on their weapon/gloves, but otherwise the same rolls.    You are trading off 20 power for 6.05% more AB/SS usage (and more willpower/mana gain), assuming you already rolled for CDR on weapons and chest. I don't believe the AS from the etchings will have much noticeable effect since all the animations are canceled anyways.  If your total power (with the pumped etchings and buffs) is above 250, then it may be worth it. However, anything less than that, point per point, you will get more out of power (or crit) than CDR via etchings in this setup.  Edited OP to include a mention of energitic etchings."
TeraOnline,3dbury,megatonfist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"20 additional power when most gunners already run power vyrsks/power inner + power charm, priest shakan, energy stars, power from gloves/brooch/belt isn't much; you end up getting about 5% more dmg overall if not less. I'd take 5% cdr and 8% AS over 5% dmg anyday"
TeraOnline,3dbury,Kourinn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:46:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, gunners are probably around or above the breakeven range in this situation (200-250, I just quickly plugged in some numbers into the power formula).  I still feel that moving the Vrysks and Inners to crit would be more effective if your power is too high. I don't have numbers to play with right now, so it's hard to say. Would you happen to have a setup that I could get numbers from?"
TeraOnline,3dbury,Acerolion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:28:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks to /u/roukanken for for deriving this formula, but the equation for ability cooldown reduction (percentage) is:  1 - (1 - [Sum of Gear CDR + Glyphs]) * (1 - [Sum of Buff CDR])   ""Gear CDR"" includes weapon rolls and etchings  ""Buff CDR"" includes Nostrums and active abilities like Deadly Gamble for warriors"
TeraOnline,3dbury,Acerolion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:50:23 2015 UTC,"I see, thanks for the formula! All the math in OP is correct, but if you want to factor in CDR buffs, then you need to add up all the buffs then multiply it with the gear CDR."
TeraOnline,3dbury,Kourinn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:06:00 2015 UTC,"Wait a sec, assuming you have 20% cdr for gear+glyph and another 20% cdr for buff CDR, that formula gives me:  1 - (1 - 0.2) * (1 - 0.2) = 1 - 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.36  This means a 10s cooldown skill will now become 3.6s cooldown.  This can't be."

TeraOnline,3dbury,Tomridd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:11:13 2015 UTC,"While I think theoretically that CDR and the replenishment roll will yield higher DPS, I actually rerolled my chest to 7% AB damage and found my overall play feel a lot smoother.   My replenishment was down to a little over 4s, and with that, all I could ever use as filler was scattershot, arc bomb or time bomb. Whenever I would use mana missiles or try to pump out a full burst fire, my replenishment would always go off cooldown for at least a second or 2. This either left me with using blast as filler, or wasting some of the cooldown time. Also I felt like there was a lot of wasted time when repositioning to get behind bosses.   I feel like having a CDR roll on weapon to help with other skills and the 7% AB damage roll on chest is the sweet spot for me in terms of playstyle. I don't have any numbers to back up anything, and even if I did, they might not show I actually do less DPS, but the gameplay just feels more fluid to me this way."
TeraOnline,3dbury,megatonfist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:54:55 2015 UTC,Could you take it a step further and include nostrums? Since nostrums is multiplicative with CDR in gear rolls and etchings.  Maybe a good mix will be using nostrums and giving up CDR etchings for power or giving up chest CDR for AB damage.
TeraOnline,3dbury,jhaggz,2,Wed Jul 15 05:59:45 2015 UTC,"I just tested both the melee and ranged nostrums, and neither have any affect on replenishment. I'm guessing this is because nostrums only affect attacking skills (at least that's what the wording says)."
TeraOnline,3dbury,megatonfist,-1,Wed Jul 15 10:39:48 2015 UTC,Stacking so much CD is actually detrimental to a gunners playstyle. A good gunner knows that his top 2 skills are AB and burstfire. With so much CD reduction there is no time to get the full benefit of BF which comes in the bottom half of the willpower bar. I don't know how the calculations work but I actually think running a attack speed on the top line would benefit a gunner so much more than that enrage or cd reduction because skills get activated faster which allow you to actually make full use of your main DPS skills
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,JocelynWonderland,11,Wed Jul 15 06:32:26 2015 UTC,why does it feel like I'm tickling mobs now in comparison to my gunner?   because gunner is the easiest and hardest hitting class in the game
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,JaggerA,-13,Wed Jul 15 07:20:27 2015 UTC,"Well, saying that is highly debatable would be an understatement. While i must say that owing to the fact that it was released soon after TERA's release on steam, the new influx of players needed a new class. They made this class both for sustain and dps. While i agree that is is relatively simple to play, hardest hitting is something i see as false. While it might have good skill chains, and amazing mobility, something like a Zerker or lancer could easily pull out the nukes, and then launch into a counter. You dont see many good lancers these days. They arent as rare as a Warrior-Tank though. Those could pretty much shut down the gunner with the new patch. While my views might not be shared as much, gunner isnt the ""Hardest hitting"" class by far."
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,TheJokrsApprentice,11,Wed Jul 15 10:02:15 2015 UTC,"It's been proven over and over, and then over again that gunner is both the quickest burst and highest sustained dps.  but then again you also mentioned lancer as top dps so \o/"
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,AChickenTender,3,Wed Jul 15 10:31:59 2015 UTC,"""Lancer could easily pull out the nukes"", do you even do PvE? Lancer PvE damage is miserable compared to even Sorcs/Archers/Slayers which are considered the ""weaker"" DPS classes right now.   While it's true that a good zerk or warrior can easily dish out as much damage, if not more than a gunner can, they have a range disadvantage and are significantly harder to play well compared to a gunner.   Also, warrior tanks are getting really common these days. since this patch they get all the tools lancers had over them and is basically lancers with more iframes and better damage mitiation that does more damage."
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,AuregaX,8,Wed Jul 15 11:44:01 2015 UTC,"The thing is... we could give you the best advice in the world, but if you are level 59 it's impossible that you understand how this class works. Seriously, even at 65 you'll need time and patience.  It all depends on whether you like challanges, because there are other classes like the gunner with which you can deal a lot of damage without much effort and a pretty simple rotation. The reaper is not like that, it's about mobility, dodging, positioning and risk management.  I know how you feel because a while ago I quit a well geared 65 reaper due to my lack of understanding of the class. I died a lot and I was frustrated, but I loved the reaper so I started training and watching youtube videos of pro people and I felt motivated to continue. Now I'm loving it and I would never switch to another class :) Good luck mate."
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,Meganezuki,7,Wed Jul 15 10:15:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of reaper is proper rotation. If you mischain skills, the reaper feels like it has all the fluidity of a solid lead brick. There are 3 main rotations for reapers for PvE. The first is deathspiral-double sheer-grimstrike- sundering strike. This makes the grimstrike and sunderstrike animation about 2-3 seconds shorter. You can continue this combo by using the second charge of deathspiral to chain into grim strike resets or to restart the combo if you have to dash our counter. The second rotation is pendulum into whipsaw. This positions you at a good distance to dps the boss, and you can use it to reposition behind the boss to. The third rotation is cableshot into shadow burst. You should be rotating between these 3 combos, and if you chain these together it feels alot faster due to chaining increasing cast speed for a bunch of skills. This should help fluidity.  Another thing to remember is that you have almost no attack speed currently. It feels like night and day to be honest. It has cut my animations in half for most of my skills. It makes a huge difference in how a reaper feels. Hope this helps."

TeraOnline,3dcqw6,Ic3Kreemz,5,Wed Jul 15 06:59:45 2015 UTC,"Highly disagree with what endlessramber said, reapers are extremely good in pve as long as you know how to play the class, one of the top 3-4 in the dps list atm. Only problem in terms of fluidity is the cool down wall reapers face, which has been significantly reduced with the buffs and will be further reduced in the next set of buffs. Tbh it's a pretty solid class in pvp and pve, you really can't go wrong with it unless you do not put the effort and time to learn how to be a good reaper."
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,randomgrunt1,2,Wed Jul 15 08:12:06 2015 UTC,"The reaper is already a solid base class, it just feels a lot better with gear. In addition, 58-65 isn't that long. You just need to run a few dungeons, took me around 10? then do the level 65 questline. You could probably knock it out in half a day.  Edit: Endless's comment refered to an endgame bug. When you level reaper skills past their initial level from your skills menu, they don't actually level. Instead you need to go to a tactics trainer to properly level up your skills. It doesn't really have an effect on the feel of the skills, instead it severely gimps your damage until you level the skills at the trainer."
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,AuregaX,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:16:30 2015 UTC,"Having both a reaper and Gunner that I've done TSHM with, I have to say that Gunner is superior to reaper in terms of utility and sustained damage output for this current patch. Being able to solo-rotate middle circle on Yana is just too useful to ignore, and them being able to output damage at almost any range and not being affected as much by boss movement.  Like /u/randomgrunt1 said, reapers are all about proper rotations, and attackspeed will affect that significantly (I can squeeze 2 extra grim strikes into the first combo if it resets). cable step -> shadow burst and pendulum->whipsaw can help you reposition/move around the fight. Remember to always use a nostrum or you'll be stuck with several seconds of downtime before your skills cool down. For me, unless grim resets a lot, I'm still finding myself with windows of a second or two where I can only autoattack while i wait for my skills to cooldown during bossfights. When you get the rotations and positioning/movement in the boss fights down, reapers are in fact very strong DPSers right now.  Reapers are extremely gear dependent in order to pull big numbers, but when you have the gear for it, their damage isn't far behind a gunner's (my +13 gen reaper outdamages my +12 shisma gunner). On the other hand, Gunners scale decently with gear and perform decently even if undergeared. Reapers are absolutely a very good DPS class, but their main problem is how squishy they are. My reaper will sometimes get 1 shot by a random boss mechanic (arm cannon and the stone chain from AIHM last boss will crit me for 90k+, while gunner only takes around 60k). In return, reapers have more iframes and a super-iframe in retribution (can use it to iframe attacks that are otherwise not iframable, like TSHM 2nd's boss' jump, or water in BRHM).   Not quite sure what you're talking about when you say 58-65 runs, but I'm assuming your'e meaning leveling them, in which case, reapers kinda start off at 58 after their intro quests, while gunners have to start from level 1. in terms of actual speed when doing the quests form 58-65, I'd say gunners can do it much faster than reapers.  EDIT: I personally find using spacebar as a reaper initially to not be as bad as people say, as it gives you a good way to learn the timing between chaining skills. However, once you've gotten more or less used to timings, you should move away from that, since it often causes you to do say a double spiral which is a pretty significant DPS loss since you lose out of a lot of the powerlink damage boosts."
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,bo0sh,2,Wed Jul 15 11:34:28 2015 UTC,"I am not quite sure if this is the most updated version but what often gets linked in these sort of Reaper threads is Armell's Reaper FAQ.

TeraOnline,3dcqw6,Toma2YouRFaCE,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Hi.  I can somewhat relate to you here.  I started out as a Sorcerer and Grinded it out until level 65 because I really love magic based classes.  However, I was really interested in the reaper.  Something about that class just continuously drew me in. Literally right after hitting 65 with my sorcerer, before even experiencing end game, I made a reaper.  It felt clunky to me too.  It felt like my only option was to spacebar my rotations.  As much as I wanted to love the class, I thought it's playstyle was straight up stupid.  So I mained my Sorcerer for 6 months.  In those 6 months, obviously my mentality toward the game and how to play it to be highly successful in the end game content completely matured.  My understanding of how to comfortably set up rotations based on various situations both PvE and PvP became a whole lot clearer.    With this I realized that the reaper's intention is to be a ""pick me up"" class.  The intention is give new players an idea of how to chain skills together.  However this is obviously done poorly since there's no real explanation behind it from when you pick up the class.  I decided to pick up Reaper after those 6 months and I was easily able to use proper rotations on the class without using space bar to use skills.  The class now to me feels really smooth and I absolutely love it.  I now main the class and do not plan to change, probably ever.  They're fast, safe and high in DPS in both PvP and PvE.  Basically what i'm trying to say is, you're still really new to the game, even with your experience Tera has a totally unique playstyle compared to the games you mentioned.  I'm sure you'll love Reaper, google some reaper guides and set up the skills on your keyboard in a way that will make you feel comfortable.  Then practice the rotations without the use of spacebar to chain the skills, time them, get used to how the reaper's mechanics work.  And like the replies before me have mentioned, the class scales really well as you progress.  It becomes a lot more fun then it already is once you gear up and have cooldowns, high crit/power and attack speed."

The key is to learn the skills and do not use spacebar. You don't have to use the skills to just deal damage, you can also use them as gapclosers or reposition yourself (Pendulum Strike is such a good skill regardless of the little damage it can do)"
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,EndlessRambler,-7,Wed Jul 15 21:23:35 2015 UTC,Be sure you go to the actual skill trainer to level skills as reaper skills are bugged.  Reaper flows a lot better as you get better gear (and attack speed) although honestly are not very good in PvE. Feels like your gunner is much better because it is. Gunner is super OP faceroll DPS atm in pve and reaper is one of the bottom tier (probably the actual bottom with all the sorc buffs last patch).  However reaper is very good in pvp with life steal for days and tons of staggers/stuns and escape options to augment strong burst and good aoe. It's like a sorc where you are basically better off in pvp unless you REALLY REALLY like the class.

TeraOnline,3dcqw6,AuregaX,5,Wed Jul 15 06:46:18 2015 UTC,"Don't buy into peoples' opinions on class balance. Tera doesn't have a robust set of logging tools, so even the people running damage meters are just guessing based on which classes they see coming on top most frequently, and most are just parroting hearsay. And reapers specifically have a lot going against them due to the difficulty of the class and the fact that most reapers have been playing with unleveled skills due to a bug, so the ""it kinda feels like I should be doing more damage, this class must be bad"" sentiments Tera's community thrives on simply aren't very accurate most of the time. People who talk as though they know without a doubt that reapers are bad are probably just really bad with their reaper.  As for the rotation, you can't rely on your spacebar at all. I'd honestly suggest unbinding your chain key altogether. Reapers rely on skill interactions and powerlink glyphs, so getting good at reaper means understanding how to capitalize on those interactions.  To explain things simply:  Grim strike ideally follows both death spiral and double shear, but can also follow double shear alone. Do not cast its resets back-to-back, attempt to insert either death spiral or double shear in between them. Preferably both if they're off cooldown. Do not cast it if you cannot chain into it.  Sundering strike ideally follows a grim strike combo, but can also follow double shear alone. Do not cast it if you cannot chain into it.  Whipsaw always follows pendulum swing. Cast it without a chain only if you are interrupted while trying to chain it. Casting it unchained is better than putting it off for 15 seconds. Don't use pendulum strike unless you're chaining it with whipsaw, there's no point.  Shadow burst ideally follows cable step. If cable step is on CD and you have nothing else you can do, cast it unchained.  Those four abilities are your priorities, everything else besides shadow lash is filler. At any given moment you should be attempting to chain into one of them, and everything you do should be an attempt to chain into one of them. Never use a filler if you aren't going to chain into one of these four skills, it's a waste of a cooldown. Other things to keep in mind:  Shadow burst and shadow lash have 30s CDs, and cable step has a 15s CD. Alternating cable step - shadow burst and cable step - shadow lash when cable step comes off cooldown will keep you from being mana starved. If all your finishers and cable step are on cooldown and you are below 70% (ish) mana you can cast shadow lash unchained.  Shadow lash and whipsaw both chain with double shear. Don't get caught with your hand up your ass after using one of them; if sundering or grim is about to come off CD and death spiral is on CD make sure you chain into double shear for the 10% bonus damage.  Back when double shear's chain bonus was 100% smite was a useful combo starter. This is not the case now, however if you're in a situation where you would have to wait for a second or two to cast double shear in order to chain it with something (e.g., double shear is off CD, but grim's has 3 seconds left) there's no reason not to start the combo with smite. Obviously don't do this if you'll need the stun for something later.  Finally, every now and then all four of your finishers and shadow lash will be on CD. This is the only time it is acceptable to use your basic attack.  That's it. On paper you can reduce the rotation to a few combos, but in practice dodges and whatnot will cause your cooldowns to desync, so you'll have to know what you're doing to keep your dps up. It's tough, but once you get the hang of it it's actually a very fluid rotation."
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,narrill,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:10:18 2015 UTC,"A few notes to this, as it's mostly accurate.   Pendulum strike is one of your tools to help you move better during a fight. It basically propels you backwards and is much faster than normal running. It's extremely useful as a re-positioning tool, so don't be afraid to use it as such, even if you can't whipsaw after it.   Casting grim strike resets several times in a row is fine during your first combo since you can squeeze 1-2 of them in depending on your attackspeed before sunder in your initial combo before you lose the 2nd spiral.   Reaper is a top DPS class, right after gunner, zerk and warrior right now, but the wonderful thing about Tera is that a ""suboptimal"" class played well is significantly better than a ""top tier"" classed played decently. I've seen Sorcs and archers outdamage gunners simply because they knew the fights better and could take advantage of movements to get more backcrits."
TeraOnline,3dcqw6,xTiCT0C,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:50:23 2015 UTC,"before you lose the 2nd spiral.   You should at least wait until after the second spiral for the powerlink bonus, and double shear's cooldown is short enough that you'll sometimes be able to use it before the second grim strike as well, or at least between the second and the third. Casting them back to back is fine if you get four or five resets in a row and death spiral and double shear are on cooldown, but if you can take advantage of the powerlink bonuses there's no reason not to."

TeraOnline,3dcqw6,NautyNautilus,0,Thu Jul 16 01:10:51 2015 UTC,"A few reasons, one of which I can really see here is one that I had issues with in that Reaper is a really, REALLY easy class to get spacebar dependent on.  (Disclaimer - I haven't played my reaper much since the new patch, so I'm not sure how much this applies. Been using what little free time I have on my gunner)  The greatest strength I've found in the Reaper isn't just its damage output, but the mobility of the class and how fluid they can move around the battlefield.  Until you learn the class and the mechanics of the fights, you're using your stuns and semi-escape moves in these rotations, may of which are chained by default. This is one of the main reasons I see Reapers die in PVE in boss fights (and was the main reason it happened to me too). They'll use shadow step twice in a row to reposition, chain Pendulum into Whipsaw, and then suddenly the only option they have to avoid a huge hit is to get a perfect timing on Counter which can move you into more damage even if you hit it right.  Same thing with Smite. Until you know the fights and mechanics, I'd save this one in reserve to use to knock a boss out of an enrage move. If someone else has already stunned or staggered, go for it.  Two more tips that have helped me immensely:  Shadow Lash makes a great filler skill, especially on stationary groups of adds. A ton of backcrits and a completely full mana bar is great, especially if Grim Strike resets like six times in a row and you run out of mana to keep your rotation up.  ALWAYS check with the group and tank especially if they're okay with you using Soul Reversal on big mobs or bosses. The wrapping chain around the boss can make some cues hard to see."

If you didn't have a healer, you better not get hit too many times or you die  -There wasn't OP relic weapons that let you faceroll through content, if you wanted orange gear you needed to run dungeons and pray for a rare drop. So you're fighting them with weaker gear  Soloing a BAM back in the day was actually a huge achievement, you had to be good to do it.

TeraOnline,3da50p,skilliard4,2,Wed Jul 15 05:27:12 2015 UTC,I haven't played in a long time. I assume they nerfed the BAMs so they're easier to solo now? I remember my first BAM solo I felt so accomplished.

TeraOnline,3dcerm,Shuuuyan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:35:56 2015 UTC,On reason why CS queue times seemed long was that the matchmaking had trouble to find groups of exactly 20 and that it tried to match groups vs groups so they changed it to only max of 2 players per party to reduce queue times (which worked i feel) so yes you can only queue as 2 at 65 though there is content you can do as up to 5 (fraywind for example)

TeraOnline,3d9xdf,narium,11,Tue Jul 14 17:20:41 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous how they decided to band aid this. Not only is eclipse a short duration buff but it is also very expensive in AV, we need a new tier version that is not removed upon death, has better aggro reduction and is made using the more abundant and cheap cobala ore.  Imo shouts and special aggro drawing skills should work as a team wide eclipse, while under the effect of X shout your party members generate -25% less threat. That way I don't have to worry about Jonny the Scrub gunner blowing his OP vengeance with out eclipse and typing ""lol igotaggro for 2 seconds me too gud dps kekeke"""
TeraOnline,3d9xdf,heiltdo,5,Tue Jul 14 19:36:08 2015 UTC,"It's honestly just what happens when gear power-creeps over skill design. When agro drawing skills like Torrent of Blows and Guardian Shout were designed they had a specific agro # attached to them, and damage dealt by every member has a formula to convert that damage to agro. So obviously if you hit for an extremely large number the amount of agro you generate is immense. Purely numerical agro generation skills don't scale with your equipment, at least not in the drastic way damage can scale with equip and consumables.  Bluehole first tried to band-aid this with more accessible agro rolls, it worked for a little bit when DPS were hitting for around 600k and 1 mil crits were very rare, but then the crit scrolls and all the new dps rolls plus consumables pushed it past the point where agro rolls just couldn't cut it. So the only way is to reduce the amount of agro the dps dealt, and now we have eclipse.  Eclipse, in my opinion, should be sold by the merchant, and should be cheap. I'm talking maybe 9g per pot. I personally craft Eclipse and know how expensive they are, it's actually pretty brutal. I think eclipse should be something more accessible to DPS, maybe even make it drop in dungeons so you can replenish your stock as you run. I see far too many dps run AINM/HM without eclipse, and honestly, I really don't want to deal with that as a tank. It's the result of something overlooked and unforeseen by the game developers, or foreseen but just handled poorly. Players shouldn't be burdened with the responsibility of dealing with that."

This obviously is not always the case, parties would be so limited if a +12 disco lancer wanted to join a +15 group but was denied because they know he couldn't hold aggro. The eclipse pot makes tanking in this situation possible and doesn't exclude players still learning or undergeared.   An aggro increase pot could spell disaster for someone who wanted to troll a party, oh I am +15 and I don't like this group, pops one and completely ruins the party for everyone involved.\  I personally don't like the eclipse pots myself, it just another consumable I have to remind players to use......"

It's a shame that Eclipse potions are mandatory when tanking, since it doesn't matter much how well you play as a tank if your DPS aren't using Eclipse. If they're good, they'll pull aggro.  Hopefully the new crystals and aggro formula in the kTera update will fix it, but that's still a long ways off for us.   It would be nice for EME to make Eclipse persist through death, though."

Front crit glyphs for tanks and aggro will scale with the damage you deal as well, and also aggro crystals will become one with the value of 4, so that you'll just equip 1 and wear 3 damage crystals aside from that. Bosses will push tanks around less, and also tanks get better tank glyphs and skills in the following patches, that increase aggro and dps when tanking.   It'll be better. Slayer buffs coming too. Just you wait. (:"
TeraOnline,3d9xdf,N0rthWind,0,Wed Jul 15 01:45:37 2015 UTC,There's always been threat reduction.... Even in World of Warcrap they had threat reduction and that game is such a joke now.
TeraOnline,3d9xdf,Masterpop1337,3,Tue Jul 14 17:42:38 2015 UTC,"Dont know what your talking about, but even in vanilla wow it wasnt a requirement to take threat reduction pots into every dungeon. there were/are a few classes with some threat reduction skills like hunter and priest, but i never needed to specifcally drink threat reduction poitions inorder for a tank to do his job. This is a design flaw of tera, nothing else."
TeraOnline,3d9xdf,phoenixaflame17,0,Tue Jul 14 21:28:11 2015 UTC,"Attacks draw __% more aggro is too damn vague. There's no way to calculate or see how much aggro you're generating.  So an increase in aggro generation pot would be pretty useless. My Lancer's aggro holding ability is proportional to my damage than anything else. I went from quick disco lance to ""quick"" schisma lance for about 1 week and hitting harder due to +% dmg and +% dmg to enraged has significantly increase my ability to hold aggro. My +% aggro increased maybe like 5% but I'm getting 500k wallop back crits on bosses in AIHM. That 500k crit generates far more aggro than stacking +% aggro increase will.   What I'm really saying is, when a dps nukes the boss for 8 million dmg in 2 sec, you need (what I believe) damage with increase % aggro to pull the aggro back. Not to mention when dps use eclipse pots they'll just nuke 100% of the time instead of potentially watching aggro before potting. Now if eclipse pots increased aggro instead then everyone will nuke all the time thinking the tank will be able to hold aggro now no matter what. But we can't tell right now what's better. There's no aggro meter anywhere.   Imho, until we can see aggro levels in real time, eclipse pot changes are pretty irrelevant."
TeraOnline,3d9xdf,Spiffymooge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"Getting the best aggro generation has always been finding the right balance of damage and aggro modifiers. A Focused crystal will add a lot more aggro than a fourth Threatening. If you don't need the speed, a crit damage scroll instead of a speed scroll will add a ton too, assuming your crit rate isn't +10. It's the same reason why people with Intense lances usually don't roll for another %-aggro and instead get more damage or attack speed."
TeraOnline,3d9xdf,fluffy-tails,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:36:14 2015 UTC,"If you're not using a focused instead of a 4th threatening, you're doing something wrong. ~400k crits from the front with whallop. Granted I'm using +15 gene."

The crystal usually dies for me at around the same time deadly gamble runs out.  I just iframe everything and stick to crystal at all times, ignoring trash mobs that spawn.  By the time my deadly gamble comes up again, I just pop it again and the tree dies by the end of that.  I have deadly gamble glyphed for both duration and cd.

You try doing HM on a fulminate warrior, it's a pain and it's often much better to do the gatekeepers which will result in a 20 minute run.   Besides, I've like to see proof that a gunner can clear the dungeon in less than a minute.  Just waiting for the chest to spawn takes a long time, not to mention walking to the boss."

TeraOnline,3d9gs0,Heratikus,3,Tue Jul 14 15:24:35 2015 UTC,"Just a note, the following tips I'm going to give apply to a lvl 65 priest.    1) I run 2x relentless, 1x warding, and 1x resolute on armor. Warding is good against KD and resolute is good because the dmg taken decrease > health increase (in the event you can't heal yourself, or have healing debuff and don't have time to cleanse). For weapon, I use 3x brilliant and 1x swift. Glyph setup has a lot to do with your play-style. Here are my glyphs: http://teratoday.com/glyphcalc#pr65:a1:e1:g1:h0:j1:m0:n0:q01:s1:A1:B02:D0:F0 . I often switch Kaia's HP glyph for leash CD reduction when I need to pull people through a gate, and then switch it back.  2) When you're going in offensively, you might want to kaia just to give yourself more opportunity to plague them. Don't kaia too early, though. At the start of a zerg vs zerg all the dps have their skills off CD so there will be a lot of dmg dished. I like to Kaia then throw plague on all the melee classes I see. I will pick a healer to plague if I see them have kaia and GS on. Just keep in mind that if you plague someone, there will be a DoT on them so if you sleep them they will be broken from sleep.   Then, it's nice to look at the back of the enemy line and find the healers. Try to notice when they have GS (Guardian Sanctuary, priest) on or if they have their fairy (mystics). If they have these, don't sleep that one because it won't work. If they don't have this, then definitely sleep them unless a DPS is hitting them.  If I see someone gang up on my team, I'll tornado (vortex). Otherwise, if my team is getting a nice set up and is dealing more pressure, save your vortex because it can ruin some dps rotations.   I don't generally bother triple nem'ing in zerg vs zerg because there are a million other things that are more useful. Unless you're against a priest and they happen to be movement locked, then I'll throw in a triple nem with debuff glyphed. Don't try to triple nem on a moving target, the animation lock is too OP. And never shoot it three times, because the third shot has the longest animation lock. Only reason I glyph triple nem in CS is to triple nemesis on the gates and seiges.  At the start of a zerg, if you're going to go close to the front line (more offensive) it's good to guardian sanctuary yourself just in case they giga. If your team gigas first, be prepared for a counter giga by either GS'ing yourself or getting out of giga range. If your team gets giga'd, cleanse them before you heal.  Put cleanse on CD and spam it. A lot of mistakes that healers make is that they try to heal someone instead of cleanse, and the DPs dies. Know when you need to cleanse, and when to heal.  Rebuff DPS. You don't need to do all the buffs. Generally Power + endurance is okay if you're pressed on time or mana.  Arise can really fuck up your teammates if you use it when they have retaliate off CD. Try to only do it if you see them get KD'ed, use retal, and then KD'ed shortly after (where you know they don't have retal). Otherwise they may end up jumping if they're retal-spacebar-jump-heroes.   3) Positioning is more about what kind of heal style you play with. I play more offensive, which means i get right in their face and sometimes I rush into their zerg to go behind them. ((Know when to NOT do this though.))   Healing circle is your friend and saving grace sometimes. Just need to know when to use it. It's good to use it when a DPS is staying kinda still. When the DPS is getting pressured, they're going to be trying to escape as fast as possible, so its better to cleanse/target heal. They usually stay still after they get decently safe, so that's when I healing circle. Also be prepared to cancel your healing circle if you know its going to miss, that way you won't be stuck in animation lock (by pressing movement keys).  All in all positioning is more about playstyle. There are healers that play more defensively, i.e. focus more on heals + support and like to stay safe. I'm a bit suicidal but I can handle myself pretty well so I go offensive more often. One thing though, is try not to stay still for too long. Keep moving, it makes it harder for enemies to target you."
TeraOnline,3d9gs0,iEuphoria,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:37:57 2015 UTC,"I'm a slayer main, and I appreciate the work of healers. Here's a few points to the OP that you covered already:    rebuff dps. THIS. DO THIS. Your buffs have negligible cooldowns but they make a huge difference. Power, endurance and healing buffs are a huge help. Most players die at least once but most priests don't rebuff during the rounds, leaving their raids weaker. If you keep your team buffed, it makes a big difference in battles if the enemy healers don't do the same (which is likely). As an individual they help me a lot too, the buffs allow me to single out and murder the enemy healers more easily, which is also crucial.  do not try the healing circle when I'm getting murdered. You will miss, I will die, you will die soon afterwards, there goes one healer for our team. Use the lock ons, cleanse me often, use the shield and when I have time I'll make sure to sit still next to you so you can 0-100 me with the Grand Heal Royale. Till then, healing immersion will usually do for emergencies. Also if you see me fighting someone and you're too busy to heal me properly, a rejuvenation circle (idk iirc the name, I mean the heal over time thingy) will do. Drop one before leaving even if you can't lock on heal me. It helps a lot in extended duels and if I win the fight, I might capture an unguarded pyre when it's crucial.  do not pocket heal. Try to heal everyone, not just top off your friends. There's nothing more infuriating than dying literally in front of my healer because he mindlessly spams heals at his full-HP premade. Also, when you're healing, try and look around you. I hate it when I have to jump up and down in front of my healer to make them notice me. Focusing on fights and gates is important, but you're the cornerstone of the raid. Every life you don't save due to not paying attention, is one less person fighting.   These are my 2 cents. On behalf of the dps community, thanks again for keeping us alive, so we can keep them, well... not alive. :3"
TeraOnline,3d9gs0,N0rthWind,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:11:32 2015 UTC,Try using Arise every now and then while your team is rushing the gate. Your melee DPS allies will love you.
TeraOnline,3d9gs0,Lethal1313,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:50:34 2015 UTC,"Now, personally I don't play priest in CS (so take my advice with a grain of salt) but I do lead CS matches so I can sort of tell you what I generally would like to see from priests.   Rather than a guide of how 2 priest, think of this as a what-people-want-from-you thing. There might be stuff in here you can do way better with another method, or things that aren't actually any use.   1) Kaia's shield   Use it on groups climbing ladders. It can give people that extra bit of health necessary to survive making it up.  Use it when you're assaulting gates and your group is getting harassed. During a gate burn, you can just spam it whenever it CDs or try to watch for enemies and kaia's before a rain of arrows/bombardment/etc.   2) Arise   Personally, I don't really notice too many people using this skill. Probably would be pretty useful during a mid pyre assualt when you're getting mass KDd by sieges.   3) Plague of Exhaustion   (probably) Really good early-game during a gate burn or an initial defense while people's buffs are still live.    4) Ishara's Lullaby   Can be useful. Pretty good when you're gate burning as a way of disabling harassers, assuming your dpsers focus on the gate and ignore slept people as they should. Wars/Slayers, who should be protecting you guys during a gate burn (because they're generally not very effective against gates (... i think. Correct me if i'm wrong)) might be able to get off a nice clean charged hit.   5) D I V I N E I N T E R V E N T I O N B O I Z   This is literally the best skill in the game (not really). If you're in a backcrit ship, you can get behind a gate and start pulling people through the gate with this skill (I think.) moar backcrits = win   6) Healing Circle   Fucking amazing if you can pull it off. Stick in the middle of your group if possible. Won't work on half-dead people because the instinctive reaction of half-dead people in CS is to flail wildly and flee in random directions. Just use it right after aoe attacks n shit before they can run from you. During an outer gate burn, you can sit inside the wreckage of a tank and circle from in there, and you'll be relatively safe. See positioning section.     Glyphs  Besides the obligatory TN glyph and the ES glyphs,    All of dem Kaia glyphs All of dem healng immersion glyphs CDR on: Divine Respite, Sleep, Fiery Escape Multiplication on Focus Heal, maaaybe longshot if you have issues with range.  Heal Thyself glyph if you get hammered often     Positioning... Your raid leader should probably mark healers so melee pvpers can keep an eye on you. But this takes effort, and so most people won't do it (including me). Try to stick near warriors/slayers and ask your raid lead to tell them to cover you."
TeraOnline,3d9gs0,Zenith042,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:50:01 2015 UTC,"Eh. For glyphs, I would disagree. You don't need to run CD glyph for Divine Respite. It's not worth the points you sacrifice.  Don't need longshot. DPS shouldn't run away from you if they need heals, again, not worth the points.  And personally, glyphing all of kaia and all of heal imm takes a lot of points. Glyphing the ones you say to takes a total of 57/55 points (aka, not possible). But you're not glyphing Guardian Sanctuary? That skill is a lifesaver. You also can't glyph Plague now. You also can't glyph retaliate now. You also aren't glyphing Cleanse CD now. Nor in-combat movement speed.   Other than that, your other points are pretty correct."
TeraOnline,3d9gs0,iEuphoria,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:42:48 2015 UTC,"DPS shouldn't run away from you if they need heals,   Sadly, we do. Without priest marking, it can be difficult to tell which people are priests and which aren't amidst 15 people at max zoom range.    Glyphing the ones you say to takes a total of 57/55 points (aka, not possible).   Well, it was more of a list of seemingly useful glyphs than any actual build. The fact that it was that close to 55 is from pure coincidence.   Fair points on GS/Retaliate/Cleanse/Plague though.  To be honest, i'm a little relived that most of this was generally correct. Aside from glyphs, which generally takes too long to argue about imo, i tend to shout most of the rest of the information over raid notice."
TeraOnline,3d9gs0,Zenith042,0,Tue Jul 14 21:09:36 2015 UTC,"Full relentless blues and full brilliant reds.  You have 1 job as a priest , capturing outer nodes with a random dps , everything else is meaningless , let the other scrub priests do the other work.  My CS with priest were fairly successful via rushing the outer node while the enemy is going for the gate , if you're good enough you can't be solo'd or even Duo'd.(buying time ftw) and if they see you jumping down , some friendly dps are bound to follow."
TeraOnline,3d9gs0,XioKenji,2,Tue Jul 14 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"This is a horrible suggestion. Swift crystal + 3 brilliants is much better than full brilliant. You have infused charms for godsake. And full relentless blues is also not good, there comes a point when either you can't heal or you have a healing debuff that you don't have time to cleanse. Better to go with a Resolute and/or warding and rest relentless.  And as for the job as a priest... I'm sure you are trolling."
TeraOnline,3d9gs0,iEuphoria,0,Tue Jul 14 19:44:05 2015 UTC,"No , it's complety legit and yes I'd remove a single Brilliant for a swift my bad , but would still roll full relentless , as a personal preference.  For defense: Priests are wasted away the few 1st minutes of a match running around , I'd rather a priest jumps down and attempts to capture a node with a couple of dps(DPSs will follow if a healer goes jumps down) than stand near a ladder wanking to nothingness. Even if not going for nodes , just simply being near the enemy will instantly trigger atleast 3-5 people to chase you , even if you manage to hold off these 3 to 5 people for a single minute that's a lot(provided your team is competent enough to actually do something)  During gate breaking stage(Defense) They're also wasted around for standing near the ladders and behind the gates , going down to support dps in killing the enemies at the gate is a much better option.  For offense , simply sticking to your allies is the way to go."

TeraOnline,3d9615,FrostyPeachez,4,Tue Jul 14 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"I have a 65 Lancer and I've done a few guild runs of some end-game dungeons. From my experience, if you're under-geared, you're going to have a hard time holding aggro if your teammates have much, much better gear than you. If you're all generally the same, you should be able to hold on to aggro pretty well, but of course work towards gearing yourself up with crystals and jewellery sets.  Regarding Gunner and Berserker, I have both but neither of them are close to 65. I enjoy both play styles, but I feel that the gunner has a much more fluid gameplay and (in my opinion) just feels more fun to play during the 1-65 grind. It's also a much easier solo class because of the safety and constant self-heal once you hit 28.  In the end, it's all up to preference. Berserkers are good and definitely very strong, but gunners are as well. If you don't feel like playing FOTM, Berserker will be a nice fit. Seeing huge numbers when playing a damage class is always great :)  EDIT: Just as a side note, try and find a nice guild if you're worried about your earlier points. The guild I'm in was quite patient (albeit passive-aggressive) when I couldn't hold aggro on some bosses during AINM. Raids and dungeon runs will almost always require a tank. You will always be needed. However, you might not be useful for more experienced players due to being under-geared and aggro swap. So like I said, just hope that you have patient people who will help you get geared for future runs."

TeraOnline,3d9615,omaniakc,3,Tue Jul 14 14:52:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's a mixed bag. Generally I've had pretty understanding people. Most of the time, people don't normally say anything if aggro is swapping a lot during a boss fight. Also, I like telling teammates that I only need X equipment and some people are nice enough to let you roll on it.   But there will always be people who literally roll on all equipment. That's annoying, but expected. I will never understand the thought process of rolling on something that you really don't need, thus stealing it from whoever needs it. I was doing BRNM and had some forest-series accessories stolen from me like that. They're soulbound and sell for 60 silver! I don't understand why you would take that from someone.  I've never been insulted or whatever for being under-geared. I mentioned that one of my guildmates was passive-aggressive to me though... We were doing the first boss of AINM and aggro kept swapping. Someone said ""Wow this boss is more annoying than the fish in BRNM"", to which someone else replied ""That's because of the aggro swap"". Of course nothing was said to my face, but it's my job as tank to hold aggro and I couldn't do that... so that comment made me feel bad. :(  Please note that these are of course from my experiences. You could experience something very different. But overall, it's been mostly okay with very little nastiness."
TeraOnline,3d9615,Symphawnics,2,Tue Jul 14 15:08:14 2015 UTC,don't feel bad about the aggro swap in ainm - remember you're trying to keep aggro from 8 or 9 other people and that boss is the jumper's jumpers.  it would be pretty difficult to keep aggro on yourself the entire time.
TeraOnline,3d9615,foochbwah,2,Tue Jul 14 16:20:31 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where you go man :/ For instance in my guild on LoT, we offer a service to anyone that wants to be a tank or a healer, we will gear them up as fast as R N Gesus will let us. But other guilds I've seen around are very rude towards tanks/healers and are always blaming them for wipes, etc. when in actuality it's usually the cocky DPS's fault(no eclipse so aggro swapping, not dodging anything, running away from healers and all that lovely stuff.)"
TeraOnline,3d9615,Snizax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:14:32 2015 UTC,"I main lancer and I don't really run many dungeons outside of guild runs. I am pretty decently geared and have ran previous content a lot so I don't think I would have trouble being picked up by a pug.   Tanks are definitely valuable in TERA, so the gear requirement isn't as harsh as a strictly DPS toon. When a group is LFGing for a tank, they most likely will not get very many responses, so if you have proper crystals and look like you know what you're doing, they will most likely take you. Many PvE orientated guilds are looking for tanks right now as well. I walked around MT guildess when I first transfered and I got maybe 2-3 people whispering me about wanting me to join. If you stick to your class and do your research as a Lancer, you will be wanted for PvE. Not to mention you can basically get insta-IMS whenever you want to.   As for a DPS class, Berserker.

Not that it would matter, skill beats gear beats class and the small difference in the other classes dps will not matter.  /u/PrettyTrustworthy you can, with some effort, be tank as a lancer. Still, current meta going warrior is the more solid choice so you can switch to dps if u find yourself not enjoying or managing tank."

TeraOnline,3d9615,Potatoatak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"Unless you have up-to par gear with your DPS or better, you're not going to have a fun time holding aggro (as a lancer). Lancers currently have the lowest aggro gen between them, warriors and berserkers (yes berserkers can tank, but only at Lv65) but they provide the best team security with guardian shout, pledge of protection and rallying cry.  As for DPS Gunner would probably be better over zerker if you run solo more so than groups. Otherwise zerker is pretty cool and super bursty. imo Slayers take the cake when it comes to DPS assuming they can crit a decent amount. I see Slayers taking aggro off me for split seconds way more often than I do gunners (once every 6 minutes when they balders lol) and zerkers which is almost never. Slayers just need a good crit chain to pull aggro. Unforunately holding aggro at endgame is very gear reliant. So just play what you enjoy really. Being in a guild is a big factor here too. If you have friends in a guild that are willing to help gear, playing tera is going to be a lot more fun than pugging and getting yelled at for not being able to hold aggro occassionally."
TeraOnline,3d9615,FrostyPeachez,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:16:20 2015 UTC,Held aggro with patron vs schisma and gen weapons as a lancer. If you dont rely on just shouts (so many bad lancers do) and actually do damage as well as shout your aggro is hard as heck to steal.
TeraOnline,3d9615,TheZanno,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:12:06 2015 UTC,"The shouts are a huge part of it though, however a lot comes from blocking ad shield barrage/spring attack."
TeraOnline,3d9615,Ommageden,2,Thu Jul 16 17:06:27 2015 UTC,yeah i know it is responsible for about 70% of your aggro but your damage makes up that remaining amount so its all up to how people really play
TeraOnline,3d9615,TheZanno,-3,Thu Jul 16 18:17:21 2015 UTC,"Gunner damage off of Arcane Barrage has been severely nerfed, so they don't do as much burst. They're a bit harder to play now as you have to rely on using more than just one skill for the majority of your damage.   Berserkers are by far the best PvE damage. Warriors are also very high under certain cirumstances (two warriors one scythe) and are very versatile in what role they want to play. I'd say pick one of the two here. But honestly, it's all about what you enjoy playing!"

TeraOnline,3d8wbo,rare,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:45:03 2015 UTC,The only hard thing about Hard Mode is that so many things are happening at once that you have to know the mechanics of the Bams/Boss and to dodge accordingly.  When the trees spawn you need to kill them and get the healing motes (this will be your life saver).  Other than that it is just getting out of the way of the AoE stuns and keeping back crit on the crystal.
TeraOnline,3d8wbo,Tangy4tw,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:20:52 2015 UTC,"As a war you should drop your charge glyph and pick up restorative ROB, it'll help a lot with sustaining and charge behaves badly on that fight.

TeraOnline,3d8wbo,Xivaxi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:05:50 2015 UTC,It also has a lot to do with what class you are playing. On my reaper I rarely get hit unless I trade completing one of my big animations for taking a tree auto attack.

TeraOnline,3d8wbo,Captain_Jackson,0,Wed Jul 15 00:31:58 2015 UTC,"I can do it in 2-3mins as a warrior with +12 schisma. You should first try and +12 ur weapon, I would become an alliance member, save up all the T7 feedstock u can, and use the bronze / gold enchanter if it's up to +12. Bronze will give you like 5% at the minimum, but it'll save you a good chunk of money.  In terms of ghillie, the crystal part is really the hardest part of it. If you can damage it fast enough in +12, it shouldn't be a problem, but otherwise, you might want to just ignore the adds and look out for the aoe stuns, as those are deadly. You can put on a cleansing brooch if you're sitll not comfortable. Just look when the guardians swing their arms to know when to dodge, it's really ez to time as war, since you have more than enough invincibility with DFA.  Then you have the big tree. It enrages at 50% and will attack faster. The main and only mechanic here that really needs attention is Bitter Fruit. The moment he announces that, you HAVE to dodge and rush out. You can also chain dodge, but it's risky as you may receive a tick at some point. Keep in mind if you are too far left or right of the tree, that sometimes it will sense it and pound your face off. So the best position would be somewhat from a 45 degree angle, since his front is also a bad place due to mechanics.   While DPSing the tree, just watch for the hand swipes, he will alternate left and right randomly, just DFA the ones on your side and ignore the ones and continue dpsing if he swipes the side you're not on. Also, remember once he casts bitter, and you rush out, he will cast that ""burn"" phase where you have to rush to him. I recommend popping your buffs here, try to get Glyph of Swiftness to proc, then deadlygamble and go at it. Once it's passed 50% and if you have focused niveot, it's a cakewalk."
TeraOnline,3d8wbo,Catalystd,0,Tue Jul 14 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"It's really easy for a warrior, the hardest part is taking down the crystal and dealing with the Ent's. Warrior's lack good AOE so fighting the Ent's and dpsing the crystal takes a little effort, just kite the Ent's away from the middle and dps them to the side watch for ghillies hand smash. A few rounds of this should break the crystal, and for a warrior this part is easy, just rush to ghillie, dps him and dodge his hand smashes, whenever he does the poison attack Roll into a Death From Above and you'll I-frame just long enough to miss the poison."

TeraOnline,3d5l37,TheWompage,62,Mon Jul 13 18:26:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how eli5 this is, but here is the basics of gearing.  There is a basic pve gearing progression. The basic progression is idoneal<fulminate<wroth<shisma<lucid. With lucid being the best possible gear you can get in slot.  Idoneal is the basis endgame set. It can't be enchanted. To get it, you must finish the level 60 supply and demand questline starring zolyn, hit level 65, do sabex armory, marcelius catacombs, and do 20 vangaurd quests. You shoudl also run sabex and catacombs a ton, because they drop high level glyph upgrades you most likely do not have. Edit: if you are missing glyphs, you can purchase glyph tokens from the vangaurd merchant. These let you directly acquire the glyph of your choice. I would recommend this for healers to get their stamina rez.   The fulminate gear is the second tier of gear for Player vs environment. It is dropped at a high rate from bathysmal rising normal mode, a 7 man endgame dungeon. You should run Brnm, bathysmal rising normal mode, until you have a full set of fulminate. You will most likely also aquire a brooch, an item with an activated ability like a self cleanse, and basic jewerly from the run.  Once you have fulminate, you can start working on getting wroth. You get wroth in Akeron's inferno normal mode. For this, you should instance match your party for it. As of the typing of this, instance matchign AInm gives you a wroth and shisma chest, which gives you a chance to get wroth and shisma gear. Wroth is the first enchantable endgame set you get. I would enchant the boots, gloves and chest to plus 9. Which means enchant to to the ninth level.  I would also masterwork the weapon. To masterwork something, you use enigma scrolls to obscure it, than Identify it. Each time you identify the gear it has a chance to become masterworked. Masterwork enigmatic scrolls have a 3 percent chance to masterwork something when used with a intricate identification scroll. Common scrolls have a .5 percent chance of masterworking.   Masterworking improves all the stats of a weapon, and allow it to be enchanted to plus 12. It also gives it more lines of stats. To enchant something past plus 9, you need to use masterwork alkahest, which you can purchase at the vangaurd initiative merchant in highwatch using vangaurd credits, acquired from vanguard initiative quests.  Rerolling is changing the stats on a piece of loot. Loot has lines of stats with a little circle near them. Those statlines can be rerolled, or changed. For example, one of my statlines was +.24 crit power, which I rerolled into 9% bonus damage vs engraged monsters. To reroll something, you wrap in in an enigma using an enigmatic scroll, than identify it. you can also preserve stats you want by applying spellbind while wrapping it in enigma. This is used to make sure the gear was the optimal stats. For weapons, it's usually bonus damage while attacking, attacking from behind, and vs enraged monsters.  Once your wroth weapon is masterworked and you gear is fully enchanted, you can go for shisma. If I recall correctly, shisma is dropped from Akeron's inferno hard mode and Timescape normal mode. This is the best gear you can get from drops. Masterwork all pieces you get, and reroll the statlines.  The last and best gear in the game is lucid. It is crafted from drops in endgame dungeons. All lucid should be masterworked. You can also awaken lucid, which allows it to be enchanted to plus 15.   Edit: To acquire lucid, you need to urn endgame dungeons an average of hundreds of times per a piece if I recall correctly.   While gearing, you also need jewerly. To get proper jewerly for you class, run shattered fleet and vault of kaprima. These dungeons drops rings, necklaces and earring. For dps try to get forctic earrings and ring, and all other jewerly edgetic.   Lastly you need crystals. To get level 65 crystals, you do vangaurd iniatives and buy them from the vangaurd crystal merchant in highwatch.  Sorry if my guide messed up something or was poorly put together, there is a lot of information. I tried to explain it well, and hope I succeeded.   Edit: For pvp gearing is a little simpler. There are 2 pvp gear tiers. It goes Deviate<tensus. To get deviate, you can purchase them with cosmo shards and Bellacrium credits. Cosmo shards are acquired from most endgame raids, such as shattered fleet or Akeron's inferno. You simply right click on the shards to open a store, and purchase your gear. To get bellacrium credits, play in the battleground Corsair's stronghold. You get credits for playing, and more for winning. You can use these to purchase deviant gear at bellacrium credit merchants, located in highwatch and velika. Probably also located in kaitor and alementhia but Honestly I have no idea about those for sure.  For crafting tensus, you need Inferno ore, Noscible marks, Patritrion marks and crowning laurels. The Patritrion marks are acquired through bellacrium credits. The noscible marks are acquired through killing spree credits. Those you get from playing pvp and murdering people if I recall correctly. Inferno ore is acquired through the trade broker and as drops in endgame dungeons. The crowning laurel is awarded randomly in win of the day boxes for kuma asylum and sea chests from corsairs stronghold. PvP isn't my strong suit so I would appreciate corrections on this part."
TeraOnline,3d5l37,randomgrunt1,8,Mon Jul 13 19:39:11 2015 UTC,"Legend. This is great, really appreciate you taking the time to do this"
TeraOnline,3d5l37,randomgrunt1,4,Mon Jul 13 19:46:19 2015 UTC,Glad to help <3.
TeraOnline,3d5l37,iEuphoria,7,Mon Jul 13 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"Really well written, glad you took the time for this.  One thing though: I would just skip +9'ing wroth and go straight to +12 Schisma while working on Lucid (if you're going PVE).   And another thing I want to point out, is the user above spells out what to do if you're going for PVE end-game gear. Lucid is the beast in slot for PVE. For PVP, best in slot is Tensus. Lucid and Tensus are what we call VisionMaker version 5 (VM5).   If you're going PVP, the scaling is simple, it goes from Deviate -> Tensus.   If you want to do PVP, I still highly suggest learning PVE first. Get +12 Schisma and learn all the dungeons, learn your class, learn other classes. Then grind PVE to get gold and work on getting your mats for Tensus.   Also, as for jewel rolls, there are PVE rolls and PVP rolls.   So for simple:   From 60-65, make sure to finish your story quest to get your Idoneal set. Once you hit 65, you will have a bit of vanguard credits. Use these at a Vanguard Crystal merchant to put some niveots into your Idoneal. Buy some Complete Crystalbinds if you have not already, as niveots are expensive and losing them when you die really sucks. Make sure you do your 16 vanguard dailies each day (press H to access the menu) so that you can save up credits for Masterwork Alkahest Boxes (need these to enchant). Go grab some friends and run BRNM (7-man) until you have your Fulminate set (which does not need/can not be enchanted). Grab some friends and run Shattered Fleet, Vault of Kaprima, and try to get a raid group of 9 people together so you can use instance match to AINM and queue the 10th person. Instance matching AINM will get you your schisma gear. ((And after you already have your gear, you should still do this because you can dismantle the equips you get for Tier 7 feedstock, which is necessary to enchant)). Don't bother enchanting Wroth, just go straight to Schisma. With your Schisma set, work on +9'ing everything, then masterworking it so you can +12 it. Then roll the correct stats for it as well. Test yourself with harder dungeons such as TSNM (you can do this earlier in fulminate if you want) and TSHM, AIHM. Learn your class more. Decide if you want to go into PVE or PVP. Then start working on VM5, if you want.   EDIT: I realize this isn't ELI5. But if you have any questions feel free to ask."

TeraOnline,3d5l37,CrazyVih,3,Tue Jul 14 17:58:24 2015 UTC,"Because not only will you be kicked from dungeons, but you will literally be torn apart. All bosses will most likely onehit you with all attacks. In addition, your dps will be way to low. You will simply not deal enough damage to kill the bosses once, let alone the hundreds of times required to get lucid. The difference in my dps from idoneal to shisma is about 900 k for my reaper.  edit: You could in theory do it, or if you have a strong enough guild they can carry you through it. Most guilds go from idoneal to fulminate to shisma. However, without appropriate gear dungeon runs are slow and miserable."
TeraOnline,3d5l37,Acerolion,2,Mon Jul 13 22:05:44 2015 UTC,"Because in order to get lucid you need to have some crafting materials and most of them only drop in the dungeons mentioned above, and there's one or two that can't be traded, so you have to get yourself. Maybe you can skip fulminate or even wroth if you have someone to carry you to schisma, but the progress to lucid is really long and expensive, and only using idoneal you wouldn't be able to find a party to endgame dungeons."
TeraOnline,3d5l37,dar911,3,Mon Jul 13 21:04:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair you don't have to do a single dungeon for lucid:  Infernal Metals can be purchased via broker.  Infernal Orbs are obtainable via Infernal Orb Containment Device.  Yana's Dice are obtainable via Infernal Orb Containment Device and Yana's Dice Box.  Seconds of Timescape are obtainable via Yana's Time Box.  And all these boxes and chests are purchasable via the broker.  So yeah, if one has like 5mil gold and is too lazy to run any dungeons, one can simply buy everything and +15 with that amount of cash."

Wroth is ambit 2, shisma is disco 2, and lucid is generation 2. ie, the newest incarnation of these tiers. An expanded loot guide, which is mainly for players who geared before patch like me, is idoneal<ambit<fulminate<wroth<disco<shisma<generations<lucid.

I do want to add to those that are saying skip wroth though- it's absolutely possible (and I would recommend it, especially if you're not wealthy in-game). Just like skipping Ambit in the previous patch was very possible, so is skipping wroth.   Unpopular opinion and I don't doubt I'll get a few downvotes for it, but it was very possible for a group in full idoneal to run BRHM. Knowing when to pop your powerful CDs and understanding boss mechanics and patterns (which certainly comes with experience) is tantamount to an average/mildly experienced player in disco+12 during the run. Of course, someone with similar experience and skill in higher level gear will absolutely outperform someone in Idoneal, but a group that know what they're doing can clear dungeons with little difficulty. Keep this in mind, especially if you have a group of active friends, as it can save you a shitton of gold and resources courtesy of skipping sets."

If not, PM me and I'll give you my skype.   Default items can either not be enchanted (will not say enchantable) Can be enchanted, but not masterworkable (Will not say masterworkable) which means they can go to +9.   Masterworking is the process of taking master work scrolls either from loot boxes, dungeons, or the auction house, and applying them to masterworkable gear and then using identification scrolls which cost 56 gold each.   It is a 3% chance per scroll to masterwork. Masterworking allows you to +12 a weapon, and get three extra stat rolls on the weapon - giving you waaaay more power than a +9.  You'll need to do Sabex Armory and ... that one other dungeon, sorry forgetting the name - for glyphs for your skills. Those are three man dungeons, not five man, so if you're rolling a full party you'll need to split up and either take turns, or queue.   This is a very basic overview, so again, if you'd like a more in depth explanation either add me in game if you're on ascension valley, or pm me for my skype. :)  Edit: Soleria's post is a great read if you haven't seen it already."

TeraOnline,3d5l37,Madhardcore,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:18:46 2015 UTC,"Here's a good source of information on gear: http://teratoday.com/content/tera-guide/tera-general-guide/tera-fate-of-arun-enchanting-guide-nan0teck. Some of it is a bit outdated for the new jewelry and weapons, but everything else is accurate. You can find information about those here. There's a lot of resources already out there on optimal stats for every piece of gear, so you can find that out easily.  A 5 man premade will do you fine, although you might have to pick up a few extra members for the 10 man dungeons. Regarding the LFG, you use instance matching to queue for Akeron's Inferno Normal Mode via the Vanguard menu (it will appear when you press H at level 60+). Completing the instance will give you boxes that will award you with two Wroth (the low tier enchantable gear) boxes and two Schisma weapon (the mid tier enchantable gear) boxes. These boxes will either give you a random piece of gear (for any class) or 30 gold worth of gems.  Like Soleria said, getting from 60-65 is really simple: just do the story quest and do Sabex Armory and Macellarius Catacombs at their respective levels (61 and 64) and you should easily get to level 65.  For level 65 dungeons, you want to progress from Idoneal > Fulminate (from Bathysmal Rise normal mode) > Wroth (Akeron's Inferno normal mode) > Schisma (Akeron's Inferno hard mode) > Lucid (best in slot gear which is crafted). Do Shattered Fleet and Vault of Kaprima for jewelry. Once your group gets Wroth, you can learn Timescape and do that for upgraded jewelry. The final end game content is going to be hard mode of Timescape. All of these dungeons drop Cosmoshards, which are tokens which you can use to get Wroth and Deviate gear (low tier PvE and PvP gear) and jewelry.  I'm not too sure about PvP gear progression, so someone else can elaborate on that. All I know is that you do battlegrounds and farm up Bellicarium and Killing Spree credits and get materials from battleground boxes like Sea Chests for Tensus (BiS)."

Everything about elite makes it worth that much; you'll earn it back in no time with the elite bonuses.  Wroth is nothing but fodder, just keep matching AINM until you get your schisma weapon, and then enchant that. It's seriously not worth the cost of enchanting wroth. You can get better rolls from wroth, but everything about it is a huge investment for marginal benefit.   I did queue, but it would take forever to get schisma since the box in the end could be anything else but ur class + u could get unlucky and get an amethyst from it.   How are you even doing AINM without queuing? Every single group in lfg recruits to nine or fewer, then matches so everyone gets the instant match rewards. That's the heart of what makes AINM worth doing. Get elite, and have your lfg group queue up (you'll get a match in a few minutes if you're bringing a group, especially if you have a healer or two and/or a tank); you can enter twice with elite, plus you get an elite instance reset scroll every day meaning you can do it two more times on top of that, then you can do a normal instance reset scroll too for another two shots, leaving you with 12 schisma boxes and 12 wroth boxes a day (elite also doubles the instant match rewards you get each time), if you feel like going through the trouble of getting a group together six times, that is."

Then, at 60 powerleveling works again, so back to spring valley. You can get 65 in like 4 hours of being powerleveled or 2 hours if you're a zerk and can do it yourself."

TeraOnline,3d8kff,TehKisarae,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:17:40 2015 UTC,"Well you are in for a field trip with this patch rolling up today (or you have it already if you play NA), since Burst of Celerity is made available for players lvl 18 and above. This can be glyphed for a total of +70% attackspeed and will be your most used buff alongside with overchannel. Sorc is a ""hard"" class to play (even though it is only given 2 stars in the character creation screen) and requires alot of patience to get good at. But with the buffs we got this patch you will do much better at lower levels too i thinks. I can't give you a guide for 100% wins or anything, but I'll try to give some general tips:    -Learn what each classes most damaging skills are, what they look like and what limitations they have in terms of range and positioning, and learn to avoid these at all costs. Sorc has trouble with getting damaged early on in a fight since our means of recovery are limited. Getting hit by say 2 full charged Thunderstrikes from a zerker usually totals into a death. Hell sometimes i feel like if the other guy even scratches me im toast!    -Learn your own skills, what range they operate in, how they need to be aimed, what combos are worth doing. Bread and butter combo is usually along the lines of a root - sleep - burst - repeat but with more nyances when you open up more glyph options. Read and think about your glyphs (ice needle increasing mindblast cast speed hmm hmm, maybe combo it with the mindblast cast speed glyph and burst of celerity OHSHITINSTANT SLEEP kinda thing).    Good luck!½    PS also playing an elin sorc pepew"

I played WOW on a private server, Cataclysm edition, my bar was full of skills and a side bar full of skills and I wasn't using all the because I would forget that I have that specific skill and forget what they do. I really like Tera, Sorc is my 1st char and I'm loving it and I realy want to get used to a bar full of skills. And glyphs, oh boy, how am I going to remember that: using this increase this to this and this will deal with this to cast this and BAM.

TeraOnline,3d8kff,TehKisarae,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:22:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I 100% get you! :D But yeah today is the patchday for us then, learn burst of celerity asap (dont know what lvl the glyph is available) and mix it in. 2 skills you can toss imo are the basic attack and painful trap, those 2 never were worth the time casting at all. Fire pillar is getting some buffage, it has potential now that the animation lock is being removed so im 50/50 with it. In the end even though sorc has many skills, they are usually grouped up into certain combos, like burst of celerity - nova - overchannel - fireblast, and everything else being casted between this ""main"" cooldown block. Basically you want to cast as much as u can in a burst duration and use mana spihon/recovery and other skills in between. In pvp you chase that CC combo and then do a burst when its safe since you are so squishy.     EDIT Try to make the class simple for yourself, its easy to get lost with all the information available and getting used to the combat and positioning at the same time makes it very confusing. Ask yourself questions like ""what are my damage options"" ""can i use a CC on x boss ability y"" ""is it safe to recover mana right now or should i move"" etc and in time you start doing these things without thinking, repostioning for burst then kiting while getting mana, ccing and positioning into another burst etc."

Also it feels to me that doing shorter bursts with good uptime on the bosses ass is more worth it than spamming away with lesser uptime, and the tele/step/retreat and warp barrier make it very easy too.

You can (and probably should) glyph it to last for 2 seconds.     Flame pillar delay, before this patch there was a short moment where you couldnt move or cast after using this skill because of the spell animation, but now its cut short and the delay is almost nonexistant."

On our way back we encountered a lone sorc.  The name looked familiar but what really confirmed he was the same sorc was due to the fact that he still had his top hat on. We popped our decs and gave chase. We both made a couple tactical errors that would have made the difference between killing him and him making it to the safe zone with a sliver of health.

TeraOnline,3d7d40,rocketbears,2,Tue Jul 14 03:37:44 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel the same, i KNOW that lancer is seriously strong, i know though that i would have to put more work into using it right with all the different skating, barrage to stagger vs the barrage cancel for fast dps stuff.  So, for my 20dailys to cap it it felt dull, are u sure that it keeps the way if there is variance in combos that require skill added?  I´d really need a really op lancer to state, berserker will get a lot of what lancer has with addiotional stun combo and no-cd (even no mana Q_o) block.  @XioKenji: i get your kappa and i get your serious part, i agree on it 100%. Reaper is easy but as much as reaper is easy and lancer is dull skill could add a lot to both.  @Achicken: Tbh for solo PVE the reaper is a lot better since it can burst without having to manage mana all the time. PVP gear will sadly not help me with pve anymore so it doesn´t matter i could always play berserker pve or reaper or tank lancer to carry bad groups.  @TorrentRage: So which one and why?:D I noticed how ping made both stronger moving na to eu but which one?:D"

TeraOnline,3d7d40,ebonystallion,2,Tue Jul 14 14:42:31 2015 UTC,"My opinion out of the choice would be reaper. They have huge mobility, lots of invincibility frames, and crazy damage. They wreck holding corsair ladders and can cover so much distance which makes them so hard to lock down. So in other words, if you're a free spirit and want to bounce off walls but still go in for the big hitting fatal attacks, reaper.  I'm personally a zerker.i do enjoy it. Charging skills makes it satisfying to lay a thunder strike down on an enemy. However, they get gimped for the exact reasons I talked about liking reaper for. Higher mobility classes will slip right past you before you get much of a chance to do anything. I try to land my skills onto reapers but they always shadowstep away."
TeraOnline,3d7d40,AChickenTender,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:38:56 2015 UTC,I have to second the zerker notion.  It's a nice cross-class that can farm dailies quick and also get parties if lancer is boring you.
TeraOnline,3d7d40,EwynaBG,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:33:20 2015 UTC,"I main berzerker in pvp but i would suggest if u want to put time in learning a class in pvp and master it , you should do that on Lancer srsly its the strongest of all have strong carry potential in 3s and there is lack of good lancers :)"

I think that xcept giga zerk can have the same potential now that we get unlimited block and another gap closer, did u experience differently?"
TeraOnline,3d7d40,jhaggz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:16:24 2015 UTC,"Depends, are you doing large scale PvP such as GvG's and CS or small scale PvP such as Grid, Champ Ring and Due  In all of those categories Reaper and Lancer excell. lancer is probably the best pvp class in the game due to the sheer amount of distruptivness they can cause. Reaper is the best at locking down single opponents and killing them fast. Zerker is just awful at large scale PvP. If duels are your thing than zerker is where its at. A zerker can successfully stagger/stun lock an opponent if your master the class.  Whoever said reaper is easy to play in pvp is probably garbage and a spacebar warrior. You need to time your skills perfectly and you can lock down an opponent till they are dead"
TeraOnline,3d7d40,bipbopbloop,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:05:46 2015 UTC,"OKay u nailed my thoughts, didnt mention it to not make others simply agree though.  I notice how strong zerk is, even more so with the buffs and more stagger and stun combo. But don´t u think that reaper and lancer are equally strong unless they meat like an op skill sorc?  I saw the skyring finals on na, made me try reaper and it grew onto me. i enjoy the shitty comments about spacebar class because most of the time im getting whispers laughing about the noobs from skilled people that notice the difference even though i am a very beginner at reaper with 2combos up my sleeve. Man i love cable in, jump to the back,  kill it while its staggered and shadowstep out to kill any like 70%or lower enemy and that is just me using the most simple possible combo.  I enjoy zerk too but in like cs or new bg i do not see it being as awesomely strong as the updates made it look like, can u disagree, got experience with new zerk?  it is about 30more minutes and i can try it with decent ping, maybe i will make my zerk my pve femal doggie...:((  Lancer feels so totally strong and smae as reaper i did not put any training into it, i am not good at killing stuf fbut that is basicly because on my lacner i am trying to practise going around and hitting the back but sometimes miss the combo, i got by far the best solo winrate on it.  I guess that i could abuse my good ping more on lancer than on reaper? do u know of any very good lancer eu that would be willing to showcase a real lancer or a decent guide?"
TeraOnline,3d7d40,XioKenji,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:30:54 2015 UTC,"your ping will lead you to become a better reaper, the timing on reaper skills is so essential. A good reaper will destroy a good sorc and whoever disagrees doesnt pvp often. Sorcs are 1 trick ponys right now, there combo invovles putting you to sleep. A reaper has 3 i frames and a ton of movement skills. Again it all comes down to skill and what you will be playing more. We are getting nexus again which is another large scale pvp event. Zerkers are cool but they lack in most end game pvp modes. Also this game isnt all about PvP because the main source of income in this game is PvE so it comes down to if you want to be a Tank or a Dps."

I am gathering proof etc. before I make a big post. The main problems of the other two aren't even an issue with zerk for one;  Mana does not need management. You can block forever.  Once I have all the proof, I will post it. People are radically underestimating zerk tank.  Infurate is not a big deal either. It would actually be OP on zerk tank, for the infinite block. Enrage -> hold block for 99% of attacks with no RE drain. It would make dungeons a complete joke.  They also have MORE aggro gaining skills than bother other tanks, but must be glyphed."

Infuriate gives current highest aggro +1, so you must immediately follow it with high aggro producing skills as literally the next white auto attack from a DPS will pull aggro.  Not only that, but now DPS are benefiting from Enrage damage weapon rolls and crystals. You need to be putting in double time on the aggro generation, not holding block."
TeraOnline,3d78ft,GunslingerAZ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"Zerk has two skills with 100% aggro glyphs. This is on top of the constant minor aggro aura, fiery as a shout, etc.  Warrior has this only on his shout with a 100% and 20% on torrent, for comparison. Those are pretty much 99.9% of the moves I do on warrior for aggro, and it holds.  I meant the infuriate in how easy it would be for zerk to manage, with aggro of course. On my lancer or warrior, it is a constant battle to have enough RE to block (much more so on warrior), enough mana to keep repeating aggro chains, etc.  Zerk has none of that. Mana is non-issue, block non-issue, throw one of two moves with 100% aggro. The one, even has a 5sec cooldown, and it procs of block ffs! Just block, hit counter, etc. Throw a shout and the other 100% out if some DPS is going really Ham, but overall it's 10000000x better imo as a tank player.  EDIT* You can also glyph counter for cooldown, to hit a 100% aggro gain move every 3-4 seconds... that procs off block...which you can do infinitely... no mana cost on evasive roll... on and on."
TeraOnline,3d78ft,gr00grams,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:32:58 2015 UTC,"Never have had a problem with RE on lancer. It always seems so odd when people mention RE at all, or the ""OPness"" of zerk block now, it has never been relevant to me. If you're running out of RE you're turtling too much and probably have very poor aggro generation.  I once ran out of RE on lancer after doing a full pull of all jellies and starfish in BRHM and dps couldn't kill them off fast enough.  On zerk tank I run a crit build with minimal aggro pieces (rings, brooch, 2x threatening niveot). Fiery rage is only a ranged aggro generator alongside tackle. Aggro comes from 500-700k crits on raze/flatten/counter/punishing or ~1.5m crits from TS. With this kind of setup and play style infinite block means nothing.  Schisma gear except chest and I'm easily tanking TSNM/AIHM against +15 gen dps.  Only using shout and torrent to generate aggro? Why even bother playing a warrior tank? You should be spamming blade draw and ROB whenever possible, that's where the massive aggro and extra dps comes from on a warrior. Just because a skill has 100% increased aggro gen doesn't mean that it's your highest aggro producing skill. It sounds like you're ignoring the damage factor..."
TeraOnline,3d78ft,GunslingerAZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:52:23 2015 UTC,"I don't have serious RE 'problems' with my others, but that doesn't mean no RE at all isn't better, etc. It means, there is no concern. It doesn't need to be looked at so deeply. That said, lancer has a much easier time with RE management than warrior.   It's simple. No RE > RE. Aggro skills on useful skills, etc, not 'smoke clone' and similar. Infinite block never means nothing, its just a tool to use when you need, should you need. That doesn't mean, just because you don't use it, that it's not superior.  The rest you cite is mostly out of context etc. I don't just use torrent/shout, just those are really all you can mod for aggro.  I definitely do not ignore the damage factor, and this is actually one area I believe zerk again really excels, he deals incredible damage for being in tank role, which you make a point of. Warrior and lancer aren't hitting those kinds of numbers because they don't have one-off skills like such that you can bust out often in tank role. I actually really dislike the blade draw change as a proc off block. I would have preferred torrent, RoB, anything with a damage reduction really.   EDIT* If I had to rank them, I would go zerk/lancer as equal footing, depending how you look at it, and what you as a tank player value. Warrior is a distant second to both.  Cheers,"

TeraOnline,3d78ft,metatime09,0,Tue Jul 14 02:40:17 2015 UTC,"No, zerk tank is quite underwhelming considering you offer almost nothing to the table compared to a warrior/lancer.  Zerks don't have infuriate, so kills take much longer. They also have no reliable CC at all other than one 20 second cooldown stun which also makes the boss face your dpses which screws over their back crits. You also don't have a leash or endurance debuff.  It's just not as good as other tanks at all."
TeraOnline,3d78ft,Titandino,2,Tue Jul 14 14:02:59 2015 UTC,"Staggering strike does not turn targets around in tank stance, and also, one of the tank stance only spells (punishing strike) is a 3% endurance debuff, stacking twice."
TeraOnline,3d78ft,magocchi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:28:05 2015 UTC,"Bosses are enraged almost all the time with some exceptions. Infuriate is still strong, but not mandatory in a lot of instances.  All bosses are immune to cc except for some instances. In those instances any stun is sufficient. An example would be stunning the bird in rg to prevent the buff from going off.   Also zerker tanks stun does not rotate the mob. A zerker DPS will spin the mob, but not tank.   As mentioned above, cc does not work on bosses. This includes a leash. Again this is only useful in some situations. Warrior leash to prevent the first boss of SCE from charging comes to mind.  Zerkers do have an endurance debuff. From the top of my head I believe it's 3% and stacks twice. So 6% endurance debuff in total and is applied when you use punishing strike."

I have a hard time believing you tank endgame dungeons with those. That's point number one.  Number two, especially in end game dungeons you don't want the boss moving around. So while you could potentially make use of back crystals as a tank holding aggro, you'd have to constantly turn the boss around. No party wants that.   Sure you can tank lower level dungeons just fine. But I'm not a fan of suggesting that to other people."

I'd say grab Wroth gear(Chest and Gloves) but keep on striving for a Schisma weapon , mainly because AIHM kinda hurts and most LFG parties only accept nicely geared people(Disco +12 , Wroth+12 and VM4)"

TeraOnline,3d7f2h,8ozbottle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:39:18 2015 UTC,"I think having the Iretock earrings and neck plus the Edgetock rings work better? The earrings provide max HP which is nice when a lot of things seem to do flat damage as of late...  And I think the rings give more crit factor? Need to double check but yeah. Personal plan is to get that sort of set for myself.  Side note though, the new jewelery really sucks when re-rolling so just be aware of that. Soo many bad (?) options to go through before you get that ideal combination of stats so you may want to stock up on semis or if you have full Forestrill then to take it slow so you don't blow everything on one piece. ;___;"

TeraOnline,3d7f2h,TheZanno,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:29:21 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm going for ire necklace and rings, then getting force earrings for the extra power. Imo power helps you tank much better than the +%hp rolls on ire earrings, losing the 4 and 5 piece bonus is also fine. You get 3 and 4 power base respectively on forcetic and forcetock earrings before rerollable lines and 8 power from the 2 piece bonus is huge.   The extra damage will help you tank better than 6% more aggro. Also, crit is nice and all but you get reduction of crits because you're tanking and hitting the boss from the front, so I think going edge earrings wouldn't be that great."
TeraOnline,3d7f2h,Spiffymooge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"if you wanna go full aggro the best thing will be forest trill band (red) + forest trill earring (red) + forestsong neck (aggro roll on neck + ring) as a 3 set and a 2 set of iretock (new aggro ring, the sparkly one) + earring :)"

TeraOnline,3d6xyg,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:41:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know, getting gear on EU is hard, so many elitists make it hard to use LFG, and instance matching means you don't stand a chance.  I was trying to get full +12 Disco before this patch arrived, so I could jump straight into Disco 2.0, I spent 2 weeks trying to use LFG (including hosting my own) and IM and got into 2 runs of SCNM (Both of which I was the highest geared person in). Suffice to say they both went awfully."
TeraOnline,3d6xyg,Blue_Executioner,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:45:50 2015 UTC,"Well you must not be in a decent guild then. Most guilds will take new members to SC/BRHM as long as the new member at least has ambit +12 and plays his class decently.  SCNM is quite doable in ambit +12 (weap/gloves) as long as all the players are using the correct crystals and consumables and know decently well how to play their class. So while making LFGs make sure that everyone is using the correct crystals, make sure that all use the mob crystal in room 1.  Much in this game depends on people you know, if you run something with some equally geared good players, befriend them and gradually you should know enough people to form parties through you friend-list.   In any case, NA is just as elitist, they even have +15 LFGs, its just human tendency. This patch the gear drops from the 10 man raid too which is ridiculously easy, so gearing should not be a problem."

I am not going to get a Schisma weapon for my Mystic, since it has a completely useless non-rollable line for % damage and there isn't a way to get double attack speed and CDR like Quick Disco/Gen.  I am getting a Deviate weapon(since it is very close to Quick Disco - more attack speed, less heal %) until I can finish crafting Quick Gen.  Edit: Forgot I was going to answer your original question also, for armor reduce flat damage, reduce frontal damage, reduce enraged damage are good.

TeraOnline,3d4ecl,NanakoC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"You (or at least Minea) already gave the reason for SCHM being part of crusades:   ""As for the new instances not being included, the focus was to provide additional motivation to play the instance dungeons that are not the newest or give the newest items""   The challenger league, and the crusades system in general, was implemented as a way for guilds to compete with each other in endgame content. While, sure, SCHM is ""outdated and almost irrelevant"" in terms of drops/vanguard/etc., it is still as much of a challenge now as it was when it was introduced (gear notwithstanding). By that logic, it is perfectly reasonable that SCHM is still part of crusades.   EME (BHS, really) took the opportunity to use crusades as an incentive to run dungeons that don't give the best/newest gear. The new rewards for placing in crusades is not merely a coincidence. However, nobody is forcing you to run BRHM/SCHM if you don't want to; if you feel like the reward isn't worth the effort, by all means skip it. I mean, some people might not want SES, MWA, noctenium, a skycastle and a border around their guild icon. I don't judge.   WHY would we want to grind BRH and SCN again   You only need to run it once to be placed on the leaderboards. Assuming you have the ability to clear said dungeons, it should take you but a few hours to place well in every single crusades category. Compared to farming hundreds of mats/thousands of credits, this is far from a grind."

TeraOnline,3d4ecl,Sirocco_,2,Tue Jul 14 07:47:39 2015 UTC,"They are right but there is a catch;  Gunner is absolutely the easiest/mindless class.  However, the fastest way to level is as others have said, queue dungeons.  Gunner is a DPS class. Your dungeon queue for leveling will be terrible, like all DPS.  If you really want to level the fastest, roll a healer or tank. Why? Queue is near instant. You can run dungeons back to back without waiting more than 5 minutes to start the next.  On a dps class, you're going to be waiting 15+ minutes per dungeon, gets higher n' higher as you level too. For the dungeons near 60, I've waited 40+ minutes as dps before.  The fastest absolute way to level is play a healer, then/or tank, and actually spam queue like everyone says to do.  You absolutely will not 'spam' them as a dps because of the wait times.  The alternative, is to solo them. Gunner can do this fairly easy, as it's pretty silly op class.  Cheers,"

I wanna try the new stance on EVERYTHING plus I'm sure zerks will be amazing now that they hav3 a charge, a ranged axe and a whole stance that is designed for the KD based gameplay (as opposed to the oneshot combo) .  Still. Slayer, who I dearly love and I know well, but is old to me and apparently sub-par in PvP (which is my thing)? or zerker who got tons of stuff and I also like, but they aren't slayers and I also have 150 ping which would be bad for a zerk while almost the same for a slayer?

They are able to and rely on executing very long stagger chains where timing is veeeery tight. A 0 CD block in general is hard to play with 150+ ping.   Oh, and I don't think people really use axe counter in PvP. There's no reason to not just go for a staggering strike or a KD when you have an opening."
TeraOnline,3d4ecl,Kaoryn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"It's exhausting for me since I have to actually go through it... It sucks.  Anyway. I don't really care about infinite stagger chains. I don't like Zerk for the stagger locks, I like being a behemoth that knocks everything down and dishes out the nukes. A couple of staggers into my combo will suffice. If that's doable with 150 ping, I don't mind missing the stagger locks.  And we'll obviously a full thunderstrike combo is better than a counter but, like the slayers yolo fully glyphed fury strike combo, it can be fun. Turtle under your block, smack them with a nuke, kd them, block again. :3  But of course if 150-160 ping ruins zerker in general apart from the mistimed staggerlocks, in PvP, my only option is the slayer. Which again idk if its bad or okay since some people say it's utter garbage now (and I can see why) ans others say slayers are fine (and down vote to hell anyone who disagrees) ."
TeraOnline,3d4ecl,N0rthWind,3,Tue Jul 14 12:03:10 2015 UTC,"Why does it matter if the class is sub par or not? Slayer by the populace eyes were on the lowest tier of dps on pve/pvp until lvl 65 patch hit with evis making the class fotm.

And zerks have never been really weak. High skill cap, yes, but never unrewarding.  Zerks now are really mobile and can dish out infinite CC if retaliate is used, whereas slayers struggle to get to any gunner or sorcerer in 1v1 because they do more damage than us and have 3-4 independent escapes each. Reapers too.   So, while slayer is 100% my style, and zerk is only 80% plus a bit hindered by my ~160 ping in PvP, I think I'm going to take a break from slayer just until the situation balances out a bit. Just to understand where we stand and see if they intend to keep ruining the balance (go with Zerk who at least consistently gets stuff) or if they realize it can't go on like this, and at last start making meaningful changes and good balancing (keep slayer) ."

TeraOnline,3d4ecl,warriorgriffinheart,3,Tue Jul 14 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"Did you see this guide on TeraToday?  It's a little messy, but the info is there. If you'd rather, I'll just give you the quick & dirty that should help.  The first boss is just like Kaianus in Bamarama. Almost every attack will apply a bleed effect that your healers will need to cleanse. You shouldn't get hit often at archer range. Main one you need to watch out for is when he runs one way and then does a huge pounce the opposite direction.  Second boss is like Hakan in Bamarama. As an archer, you might get assigned to mobs because of your AOE damage. If so, just run over to the giant sword in the ground on the opposite side of the entrance, and AOE down the mobs. If your raid wants you on the boss instead, make sure you stay on that half of the room. Attack pattern is predictable. If you get targeted by his ranged jump, just be ready to iframe it with backstep. And watch out for the flame breath, it staggers and will quickly kill you.  Third boss is like Terkasia (Twerkasia) in Bamarama, but a little different. Archer range you should be pretty good. Don't get too close when she spins upside-down, because she's about to do an aoe attack around her. Avoid all the orange circles on the floor. Very easy fight for archer.  Last boss is the only tricky one. Similar to Kezzel from Kezzel's Gorge if you were around for that. As an archer, if you are the furthest away you are likely to get targeted by his ranged attacks - whip and shotgun. Be ready to iframe them. Kill the ads as soon as they spawn - if they get on their vent they'll have a purple ring around them and be a lot more tanky and difficult to kill. When he says ""Burn for me!"" you have to run to a vent that doesn't have a mob on it. In NM, you can have a max of 5 people on the vent. Spam your jump key and you might miss getting blown up in the air so you can start attacking again faster. The boss will occasionally have a huge dot AoE - you'll have to be inside it to do damage. Your healers will probably be more focused on healing the people right next to the boss, so you might occasionally need to either get a little closer to get some heals, or just get out of the AoE and find a healer until they notice you and can heal you. Don't get right up on the boss during this because he'll usually do a couple of foot stomps. If you can iframe it, you'll be ok. But if you're not comfortable with it, just stay back and play it safe. He'll sometimes get a shield and say he's going after someone. If it's you, just do your best to kite it. I don't know if you can use backstep or not - if you can, use it to iframe when he's going to stomp you. Enough damage and the shield will be popped and he'll stop chasing whoever.  I'm not covering literally everything, but those are the basics. Hope it helps.  tl;dr: Play it safe, backstep to iframe when needed, don't get hit."

In theses cases it's pretty much decided by the full +15 premades. As a Lancer, you are still able to contribute decently in FWC with +12 deviate (Rallying cry/Giga leash are good regardless of your gear), but prepare to get obliterated by +15 people.  As for where to begin, I think starting out with some duels is a solid way to learn your Lancer mechanics. Namely, you should aim to consistently be able to chain 2 staggers with shield barrage. Practice catching up to ranged classes, hitting your leash and whatnot.   As for indomitable cruxes, they are OK, but Lancers are inherently tanky so it's not very common. Most run either griefing or carving for accessories.   I would suggest trying to get the tensus weapon if you can.

TeraOnline,3d4p4s,Tangy4tw,2,Mon Jul 13 16:19:55 2015 UTC,If you kill the BAM in less time than the other people of the same class as you then you will rank higher.  If you rank higher than it tells me a few things:   You proc'd a lot of your crits and was able to to have optimal back crit time (stayed behind the boss 90% of the time) You were able to fluidly execute your skill rotation with minimal downtime in between (lag between successive skills) thus optimizing your dps uptime. You have high damage because of your gear and proper rolls. If you were to compare gear for gear against the top 5 DPS in ranking for vault and you all have the same gear/rolls and they still out rank you then it's all down to skill at that point.

Its quite likely there are more slayers than reapers actively playing and doing vaults, so you will get a higher ranking on the reaper more easily.  However, this is by no means a measure of how good a DPS you are, for all you know you do more damage with your slayer than your reaper even though your reaper is ranked higher.

Best decision ever.  I know they are not the OP DPS on PvE and that their actually good on PvP (even tho I'm not much into into) but man is that class fun.

What you said used to be true back when those abilities scored back crits whenever the Archer faced a mob's back, regardless of where those abilities actually hit it.  From what I understand (according to English language translations of what BHS has said), the new behavior was supposed to only affect Gunners, but affects Archers and Reapers too.  It is supposed to eventually get fixed and will go back to the old design (putting Archers consistently in melee range on a boss's butt again).

Really the better heal modifier for dropped gear barely outclasses the benefits of the avatar weapons themselves.  Just have to farm for it sadly. Consider doing vanguard initiative quests, within a certain level range the weekly bonus for competing x/# is 500 t3 alk and some gold. You'll get more exp per mob than if you were partied, but a pure dps or even a tanks' damage far outclasses your own.

Blue 4x Hardy Solo: Switch out the reds for full Pounding. Go Savage/Forceful/Bitter/Pounding if you feel you can reposition enough for back crits.

TeraOnline,3d41gi,YiliaTheMystic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:41:00 2015 UTC,"I would recommend doing them anyways, but yeah they give pretty good gold, especially as you level up.  That being said you don't really need it till 65.  I'm level 60 on my gunner and I haven't bought anything, but my gear is pretty much best in slot for my level, just from loot.  Save your gold for your skill level ups. That's what really matters.  Just do all the story quests while your in matchmaking for raids and you'll level up fast, and have plenty of gold and gear."
TeraOnline,3d41gi,grayn0de,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:35:09 2015 UTC,"Depends what goal you have for leveling, if you are going to be doing nothing but partyplay and dungeons i would reccomend going for a wep with more healing. Avatar weapons are very superior in terms of dmg but dealing dmg is not your role unless you play solo. You can sell stuff on the trade broker for gold and use that gold to buy alkahest at the merchant, you can get atleast 10-20 gold from your inventory almost no matter what is in it. As a priest you CAN run all dungeons till around level 40 solo but it will be much slower than just queing and rushing through with a team so i would say to use instance matching for it. crystals for group play is: red = 3xBrilliant, 1xSwift blue = 4xHardy green(when you get there) = 4xSuccoring or 4x Swift (grounding can work if you need endurance) for solo play you should use the same blue and green crystals but you should change the red ones to either a backcrit setup (bitter, savage, forceful, focused) or just a straight up %dmg (savage and 3x pounding) if you run dungeons you should get the gear eventually, usually if  you outlevel the ilevel needed for dungeons you should invest where your gear is worst to bring it up to an appropiate level :)   Hope i was able to help, enjoy your time on Tera :)"
TeraOnline,3d41gi,TobaccoAficionado,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:38:38 2015 UTC,"10-20 gold? I try to sell weapon and gears I pick up in BoL around 1-2g but still having a hard time selling it.  So, I can run instances til 60+ without doing the main quest?"
TeraOnline,3d41gi,Ommageden,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:53:36 2015 UTC,"Selling any non-superior gear dropped from dungeons is nigh impossible. The quickest and easiest way to get gold as a lower level character is to gather all of the resources when you see them (ores, fibers and essences). Not only does this give you materials used for crafting later on, but the rare drops (God's Tears and Scarabs) can sell for a decent amount on the broker. By simply mining Krymetal ores, I ended up with around 100 God's Tears in a single play session and sold them in stacks of 10 for 7-9g apiece or 70-90g per stack, depending on the average price for that day. Quick 900g for a couple hours of farming while grinding BAMs. Rare mats are in fairly high demand by high-level characters, as they are needed for end-game crafting, so they sell quickly. I've had God's Tears sell for more than that, as well. All supply and demand."

I honestly have NEVER used IMS and I've run every dungeon multiple times.  Try your luck searching for people while you're queued up. You may have more luck that way."

TeraOnline,3d4sum,rootless2,2,Tue Jul 14 21:25:40 2015 UTC,You don't queue for anything except for SA or MC when your 60+. The story quests grant you a ton of experience and is much faster for leveling than running old dungeons.   Finding a level 65 tank/healer for MC and SA should be no problem if you are in a guild or know a couple people. Realistically you would only need to run them maybe 3-4 times to get enough exp to fill the gap between 64 and 65.   You will still want to chain run them after you hit max level to get the glyphs.

Why are you doing Ebon tower? if you;'re at level 60, do the FoA quests along with a couple dailies and you should be at lvl 64-64.5(after running SA and MC a couple times for your glyphs)  personally, i usually watch netflix while i queue up or i gather while queueing(for the lvl 65s you have)."

TeraOnline,3d4sum,eretriawhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:57:41 2015 UTC,"As other people mentioned as well, these lower level instances are not ran that often because you outlevel them very quickly. There's likely a lot more people at 65 than in the 50-64 range.   It takes a little longer to get matched as a DPS but if you're not 65 then there's plenty of other things to do that give more than reasonable XP i.e mainline quests, and at 65 if you're a competent +12/15 DPS then finding parties wont be a problem either."
TeraOnline,3d3ts0,goetha,3,Mon Jul 13 08:24:07 2015 UTC,"Gene is worth it ONLY if you +14 it; even for tanking, +14/15 is quite good as you do more damage = more aggro.  But tbh you should not lose aggro even with Disco, I think you are either missing aggo accessories or need to work on your tanking rotation; get disco defense gloves and +12 them with an aggro roll, those help quite a bit.  I do not recommend crafting gene to anyone now as lucid is quite cheap on NA, and since all Lucid mats drop in GG for EU, its likely to be cheap for us too; so might as well get Lucid which can have a 9% ASPD roll instead of 4.5% and has better base stats.   Lucid with a 9% attack speed roll + CDR is a great weapon for both tanking and DPS war and you dont need to bother +15ing 2 pieces of gear, trust me +15 is a pain and can cost more than a million gold."
TeraOnline,3d3ts0,ZonerRoamer,5,Mon Jul 13 08:31:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think Lucid is cheap for NA. Infernal Orbs and Yana's Dice need to be farmed since they are untradable. With Orbs, you need to be lucky against 9 other people and the Dice are hard to get unless you're running TSHM. Not to mention Lucid needs T7 to upgrade and awaken, which goes for around 22g per feedstock on MT. Inferno Ore is about 130g ea, making the metal nearly 400g a pop, and you need 100 of them for weapon. Seconds of Time are also a bit pricey.   Not sure on the EU side however.   Edit: Added why they weren't cheap."
TeraOnline,3d3ts0,TheMantello,2,Mon Jul 13 12:58:45 2015 UTC,"Lol thats very cheap going by VM4 standards; I personally bought 100 scales @ 2.5k gold each, 100 plumes @ 700g each; which makes it 320k for those 2 mats alone, now add +10k for the torches +80k for timeworn and VM4 on my war cost me around 400K  Untradable items are not a problem for me since I run only with statics/guildies and almost 80% of the guild is not planning to get vm5.  In EU feedstock is cheap, its the MWA thats expensive, since the MWA for tier 7 is the same, the cost of awakening/enchanting lucid is the same as gene.  TBH I shall more or less have all the tradable mats for both my war and my gunner on day 1 if those are the prices in EU :D"
TeraOnline,3d3ts0,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"But VM4 is now stupid cheap compared to before    1-2G per Plume - 250G-500G for 250 (Entire Set) 150-300G Scale - 37.5k-75k for 250 (Entire Set)  Timeworn 1-7k - Bought Weapon for 5k Torches 300G - 12k For 40 (Entire Set, or craft your own)   Scales are still the problem but do-able since BR is easier now.

PvE in this game makes 0 use of it's amazing combat system, all the monsters are huge and easy to hit, so really the only place to use it is PvP which there just isn't a big focus on. You have a bunch of equalized battlegrounds, most of which suck, then you have Fraywind Canyon (Idr if it was made equalized or not) 3v3 premade (who the fuck has 2 friends with decent gear though? One of which is a healer) Alliance Conflict (one side always wins, nobody wants to split up and make it balanced, we all just enjoy the winning sides weekly gold for free) and then duels outside Velika / ganking people who are busy with other shit.

The combat system itself is pure gold, but the UI is shit, every class has several abilities that either scale too poorly to be useful at endgame, are horrendously undertuned to start with, or simply serve no purpose due to their mechanics, mobs behave in ways that aren't conducive to a rewarding player experience (BAM walks through you at point blank range? Instant KD, and it worked pretty well so better do it again three seconds later), ping can render some classes totally unplayable, more half the items you pick up while leveling are entirely useless and do nothing but waste bank space, story quests are stupidly boring, etc, and TERA's leveling is fast enough that a single tester could identify most of these problems in just a few hours' time.  People give WoW shit, but it maintains its popularity precisely because it doesn't suffer from these sorts of design oversights.

The Second time was free-to-play release, a friend of mine asked me to play with him and some other friends, so we leveled new characters on my current server and played for about 6 months. GvG and Nexus kept me in this time around, having an alliance that kept people out of Granarkus and claiming all of the nexus zones in it was very fun for me, also queue'd for Fraywind Canyon with friends very often. I quit the second time around as I was just starting college and didn't think I'd have time to lead a guild and study, and not leading a guild wasn't very appealing for me at the time.  This time around, an old friend from my server told me a bunch of us were playing again after the Steam release, so I came back and tried end-game PvE for a first time, I didn't realize that the PvE in this game felt so rewarding. I don't really know why but it does, I remember doing Queen a few times but not necessarily grinding it. I'm still playing as I currently have time to, but we'll see what comes up in the future.  Overall all three times I've played Tera I haven't not had fun. I think as long as there are people to play with I'll keep coming back. The combat style is so refreshing as I used to play WoW as well and it just got boring as I was able to just press my hotkeys pretty mindlessly during end-game content while avoiding fire as long as I was tabbed to the boss or adds that I was supposed to be killing."

I understand that, but it is what it is.  Here's a great example;  Sabex Armory. Fresh 65 hits this, and the asshat veteran guy proceeds to round up all the mobs.  There's nothing wrong with that, but the new guy doesn't know that's what ppl do.  Gets wasted, that guy yells at him.  Can't even tell you how many times I've seen that. Like a billion. That's just one example, compared to the odd window-licker in pug queue, the vets far, far, outweigh the others for being dicks.  Deny it all you want, but it's pretty much fact. This game is known for two things;   T n' A. Elitist endgame.     EDIT Also, my 'steam mentality' is almost 40 years old. Please don't be so biased or ridiculous with stereotypes. It's the largest platform on PC, by an overwhelming number. I'm pretty sure the 'steam' crew saved this game in NA for the moment, population wise."

You'd be astounded at how many newbs flat out refuse to read guides even if I politely ask them to (""I'll just wing it"", then proceeds to be worse than useless the rest of the fight).  Sure, there are elitist assholes, but don't pretend new people aren't assholes as well for wasting everyone's time (as well as reducing their enjoyment)."
TeraOnline,3d0rg4,Purple_Engram,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed somewhat, but a lot of this game is 'veteran preference'.  Again, same example; Sabex does not require you to herd up all the mobs to beat it.  However, every single veteran player will get pissed at the tank if he doesn't. They will get even madder should they be the ones to round up the mobs, and he doesn't know how to deal with it, and dies causing more problems.   They have absolutely ZERO reason to rage at the player in this case, but it happens like every other run.   Sky Garden, another 'noob trap', can be beaten by taking out the mobs everyone skips. It's really not too hard, but god forbid some new guy aggro one of the two mobs, everyone will lose their shit. I've seen examples like this so many times I've lost count.  It's not the wiping. Really, I've been in very few groups that actually wipe, and I will agree totally there, it's wise to lookup stuff like raids etc.  The other fault I will give is on the game devs, there is a LOT of stuff that could use better information, or when/how it's shown to players.  Like, one we are experiencing now, is again, Sabex and MC, with the lower level caps, players who do not get the gear for 60 before cruiser, are getting obliterated. In their defense, the game does not tell them anywhere that they need that gear for it. They definitely should not have been made 60/63 to queue."

While doing these, pop your 3 daily Elinu's Tears. When you're done, go spend all your PP on gathering. Then buy 3 GG scrolls for your Vanguard rep and do them. Spend all your Mark of Valor on MWA (unless you need a CCB; prioritize that). Throw in a daily CS win if you don't mind PvP. By the end, you should have enough stuff to sell to make at least 15k a day.  (This is all assuming you don't need/want to hoard all the stuff you get, of course.)"

For example some costume boxes are cheaper than the costumes they give. People can't judge how valuable their bills are too so I exploit their weakness to getting urgent gold. I even bought a jade ride recently because it looked the cheapest for what it offers (it has a very slow animation and I hate it though).

You will need Feedstock and Alkahest to enchant something. You will have probably picked some up. Open it up with 'T' key. It is ideal to always enchant your equipment/weapon to +9. At the very least, always keep your avatar weapon +9.    Is dungeon grinding a viable way to level ?   Yes, dungeon grinding is completely viable. People say it is better than regular questing.

TeraOnline,3d10dn,EchoTruth,4,Sun Jul 12 16:57:18 2015 UTC,I think it works more as a balancing function to the BG.  If one team has grouped up it can be very very hard to break up that group once they've wiped yours.  If they have 6+ people sticking together you're never going to be able to brute force them down without some exceptional luck grouping up with teammates.  Suicide bombers keep those groups from being able to run an entire BG from beginning to end.  edit: but yeah it's really annoying getting caught.  It's tough to iframe those fucks as a zerker.  double edit: invisible bombing is really funny.

You don't ever see bombers facerolling teams in CS, because it's a long walk from spawn to get a bomb, then you have a respawn timer, wide open areas that can get you spotted easily, healers will keep people alive and so on.

They are much weaker when Celerity is down, so play more aggressive when it is down. If you get time gyred, you can still move with leaping strike/distant blade/etc.   There isn't anything a Sorc can do to guarantee a sleep/stun trap, technically.

Apart from this your gloves have other 2 rerollable stats, let's say you need to use another 10 mes to get the 3 stats perfect, that's another 6k, at this moment you have use 12 k on spellbinds. I would recomendo you 2 things, first don't use pellbinds on Worth gear, roll till you have 2/3 perfect stats and the 3rd one is not complete bs. mostly 'cause you are gonna upgrade your gear in a near future, and the second one would be NEVER use spellbind to lock on a skill when it is not masterwoked, waste of gold."

There aren't that many different rolls that you can get, you'll probably see that aggro roll at least 10 times before you hit MW.  Also, I have personally decided to skip wroth and go straight to schisma from fulmi.

Saves a lot of money in the long run. Getting 3 rolls with MES isn't very bad.  Math from my top:   1224 common enigmatics for rolls (6g per reroll roughly): 7300g  If they were MES (95g each + 50g for intricate): 177,480g  Noble+Spellbind cost: 25,000g"

Noble works out to be cheaper (generally) for chest and and weapon unless you are extremely lucky using MES and get good or almost perfect rolls with a few MES.

Nothing will stop someone from coming along and heavily undercutting you though, or market manipulators tricking you into selling low so they can resell high.  You pretty much need to learn the market on that kind of thing.  Still (roughly):  (qty_mats * cost_mats + cost_kits) / (number_crafted) = cost_per_unit.  (market_sell_price - cost_per_unit) = profit_unit  profit_unit / prod_pts_unit = profit per production point.  This doesn't take into account crit rates, which vary across the board, but it gets you a reasonable idea of how to best spend your production points if you only want to craft with them.  Materials gathering is another animal entirely since most of what's worth gathering is governed by RNG and you'll probably want points left over to refine.  It also pays to look at how often stuff sells.

TeraOnline,3d0bg4,Requiris,5,Sun Jul 12 12:27:45 2015 UTC,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/wiki/lvl65faq/pvegear  All your answers are in here.
TeraOnline,3d0bg4,random4lyf,2,Sun Jul 12 13:14:27 2015 UTC,"I'll assume you have the proper crystals for your gear. After that if you're not in a guild try to join one so that it might be a little easier to farm dungeons. Ideally you'd then run these dungeons with your guild. If not then it may be hard to join the premades that are advertised on LFG due to lack of gear. Anyway, if all else fails I've actually had no issues personally doing most of the new dungeons via instance matching. I would start off running akerons inferno. Its super easy and provides wroth gear with a chance for schisma gear (fulminate -->wroth-->schisma-->lucid). With the instance matching reward boxes you also have a decent chance at a schisma  weapon. I got my schisms weapon, wroth everything else, and then +12'd it all. You can also start getting the newest tier of jewelry via vault of kaprima and shattered fleet (or with cosmoshards which you obtain for completing dungeons or via PvP). That's how I started this patch."
TeraOnline,3d0bg4,docrod,2,Sun Jul 12 13:15:56 2015 UTC,"Since you have fulminate, queue AINM. It drops wroth gear and the schisma weapon. I wouldn't bother with wroth. It's pretty much no different from fulminate and would be a complete waste of resources to enchant. Get the schism weapon and then start AIHM. That's where you'll get the schisma gear."
TeraOnline,3d0bg4,ebonystallion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:46:39 2015 UTC,"Now that you have a full set of fulminate I suggest you go run AINM either with a guild or through instance matchmaking. You'll be aiming for the wroth gear set next which drops in AINM but if you que up through im then you get what are called schisma boxes which have a chance for you to get a schisma weapon. A lot of people skip the wroth weapons because it is barely better than the fulminate one. The gear set progress like this : fulminate (idoneal 2) -> wroth (ambit 2) -> Schisma (Disco 2) -> Lucid.  As for you vanguard credits, most people just turn those on for masterwork alkahest boxes which sell pretty well at the trade broker. Since you have 1500 credits I suggest you buy some of those boxes to sell on the trade broker and some to keep so you'll have some alkahest to enchant your gear. If you also need lvl 65 crystal niveots they sell for 400 credits and will save you 1000~ gold if you rather buy them at the trade broker. As for daily farming just run some dungeons and if you need to grind the BAM dailies if you are low on vg credits."
TeraOnline,3d0bg4,AlwaysSitting,2,Sun Jul 12 13:06:23 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks! Probably look for a guild to run the instances with then!
TeraOnline,3d0bg4,AuregaX,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"You're better off Instance Matching AINM, since you get 2 shisma boxes and 2 wroth boxes from it. It's not worth doing through normal groups. You can easily skip Wroth weapon this way and a lot of wroth pieces, since you can get into AIHM with Shisma weapon alone."
TeraOnline,3d0bg4,leeep,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:48:19 2015 UTC,Is this with elite to get two of each?  I'm still confused how AINM  works... if you instance match you are awarded a Schisma box for your trouble... but if you just run it with a local group you only get the Wroth box?  Thanks.
TeraOnline,3d0bg4,AuregaX,2,Thu Jul 16 19:52:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, instance matching with elite gives you 2 shisma boxes that has a chance to contain either a schisma weapon or a 30g gem. Note that this box is not a smart box, so you can get a weapon not for your class (great for feedstock since it's 48 T7 feed). You also get 2 Wroth boxes that contains a random piece of wroth equipment. Again, this is not a smart box, so you can get pieces you can't use, but it's also great for feedstock.   This is the instance matching rewards and is in addition to any drops you get in the dungeon. Without elite, you only get 1 box of each."

Slayers are hard to glyph, everything they have costs like 5-6 points and they have a lot of good ones.  There is a few things I am unsure about since I don't actually have a max level Slayer just yet, nor the motivation to finish mine even though it's close, at any rate I think I would use these ones for 1v1 PvP http://teratoday.com/glyphcalc#sl65:h23:i4:j4:m1:o0:p02:s4:u01:v1  Most people would probably use most of the same, taking out the healing on OHS, and possibly the CDR on backstab, I'm unsure of what others do, depending on how they combo they might use eviscerates measured slice damage glyph.

TeraOnline,3cya7o,Kokumai,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:54:48 2015 UTC,"You probably shouldn't worry too much about pvp combos right now as you don't have many of the abilities necessary for it. A few things to keep in mind though when fighting is to use the first hit of your combo attack to stagger enemies out of cast animations. Some skills can't be staggered like whirlwind so you'll need to figure out what skills they're using. A few things I can recommend for lower level combos would be this    Combo attack -> step back -> fury strike -> wait half a second combo attack. This combo stagger locks them preventing from using abilities or moving around as you set up for damage combos.    Stunning backhand -> overhand strike -> startling kick -> knockdown strike -> overhand strike(if it resets) take note that this combo can be split into two separate combos starting from startling kick. For this I would recommend glyphing the bonus attack speed glyph on startling kick and bonus speed link to knock down strike. If you want to start off with a startling kick you should try to connect with a combo attack or fury strike first to both make sure you're in range for the kick and that they can't get out of it.    Fury strike -> startling kick -> overhand strike -> step back -> headlong rush into them -> whirlwind -> overhand strike if it resets this combo requires you to glyph the speedlink glyph from fury strike for this to execute in time so keep that in mind.    Against ranged targets, using db to harass and close the distance is also a good idea. Leaping strike can also be used to gap close or get out of aoes."

Warriors are half tanks and I'd rather have a greatsword than stabby stabby swords but they're doing slayers job better in PvP so yeah. :( I mean, measured slice cannot be substituted with scythe, but little scythe does 2x the damage in PvP along with better CC, mobility, speed and survivability.  I really don't know what to do. I love slayers but I'm not going to suck in PvP against any enemy that's not completely useless, just because I happened to like a class that the community will never let be actually strong. -.- But everyone downvotes and flames me. They'd say slayers are fine even if they hypothetically got all their glyphs removed. ""If you loved your class and weren't a baddie you'd play them, we dont need glyphs to succeed, slayers are still good, practice and you'll be good, I bet you sucked even with glyphs. Numbers don't matter. If you live slayer you'll play them even if you lose every PvP battle you participate in despite your efforts."" I will come back if we become good again, but I need to take a break for a while. I'm tired of being the underdog in PvP. I dealt with it before FoA but I thought that finally we would be okay and the dark days were over. Obviously the buff was an exception and not a real change. So I'm not gonna keep torturing myself while every other random person single handedly counters everything I have and then does more damage than me, and I die even when I tryhard against noobs that simply outclass me.  So, fellow slayer. Would you recommend sorcerer, Berserker, Archer or warrior? :/"
TeraOnline,3czvxw,N0rthWind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:48:24 2015 UTC,"Well here's my take:  Sorc - The only class except gunner that I have absolutely no experience with. As such I cannot tell you much more than what you already know. It's kind of the reason I was asking about it. I might give it a shot eventually.  Berserker - As someone who has mained a slayer since I started playing, zerker comes with a notable ""mentality shift"". Block instead of dodge, charge instead of chain, tanky instead of mobile... As such  I make a lot of bad calls, especially in 1v1 scenarios. Despite my general incompetence I think they do the ""seek and destroy"" thing better than slayers do atm. There is no denying that they do struggle in group pvp tho. Didn't try out the new stance in pvp yet, maybe a dash and a roll could help their lack of mobility somewhat?  Sometimes I feel like playing a zerker just because of the badass heavy armor tho XD - not the best gameplay tip however.  Warrior - I've recently started leveling a warrior and I've got to say I love this class thus far. However, this has only lowered my opinion on slayers since everything they can do a warrior can do better. Triple roll, dash, Death from Above (I luv this one so much), backstab, faster attacks, reliable 100-0 combos, throw in not one but two endurance debuffs and why would you ever bother with a slayer. Ok, that's a bit harsh. Slayer dash still has that nice animation speed up I like so much, and Tenacity is still a thing, but yeah I really feel like dps warrior is slayer++ even if they are a bit more fiddly to play as. Also, Scythe can be fired off without a combo if needed while MS isn't so lucky. Oh and warrior can tank. Just something to keep in mind.  Archer - I admit I have a love-hate thing with these guys depending on the day of the week, but I won't deny that the recent buffs helped them stand out a little. Despite having a very few movement skills (on par with priest I believe), they are rather mobile because you can charge their main moves ""on the go"" while being able to keep your distance. Rain of Arrows is an excellent AoE  and level 60 traps are a godsend if incorporated into the rotation properly. Though their standard rotation has only like, 4 skills and final salvo Don't see much point in using Thunderbolt, honestly. And they DO rely on their stun traps to get them out of shitty situations, maybe a bit too much if you ask me. Overall, I think they are good mix of efficiency and simplicity.  That said, I'm gonna roll warrior for now just to see If my suspicions are correct. As for yourself, I really can't recommend any of those 3 classes more than the other so I guess you'll just have to go with one that ""feels"" most right. I think I'd go back to the zerker if I were you, but that might just be heavy armor bias speaking. Or give sorc a shot? Who knows, maybe it ends up fitting you like a glove ;)"
TeraOnline,3czvxw,Lethal1313,2,Sun Jul 12 16:00:59 2015 UTC,"Slayer fits me like a glove, too bad they ""accidentally"" forget to bring it up to snuff. For six months (and still going).  Warrior indeed feels fiddly to play, but I might give it a shot once more since bluehole lοves them so much. Blade draw has base damage like MS. Lel   But if I wanted to tank I'd go Zerk. 3k base power axe counter :3 nice. Plus I already know how to play them and they've always been strong in PvP (and PvE).  Sorc seems a bit cheesy so idk if it's what I want. I'll just decide between war and zerk and be done with it. Zerks with a ranged kd axe, a charge, reduced CD kds and equalized ranges? Lol :3"

And has new skills for tank stance which can be good for PvP. A 3k power axe counter could be hilarious. Block something, fast 3k skill in your face, block again. I say good day sir. :3  Warriors seem cool too but I won't play slayer 2.0- I refuse to. I'll wait till slayers get buffed accordingly and return to slayers then. Till that happens, Zerk it is, or perhaps sorc. But as you said zerks are the real ""seek and destroy"" class atm instead of slayers, so I'll probably pick Zerk. They're almost as mobile as slayers now minus a backstab but they can block cancel leap strike since foa so yeah. I'm excited to try that. Not as excited as I'd be if slayers were strong in PvP but since bhs has no idea about balance, I'll roll zerk. At least they like to buff zerks."

Other than that, rotation's around the same. Overcharging by one tick is a persistent problem even if you release at the first non-damaging overcharge but I reposition a lot so it doesn't bother me too much. So there is a delay, yes. Never, at least with skills or enemy moves that have huge telegraphing, since the i-frame window does not change. I've played Dark Souls 2 for a long ass time though, so dodging is second nature to me. Very hard to i-frame properly in PvP, though Archers only have one i-frame so this might be part of the problem. Yes, at least with mass PvP like Corsairs' Stronghold. Personally, I've topped individual game leaderboards before as an Archer and rarely do particularly badly in CS. Have never really tried to play in smaller PvP environments, though according to my experience 1v1ing people in CS it's not too pretty. Granted, I'm not a very good or experienced PvP Archer player so take this with a pinch of salt.   EDIT: I've recorded a session of CS at 200-300 ping before and uploaded it here if you're curious to see how Archer plays at high ping.

TeraOnline,3cylrg,ToastedHam,2,Sun Jul 12 17:15:35 2015 UTC,"Every class requires low ping to function optimally. You're going to find people saying X class isn't viable at high ping for every class. Since ping affects skill casts at every interval, the classes with least cast requirements will be least affected (i.e. the classes that do big hits and don't require keyboard marathons). This is my experience as a 300 ping Australian player who plays PvE and PvP with all classes at 65:  Least affected:  Priest, Mystic - Lock-ons will be slightly slower, everything else is OK. In PvP can actually work to your advantage since you desync more so people can't hit you.  Slayer - Rotations do not require a lot of skills in a row. Probably the best class for DPS for high ping.  Middle:  Gunner, Archer, Reaper - Rotations require more input. Some skills (e.g. final salvo cancel for archers, rapid fire for gunners, second shadow burst reaper) slow or impossible. Other skills are generally OK.  Lancer - Slower combos. More difficulty with block. Shield bash->spring attack very difficult.  High:  Warrior, Sorc - Requires high APM input. Since ping slows you down at every interval, you end up losing a lot of DPS. Some PvP combos are completely impossible with these classes at high ping.  Zerk - Each charge bar is slowed. Huge DPS hit. Almost every PvP combo is impossible at high ping.  I play warriors at 300 ping and do well in PvE (top 20 in all vaults with just renegade weapon and no slaying crystal) and PvP (battlemaster - 20 battleground wins in a row, 1600 elo cs rank 1 top, rank 7 skyring top, etc), so it's not a game-breaking issue, but the disadvantages are definitely very noticeable.

TeraOnline,3cyavh,iisten,2,Sat Jul 11 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"Having the extra crit (versus full power accessories), helps the overall damage of other skills you may end up using when AB is on CD. So yea, I'd go 3 force and 2 edge aswell. I'd probably use 2 power etchings and a crit/power inner depending how much crit I want.   I had my gunner at around +100 crit and I was happy with my crit rate and damage.  @op, I'd keep those rolls for now on your weapon, wroth isn't worth rerolling since you'll be replacing it with schisma or vm5 anyways. With weapon I'd do all 3 rolls with %damage (flat, back, enraged), and do an above line enrage (or maybe CDR). +116 crit is fine, but make sure you're not lacking on your power because AB's damage is very dependent on that."

TeraOnline,3cvi8e,acustic,3,Sat Jul 11 06:42:43 2015 UTC,First off.... You also don't HAVE to play on a PVP server if you don't want to. This is what happens on a PVP server. Its your choice to deal with stuff like this. Second and more importantly...  How are you about to say the whole community is horrible when (you said it yourself) 7 people are blocking the path. At this point you are just making a huge deal out of something extremely small. And quite frankly... making yourself look like a winey little child.

TeraOnline,3czb05,Wakabala,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:13:19 2015 UTC,"To be honest, as long as you've average mental faculties and have the capacity to learn, no class is really hard. It's more a measure of the complexity of rotations and skill mechanics, which mostly comes from practice.   Berserker and Gunner are both in a very good place DPS-wise right now, so if you enjoy the play style stick with it. My advice is to try any class that seems interesting to you and get a basic feel for the way they play- there's really no wrong choice. Some classes do get key components of their kit late in the levelling process, so keep that in mind, but for a general idea the first ten or so skills are a decent indicator.  As for anything important, I'd say make sure you expand your inventory ASAP via the NPC in Velika, keep crafting reagents either for when you decide to craft at end-game or just to sell, and gather nodes you see if it's convenient. Don't trust average brokered sale on item tooltips either!"

Pay attention to what the bosses do and avoid hits, make sure you have grace of resurrection on so if you do go down by accident you can get back up for free once. Personally when I play I am almost constantly in motion im personally using succoring vrysks which increase heals but if your having issues with surviving use the ones that provide endurance lower heals vs surviving for that.

What exactly is it that you're dying to?  Some priests run ASpd (Swift) vyrsks, while some run Succoring. Personally I use Succoring.   Run only if you need to in order to avoid boss attacks/mechanics. Stay within healing range of people at all times. Keep Triple Nemesis endurance debuff up, use Energy Stars on cooldown (glyphed)  And remember that if the group is letting themselves get hit by every single avoidable attack, then it's not your fault.

I'm lucky enough to have alts and be able to run this bosses with my alts on both positions, this knowledge has made me a better priest 'cause now I know when the tank is gonna need a heal or when the dps can eat the most dmg, so I'm aware of it and I can be faster with my actions, since not everyone has the privilege of being able to run from the 3 positions I guess you will have to pay a closer look to the boss, the mechanics, the movements, get to know the boss = get to know the fight = heal faster and better.

For Crystals in PvP you're gonna want 3 Fine Relentless Niveots + 1 Fine Resolute for blues (armor crystals) and then I run 3 Fine Brilliant + 1 Swift or Fleetfoot (I don't remember the red move speed). Then for my Zyrks I run Indoms which come from alliance.  For PvE I run the same red's as PvP but with full hardies as my blues and Succoring Vyrsks (the one that improve healing).  When I first hit 65 I started small and ran RG + BRNM with a couple people from my guild. It's easier to get gear and most likely your guild will teach you more about the dungeon. As I got more comfortable with healing we moved on to different dungeons like Rift's Edge(the previous 10-man dungeon) + Sky Cruiser Normal Mode. It's all about learning and going with what you're comfortable with.  As for glyphs I rotate mine between Solo, PvE, PvP, and BGs. I recommend having a different set for each just because you won't be ressing in BGs like you would in Open world/dungeons. Just google priest glyphs and you should find something that would suit you.  Energy Stars + Triple Nem are a must during boss fights. I glyph Healing Immersion for the reset so I drop it as often as needed. Kaias is also glyphed for healing + CD. You want to save your plague for certain things (in RG the bosses all have shields and in RE there were times when you had to Debuff boss). Mostly just keep everyone's health up, throw a e-stars when you can, and triple nem when you're not healing. ALSO! I've found that even with an infused charm people run low on mana so it's best to mana charge when you can. c:  I hope this helps. If you're on MT I can help you out a little more, if not it's cool."
TeraOnline,3cx3v5,HomemadeZombie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:43:18 2015 UTC,"You can build either defensively or for big heals. I use my Hyderad setting rings + full succoring vyrsk/zyrk setup for easier dungeons (big heals) and my rivertrill/beat (to be upgraded to the new jewelry set) + grounding zyrks for harder dungeons.   As for how you're playing, we won't really know unless you post a video of your playing. Keep in mind that you, as well as all the other members of the party, should know the boss mechanics and attack well and be dodging them. Being quick with cleanses and ready with heals comes easier when you can anticipate what is coming. Make sure you're making full use of all your skills, including Kaia's shield and guardian sanctuary.   But again no one here can really give you an accurate feedback on how you're doing unless you post a video or you run with them."

If shocking implosion is not off cooldown when the skill stops resetting, fill in with tripple nem and other stuffs.

So who's to say the majority of knock-up skills on Brawler lose their knock up ability unless chained? Or maybe the knock up only works when the enemy is stunned?

I mean its cool and all that they are making all these new kinds of stuff but they really need to stop it with the fatal shield stuff and knockup based things such as the gunner time bomb. for christs sake this class has bonus crit vs airborne targets and an airborne juggle. Being airborne is the worst form of cc in tera because of how much is ruins the flow of combat. But oh well. Bluehole will be bluehole.

If you find yourself needing more mana, glyph tenacity for chance of mana per second. It fills you up nicely, and you can do this while you practice. Infused charm + mana charge or aura from healers is usually enough, but I use shevranberry cookies or grilled piglings (1%mana per 5sec) all the time since it's cheap, and helps a bit."

TeraOnline,3cvnys,N0rthWind,2,Sat Jul 11 19:04:00 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Slayer since TERA went FTP and I gotta say Slayer is almost as bad as when Overhand/WW didn't stagger and KDS/ WW didn't have KD / Stagger immunity.  A gunner that camps HB-7 forces a Slayer to bait out a leash beforehand or wait for Tenacity CD to counter Detonate. Leash CD is on 20 second cooldown, while Tenacity has 25 second CD if glyphed. Before this patch, Slayers could put pressure with Distant blade, and leap strike into eviscerate. Now, this patch makes any non-backstab gap closers risky as a Gunner can tap-cast Mana Missles for KD. Once a Slayer is KD'd a Gunner just AB for lols.  Hell, a Slayer can time his iframe to dodge the first tick of AB passing through the character model, but all the gunner has to do is to time the AB explosion (second cast) to hit the Slayer as he touches the ground after Evasive Roll.  Sorc matchup is just hilarious because the usual strategy of tanking through KD traps with KDS/WW and sleep traps with Tenacity is near suicidal. It's almost like telegraphing to the sorc that it's a perfect time to Celerity > Warp Barrier > Flame Pillar / KD Trap/ Sleep Trap with an 1.5 sec immunity from the Warp Barrier still applied becuase yolo Celerity.  Fuck Reapers. Moroku gives me terminal cancer."

You don't play slayer because you wanna be a dick, that's what warriors are for. You play slayer for the aggressive burst and skill control they have. Just a backstab may force a sorc, or reaper to blow retribution/warpbarrier. An ICB pop engage on a priest could force them to pop 5min. It's a very battlefield controlling class. Warriors are also like this, but less kd's, and rapid burst."

TeraOnline,3cvnys,BobOfTheSnail,3,Sat Jul 11 05:30:29 2015 UTC,"Except a warrior literally does a Slayer's job better now. The addition of an extra KD to a Warrior's kit, Edge burst combo improvements , damage increase across the board, an extra second of Backstab (0.5 sec with double stun reduction), longer range on Battlecry, Instant Ramen Giga makes it equivalent if not superior to a slayer.  A warrior literally does what slayer used to do. Nowadays Slayers watch as their KD's get Hb-7 recalled, Warped , etc. At least Warriors can guarantee a Edge combo now. I'm struggling to crit a HT from behind with 56 base + 144 extra + triple crit rate glyph + Castanic Passive. God bless white damage HT.  Warrior is the true jack of all trades."
TeraOnline,3cvnys,N0rthWind,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:23:12 2015 UTC,"""Jack of all trades"" is usually followed by ""master of none"", which is the problem, slayers aren't great at anything that they do in particular. Its true that at a medium-ish skill level before players realize the true extent of their class's ability, slayers can use their wide array of skills to their advantage, however once it gets to a higher level of play there's not much left. Backstep forces a sorc to do nothing more than Jaunt cause apparently we dont stop that with backstab, reapers can just use their dash to leave our backstab (They do get rooted after but they're already out of range of all our skills except DB). ICB pop tells everyone on the enemy team to focus you, tenacity is only going to get you so far with the stun resist lasting 5s(I think) seeing as you can still be staggered and KD, it's only a minor reprieve that allows you to stay alive, and you're probably not gonna get to do much to the enemy healer if the other team is competent."
TeraOnline,3cvnys,ThePurpleKnightmare,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:57:21 2015 UTC,Why would backstab force a reaper to use retribution? They can just shadow step or pendulum out and not risk getting kicked in the face

If it's not MWed you're probably not measuring up.  However, if you don't have any Schisma hands, you might actually be losing on DPS, even if it's MWed, due to the set bonuses (if you have Fulminate belt the loss is less).

Also the achievements to travel to every area in the game and dungeon achievements are pretty easy to get too.

There are also several achievements for climbing up to certain spots in mountains, search on youtube for ""Northern Shara Vistas"" ""Southern Shara Vistas"" ""Northern Arun Vistas"" ""Southern Arun Vistas.""

TeraOnline,3ctp1r,Snizax,5,Fri Jul 10 18:15:48 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't.  You want to roll either %dmg, dmg from behind, or dmg against enraged as these are all viable damage increasing rolls for bosses.  %dmg to monster with highest aggro to you is not consistent as you aren't going to always be pulling aggro with a tank in your party so the dmg modifier won't always apply so you are losing out on that roll."
TeraOnline,3ctp1r,Tangy4tw,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:18:58 2015 UTC,"So should the text actually read ""%dmg to monsters to which you have the highest aggro from""? Because as the text reads, against a boss or something, it should always be in effect..."
TeraOnline,3ctp1r,LuxuryScience,4,Fri Jul 10 18:48:06 2015 UTC,"The text reads weird but what it means is that if YOU pull aggro (red ring underneath you), whatever monster is currently targeting you because you pulled aggro will receive 8.6% more damage.

TeraOnline,3crub6,narium,-9,Fri Jul 10 11:32:42 2015 UTC,Wrong. The highest aggro stat works off YOUR aggro table. You're thinking of the monster aggro table. Something like this  MONSTER    Tank 80 DPS 1 10 DPS 2 7 DPS 3 3 Healer 0  Instead it functions something like this  YOU    Monster 1 70 Monster 2 30  The highest aggro stat will work against Monster 1 but not Monster 2. Does this make sense?  Unless they changed it.

What you're saying makes absolutely no sense at all - you can go test this right now with your highest aggro roll. Have no endurance debuffs on a bam, hit it with any skill while one of your friends has aggro. Now repeat, but have aggro yourself. Highest aggro rolls for both weapon and chest pieces ONLY work if you're holding primary aggro, otherwise they're completely worthless rolls.   If it actually worked you would see every single endgame dps player walking around with highest aggro rolls, as there would be absolutely no reason not to roll it. 99% of the time you're only facing one boss monster at a time in endgame - but guess what, no one rolls it because it doesn't work that way."

TeraOnline,3cs79j,BigBallsBitesBack,3,Fri Jul 10 10:08:34 2015 UTC,"You definitely want to be moving around. All classes benefit from using the mobs and boss position and the position of other party members to best handle any combat situation. But ideally, in the endgame, you want to block as much as possible as this builds a ""threat profile"" which gives any monster attacking you a base amount of threat (20% at max) which stays on you until you are hit again. Of course, this doesn't matter when you're soloing as monsters would only have you to attack anyways.   All the lancers reasoning for maneuverability is based on if there are multiple targets involved in the combat. If you have other party members, then move around so that the enemy is back on to your party; this allows your party to get a higher crit chance. If you have multiple enemies, move around so that they are focused on your shield. And when either of these conditions are met, throw down your shield and don't use an ability unless you are sure you can do it before the monster hits you again. This is ideal, but takes long practice to figure out.  Your backstep is useful when you're taking on multiple mobs and their position is spread around your shield. Backstep and allow them to reapproach. They will triangulate to your shield and thus be more concentrated for your attacks, and less likely that they will hit you around your shield.  One EXTREMELY beneficial position you can practice is ""Wall Tanking"". You may find that when you're out in the open and you're fighting a few enemies, that one will just attack right through you. It will block, but now the enemy is behind you. You could backstep and be fine again, but when there are enough mobs (and know that your party will eventually ask you to take on MANY mobs) you won't be able to rely on backstep. So find a wall, and stick to it. Most times, your view will go wonky. Just aim your camera so you have a bird's eye view of the battle. It's a little tough with the limited view, but you'll get used to it. Staying on the wall gives mobs less room to attack you. This is why ""Corner Tanking"" is even better than WT. Your shield is just about big enough to make sure no mob can ever attack you, as long as you have two walls also protecting you.   Also, many animations can be cancelled by blocking. For example, your Challenging Shout can have it's full scene of him shouting to the sky cut short just by using the stand fast skill while still allowing the effect of Challenging Shout through. Many other skills can be cancelled as well, and through other means. Utilizing this also allows you to maximize your damage output and threat generation, without taking damage yourself.  Many of these skills seem pointless right now when you can just smack around some mobs and eventually they die. But at about 35 or 40, these skills become useful. And I'd advise you look in to a proper rotation for threat generation. Being able to hold aggro is your key skill. Become good at never letting the enemy hit your allies, and you become the tank god.  Here's one of the better tanking guides out there: Tank Guide  :)"
TeraOnline,3cs79j,defford,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:00:53 2015 UTC,"can i just say that ""hold the line"" is one of the most useless perks the lancer has. you get one stack for every time you put up the shield and block something. only one. so, if you put your shield up and block a dozen hits? one stack. unless, of course, you can put your shield down in between each of those dozen hits and not get hit. you also lose all of the stacks you had gained when you get hit so doing the droppingtheshield bit is pretty much useless. just saying, it's complete crap."
TeraOnline,3cs79j,Retrikaethan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:33:34 2015 UTC,"... I had to practice hard to learn how to block between attacks so I didn't get hit. Needless to say, it isn't impossible, and an extra 20% aggro that just floats is a huge help."
TeraOnline,3cs79j,defford,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:15:06 2015 UTC,"the problem is that you lose all stacks when you get hit. so you get two choices: perfectly block every single time for the entire fight or disregard it as a tool. it is fantastically easier to do the latter due to your need to attack to make use of the aggro anyway. sometimes its better to take a hit and punch em in the face than to block and lose aggro to dps which would defeat the purpose of being the tank anyway. if it gave a stack for every time an attack is defended? yes, that would make this awesome. however, that's not how it works and because of it is a lot more trouble than it is worth."
TeraOnline,3cs79j,Retrikaethan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"Hold the line isn't there to tell you to perfectly block every attack, it's to help you hold aggro when you don't have much time/opening for an attack. Also, it's really easy to stack on some bosses that attacks multiple times. Examples: Mephisis spin x5, Tantibus drill x7, Fulminar's hand swipe x2, Fulminar's walk x6, Tempa's thrash x5, Yana's dice attacks x3/ x5? etc. these numbers are from what I was able to stack at max. It could be more if you can time them correctly. Each boss have an attack pattern where Lancers can greatly benefit from just by blocking alone. Lancer is supposed to be a class that holds down the boss in a position where other party member gets benefit. So disregarding it is entirely stupid as well, it's like disregarding combo attack in PvP. Sadly, because of how DPS class's attacks get stronger at a much higher rate than Lancers, we have to rely on the modifiers from gear and skill. It's not too terrible if you know what to do, such as remembering to use challenging shout whenever it's up, followed by rally cry with 100% aggro glyph if you still don't have aggro. Even 5% aggro glyph on combo attack can get your aggro back too if you can skate well enough too. Lancer's difficulty level wasn't just 4 stars for nothing. So just because it ""seems"" not much, being 1% per successful block, trust me, I've seen a lot of KTERA lancers stack up to 10 easily (except for Mephisis in BRHM because the poisons are troll)."
TeraOnline,3cs79j,Idi0ticGenius,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"You can only get one stack per block. If you hold block for 20 attacks, you only get 1 stack.   It's pretty difficult to get over 15 stacks on a boss. Lots of bosses use a filler walk animation which do not have tells and does damage. You get hit by these while attacking and lose your stacks. I would really like to see something like 5% aggro to max 20% stacks or something. 1% doesn't help much when you can only get about 6 stacks average during a fight. Edit: I'm assuming you aren't tapping blocks in between the attacks. If you are, that's some pretty quick blocking."

Also, the reason why it seem fluffy (while in irl, it really isn't that fluffy) is because people also call that outfit ""Little chickling outfit"". They're small, yellow, cute, young children. It's a shame that people like you think about something sexual first in anything related to children or child-looking things."

Warrior I-frames go as follows:  Roll - at 1500 RE and glyphed you can roll 4 times in a row.  Death from Above- launches you in the air for the longest I-frame in the game, this skill is the best skill warriors have, saved my ass a million times it even does moderate damage.  Backstab - This is sort of an i-frame if you time it just right, it's tricky to time it but it's do-able and has it's uses especially in the fight against Darkan.  Warriors also have damage mitigation skills.  Rain of blows - While skill is active it mitigates damage by 30%  Rising Fury - While skill is active it mitigates damage by 20%  Torrent of Blows - While skill is active it mitigates damage by 50%  Pounce - While skill is active it mitigates damage by 50%"

Like, bro, just think about this as being a kind person instead of ""Oh someone made a mistake LETS FUCKEM FOR IT, not my fault they messed up!""  The principle is the same as screwing a corporation, but the fact that you're taking advantage of someone else just like you instead of a mega corporation that won't even care is what makes the situation different. Instead of looking at it in the only situation you want to see to justify being a douche, think of it as a human situation.  Don't try to justify it, man up to it and accept you're being a douche, no problem in that, it's just how you're wired.

TeraOnline,3cs2ho,ZonerRoamer,2,Fri Jul 10 09:26:53 2015 UTC,Warriors definitely do more dmg tanking this patch. I usually do 500k-1m scythes in tank mode.

Against good DPS, especially +14/+15 I lose aggro a few times but generally 1 ToB gets it back as long as im using infusions. Waiting for the buff to check if I can actually DPS-Tank :D"

Use ToB as much as I could and tweak my shout glyph to draw more threat, you can surprisingly hold aggro pretty good, you just have to be quick on your hands and roll back into the wall appropriately and use DFA to keep the boss still facing his ass towards the real dps. If you have a great healer this is totally do-able unless the whole party is in +15 then your just better off going tank.  I haven't tried DPS-tank in the new patch.

But when i did brnm with idoneal gear,  i can hold aggro pretty easily against +12 disco2 gunner, and ambit2 is a walk. From what i see, zerk tank is more spacebar tank than others. Raze and Flatten have such low cd that you can chain a lot of skills to it and space bar all the way. You also don't need to worry about mana problem too since you never run out of mana."
TeraOnline,3cs2ho,gr00grams,0,Fri Jul 10 14:24:46 2015 UTC,"Call me crazy, but I could easily see Zerk tank being the best, if you can hold aggro.  The reason is simple, with the mana on block glyph, you can hold block forever. If the aura keeps aggro up ( as it's supposed to constantly gain aggro ), I see this as head and heels above both warrior and lancer. The only challenge is keeping aggro, otherwise Zerk in theory should easily be the best tank, for tanks."
TeraOnline,3cs2ho,magocchi,2,Fri Jul 10 17:01:51 2015 UTC,The aura does constantly generate aggro but it is very little.  And zerk tank is the worst tank simply because it doesn't have Infuriate.
TeraOnline,3cs2ho,AboveArcadia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"Why is infuriate so good?  Honest question, I do not know. I understand what it does, and the ideas of back crit gems, but everyone talks about this skill.  Back to zerk, again the ideas one can have with his skills make a logical argument, if u could hold aggro and just hold block, it's how i solo bams with mine idk, it's a friggin lot of block though."
TeraOnline,3cs2ho,samiradel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:51:39 2015 UTC,"Infuriate enrages bosses, which makes them take more dmg (less crit resist on most bosses, not all tho) and well you also have the enrage dmg rolls on your weapon + focused crystal applying. Almost all bosses also deal more dmg tho and are faster. Usually it just means an insane dps increase :)"
TeraOnline,3cs2ho,Idi0ticGenius,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:39:12 2015 UTC,"Infuriate doesn't even matter this patch, all the bosses in the new dungeons naturally enrage. And even if you want to do SCHM/NM you could just bring a warrior."
TeraOnline,3cs2ho,Spiffymooge,0,Sat Jul 11 05:47:14 2015 UTC,"For the current gear, with decently skilled players, Zerker tank is fine. Holding aggro is a breeze - just hit Fiery Rage every ten seconds and use the double uppercut thing. I don't know yet for upwards of Ambit 2, however. One thing to note, there is an INSANE delay between hitting block and actually blocking in tank stance :<"
TeraOnline,3cs2ho,Rockinallnight,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:18:49 2015 UTC,"I main Lancer and I prefer it over Warrior, but that's because I'm not used to Warrior's controls and skills.

TeraOnline,3cnfa0,Wakabala,4,Thu Jul 9 06:57:01 2015 UTC,"agreed, but something is bugged with looting in general.   i have been power leveling my new archer doing about a dozen instances per day, and i'm amazed and how much trash can not be picked up by anyone.  what's up with that?  isn't the whole point that anyone can pick the floor clean and the server logic does the random or by turns distribution of loot?  it's frustrating because especially newbies low on cash and picking up alkahest and anything they can crush for fodder waste time and collect pet costs and get nothing for their trouble."
TeraOnline,3cnfa0,stonecats,2,Thu Jul 9 12:47:44 2015 UTC,"Certain items are ""reserved"" for specific party members. For example, when alkahests drop, a few piles may be ""reserved"" for you while a few other (presumably fair/equal amount) piles are ""reserved"" for the other members of your party. You can't pick up their alkahests until they leave the party I think.  Basically, SOMEONE in your party can pick them up but for whatever reason won't. They're probably just power leveling a side character and the money that comes from selling alkahests to NPC merchants is nothing to them."

In my experience its a pretty high damage skill. Personally, I think some people overstate how useful it is because one cast of it takes quite a while from full willpower, and you can do a lot in that time. My major problem with the skill is the latency does NOT play nice.   I read a lot about how latency makes it more burst fire than a steady stream which can hurt DPS, which I have certainly encountered, but my biggest problem is that the skill will randomly recast itself, an animation which locks me in place. I'd say around 50% of the time when I want to stop casting, I can move, dodge-roll, autoattack, use other skills whatever - and it will cast again locking me in place. It's happened up to 8 times in a row to me before. I don't have any video to show this yet, but it happens to me enough I might try and grab some later today cause it's infuriating.  Long story short though, because of that random animation lock I consider it pretty unviable for me and if it's latency causing it like I think it is there's not much I can do. It's high enough priority that I try to use it whenever I can in fights that I know, when I know I'll have an opportunity to sit still for a while, but it's costing me DPS when I cast an animation eight times in a row without any skills coming out of it and it's gotten me killed too many times.   TL;DR Your mileage may vary especially with latency, but it's good when it works"

TeraOnline,3cqfuz,Acerolion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:16:52 2015 UTC,My assumption so far is (assuming low ping) Arcane Barrage > Scatter Shot > Replenishment > repeat if CD reset > Burst fire if near cap > mana missiles > time bomb > arc bomb. Sound about right? (I also tend to fill in blasts between casts)
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,AzusaNakajou,2,Fri Jul 10 00:53:39 2015 UTC,You can summon HB-7 (it does a lot of damage when glyphed) and cancel the delay afterwards with burst fire.
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,AzusaNakajou,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:28:23 2015 UTC,"Just tap your HB summon button, then hold down burst fire right after."
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,_United_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"This, glyphed HB-7 can deal about half of an AB crit. Its a good habit to get into using HB before BF."
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,ch1k,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:44:41 2015 UTC,I mix in time bomb with Arcane Barrage using basic attack as an animation cancel because it does decent damage and also takes little time to cast.
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,AboveArcadia,-1,Fri Jul 10 04:33:43 2015 UTC,"Scatter shot does such low damage over the course of an encounter it's not even worth to use. It has a relatively long cast time (even when canceled properly)and changes your position, it could be better replaced by a timebomb, MM, or maybe even an arc bomb. Even the damage from using blast between skills will end up doing more damage than scatter shot.  The only thing I used scatter shot for was the movement."
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,kusanagisan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:01:46 2015 UTC,"My personal opinions on it:  IF your ping and connection is good enough, go ahead and use it. If you can't get through a full bar without it lagging, I would avoid it. Sometimes it drops for me, depending on what time I play.  I tend to use it if Replenishment doesn't reset either Arcane Barrage or Scattershot. It's also pretty much free damage if you happen to be running low on mana after a few Scatter/Arcane resets.  It's not as useful against bosses, but when you're clearing trash or higher level mobs and the tank can group them together and you're behind them, it's an amazing skill."
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,tyrenzo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:54:15 2015 UTC,I've said this so many times and i guess i'll say it again. Hit 150 Crit Factor and it WILL be your second highest DPS comparable to AB pre-nerf so it will definitely be equal now. Spam AB and replenish and use other spells to build 75%+ WP. Once you hit 75% WP and don't have AB then dump your BF to the back.
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,tyronoa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:02:43 2015 UTC,"Will this hold true even with high ping though?  The delay for Burst Fire is very noticeable the higher the ping goes, especially above 200."
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:23:02 2015 UTC,"It is an essential part of any gunners rotation and any gunner not using it is not playing the class to its potential. Also its near useless unless you have around +80-100 crit rate.  Burst fire does more damage than Balders and Artillery Barrage, but has a long cast time; so using it to its potential requires some knowledge of boss movements. Knowing WHEN to use it is as important as position when you use it.  Let me illustrate with an example; when the RG monkey falls back after tree/herbs/sacrifice; this is what you can do; (assuming your willpower is already full like it should be)  Artillery Barrage (will replenish ~ 70% of your willpower bar if cast correctly) > AB > Replenish > AB (You now have a full Willpower bar) > HB-7 Summon > Burst Fire (until the boss gets up and turns towards you)  Also to be noted is the fact that Rocket Jump > Burst Fire speeds up Burst fire's initial cast, so you can jump OVER enemies that start doing long animations and near instantly start burst fire from the back.  As a gunner there are tons of times when Artillery Barrage, AB, Replenish all are on CD, it is at this time you use burst fire rather than skills like Mana Missiles that are very low dmg atm. (Maybe missiles were buffed in this patch?)  What you have to remember is that any time that you are running around with a FULL willpower bar, you are LOSING DPS, Artillery has a 2min CD, Balders 6min; so the only skill left over that will consume that willpower is burst fire. At the end of the day, when you look at the damage you dealt, Burst fire will be second after AB, so it is NOT an optional skill for any gunner worth his salt.  EDIT: Also important facts about Burst Fire:   While firing on mobs, if they are bunched together, it hits all of them. The last 20% of so of your willpower will deal more damage than the earlier 80% so it's more rewarding to sit it through till the end even if the boss has turned a little."
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"You can't cancel the animation of burst, you can call hb-7 first and cancel the animation of HB call, or you can use rocket jump to go behind the boss and then use burst as that cuts the ending animation of rocket jump effectively making burst faster."
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,wolfcry0,0,Fri Jul 10 05:36:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't done any research on it myself, but I usually use it when I have full willpower and arcane barrage didn't reset and is on cool down"
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,Antipathyy,0,Sun Jul 12 22:10:16 2015 UTC,"It fits in near the end of my rotation, usually after I've used all of my willpower generating abilities, I use it to yes, do a lot of dps, and also let the cooldowns of my rotation wear out. BF is your second-most damaging ability so you should use it alot.  Arcane barrage cancels the animation, so its good to use it after that."
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,FunnyFunkyCow,4,Mon Jul 13 04:19:44 2015 UTC,"I tend to use mana missiles instead of AB because MM has a small delay before it charges. Using MM to cancel BF makes MM charge instantly.  In regards to op, I use it whenever HB summon is available (right after an AB)- summoning HB beforehand will do about 3/4 of AB, and with the extra dmg with BF, it's easily a very strong attack."

TeraOnline,3cqfuz,HotTacoGG,-2,Thu Jul 9 23:44:40 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I put it after arcane barrage in my combo chain so it will go: Time Bomb>Blast>Arc Bomb>Scattershot>Arcane Barrage> Burst Fire."
TeraOnline,3cqfuz,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:28:38 2015 UTC,AB > Replenish > AB   This small skill chain should always have the highest priority as a gunner.

TeraOnline,3cqfuz,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:25:39 2015 UTC,"Generally I am right at the bosses back, so there is no travel time, thing about ranged classes in this game is, you have to play it like a melee class if you wanna maximize you damage, if you are too far from the boss, you can't use Rolling reload to roll behind him and maximize your back time when he turns to the dps for random attacks."

Maybe it's possible that there's a setting somewhere in the files to turn showing the quests back on, if they really did intend that to be the case but forgot to put it in the options menu.

TeraOnline,3col92,th3schwartz,4,Thu Jul 9 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"I'm no where near super experienced as a sorc, but I've been 65 for a while and have been fiddling around with rotations.  My typical rotation goes something along the lines of this: Mana Barrier, Burst of Celerity, Nova, Overcharge, Fireblast, Void Pulse, Ice Needle/Flaming Barrage/Magma Bomb, Arcane Pulse (fully charged), Overcharge, Fireblast. Teleport Jaunt, Glacial Retreat, and the backstep as needed.  I still don't have the glyph for doubled crit rate for Arcane Pulse, so that's why I'm fully charging it. Also, I use Mana Regen/Siphon/the other mana one whenever needed. I tend to save Ice Storm for when Burst of Celerity effect ends and is still on ~10 second cooldown since if you use Overcharge while Ice Storm is down, one of the ticks of damage will proc your Overcharge.  After I get my main skills off (Nova, Fireblast, Void Pulse), I tend to just use whatever skills are around until those main spells come off cooldown.  If Burst of Celerity is still on cooldown, I'll throw a couple other skills in. Sometimes I put in Flame Pillar but only if I know the enemy won't hit me."
TeraOnline,3col92,Symphawnics,2,Thu Jul 9 15:32:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't know about the interaction between Overcharge and Hailstorm. Nice!  What do you think about using Arcane Pulse while Burst is down? Or does your rotation account for the entire CD of burst?  thanks!"
TeraOnline,3col92,Symphawnics,2,Thu Jul 9 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"Generally, you can fit two Fireblasts in one Burst. When you get Nova, it's a little more difficult to pull off two Fireblasts (which is why I don't normally use Nova a second time in one Burst).  And yes, to be clear, my rotation counts for the entire duration of Burst. The second Fireblast is where Burst ends.  I think the only use for Arcane Pulse while burst is down is to just fire it off without charging (assuming you have the glyph that doubles your crit rate for 4 seconds after using it). I typically don't use Arcane Pulse when burst isn't up. I feel like the charge isn't worth it when it's not sped up."

TeraOnline,3col92,victorpresti,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:16:45 2015 UTC,"It can work fine if you chose to use it. Although I save Mana Barrier for defense purposes you still have Warp Barrier up every 10 seconds for you to use if your iframe if down. Under the assumption that you have no external mana regen items/rolls on your gear (Diving Insusion, charms, ect) you may need to drop an ability or so from your ""Fillers"" so that you can use Mana Infusion earlier.  Mana Barrier -> BoC -> Nova (crit glyph) -> Overchannel -> Fireblast ->Arcane Pulse -> Void Pulse -> Magma Bomb -> Painblast OR Needle (I prefer needle for the most part but you can drop both if your mana pool wont allow it) -> Mana Infusion -> Nova -> Overchannel - Fireblast -> Hail storm -> Arcane pulse (Not fully) -> Fillers  My biggest grievance with that glyph for Barrier is that the ability is on a long cooldown. On paper it seems amazing but practically I believe the points are better spent else where. It doesn't give me consistency which I feel the class already lacks with BoC down. That being said, my previous sentence can be interpreted in different ways so I'll never say with certainty that you shouldn't use it."

At the moment I'm using it on cooldown before overchannel fireblast, but I feel I'd probably go the way of using it defensively later on as you do.  I totally feel you on the lack of consistency as well, that BoC downtime just feels so slow. But, I love everything else about Sorcerer so far so that's not enough to deter me in the slightest.

TeraOnline,3cqj2a,Rettech7,2,Thu Jul 9 23:39:02 2015 UTC,I find giving Final Salvo its own slot (instead of chaining) provides the least buggy experience.   You can even set the slot to have the same hotkey as your normal chain key and there won't be any conflicts.
TeraOnline,3cqj2a,powera,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:54:47 2015 UTC,My experience is that the chaining delay is proportional to your ping. At the same time you can hold down the keybind of the skill you want to weave in and it fires off way faster. Is there a way to disable the chaining popup? :D

To explain your situation to you, there was just a patch, pre patch people did not craft anything and now they are focussed on the harder to get parts. Hence, material prices overall are down.  What powera said is true too of course, it is easier to sell non processed materials.  PS: Try to look at the market, usually if u have a big stack you should aim to sell it for more.

The aspd roll I can see as arguable for some classes since weight-wise it's 2 rolls, but come on cdr?  As a 4th roll on vm okay fine, but I've never seen anyone replace a primary damage roll with cdr until this patch."
TeraOnline,3coihw,megatonfist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:26:47 2015 UTC,"Mathematically CDR has always been the best roll for nearly all dps classes ever since it came out. I've been using it ever since it was introduced in the WH patch. Reasons why most people don't like to roll for CDR is because it's more sustained dps over burst, people like to see bigger numbers, and over half the Tera community plays with more than 150 ping and are unable to utilize the cd effectively (using highest dmg skills off cd).  If that's not enough to convince you lets do some simple math:  50% dmg vs 50% CDR  Say you have a skill on a 10 sec cd, in 100 seconds you can use it 10 times. At 50% CDR, you now can use that same skill 20 times. That's a 100% increase in dmg vs your measly 50%."

Below the green baseline stats is a white ""Rerollable stat"" line. Think of this as a +0 stat line similar to the rollable skill line on Disco/VM4 chests.  This stat, and only this stat, can be rerolled on the baseline for CDR and other stats.  Anything below (when you +3-+9 enchant) is independent of this line.

TeraOnline,3cpd9e,Kvera17,2,Thu Jul 9 23:06:07 2015 UTC,"IMO MWing Wroth is worth it considering you are a new player. It costs WAY less than Schisma, masterworks really easily (it will often MW after 1 or 2 MES) and is as good as Disco... Its not that hard to get Schisma gear, but with the current prices its extremely expensive to MW, roll and enchant it (remember Schisma is Tier 7, so you need T7 feedstock and T7 alkahest, both really expensive).  I have a Wroth weapon +12 and boots +9 masterworked, I used 6 MES in total to get both masterworked, used a few more to get decent rolls, enchanted it using the relatively cheap and accessible T6 alk and feedstock... To be fair I didn't even had to buy anything, I just used what I had in my inventory because everything you need to get it to +12 is really easy to get. On the other hand, today I got my Schisma weapon after opening the box from AINM instance matching, I used 80 MES and 11 BES to get it masterworked and with 3/4 rolls I wanted, used more than 1k T7 feedstock and a lot of T7 alkahest, 250 MWA and its sitting there at +10. With the resources I spent to get my Schisma weapon to +10 I could probably have completed 2 or 3 Wroth sets with weapon and gloves +12. In the end, the choice is yours, but I highly recommend MWing wroth until you have the resources to spend on Schisma."

For all accessories, the 4/5th set bonus suck for all except healers, so people would run 3 Deathwise and 2 Firetrill to get two 2 set bonuses and one 3 set. The 2 set bonus for Edge and Deathwise are +12 crit factor. Before Edgetime, there was only one set of Crit accessories so you could only get that set bonus with Deathwise. So people stacked 3 Deathwise for the +12 Crit and 4% Attack speed and 2 Firetune for the power set bonus.  Now, you can stack 3 Edge time for the +12 Crit and Attack Speed AND Deathwise for an additional +12 Crit."

TeraOnline,3cpo27,BorNProNStar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:38:20 2015 UTC,The glyph itself is not really worth getting since there are better ones anyway. You can still occasionally use CQ if every other decent skill is on CD or you need a stun or a slight movement forward. After the Archer changes you should consider using your remaining glyph points on Thunderbolt or Rapid Fire (Damage buff glyph) or preferably both.
TeraOnline,3cpo27,Penetrat0r1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:44:05 2015 UTC,oh. that was another thing ive been wondering. did thunderbolt get buffed or changed in recent patches?
TeraOnline,3cpo27,BorNProNStar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:39:49 2015 UTC,Thunderbolt casts faster. Thunderbolt chains to Final Salvo. Reduced cooldown on Thunderbolt to 35 seconds. Increased damage of Thunderbolt by about 10 percent in PvE.   Combined with one or both glyphs it actually is a fairly decent skill now.

TeraOnline,3cpo27,AbsoluteHooligan,-28,Fri Jul 10 01:10:12 2015 UTC,"Every class is skill based, if you're only auto attacking I suggest you play a different game.

TeraOnline,3co7dp,AutumnAran,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:30:05 2015 UTC,Vm4 +14 is better than schisma +12 and just about equal to VM5+12.  T6 feedstock is so much easier to come by and so much cheaper and masterwork alkahests are hovering at 30g each. So its about 3000g per awakened enchanting attempt + the cost of the 200 t6 feedstock. Where as tier 7 feedstock is 6 of the tier 6 so +6 to +12 uses 48 per try which is 288 tier 6 which is 88 more feedstock than awakening enchanting uses but only uses 17 masterwork alkahests per try. So it comes down to fail rate. Basically if you have already awakened then Generation is hands down the better option. If not Schisma will be more cost efficient if you use gold enchanter and or better alkahests.

I've had times where my entire combo could not break a Lancer iron will or Priest Kaias. If you look at the previous Skyring Slam, many of those 45+ min games were the result of Warriors doing a tiny amount of damage in a fully geared environment.   They also got almost nothing compared to the other classes during FoA. Binding Sword is not a terrible skill, but it was nowhere near as good as Lancer Giga. Warriors were never good in large scale PvP to begin with, and now failed to be good in small scale PvP due to extremely short stuns and mediocre damage.

This model has basically been the same since the release of the game.    Massive gold sinks along the way to enforce goldfarm as well. Don't get me wrong, I love Tera, but what got most of my friends to stop playing was the end-game grind.    Yes, best-in-slot gear are generally way, way, way better than second-best. It follows a natural pacing though, with gear progression through steps.  This varies alot - people have very different experiences with the community. It's my belief that people have been turned more and more ""gear-focused"" and less and less focus on actual player skill. This has alot to do with new dungeon-design however.  You tell me - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XuIrBgw0oU Also, yes, enchanted weaponry, costumes and weaponskins all add different shines, particle effects, etc.  Very, very big. Thing is though, after you're done leveling to maxlevel, you don't move around the map very much. You basically teleport between dailies and instances.  Berserker is an amazing starting-class. Imo though, the best class overall, from beginning to end, is probably Gunner. I've leveled all classes to max level, and the total damage output combined with gunner mobility is just insane.    Zerks and slayers however are probably the easier classes to get started with, and zerks the easier of the two, since blocking is imo more natural than rolling."
TeraOnline,3cnz7v,O113,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:59:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for such an extensive answer! Is it okay if I ask you one more question? Imcan you only wear full costumes or can you put together an outfit yourself?
TeraOnline,3cnz7v,O113,2,Fri Jul 10 09:50:48 2015 UTC,"This depends alot on the outfit, you got equipment slots for costumes - one for face, one for head, one for body and one for weapon (I think, I can check for real when I get home, currently ""working"").   On my sorcerer, I'm using a Steampunk costume (check the little fat dude in the front, that race http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/t__/images/c/ce/Dyeable_group_shot_(1).jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131020163018&path-prefix=tera)   I've combined it with a top-hat and a monocle. For mount, I'm riding a pig.   Compare this to starting popori sorcerer : http://mmorpg-tactics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/Tera-Online/images/screenshots/popori-sorcerer(4).jpg  Weapon has a red glow to it, showing maximum enchant.   My warrior is wearing a pirate suit, my slayer is using a business suit with a dragon-themed weapon and a Oni-demon mask.   You have some options, the outfit that is the dominating aspect is the body though, rest varies alot. You could wear a swimsuit and a top hat for instance.   For female characters, one issue that female friends of mine complain alot about is that if you're not playing the little girl race, you're more or less forced to look like a streethooker, no matter what you wear. Bikini-mail and thong seems to be the only protection you need as a woman.   Edit: Oh, and some weaponskins have built-in animations when sheathing or using them. Steampunk weapon for instance, or Goldspirit, or cherry blossom, I can link a few.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXPoJwdaL2c  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5tQph3SV_U  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDY7gNB4U-A"
TeraOnline,3cnz7v,O113,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:42:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot!   Last question (I swear ;): what's the deal with that whole reaper class. Because I looked into it and thought it was awesome, but you can only make one if you character that's already level 50+?"
TeraOnline,3cnz7v,SevenTruths,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:53:19 2015 UTC,"Once upon a time, a long long time ago, alot of healers and tanks felt that they did solo pve content way, way worse than the other classes for no real reason. Alot of focus during that time was on solo-content, for instance, best-in-slot healing accessories required you to fight a bam for 30 minutes, while a dps could do it in 2.   Rerolling felt like a shitty solution to the problem, since leveling all the way to 60 was way, way harder than it is now.   Lo and behold ! Enmasse heard the prayers and answered with releasing a class that would start at level 58. The requirement however was that you had one existing class at level 40 or above.   Also, a new class is always awesome, especially with a new concept of ""mid-range"" combat, where you otherwise was long-range or close-range.   Thus, Reaper was born. It's Elin only because creating animations costs alot of money and elins where at the time the most popular race by far, especially when comparing world-wide.   It starts at 50, you do a quick tutorial run (takes 1 hour maximum) and you're 58. Maximum another 4 hours and you're 60. If you wanna rush to maxlevel, you save quite alot of time by just rerolling reaper once you hit 40.   Those were not the days. Really hard to run instances since so many healers and tanks rerolled reapers. When the dust settled however, people moved back to their old classes.   It's a strong class, especially for soloing, with good AoE and alot of iframes. Fast-pace combat, alot of movement, risk of spacebar-mashing due to all the chains they have. It's more akin to a melee than a range, but not really a melee either.  It's not currently in any top-tier dps - karma since they were insanely OP when they were released. I imagine they are going to get buffed soon.   Also, when you first start playing a reaper, most people ask themselves why they would ever play something else. Huge ""wow""-factor on alot of their abilities, but once you get used to it, you start to realize that many of the other classes are just as fun to play."
TeraOnline,3cnz7v,Chereaux,3,Fri Jul 10 14:15:49 2015 UTC,"You didn't mention whether you are PvE or PvP/WvW oriented in GW2, so hopefully I can provide a 100% PvE perspective. 5K hours of very experienced PvE on GW2 here, started playing TERA under a month ago and have 250 hours clocked.   I haven't quite gotten to the absolute endgame of TERA dungeons, but from what I've seen so far (up to BRHM) the endgame content is much more challenging than anything GW2 has ever seen. Lupi was basically the only thing in GW2 that took me more than 2-3 hours to learn to solo within dungeons. Soloing is practically impossible on TERA for the harder dungeons, and your average group of casual players will literally never clear the more difficult ones (like SCHM last patch). However, because there is no scaling in dungeons like in GW2, you can't really run dungeons below your level and expect them to still be fun. Therefore, there are only a limited few dungeons that you can do at max level if you are looking for challenging content. It seems as though content updates for TERA are MUCH more frequent than GW2 though, considering we haven't even gotten anything other than Aetherpath since launch. In addition, there is basically an in-game gw2scr (gw2 speed clear records) feature, that allows everyone on your server to see the fastest clear times for the harder dungeons. The top 10 guilds at the end of each season get a sky castle thing, which is WAY more rewarding than GW2. There are no legendary weapons/armors, but getting best-in-slot seem to be pretty similar. The grind is pretty real, and the best part is that you have to have keep up with the gear every patch to really be relevant in speedclears. Pretty similar to GW2 from what I've seen, but I basically only play TERA with my old GW2 guild so I don't have much to say about this. Yes. However, the options are much more limited than GW2. You're not going to find a wide selection of particle effects and pretty skins, but overall the graphics are amazing and simply enchanting your weapon gives it a glow. I'd probably say around the size of GW2, maybe a little smaller. However, there is no waypoint system so you'll generally be doing a lot more running around on your pretty amazing looking mount. With that said, travelling is not particularly inconvenient as you can buy scrolls to teleport between cities and checkpoints around the world. What was your main class in GW2?"
TeraOnline,3cnz7v,notsalg,2,Thu Jul 9 15:35:48 2015 UTC,"Welcome to TERA! I've played GW2 extensively myself, world completed got lumi armor etc, so I'll do my best to answer your questions.     Like GW2, nothing serious happens until endgame (I'm talking speedruns, Arah P4-esque stuff). Unlike GW2, the important dungeons are ONLY in the endgame. As in, you can't do them until you are level 65 (cap). TERA has a VERY HEAVY emphasis on endgame. The game doesn't hand you gear. You have to find it, grind for it, or make it.   There are really rare weapon/armor skins but that's about it. Most people buy skins to cover up their equipment. Unlike GW2, the ""Legendary"" tier equipment actually offers significantly higher stats when compared to the next tier down. Community is as in any game: depends on who you run into. I would suggest joining a newbie-friendly guild that is willing to guide you through the game, as solo-leveling might be a bit challenging compared to GW2.   A few do. They are very expensive, more so than in GW2.  Fairly large. You don't have a readily available map travel option (unless you buy elite status or an atlas) so you'll do a lot of walking/riding around. It doesn't get tedious, trust me - the scenery is to gawk at. Some areas are layered (GW2 didn't do multiple floors) so they are bigger than they look.   Honestly, all classes except Mystic and Priest are decently easy to solo with. If you are playing with a group, leveling will be a breeze as the game was made to be a slight challenge as a solo player but easy as a group of 3+. (If you want to easymode the game however, play a Gunner.)"
TeraOnline,3cnz7v,O113,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:59:15 2015 UTC,"it can get grindy afaik, everyone can get the same armor its the same type of community you will find on any online game, there's ur a-holes and then there's those that are forgiving and friendly only the weapons glimmer when you enchant them past a certain point.  before i had elite, it was fucking huge and could be annoying to travel by horse(i was noob and poor, so i didnt/couldnt buy town teleport scrolls. with elite, you get a free map atlas letting you teleport to any major cities) berserker is good for beginners, tanky as fk and can deal some damage."
TeraOnline,3cnz7v,Caekie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:42:14 2015 UTC,"Oh and, for what it's worth, with experience boost (which, for a new player is equivalent to paying for the game), you'll hit max level at around 40 hours of gameplay.   I did gunner in rouhly 30, but I had extensive knowledge of the game and a pretty strong leveling route. You could probably do it in 20, but it'd be hard with first char to manage that."
TeraOnline,3cnz7v,Caekie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:23:42 2015 UTC,"GW2 Endgame and Tera endgame are pretty similar I feel. They both revolve around PvP on a large scale whereas some people take a liking to smaller scale PvP (3v3 areana's, duelling ring) etc. Of course you can always take the min-max route for endgame PvE and cap the crap out of your equipment which takes an immensely large amount of time and in game currency. Oppsies misunderstood what ""Legendary"" meant. No there are no unique or ""named"" items in Tera. Though if you wanted the best of the best you'd have to grind pretty hard to get it. It's just like any other game. You will have kids, trolls, adults and fedoras all in one amalgamation known as a community <3 Yes. Weapons when upgraded will have particle effects with varying colors dependent on what weapon set they are from. Skins can also have particle effects on them but I don't know any off the top of my head. The entire game is open world outside of visiting different ""provinces"" as I'd like to call them. There are no portals into different map zones like in GW2 but when entering a new area you will encounter a different aesthetic theme. Most beginner friendly class would be the Gunner atm. They're pretty faceroll cause they're OP but Bahsahkah is literally second to gunner in terms of PvE DPS. They're also very strong in PvP and overall easy to play. A good beginner class choice."

With its decent base damage, it is actually a reliable source of numbers rather than a regen skill. Besides, as a reaper you'll take a lot of damage from any endgame boss attack so relying on whipsaw to heal up isn't much of a safety net :P  Certainly don't leave out shadow burst, it can be a really good burst of damage if it crits, just don't focus on it as your most important skill."

And Even more so, even with 200+ crit rate a sorc can go an entire RG run with Fireblast critting only 2-3 times, which if you think about it, is terrible.  There was no reward for making the effort in the class compared to the other dps classes, even though the effort requires more work.  Yes the class is strong in PvP (it's a glass cannon dps, also easiest class to kill), but it was also TOO dependent on cc and healers.  The class could barely do anything on it's own.

However, the CDR is preferable over crit rate in PvP as it's not so much about being able to have rotations, but being able to have the skills to initiate or react whenever you need them, so CDR is a must."

The sooner your skills are back up the sooner you get back to doing damage. Plus, the 7.2% cdr helps your Sundering Strike keep up with Grim Strike during Shadow Reaping, since the majority of grim's animation is wasted time.

TeraOnline,3cmrh8,AuregaX,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:07:53 2015 UTC,Reaper is a class that is permanently cooldown locked so any CDR translates very directly into damage. Reaper did get a reasonable amount of cooldown reductions in the patch but the grim strike changes make it so you go through your rotation much faster and are still easily cooldown locked.

I think I sometimes see dps with purple circles too so if they would slow down dps that would be great.   Isn't the purple circle not actually aggro dependent? I was under the impression it was just an indicator of who the boss is (randomly) targeting for a secondary attack, so there's not way of 'taking' it as a tank, you either have to stun cancel his attack or hope the player iframes it."

If as dps by any random motive I get agroo, what I've been told, since always is"" go to the tank's side"". Good dps in end game dungeons will know how much their lancer can hold and will hold the dps so agro doesnt switch. Don't loose hope, not all dps in this game are brainless.

Boss is almost dead and your Balders will kill it or almost kill it. In addition to the above, its a waste to use it when the boss is not enraged and never ever use it at the start of the damn fight lol.

However, from the not so little amount of dps I've done, (+12 Gen Weap/Glove Reaper) it is also frustrating to cut back dps by a lot. I don't mind having to turn off Noct or to use stealth/stopping to drop aggro after shadow reaping or a big chain of crits. That is acceptable. What is not, is having to pause after every single chain even with Eclipse V.  Now I'm not saying this happens to you, but you asked for a dps' perspective and that is mine.  For some suggestions, I would recommend learning when each class spikes in dps. For example, you are most likely to lose aggro after a Gunners BV or AB, or when a Reaper lands Sundering Strike. Try and anticipate those rises in aggro and be prepared.  Ultimately, there is little you can do to change how dps play, but everyone can always change how they play."

TeraOnline,3ckl27,TheMantello,0,Wed Jul 8 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"A lot of things ""shouldn't"" happen. I need to know how to best handle it when they do happen.   Likely, dps dies and forgets to eclipse when ressed or it runs out mid fight. Buff bars too long, no time to watch out for it."
TeraOnline,3ckl27,ZonerRoamer,4,Wed Jul 8 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"If a dps pulls aggro and forgets to eclipse they should have the common sense to back off on the dps till aggro can be regained by the tank to avoid having the tank have to chase the boss across the map.  Some might say ""they just need to tank and hold aggro better"" but this, to me, is a bullshit sentiment as it's as much the DPS's job to lower their aggro as it is the tanks job to generate it."
TeraOnline,3ckl27,narium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"Continuing off of this.  Common sense for anyone who dies: recharm and repop consumables. For DPS, eclipse potion is extremely important. If the DPS forgets to pop eclipse potions and still complains about stealing aggro then the tank should stop running with a senseless DPS like that."
TeraOnline,3ckl27,ZonerRoamer,-7,Wed Jul 8 18:48:29 2015 UTC,"Eclipse potions are such a crutch, our group doesn't use them, and our dps use Canephora + Noctenium + Crit Scrolls etc. Though primarily have warrior tanks and I'm not exactly sure on the Aggro capabilities between the two, I think you're just popping your aggro CDs at the wrong time. Purple circles means the boss is targeting a skill at a player, it's completely random, people refer to it as secondary aggro, but it's not really ""aggro"". When the boss turns with actual aggro on another player is when you should pop your Aggro CDs."
TeraOnline,3ckl27,ZonerRoamer,5,Wed Jul 8 18:52:47 2015 UTC,"How are they a crutch? Lots of statics say they are essential consumables for dps, on the same tier as charms. They are extremely cheap and have no negative effect on DPS.   I mean, if your static tank can manage to keep 99% threat uptime on bosses without DPs using eclipse, its a waste, but most dps use them to keep the run smooth. I wouldn't discourage eclipse usage by any means."
TeraOnline,3ckl27,uui23,5,Wed Jul 8 19:47:37 2015 UTC,"Dont think you have that great DPS then, I main a pretty decent warrior tank myself and there is no way I will hold aggro against a +15 gunner that does 500k damage per sec without eclipse.  No eclipse is fine for upto +12, heck I even tank +12 DPS in my DPS gear because I will almost never lose aggro so might as well do more damage.  But tanking +14/+15 DPS who play their class well, without eclipse is not something that any experienced party is gonna do, even with a super OP tank."
TeraOnline,3ckl27,Seohyunism,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:41:36 2015 UTC,+15 Gunner is more like 900k DPS...  You can theoretically hold if your DPS aren't using eclipse but if they do use eclipse you can use DPS setup instead of aggro setup and do an extra 100k DPS.
TeraOnline,3ckl27,Angelicel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I tank a +15 gunner, and the one place I lose aggro is the damn fish since I have to block more overthere and he gets a nice stationary target with low crit resist.  Atm I do around 500k/s DPS with +13 in RG, will be funny if by +15 I actually do that much damage; even now I am carrying most runs on my damage alone xD"
TeraOnline,3ckl27,helpdiene,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:57:04 2015 UTC,"I play both warrior tank and gunner, both Gene weap+gloves; warrior is +14 and gunner is +13.  Now when I say that I dont wanna be at the other end of my own gunner trying to hold aggro, I mean it; that thing pulls aggro from all but an handful of tanks, and not once or twice, but at least 5 times per fight if im not slacking. In an average run, my gunner alone does 50-60% of the damage, even with pretty decent DPS in the party, exception ofcourse is better geared +14/+15 DPS since I am missing etchings, brooch etc, it routinely out DPSes them, but not by so much.  I have done entire SC/BRHM runs in which the tank almost never had aggro..  The fact is that among the hoard of gunners out there only a few that actually play the class well, the ones that dont play it well dont even realize it because it still does good damage no matter how its played, a well played gunner will make life painful for any tank; I tank a +15 gunner sometimes and I lost aggro at the fish more than a few times to him, against other +15 players I almost NEVER lose aggro, but not gunners.  What I do then I get aggro on my gunner is this:   Stop DPS, unless ofc its a shield phase or a free DPS phase like annihilation. If I am far from the tank, which I generally wont be, Ill use rocket jump to go behind the tank's shield, this means that the boss wont turn and the other DPS dont lose damage, also when the tank blocks I too get damage reduction if I am behind the tank. If I am close to the tank, I wait for the tank to shout or use ToB, if they get aggro back, give the tank a bit of breathing room before attacking again. If they dont get aggro again I go behind the tank to make sure the boss does not turn. Same at the start of any fight, give the tank 10 sec to build aggro before attacking.   In the end for a tank, the more OP the DPS is, the faster and harder you have to play too, it takes a while to get perfect at it, but successfully tanking some stupidly OP DPS is a good feeling."

If they use any more and you also have to use them. I generally talk to my dps and ask them what consumable they plan to use before i start the boss your dps are gonna use every inch they are given to keep dpsing and inturn you also have to use every single instance the boss is not hitting you too keep aggro. Like your dps, you must block only at the moment you get hit.   On a different note, I've read that you glyphed everything for aggro, how about for damage? spring barrage/wallop/sheild counter at the very least to be glyphed for damage."

TeraOnline,3ckjji,_alexrp_,5,Wed Jul 8 17:03:39 2015 UTC,the effect is changed. you should feel this when you play after the patch. it almost feels like scythe always crits now...  and i fucking love it ^
TeraOnline,3ckjji,blz187,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"Double crit rate: multiplies your base crit factor by two. This is the number on the left on the stats tab. Say your stats page says 50+100=150 crit factor. Now with the glyph, it becomes (50•2)+100=200 crit factor.   Crit factor is NOT crit percentage. Obviously having 200 crit factor doesn't mean that you'll crit 200% of the time. Crit chance, or percentage, is more complex. It's calculated from a formula that factors both your crit factor and the enemy's crit resist. From that formula comes out a percentage, a chance of critting.   Double crit chance: doubles the crit chance that the formula gave. If scythe is calculated to crit 30% according to the game's formula, the glyph would double this percentage to 60%."
TeraOnline,3ckjji,Swaay,5,Wed Jul 8 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like people are missing the point here. I know what the difference between crit rate and chance is.  The question is whether the effect of the glyph has actually changed with this patch. Going by the wording in the NA patch notes, the answer would appear to be no. On the other hand, Yosha's notes make it sound like the effect has changed, but this could just be ambiguous wording.  In other words... did it actually change from double crit factor to double crit chance, or has it always been this way, just with wrong description?"
TeraOnline,3ckjji,Yosha_TR,5,Wed Jul 8 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"The ""effect"" of the glyph has changed. That's it. I don't know why they worded it that way. I made the description clear as day and I'm correct.  There's quite a bit of missing info on Warrior as well. Like you can use Poison Blade to chain to Traverse Cut on my list compared to EME. Even I've proven it on KTERA myself and it works. But yeah."
TeraOnline,3ckjji,Yisery,2,Wed Jul 8 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. Thanks for the confirmation.  To be clear, the only reason I even started to doubt the wording in your class change list was this...confusing choice of words on EME's part."

TeraOnline,3ckjji,Kokumai,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"Tooltips in tera have always been inaccurate. You can tell whether a glyph gives you double crit rate or crit chance by simply casting it.  If it says ""Glyph of Keenness"" is affecting your abilities and a buff shows up in your buff bar that looks like a glyph and vanishes the moment you are done casting, it's a crit rate glyph.  If there is no such glyph effect to be seen and no message that something is affecting your abilities, it's a crit chance glyph.  Never trust descriptions in tera :'D"
TeraOnline,3ckjji,Ready_Able,-1,Thu Jul 9 10:30:20 2015 UTC,"That would be utterly stupid you see, because if your crit chance were 51%, you'd crit 102% of the time with a double crit chance glyph."
TeraOnline,3ckjji,Kokumai,0,Wed Jul 8 19:28:50 2015 UTC,Except you'd need like +500 crit to have a 50% crit in the first place
TeraOnline,3ckjji,Ready_Able,0,Wed Jul 8 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"You don't build a game with a ""nobody's gonna do dat lel"" mindset. Besides, that depends on the target's crit resist. Hit a low level mob and try not to crit."
TeraOnline,3ckjji,Kokumai,0,Wed Jul 8 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"Even if you somehow hit +500 crit, that doesn't even mean that it's good, it means you sacrificed a lot of stats- namely power-in order to achieve that crit, and the tradeoff does not necessarily mean increased DPS over an optimized and min-maxed build. Anyways, as of this patch, I don't even think it's possible to get +350 crit rate permanently (for it to be relevant), which is not even close to the +500 you're suggesting that would be 'game breaking.'"
TeraOnline,3ckjji,Yisery,-1,Wed Jul 8 21:09:10 2015 UTC,"I am sorry, you seem to be slow so I will slow down too.   We are not talking about whether stacking a ton of crit rate over power is good or not, nobody mentioned anything about optimization. I am holding you responsible for this:    Double crit chance: doubles the crit chance that the formula gave. If scythe is calculated to crit 30% according to the game's formula, the glyph would double this percentage to 60%.     You're the one who mentioned 500+ crit rate in the first place. I've said nothing about anything being game breaking. I've quoted you for something which is impossible and silly. One can not just double crit chance and hope it won't cross 50%. I even stated it nicely for you, crit chance CAN AND DOES in the game cross well over 50%, when you're attacking something with much lower crit resistance such as a mob a dozen levels below you. Even better, avatar weapons.   The gist of this discussion is that your idea of how the glyph works is fundamentally wrong. I do not even claim to know how exactly it works in the game, I am just providing logical arguments to why your supposed explanation of how it works is bollocks."

And from what I've heard, double crit factor glyphs just add your class's base crit onto the skill (so Scythe would get 52) and double crit chance glyphs roll twice for a crit (if both rolls fail, it's not a crit), effectively giving it a +25% crit chance)"
TeraOnline,3ckjji,Soleria,3,Wed Jul 8 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"If you are sure about rolling twice, then:  p - probability of critting  1-p = probability of not critting  (1-p)2 = probability of not critting with the ""double chance"" glyph  1-(1-p)2 = probability of critting with the ""double chance"" glyph  With 1-(1-p)2 = 1-1-2p+p2 = p(2-p) for simplicity and p=0.4 as you stated, it'd give 0.64 probability of a crit which is in line with what you said. Forget the +25% crit chance though, the % increase depends on your original chance to crit."

TeraOnline,3ckjji,Yisery,0,Wed Jul 8 20:24:36 2015 UTC,"Double crit rate means your character stat is multiplied by 2 when entering the crit chance formula. This is also sketchy because for example slayer glyphs only affect your class base crit rate rather than your gear bonuses. No clue how it is on warrior.  Double crit chance i honestly have no idea because the very notion of doubling crit CHANCE is stupid, you can end up with >100% crit time. The nuance is almost certainly either lost in translation or never properly explained. One quite possible variant is that your chance of not critting gets halved although I'm way too lazy to go and test it."

TeraOnline,3cili3,narium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:15:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, as I've mentioned in the guide: ====Hard Mode Specific===== Depending on which mural was glowing Yana will receive one of three buffs.   Sun: Yana will get a barrier and the screen will flash periodically,  Goddess: Yana attacks 30% faster and has 100% increased defense. Devil: The entire party receives a debuff which will cause instant death every 15 seconds if it is not cleansed and deals damage every 30 seconds.    The buffs you receive from properly aligning the tiles are the same as normal mode.  For the Party buffs: 1. Sun: Recover 3% HP per 5sec 2. Devil: Recover 100% MP every 15 sec 3. Goddess: 5% Defense"
TeraOnline,3cili3,Idi0ticGenius,2,Wed Jul 8 05:17:23 2015 UTC,"Yana getting the sun buff is pretty bad too, since that barrier takes a while to break and can prevent you from rotating the inner ring."

TeraOnline,3cili3,narium,2,Wed Jul 8 06:15:29 2015 UTC,Well to fill the bar you need to deal damage to Yana. Apparently dealing damage to Yana's shield does not count. So if you need to rotate twice you're pretty much screwed because the shield has some stupid amount of hp. It takes my group about a minute to break it.  Your screen only flashes once when Yana gets the sun buff btw.
TeraOnline,3cili3,Idi0ticGenius,2,Wed Jul 8 15:49:15 2015 UTC,Also the debuff you get from Yana getting the devil buff causes death in 10 seconds not 15.

I plan to run a CDR build since bd has such a short cd currently and any extra animation on dfa might be the difference between a poorly timed activation and a little extra grace on the iframe.  Crystals will likely be two threat, pounding and crit power vs. enraged, threat crystals in jewelry and hardy in armor.

TeraOnline,3cil28,irumaybe,3,Wed Jul 8 12:12:54 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that Atk. Speed is usually proposed for tanks to be able to do chains in between blocks. But with Cross Parry -> BD that shouldn't be a problem, as you can do Combative Strike -> TC -> Cross Parry -> BD now. CDR in turn gives: * More ToB's and that is our strongest threat builder. * DfA off CD more often and with longer animation compared to Atk. Speed build.     I've no idea how large percentage of our threat that ToB actually is, but I quickly compiled this: http://i.imgur.com/kkNhDvc.png"

Was in a pretty chill guild nothing serious, was friends with a cool guy that I spent 7h straight in sync dance talking about random shit. One of my fav things to do with him was to run ToT because it was a chill easy dungeon and you could make easy money like 600k with those badges just from 1 run. Nexus was chill too, the jewelry runs (LP ABNM and Ghille) had good drop rates and fast queue.  When the 65 patch hit they removed some of my favorite things. ToT, Nexus... Badges were not tradeable... RG had awful drop rates and it was annoying to run it twice. So I did like 11 BRNM runs and then stopped playing.

TeraOnline,3cke6c,Soleria,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:32:17 2015 UTC,"Gunner get 10%dmg nerfed in PVE meaning that they are not OP there anymore (once people got gear, without gear high crit rate makes them win since ideonal has moer power than crit).  For PVP, they lose a lot of damage, -10%base, -15%on AB (i dunno how much the reduce to hitting one does) which means flat out -25%damage.  I did not test it but i talked to gunners that told me their damage was like half now, not sure that i can believe that but it will be a lot less meaning overall less OP bad playing gunners. Good players will always be op in pvp, especially in CS with lots of bad players at their classes and a lot more bad overall players.  There will be another nerf in the future, gunner will be okay balanced which is fine and everybody can understand that a new class has to be kinda op so that it gets a solid playerbase."

BRHM It does one of the two, and to confirm which one it does, have the person with highest aggro to move around him (so that fulminar is not facing a person with highest aggro). 1. If fulminar doesnt turn to the person with highest aggro, it's same as BRNM. 2. If fulminar turns toward the person with the highest aggro, it's the pizza pattern. I don't know how to explain the safe spots, but you can just move in circle and iframe when you see orange warning flash. Then move to safe spot accordingly as it alternates.   If I try to explain though, it's like near fulminar's left middle toe and right inner toe;;; I think the shape is cut in 10 parts(?)."

TeraOnline,3cijav,Acerolion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:22:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure if it's directly front of back, but I just know that if you move slightly left or right from his front, you're on the safe zone. as a gunner, you should be able to roll. The best way to really dodge this pattern is to move circular and when you see orange flash, just roll to a safe side. What I do as lancer is to move in circles around Fulminar and backstep when I see a safe spot ahead or behind me. It might take a bit of practice, even if I'm experienced with more than 100 runs, I tend to mess up too."

So this is pretty much exactly 4xniveots and the ideonal2 set before even entering the dungeons.  Especially as a new player this helps a lot, the grp u get into will see niveots and the set and you will do more dmg, get geared faster.

Not everyone can grind 1k credits a day ""pretty easily"", especially without elite (as it is in your scenario). If the player is new (as they likely are, if they need to get idoneal2), then 1,800 worth of VC is a lot.  9 MWA boxes can be sold for over 5k gold in many servers. Some people might prefer running dungeons to farming Vanguard Credits.  Even without elite, you can easily run it twice or more a day using reset scrolls (very cheap atm).   If you combine the above points, it's easier to just run the dungeons to get fulminate (using reset scrolls), and save the VC for MWA boxes (to use or sell)."

TeraOnline,3cg2aw,j258d,0,Tue Jul 7 23:04:30 2015 UTC,I buy niveot structures. 100 a piece and the average is 3 niveots per 10 attempts. So in 1000 VG points you can get 1200+ worth of niveots. Less so now that I can just outright buy smart dyad structures with KS credits.
TeraOnline,3cg2aw,EndlessRambler,2,Tue Jul 7 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I feel like that is a bit of a gamble, however.  In TR server (Not sure about prices on other servers)   1000 VG = 5 MWA Boxes.  Last I checked, a single MWA box sold for 600g (buy-out). Although some fine niveots may sell higher, the avg price of most fine niveots was around 1,000g. So if on average you get 3 fine niveots from 1,000, you may not be making that much of a profit. The RNG factors involved here are:    a. You may not get 3 niveots (may get more, may get less) from 10 tries b. Niveots you get may sell for less than 1,000 (or more)"
TeraOnline,3cg2aw,rocketbears,2,Tue Jul 7 17:42:07 2015 UTC,That doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't you get MWA instead? Even with the worst box RNG (never open additional MWA as the bonus) each MWA box is like at LEAST 560 gold per 200 vanguard credits and often more. For 1k VG you get 2800 gold of MWA minimum that sells almost immediately or you can even use yourself.  You would not only have to maintain 3 niveots per 10 attempts but pray they are niveots that aren't super worthless and actually worth something to even come close to that.

TeraOnline,3cclyz,ESOprudishArmor,4,Mon Jul 6 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"There's an error on the gear 2 page, the attack speed calculation has an = rather than a >=, incorrectly calculating attack speed for weapons with enchantments > +12.  edit: Error on summary page, second defense calculation needs +B11."
TeraOnline,3cclyz,just_a_null,3,Mon Jul 6 23:13:36 2015 UTC,Thank you. Google Sheets updated.
TeraOnline,3cclyz,Garandou,3,Mon Jul 6 23:42:53 2015 UTC,"Mirakuru here, good job on the spreadsheet!  Eyeballing it there are a few errors I think.   Total Damage increase - this value is multiplicative. So if power gives you 10%, crit 10%, damage boost is 21% (1.1 * 1.1) not 20%. Attack, Added attack, Total % Increase (ATK) fields are showing > 100% increase. Should subtract 100% from it right?  Double crit chance glyphs not accounted for. Years after creating those DPS formulas, everything stays true except 1 fact. Double crit chance crit is calculated as 1 - (1 - X)2 where X is the crit chance for single crit rate."
TeraOnline,3cclyz,swiftstylus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:06:06 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, will do the math and see what it works out to be for different scenarios before committing it to the spreadsheet. I had it that way in the beginning before messing up some of the formulas, will probably do that in future, the amount increase is still the same, just a different way of wording it I suppose. I'll look into adding this in the future.   EDIT: Looked into 1 and 2, updated the spreadsheet."
TeraOnline,3cclyz,Garandou,2,Tue Jul 7 00:34:44 2015 UTC,"This has been done a few times over the course of Tera's lifetime, and maxing crit rate followed by crit power/overall damage is the best stat you can stack as a dps."
TeraOnline,3cclyz,swiftstylus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:03:41 2015 UTC,Crit power is actually the worst thing to itemize for PvE DPS.
TeraOnline,3cclyz,Garandou,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:57:21 2015 UTC,"once you have crit rate, if you can't up your overall damage, the only real stat left is crit power, but there are so few ways to actually do it after you have maxed crit rate, that you generally wont have space for it and overall damage"
TeraOnline,3cclyz,tbui,3,Tue Jul 7 08:10:11 2015 UTC,"At 50% crit chance (which is already an overestimation) 0.04 crit damage is worth less than 1 power... 0.3 crit damage is worth 7~ power, which sounds impressive until you realize enrage roll is worth like 25 power."
TeraOnline,3cclyz,LeylinTG,2,Tue Jul 7 08:41:22 2015 UTC,This actually seems really good
TeraOnline,3cclyz,LeylinTG,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:33:32 2015 UTC,"First let me state this is a SUPER helpful resource thank you so much!!!   Secondly, I hate the way you attempted to try to calculate DPS. There is no need to math it out from the ground up. Just start with a super basic question of how do you optimize DPS verse a single target who is not moving and compare a few rotation variants. All you need is average skill damage, cast time, and animation time. Most variables you worry about are a wash and it helps you answer simple questions. You can use your fancy formulas (especially regarding crit numbers) to help calculate DPS gains from building differently."
TeraOnline,3cclyz,LeylinTG,2,Tue Jul 7 00:52:47 2015 UTC,"There are a few problems with your statement. Although we can theorycraft the perfect rotation given our class it is nigh impossible to calculate the average damage given to a target unless you know the target's exact stats (for instance PvP.) All monsters enrage at a certain percentage of their HP and their defense is different as well as their crit resist.  In order to even begin calculating damage per skill you would have to dig through the game's database to find these values which we can't exactly do easily. As far as cast time and animation time the difference between different attack speeds is mostly personal preference, with how much ""leet deeps"" you can put depending entirely on your own ""skill"" executing the rotation as well as ping affecting how many actions you can push to the game per minute and how much you're willing to compromise damage output for smoother/faster rotations. The ""DPS"" counted in this spreadsheet is only a indication of which direction you should push your build towards due to minimum returns of certain stats,not exactly an ""ideal build calculator"".  TL:DR : there is too much we do not know about the game to use your methodology.  Nice to hear another person's opinion about this topic though."
TeraOnline,3cclyz,loneleh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:26:45 2015 UTC,That's actually not true. For most questions you want to answer in theory crafting DPS resists and other combat variables are a constant and do not matter.
TeraOnline,3cclyz,RaidenXT,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:21:11 2015 UTC,"Got a link or source I can use to try it out then?   Edit: a proper ""damage formula"" would be nice too"
TeraOnline,3cclyz,RaidenXT,2,Tue Jul 7 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"You don't need a source. Its logic. If you're interested in RELATIVE DPS between two builds most ""combat variables"" are a wash since they are constant in both conditions. What you are testing would be the effect of something like more casts of X at the cost of Y. The things you stated as being a concern only matter if you want absolute DPS, which doesn't help to answer meaningful questions."

My intentions are playing both DPS and Tanking as warrior, though preferably tanking, but I have about 130 ping. What rolls should I go for? Going for quick may not be such a good idea for me, because of latency killing more of the gain from the attack speed.  What are the possible rolls, for the lines below?   9.3% against enraged monsters  6.3% damage from behing  6% flat damage  7.2% cool down reduction  4.5%(?) attack speed  8.3% damage to the monster with highest aggro on you   With those I guess I should go 9% attack speed on the line above. Then flat 6% dmg, 7.2% CDR, and then what? 9.3% against enraged?"

TeraOnline,3ccbft,DSdavidDS,2,Tue Jul 7 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"So right now, I am an Archer who hit level 65 recently with Idoneal Gear (No enchants) from the level 60 story quest. I have been doing dungeons for ambit coins, so I have been slowly progressing towards that.    Now that there is a whole new set of equipment that you can get from the dungeons, does that mean I don't need and can't get any more ambit gear? What is the plan for the newer players (like me) with just Idoneal? As far as I know, the previous gear progression was Idonel -> Ambit -> Discovery -> Generation.    Another question: since there is new gear every 6 months, does that mean that the BiS will always be getting better and better?"
TeraOnline,3ccbft,CorrosiveFox,3,Tue Jul 7 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"Okay so since you're literally at the bottom gear wise you should probably fix your accessories first. Run RG and CW, and which ever new dungeon drops those lower tier ones. You want 3 crit and 2 power for these. Then start running BRNM. There's a stigma against archers but you should still be able to find nice people to teach you BR. In BR you want fulminate gear, which is basically idoneal 2. Once fully geared you're ready for newer stuff to get wroth (ambit 2). With wroth you have to enchant and masterwork (read as grind a lot) to get +12, but it makes getting schism (disco 2) easier. Finally, you grind a lot more for Lucid materials which is BiS.   Yes, BiS gets better every expansion but I wouldn't say expansions happen every 6 months. This is VM5 tier 7 and KTera is almost to VM9 tier 9 for some perspective."
TeraOnline,3ccbft,eruwaedhiel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"almost VM9?  wow.  Do you know how long it was between VM5, VM6, VM7 and VM8 for KTERA?"

TeraOnline,3ccbft,CorrosiveFox,3,Tue Jul 7 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"Nope. I've seen estimates of 3-6 months though. Just saw that their update for this month had tweaks for t7-t9 feedstock among other enchanting changes. OH. Lol I don't what I was thinking... They're at tier 9 gear, not VM9."

TeraOnline,3ccbft,LaRenaissance,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:58:35 2015 UTC,Odd. I could usually avoid attacks with it. I'm probably thinking just about ground AoA cause you can quickly chain reaping slash to death from above and extend your float time.

TeraOnline,3ccbft,LaRenaissance,2,Wed Jul 8 16:54:18 2015 UTC,It seems like kind of an obvious thing to make it a toggle-able option rather than just delete it completely tbh.

TeraOnline,3ccbft,irumaybe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:15:01 2015 UTC,It is my understanding at least that timescape will function much like Sky cruiser did.

TeraOnline,3ccbft,jNz94,2,Tue Jul 7 01:52:09 2015 UTC,This is what I want to know. They way they worded it that's a 90% addition damage nerf 45% total damage nerf to Double Shear. The fuck?
TeraOnline,3ccbft,Kana_and_Flan,0,Tue Jul 7 02:59:01 2015 UTC,Reduced additional damage (when used in chain) to 10 percent.  This means that the damage for a chained double shear is now 110% instead of whatever it was before.
TeraOnline,3ccbft,jNz94,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:52:20 2015 UTC,"It used to be 100%, so that was 200% damage. They dropped that down to 10%. That's a massive nerf to the skill."

TeraOnline,3ccbft,justdavidt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:36:17 2015 UTC,However; we are getting 2 class updates merged; so the skill damage has been reduced by 10% and then the 2 hits have been merged into one hit; so if you crit roughly 1kk + 1kk earlier; now you will crit 1.8kk but in a single hit.
TeraOnline,3ccbft,j258d,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:16:14 2015 UTC,"Do not know why you were downvoted, but base damage of second hit is 5120 now. So it does appear that it has been nerfed and merge to one hit."
TeraOnline,3ccbft,zumomaki,2,Tue Jul 7 13:43:34 2015 UTC,The 427 represents the damage the AB's flying ball projectile does when it passes through a target.  The 2nd number (the larger number) represents the damage from the explosion of the AB projectile caused by casting the skill again.  The latest patch reduced that explosion damage (the main damage of Gunners) by 10%.
TeraOnline,3ccbft,ZonerRoamer,0,Tue Jul 7 03:52:12 2015 UTC,"Is actually not that, AB has 3 dmg, the ball passing, and sometimes the explosion hitting twice. What they are doing is merging those two explosions hits into one (which is basically a buff, as sometimes the double explosion dmg doesn't happen, and now will always deal the dmg)"
TeraOnline,3ccbft,zumomaki,2,Mon Jul 6 22:07:50 2015 UTC,"Actually as long as you have your bot (HB-7) summoned, the double explosion damage always happens; the reason it LOOKs like it does not happen is that one of the damage numbers is perfectly on top of the other one; so you see only one damage number, but the combat log shows 2.  Why this is a buff though is that sometimes one of them didnt crit, now from what I see, AB almost always crits in Ktera for 3kk+ dmg. (With vm4 +14 or better weap)"
TeraOnline,3ccbft,ZonerRoamer,0,Tue Jul 7 07:41:49 2015 UTC,"Not always, I tried a couple of times with my gunner, and it was like 60% of the times, checked with the combat log, don't know why tho"
TeraOnline,3ccbft,mikolajkrupa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:53:20 2015 UTC,"Thats when the AB has hit something like a wall or an object before you detonated it; happens in GG if you detonate it too late, it does not detonate as the AB pulse has already hit something on the other side."
TeraOnline,3ccbft,Bigrook13,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:34:23 2015 UTC,"It was always double explosion as long as you had HB up, other than that - you're right."
TeraOnline,3ccbft,mikolajkrupa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:08:27 2015 UTC,The real nerf now is that HB can't do back rolled damage unless it's behind the boss with it's volley.
TeraOnline,3ccbft,Idi0ticGenius,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:32:37 2015 UTC,The real nerf now is that AB deals 50% less damage if not worse. In new instances it's less than I had on one explosion before patch.

TeraOnline,3ce6vm,candybac0n,4,Tue Jul 7 05:31:47 2015 UTC,"A little more detail on how you're fighting the monsters would be helpful. There are several things that come to my mind:   You're not actually blocking the moment the monster attacks. When the monster is about to attack, that's when you should be blocking (holding right-click). If you are blocking, you may be blocking in the wrong direction. The damage dealt by the monster is seeping through your block. This shouldn't be happening though since the gear you get should be good enough to block all of the damage.   This is just what comes to my mind; I could be entirely wrong and that you are playing the class correctly.  (small edit because I'm anal about spelling and grammar)"
TeraOnline,3ce6vm,MeepMoops,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:56:22 2015 UTC,Also make sure you're using an avatar weapon. It shouldn't take so long to kill something that you're losing half health.

TeraOnline,3ce6vm,Khanage_,2,Tue Jul 7 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"MeepMoops gave a good little guide on how to block correctly as a lancer, and chances are (s)he's more qualified to answer your questions than I am seeing as mine is currently only level 42.   Aside from that, I feel there's a chance that blocking incorrectly isn't the issue here but possibly blocking a little too much. When it comes to fighting a lot of monsters early on in tera (and especially on the tutorial island) most of the attacks are either dodgeable or negligible in terms of damage. I'll admit what I'm saying isn't necessarily good practice, nor what you probably want to hear considering the class you chose, but maybe you should try being primarily on the offensive when fighting monsters."
TeraOnline,3ce6vm,HeyQtpie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:09:38 2015 UTC,"Blocking is important. Also, to learn when to block you need to get used to attack patterns, which will take some time. You also need to have your cross hair pointed on the monster as you block to actually block it.  Learn to block cancel. YouTube it real fast. Easier to learn that way then just try it out for yourself.  Do instance matching starting at level once lvl 20, cuz you kill stuff way too slow and mobbing things your level usually ends with you at low hp. Soloing BAMs your level takes a long time."
TeraOnline,3ce6vm,Spiffymooge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:01:52 2015 UTC,oh nah. soloing anything with a lancer is a no no. once you hit level 20 its purely dungeons till 65. also Practice blocking and try soloing Basilisk once you get an avatar weapon.

TeraOnline,3ccmvo,13moonsago,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:02:59 2015 UTC,"Doing story quests net you boosts, consumables, inner wear and more importantly extra gold.  Most story quests are simple gopher quests that lead up to an instance so the only real loss is the amount of exp you're missing out on is time spent traveling."
TeraOnline,3ccmvo,Bigrook13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:52:11 2015 UTC,"Imo do the stories, because they give a nice amount of exp too, like usually it is 2 or 3 dungeon runs worth of exp as a reward for completing the story quest in the dungeon.  You may think its faster to just purely do dungeons and not caring about story, but I think you'll get more out of it, if you do the story quests too.  Another reason to do story quests is that they give a good bit of money, which you can use to buy gear or crystals or whatever else you might need while leveling.  Avatar weapons should be upgraded if you use them, because it makes a difference in how fast you complete stuff. Even if you outlevel them fast, it's worth it for the extra stats. Besides, once you're done using them, you just make them into feedstock and use them to enchant your next weapon. In that way, you're not losing a whole lot on enchanting them, besides the alkahest(which don't cost a whole lot anyway)."
TeraOnline,3cbdp9,BigBallsBitesBack,5,Mon Jul 6 16:19:20 2015 UTC,"Leveling is kind of a joke right now. You get an Avatar weapon at level 20 that outclasses every other weapon in the level range and continue to receive them until level 62. You can go story quests, but you will out level them (until 60, when you are required to do the quest line outside of Velika and it takes you to level 64), but it's generally agreed that soloing 5-man dungeons (avatar weapons are pretty good) is the fastest, then BAM grinding, then grouping for the dungeons.  While it is possible to ""buy"" gold by trading EMP, it would cost near $2000 to buy the gold to purchase a top tier set of gear (full +15, not just weapon which would run you around $500). But that isn't to say spending real money is at all required, it's just that the top end gear represents a huge concentration of resources and so is worth lots of gold - few to no people actually buy it (with the emp->gold->gear conversion) with cash (and, in doing so, buy it off of somebody who made it in-game since the cash shop helps very little if at all).  Remember to always enchant your avatar weapon to +9, get new gear (dungeons help here), and to get into a guild for end game content.    Edit: given that you're playing lancer, do queues for the dungeons instead, they'll complete almost instantly (usually).   Edit 2: despite the laughable ""ability"" to purchase gear, even if one takes that route they still need to play skillfully- this is a very, very skill dependent game."

Race is almost 100% a matter of preference. Elin moves slightly further with the first auto attack, improving their ""skating"" (a movement technique where you start a combo attack and then cancel with block and repeat), while High Elf male has a slightly faster Shield Barrage, a CC move. Those differences only really matter for completely top-end pvp, though."

TeraOnline,3cbdp9,TheMantello,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:26:59 2015 UTC,"Is this game's leveling system a quest based or grind based system?   Can do either. Grind is faster atm and you can reach max level in half a week even without boosts as a new player.   Can i still do well in PVE/PVP/Raids without spending cash on this game?   It's easy to obtain good gear without spending a dime for PvE. Unequalized PvP requires you to be +15 (hard for new players) to be competitive, but there are a lot of equalized battlegrounds. Essentially you can PvP without any gear because of that.   What are the tips/techniques you would tell your former self when starting out with TERA online?   Get to max level ASAP. Nothing during the leveling phase is important apart from enjoyment.   Note: I decided to play Lancer. I always love tanking class but tend to change class because they are the most gear intensive class in a game.   In terms of speed runs, DPS is the most gear intensive class in this game (better gear = faster runs), healers are the least (just need enough gear to not die). In terms of just clearing content, player skill is the predominant factor for all roles."

Lancer is a very good class in both PvE and PvP and the gear isn't all that money intensive until really end game which even then isn't that high if you learn how to make a decent amount of cash.

TeraOnline,3cbdp9,Soleria,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:15:37 2015 UTC,"Quest, grind mobs or BAMs, or run dungeons.  All are viable depending on your preference.  Since you want to play a Lancer, grinding's not going to be something you really want to do (low DPS).  Dungeon running is probably going to be your best bet as a Lancer and do the storyline quests while in the queue. Yep.  The game's pay structure just makes doing some things faster.  Elite status is very worth it (my opinion), but can be purchased with in-game gold if you're good at making it. Save your ""elitefreedays"" code for the level 60-65 sprint.  You get double gold on an elite account and that chain gives tons of it so you'll have a good chunk to start with.  Use all your production points in some way to generate some income (might as well not let it go to waste) - you can do this passively by queueing something to craft and go AFK.  Be patient with buying high ticket items and save some gold by negotiating with people to get a lower price - negotiating even for the same price they're asking for saves you the 10% ""buy now"" price (it's a gold sink) and costs them nothing.   Edit:  I knew I forgot to mention something.  Since you chose a Lancer, it's not as gear intensive starting out as one might initially worry about.  A good Lancer can usually tank quite well even undergeared for many dungeons and the process of dungeon running will feed you lots of armor anyway (everyone loves a good Lancer so finding groups is no problem).  Dungeon running is very profitable, so you can buy any gear that doesn't drop for you.  Carry a stack of Eclipse potions (they reduce threat generated) to give out to your group if you find that aggro is a problem with overgeared DPS."

Your characters' levels are easy to achieve, so you can choose to re-level on a different server and be back where you are in a relatively short amount of time.   If I were to level on a different character, whats the faster way to level?   You can follow the levelling guide on TeraToday, which mostly prioritises killing mobs/enemies rather than doing quests. You can certainly use the Instance Matching (aka Dungeon Finder) and queue for a level-appropriate dungeon while you're out and about.   It kinda seems like it would be pretty hard to solo these, or are they easier when its just you?   Once you have a level-appropriate Avatar weapon upgraded to +9, you should have no problem soloing most low-level dungeons. Of course, have 4 extra sets of hands help speed things along.   Is there any benefit to soloing vs matchmaking into dungeons? Aside from the wait time of matchmaking anyway.   You get to keep all the loot!   On my way to level 40 I did minimal gathering and zero crafting of any kind. Am I going to be behind on something I should have kept up on now? Or is it pretty easy to just jump into it at any time?   I'd suggest keeping your gathering skills up-to-date and eventually reach their respective skill caps. This allows you an easy and profitable dump of PPs (Profession Points used for gathering and crafting that replenishes automatically with time) and a free row of inventory space. Crafting of any sort is expensive and - barring Alchemy - do not provide any benefits to your levelling experience. Once you hit 65 and have a comfortable set of gear, going back to level a crafting skill is more affordable than at lower levels."

TeraOnline,3cdmcz,Ommageden,3,Tue Jul 7 02:20:47 2015 UTC,"As for what abilities to focus on, they're all pretty useful in their right situations. Spring attack is the strongest damaging move but its animation takes forever, don't use it without chaining it off of shield barrage. Don't forget to use debilitate on bosses, cast iron will whenever you can. Onslaught is trash actually, too much mana for too little damage. The aggro shout and shield counter both give decent amounts of resolve, use those if you have resolve problems.  IMO it's really important to rebind your unused action bar slots to keys like Q, E, R, T, and ZXCV. Also you can bind slots to shift+buttons. My lancer has shield barrage on Q, spring attack on R, and wallop on E. Those are the most used damaging moves so they should have easy binds. I have leash on 1 and master leash on shift+1, I like to pair similar moves on one key like that. A good rule to follow is to put moves with lowest cooldowns on the easiest keys."

TeraOnline,3cdmcz,FrostOX9,2,Tue Jul 7 18:42:41 2015 UTC,"Here's a look at my bar.  I move with WASD, and bind all of my abilities on the letter keys around those four. I find it a lot easier than using the number row and Function key row.   Shield Barrage is my most used ability, and I have it on my T key. I usually use the combo skill button (Mouse 5 for me) to chain into Spring Attack, and then Wallop with F or Debilitate (V) into Wallop (F) or Lockdown Blow (R).  Your main combo will be Shield Barrage x2, Spring Attack, (Debilitate if stacks aren't maxed) and then Wallop, followed by Lockdown Blow off CD. You most likely won't get the entire combo off, so don't worry about hitting the entire combo. Wallop can be combo'd into by a lot of abilities, so you shouldn't be using it without comboing it first.   I would recommend not binding Leash to Q like I have, but I'm so used to it at this point that it would be a hassle to switch."

TeraOnline,3cd8ka,tsunkendere,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:25:57 2015 UTC,Well step one you're going to have to probably pay a hefty gold price for a Disc 2.0 recipe. They start out being pretty expensive with the new patch because the supply of them is really low.  Only plan on going into Disc 2.0 if you actually have a hefty amount of gold already - because you're going to have to be buying mats and recipes for higher prices in order to sell weapons for the very high prices. Honestly I think it will end up taking you a while unless you can outbuy the people with an excessive amount of gold who will be buying at high prices to turn out even higher profits.
TeraOnline,3c9jpv,cosmicteddybear,10,Mon Jul 6 03:54:47 2015 UTC,"Did you jump into the pile of rocks in one of the open rooms? If so, holy hell I guess that bug report went nowhere. I didn't normally report clips, but this one was so easy to stumble onto that I felt I had to.  I have a story from this area. A friend and I stumbled into this clip by accident a couple years ago. I was waiting for her to come back and I was jumping around in this area when I found a big-ass hole in the collision and fell through. When she finally came back, we decided to go explore that instead of grinding dull fucking quests. We actually spent quite a bit of time down there, I mapped out a bit of it and tried to figure out how the game actually worked based on what I was seeing.  It was also the first time either of us got stuck in the ""void"". We found a mostly empty area with two thin black towers where the floor wasn't solid. We both eventually fell out of this area and into the empty area under the map. I jumped for a bit until eventually taking a scroll back. She jumped for a lot longer, and that's when we discovered that if you go too far out of bounds, teleportation stops working. Couldn't use scrolls, couldn't use Velik's Horn, couldn't use unstuck.  My first idea was that she wasn't actually in a ""real"" zone, and that teleportation required you be in a real zone or the teleportation just can't work due to a programming quirk. I never did find out if that would work, because it seems like the only way to ""leave"" the cave is to leave it properly through an entrance or warp. Otherwise, you're still on that map outside of any real zone, even if you should be under a different map, meaning the world isn't continuous. No idea if that's accurate, but that's how it seemed to work.  Then I went on a quest to try to convince a priest to help us, going to the zone and having them use the party summon to bring her back. Turns out, that also doesn't work, just like all the other teleportations. We actually met at the town nearby and fought our way back to the room with the pile of rocks to try it. Though we did end up doing some dungeon runs with that priest later.  So, we had no choice but to turn to the GMs. And that was the first time we required the assistance of a GM to extract one of us from an out of bounds area, though definitely not the last. I wonder if the GMs had a list of serial explorers who need regular rescuing from underneath the world.  That is one of the coolest out of bounds areas we found though. It's hard to tell from the screenshots, but the black structures are massive. It's also pretty mysterious. There are different ""floors"" you can reach which I think are related to loading zones in the rooms above. The ghost mobs are definitely from the rooms above as well. We never did get a chance to test how the ghost mobs acted when somebody was interacting with the real ones."

That being said, if getting PK'd really bothers you, you have 1 of 2 options:   switch to a lower channel. since channel 1 is the default channel whenever you zone into an area, it's of course the most populated for every zone as a result. Accordingly, this is also where 99% of PKers looking to 1 shot lowbies will reside. swapping to a lower channel will dramatically lower your chances of being PK'd. Roll on a PvE server, where there's no outlawing period   I personally also agree with the concept that PKing lowbies should come with at least some sort of penalty, but unless BHS decides to rework infamy and outlawing, i dont see that happening.  E: Don't get me wrong by the way, open world PvP is really fun in this game, even though it's a shit show. My post is directed exclusively at people who just 1 shot lowbies repeatedly, which is really detrimental to the playerbase."

TeraOnline,3cdl4b,stkj,3,Tue Jul 7 04:05:39 2015 UTC,"not sure why you were downvoted, but the penalties for attacking players with significantly lower levels is pretty bad. you only get infamy which can be ""worked off"". honestly, i enjoyed the open world PvP that runescape had prior to everyone crying. if you died, you would lose all except 3 of your items; if you were skulled(being that you attacked someone/initiated the fight) you would lose all your items. this was great incentive to avoid being pked or avoid dieing. in Tera, i think it would be a good idea to implement a gold loss penalty equivalent to the infamy gathered, each time you die. the reason for this is because, usually, people with infamy are usually way higher levels/alt toons with a bank account containing valuables and a significant amount of gold. yes, they could easily make 500-2k gold back quickly, but then you have those that just camp lumbertown and 1 shot ppl repeatedly(usually new players who are uninformed about the option to switch channel and may end up giving up, hence the banning/kicking of trolls during the initial steam release)"

Even in a party, you can't do anything about high-level PKers. I don't understand them. Just run or change channel. You can run instances instead if you're sick of getting killed in the open world.

TeraOnline,3cbd06,Rui_Idol,9,Mon Jul 6 16:14:04 2015 UTC,Warrior/Sorcerer/Mystic Are the most challenging classes.
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Soleria,2,Mon Jul 6 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"I don't completely agree with you. For PvP, this is mostly correct but in PvE, Mystics and Sorcs are indeed the hardest classes to play, but Warrior, not so much. I have played  Warrior endgame and staying alive as a Warrior is so easy. The Reaping Slash mechanic not consuming edge is something to keep in mind, but that doesn't make them the hardest. The ""most challenging"" class replacing the Warrior for PvE should be Archer. Archer requires a lot of practice and knowledge of the class to play, and even then their DPS is subpar. To truly shine as an Archer you really need a LOT of skill and practice. Though I don't know how easy Archer is PvP  Disclaimer: I haven't played Archer endgame myself, but This Guy has and he knows so much of his class I'm going to trust him on his word. He completely changed my view on the class and I'm sure many others think so too."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Lato57,7,Mon Jul 6 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"If staying alive is the only criteria to judge then lancers, warriors, healers (including mystics) and gunners would all be considered extremely easy. I think a better gauge of class difficulty is the ability to consistently function at 90% theoretical maximum for their role.  Surviving PvE with any class apart from sorc isn't even remotely difficult. So for DPS classes the next in line is rotation difficulty, and warrior rotations are so complex it's even difficult to theorycraft for them."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Garandou,3,Mon Jul 6 16:43:48 2015 UTC,Surviving PvE with any class apart from sorc isn't even remotely difficult   Sure. Try Berserker in SCHM while dealing top dps and say that again.
TeraOnline,3cbd06,SmithieWerben,2,Tue Jul 7 11:49:14 2015 UTC,"If staying alive is the only criteria to judge then lancers, warriors, healers (including mystics) and gunners would all be considered extremely easy.   As you've pointed out, it is not the only criteria, but it is certainly a very important one.   Survivability adds on a heavy notch to difficulty. Making mistakes on a Gunner is forgiving (after all, Heavy Armor, long, seamless iframes, and extremely strong passive regen) while making mistakes on a Mystic or Sorcerer can get you killed in two shots.  Doing damage is a DPS's primary role, but dying certainly makes the job difficult."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,cloudy_rendezvous,2,Mon Jul 6 18:36:37 2015 UTC,"The thing about mystics, is they don't have that many panic buttons and to hit with their skills might take a bit more practice compared to a priest. This is just from a pve perspective, but healing as a mystic will certainly be harder than priest. You don't have the four healing circles (regen circle, burst, healing circle and immersion) and your cleanse is lock on, unlike the priest. Your team needs to know that they should pick up your red and blue orbs and need to know where they are. you also have several pets at your disposal, which are very situational.  from having leveled almost all the old classes to 60, I'd definitely say that mystic was the hardest to be ""good"" with.  Sorcerer is not an easy class either though, you're heavily reliant upon your target standing still or not moving much, to get your full damage off, they have/had (when i leveled it) a far heavier mana usage than most other dps classes, which makes them need to take breaks to use their regen ability, something most other dps classes don't have to.  Warrior and archer are both fairly hard. Warriors need to keep building edge and if they lose their stacks, have to start over in building them, which can be a pain.  Archers had to stand closer to their target when using their charged abilties to maximize their dps. For a long time, they didn't any real aoe either, which made them incredibly bad for pve. In pvp they have always shined though, at least from what i remember."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,cerb20,2,Mon Jul 6 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"Archer range limits don't effect your charged arrow dmg now. But staying close does up your dps as you'd be Able to do your grounded traps, kicks, and breakaway more often. The hardest part of an archer is positioning and survivability. Double ""get back"" on perimos screws over a lot of people, archer being one of them.   Source: all classes at 65 with most in disco/better + did endgame dungeons."

On paper what you said is basically true, but in practice... staying 2-3 steps ahead of those 10 cooldowns, while also accounting for randomness in your own resets + the boss mechanics is not easy to make fluid.  Doing ""mediocre"" warrior dps is easy, just blade draw as often as you see the cooldown is up and scythe when you see a big fat red bar on your screen, but don't expect to wow anyone with that."

If you get used to aiming, it's just a matter of basic combos and knowing when to use them. The reason why Archer is so broken in PvP is because their stagger -> stun combo is so damn easy to pull off and so low cd that it's super reliable in every situation. They also are able to follow up on pressure in team battles very easily with their long ranged KD/stuns/minimal set-up damage.  Their instant ranged staggers and low cd, somewhat long duration stun-kick, and low cd slow-arrows are what makes them so hard to punish, yet still incredibly rewarding to play.  Oh, and not to mention that their ridiculously OP Feign Death is actually bugged and regens 40% HP over 8 seconds, which is supposed to end in combat but doesn't (in PvP), on a 48s cd."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,cloudy_rendezvous,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:39:22 2015 UTC,"I dont completely agree with you either, considering warriors are extremely attention dependent, very timing, situational timing dependent, the entire class is based off of chaining skills back to back non stop and prioritizing certain combos over others due to procs on Blade Draw etc, and boss animation, dodging timing, repositioning, constantly moving to stay behind target. Timing backstab as to not waste etc etc, Theres endless things to say about this class to write it off so easily.  You may be saying its not hard because you are so used to it, but compare any other class to the warrior besides mystic sorc and its a joke.  To maximize DPS as an archer will take alot of skill granted, but same goes for a warrior... you make one mistake, and you have to compensate huge. Whereas most other classes have alot more room for margin of error.  As for utility, the warrior has TONS thats for sure, but its all needed to maximize the potential for the class, they are not luxury utilities to waste.."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Sake3838,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"boss animation, dodging timing, repositioning, constantly moving to stay behind the target.   You just explained it yourself, because guess what, the Archer also has to take this into account. The only difference is that the Archer doesn't have 3 rolls back to back, DFA, Rising Fury, Leaping strike, and Charge to reposition. Archers can only cast Backstep and Breakaway bolt to reposition. You can say that Archers are safer because they are far up to the boss, but that isn't true. There are quite some mechanics for ranged DPS as well, and besides, good Archers play in melee range too because some of their important skills are melee.    you make one mistake, and you have to compensate huge.    Again you're explaining stuff against your point. Because Archers have so little mobility, the room for error is small. Add to that point that Archers have smaller defense than Warrior, and your point is completely invalid. If you are playing any class with no attention, you're bound to be a shit DPS."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Lato57,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"The only difference is that the Archer doesn't have 3 rolls back to back, DFA, Rising Fury, Leaping strike, and Charge to reposition.   When an archer is charging arrow and walks behind the boss physically, the DPS loss is zero. When a warrior rolls behind a boss, the DPS loss exists because roll does no damage and has an animation time. People act like repositioning has no cost for warriors, but the cost is actually huge. Classes like zerk can walk around and charge their attack while repositioning at the same time. Counterintuitively they actually don't lose DPS during repositioning unlike warriors despite having seemingly lower mobility.  Every time I roll as a warrior, I'm guaranteed to lose at least 1 combative strike (2500 skill damage if including scythe starting today) of damage. That's why the whole roll roll roll thing for evading damage might sound easymode, and it is, if you're a noob and don't want to actually do damage."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Garandou,2,Mon Jul 6 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Archers are not a ranged zerk so they are losing dps by charging. They don't charge skills 24/7, they have a lot of other skills too which allow no movement. The kit of an Archer isn't based around charging.  Another thing is that the boss might suddenly turn on you when you're just about to release a charged shot, in which case you're losing DPS yet again.   You can say that with overcharging as an Archer, you allow yourself some positioning, which is true. But that doesn't mean you should always overcharge. The guy I linked explains well that Archers have a lot of other things that they can do instead of overcharging. However, this doesn't mean Archers shouldn't overcharge at all, but only in said situation for repositioning.  I can approve of what you say, there is DPS loss in repositioning as Warrior, but's smaller than DPS loss as an Archer repositioning, as they don't have as many ""quick"" reposition tools as a Warrior."

Every class loses DPS from this...   You can say that with overcharging as an Archer, you allow yourself some positioning,    All I'm saying is archers have tools (ie charging) to reposition without DPS loss.   I can approve of what you say, there is DPS loss in repositioning as Warrior, but's smaller than DPS loss as an Archer repositioning,    There are 3 important scenarios   Boss immobile - reposition irrelevant Boss constantly rapidly turning 180 degrees - warriors deal with this better Boss hypermobile - e.g. fish BRHM, archers have an easier time because of range   Scenario 2, 3 also quite irrelevant with a tank."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Garandou,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:54:37 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that archers lose an ass load of dps when they suddenly have to cancel their charge in order to backstep away from an attack, assuming releasing the charge and animation cancelling with FS would kill you."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,xSetsuko,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:27:19 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that archers lose an ass load of dps when they suddenly have to cancel their charge in order to backstep away from an attack   Every class is like that... Realistically how often does that happen with a tank? When playing melee classes you have to waste time dodging every single attack. When playing range classes you don't deal with many skills at all.   Take BRHM tank run for example, the only thing archers have to dodge at turtle is yellow circle. At fish they only have to dodge mp drain. At fulmy just debuff circle. Melees on the other hand have to dodge most of the turtle's kit, deal with fish bodyslam every 2 seconds and dodge everything from fulmy.   Sure in tankless runs sorcs and archers suffer, so I won't deny they're harder in those contexts. This game isn't designed for tankless though.  If you're going to be a crappy DPS I think surviving on an archer is easier than a warrior, just because you can stay far away and essentially ignore everything. If you're going to be a good DPS, both classes are penalized for the boss moving, but since you're good, surviving is a non-issue in both cases."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Garandou,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:41:16 2015 UTC,"You're assuming that Archers are actually playing at range, which is not true. A good Archer will play mostly in melee range, because they need to cast CQ, Explosive Trap and Breakaway Bolt. Now, all other melee classes have multiple dodges, and Archer doesn't, which makes the room for fuckups smaller. One mistimed Backstep and you're dead, because Breakaway Bolt will mostly be used offensively because of the Powerlink glyph"
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Lato57,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:12:39 2015 UTC,"TBH, after playing a ranged DPS (gunner) recently, in my personal experience its A LOT easier to survive as a ranged class.  Simple example; avoiding Darkans Flame in SCHM takes effort on my warrior, paying attention when he will do the single back swipe, and iframing perfectly for that and the double back swipes too.   On my gunner; I just stand and lay down the damage with burst fire while Darkan does that stupid long double back-swipe animation.  Archer I run with and me die the least because we dont get the debuff and can just walk out of the bomb; while on my warrior if my charge is on CD, many times I dont even have time to do RF + Pounce before i get killed..  Funnily enough the one thing that never kills me on war, kills me on the gunner, the annihilation thingy; gunner walks so slow that she can never walk out in time lel.  I agree that archer having only one iframe is an annoyance; but they dont have to dodge as much as melee classes. Now the poor zerk with 1 iframe is a bigger problem."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:13:21 2015 UTC,"Avoiding darkans flame is even harder as sorc. To do good dps you need to be in range to use nova which puts to you in rage of the backswipe. Sorc has 3 skills that will lock you in animation to get hit. Fireblast, nova, and flaming barrage. All 3 are a critical part of the sorc dps rotation. Oh and you have to use glacial/tele/backstep to dodge it. Warp barrier still gets you burned because reasons."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,narium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:12:23 2015 UTC,I can agree with you. If Archer was so easy to play as people say I don't know why are there sooo many bad Archers (at least in EU).   I think Archer is pretty good if you use it at the maximum potential but of course still RNG dependent. I myself have a 20319 score in RG with a Mystic and a Slayer.

I am not sure if I'm not playing the Mystic right for groups, (I use the mana buff, I drop balls around, I've read the guides etc etc), I'm only 59, so no boomerang yet.   Well, anyway, I'd have to say, Mystic is most difficult."

And I don't know how many times I had to type the phrase ""FYI, I'm not dropping all these motes because I'm bored, they heal you for quite a bit""... still people refuse to pick them up in many cases."

For example- berserkers are incredibly easy to play in pve, essentially you self buff and the rotation is fairly static. However, berserker in pvp is among one of the most challenging to play (well) as it has many nuances and requires lots of finesse. That being said, most classes in pve are easy so I'd base difficulties almost purely on the pvp context."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,TorrentRage,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"Mystic is probably the hardest class. Followed by sorc when you are in a hard dungeon, and warrior overall.  Sorcs have had their quality of life improved substantially and now have more than 1 iframe, but they used to have a very hard time if a dungeon was hard.  Warriors are hard in easy dungeons because getting their full out dps to compare to the others is incredibly hard when the other classes don't have to worry. When in a hard dungeon, a warrior actually has an easier time due to iframes that can be used in a row. On the other hand a warrior has less iframes per minute than slayer and reaper and gunner (roll reset)."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Mouse1223,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"The hardest classes to play based on the character creation screen is Warrior and Mystic. This rating is only partially true, Warrior dps is an easy class however warrior tanking is some what hard to learn as you don't have an easy way to regain resolve like you do with a lancer. The skill cap on tanking on a warrior (lancer to a lesser extent) is probably the highest in the game and most difficult for NEW players to learn. They have however made it slightly easier then it use to be.  The reason that Mystic is a hard class to play is it relies on your team to understand the fight. Mystic's don't offer any defensive buffs and doesn't have the ability to really heal carry bad teams. Also the red mote is misunderstood by the majority of the player base, you don't eat more then one every 5 seconds or your wasting them.  just my two cents."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Garandou,-2,Mon Jul 6 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"Sorc > Warrior > Mystics > Lancers > Priest > Slayer = Reaper =  Archer >>> Gunner IMO  Zerk depends on what instance you're running. Can be quite challenging if the boss requires high mobility and a lot of iframing. But they're generally quite easy for most instances.  This rating is for PvE. I don't believe PvP difficulty ratings because it's highly context based. For example to play 1v1 berserker has a steep learning curve, but they're actually not too difficult to play in CS as an assassin."
TeraOnline,3cbd06,Spiffymooge,2,Mon Jul 6 16:20:53 2015 UTC,Why is Lancer rated so high? It's a very simple class. The longest learning curve is when to block cancel and aiming leashes.

Also pretty sure thats PvE difficulty and outdated.  In 1v1 PvP the hardest class is either Berserker or Sorcerer depending on your specific playstyle, for me, it's Sorc, I don't usually play ranged classes so it just feels weird. Both are strong though. The easiest class however is D-Warrior.  In mass PvP I would say Lancers are one of the harder classes, that said people who are new to Warrior would also say A-Warrior is hard.  In PvE Mystics are the hardest class. PvE difficulty is different from PvP because it's based off the dungeons difficult, so mobility is a big thing, and for Mystics it's just hardest to do their job + survive over other classes, and the nerfs coming soon aren't going to make it any easier."

TeraOnline,3c9iak,Goldrush453,14,Thu Jul 9 10:05:21 2015 UTC,"For one, I enjoy the art design the best out of all the MMOs I've seen. It's a great mixture of realism and fantasy. Games like WildStar and WoW are too cartoony for my tastes, I just can't take the game seriously enough to spend a lot of time on it. Black Desert and GW2 have great art too, but it doesn't have the ""breathtaking"" atmosphere Tera has. The environment is too realistic in a sense that there is nothing to jog the imagination. I could watch an action movie or some Discovery channel and it would look like something from one of those games. In other words: seen it before.  As for the rest of the game being lacking... I hear this most often from people who have never played MMOs or simply don't like MMOs. The gameplay is essentially the same. WoW, WildStar, EVE, GW2 may do some things differently, but not by much, and not necessarily in a better way IMO. If I'm going to be doing the same stuff in all of these games, I want to do it in an atmosphere I enjoy, and with a character I enjoy watching."

Dismantling items for feedstock, UI inconsistencies,  settings that reset upon closure of the item / game.   New character designs are limited to a race / sex because they're too difficult to program for the others?  No that's lazy and cutting corners.   The things people put up with in the game are absurd,  but maybe that's just a testament to how good the combat really is?"
TeraOnline,3c9iak,Svri,6,Mon Jul 6 11:03:58 2015 UTC,"New character designs are limited to a race / sex because they're too difficult to program for the others? No that's lazy and cutting corners.   Its not programming. Its rigging and animating the 3D models. TERA moreso than other games because each class/race/gender has different animations for all their skills.  Lets say..Warrior's Evasive Roll. That one skill requires the animations and rigging to be done 16 times over because male and females of each race have different animations. Repeat this for however many skills the classes has, attack swings, other shit unique to the class..  I can understand why they choose to limit race and gender to class. Its really time consuming. The budget isn't inexhaustible and you don't have unlimited art department staff."

TeraOnline,3c9iak,Svri,2,Mon Jul 6 12:55:12 2015 UTC,Also they restrict it to a race/sex cause people being more likely to spend money on a female character of X race
TeraOnline,3c9iak,auggis,2,Mon Jul 6 16:00:14 2015 UTC,"This makes the most sense.   Someone mentioned somewhere they're going down the list by popularity. Starting with Elin and then whatever races can play Gunner and then the next race.  Surprise surprise, they're all female but that's because they're the most popular (profitable) sex. Weather it is by M/F ratio or by $$ spent, they calculate the costs and expected returns then make a decision."
TeraOnline,3c9iak,evolutionvi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:00:46 2015 UTC,"The thing is that, even if there are other MMOs like Tera, you're not likely to find them unless you're really looking, and it's even less likely that the combat is remotely as solid as Tera's. Hell, I'm not even into the traditional MMORPG elements all that much. Even if they were well-designed for an MMO, they'd still probably be unnecessary fluff and tedium bogging down the shining feature of the game. It's definitely not what I'm there for, at least. There's just not a lot of similar games out there. Tera basically has the market cornered on this style of MMOARPG."
TeraOnline,3c9iak,AkiraZXE,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:13:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you're a new player, but the ability to dismantle items for feedstock proves that Tera does a lot of QoL changes for the better.  In the past, we had to use gear called 'fodder' to upgrade weapons/armor. If you had a gold weapon you wanted to +9, you would need to amass a bunch of other weapons of the same tier (aka fodder) in order to try to upgrade it. The fodder gear was used up whether or not the upgrade was successful. This lead to players having 3+ bank tabs just for fodder alone.  They have since changed the system to feedstock, and allow players to dismantle gears into feedstock.   '' Just because a game isn't perfect doesn't mean it ignores QoL."
TeraOnline,3c9iak,iEuphoria,2,Mon Jul 6 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"You're right I'm probably less than 30 days into the game.   Vanilla wow was BRUTAL. I remember farming for months to get my ""epic"" mount, but that wasn't a good game design choice.   I broke down about 140 of those items designed solely for feedstock and I'm astonished I had to click 3 times for each one just to get to the end of it.  Feedstock can be upgraded in 1 click to the amount you want, but I should be able to find a feedstock type vendor where I offer up all my items I want broken down and pay ""him"" the fee I would've otherwise sent to the air (why does it cost me money to do something for myself?  It's odd and disjointed as it is.   I'm not a game designer, so I don't know what's best, but it seems like an easy fix to a problem every player faces.   The best dev team on the block in my opinion is the current Diablo 3 crew. Each patch these guys release strong and meaningful changes the community asks for. Its a labour of love and that damn game doesn't have any cosmetic purchases available  (yet) either. Any other game (that I have played) would've waited on those kind of sweeping changes for an expansion."
TeraOnline,3c9iak,Svri,9,Mon Jul 6 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"More or less, it does the one thing that every modern MMO focuses on the best so while not ideal it is the best option available. Combat is the main focus of the game and it is solid and enjoyable, questing is generic, story is OK but nothing great, graphics are aging but still nice to look at. IMO this puts it one point ahead of most of the other options since more or less everything is combat focused and has generic questing/leveling/story/etc..."

TeraOnline,3c9iak,nemuuu,5,Mon Jul 6 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure i'll get downvoted to the ground on this one, but here are my opinions.  Tera is a GREAT game, but it has some really noticeable flaws which I think are holding the game back:   Questing System: Terribly dated questing system and sadly the first thing new players see when they first try the game.  I think they do have a fair excuse though, the game was designed back when WoW & other MMO's of it time did the typical kill 30 of this and that quests, the problem is localization took a while, by the time they released in NA/EU newer games improved on that, they were better in hiding the grind and tera was basically competing with them and not the old stuff from when it was released in Korea. Performance: This is another issue that new players face right off the bat, It is such a let down when people dont have an acceptable frame rate, specially in an action paced combat like tera's. The game was built with Unreal Engine 3, the UI with Adobe Air. You can kind of fix things tweaking your ini files and twaking your flash settings, but when you're new to a game you expect things to just work, you shouldnt have to do all that. Even after all the tweaks, framerates are still abysmal with very good hardware. Hardware has changed since Tera's release but the game is still underperforming. RNG: Tera revolves around RNG way too much, gear progression is based on rng, from drops to Masterworking to rolling the right stats to enchanting, and so on. I think this creates a very frustating progression system, because you're not really rewarded for your ""hard"" work, it all depends on luck. You could maybe argue that its technically the same as hoping to get that one piece of gear that never drops after a ton of runs of X or Y raid in other games which I agree btw, But the sense of accomplishment doesnt happen when it should, you finish upgrading your stuff to +12 ~ +15 and the only feeling I get from this is cheated and poor. Thats not really the way we're used to doing things in western games I guess.   Most of my rl friends who have left the game basically have because of one of these 3 reasons, but Why do I still play this game after everything ive said?:  This game is really fucking fun, the dungeons and the combat is sooooo good. End game is really challenging, its legitimately hard at times.   Combat: Some MMO'S (wildstar) heavily market their combat system as ""Action"", its Bullshit, no other MMO has come close to what Tera has without feeling clunky, this is their best feature. End Game: Dungeons are so fun, mechanics where you actually have to pay attention to the hints and tells that the boss gives you, other games all do the same in a way, but tera's combat make things a lot more fun to deal with all this. Art & Music: The game is gorgeous, the world is beautiful, aesthetically it is one of the best looking MMO's out there, the game is 3 years old and it still looks so much better than many newer MMO's. The music and sound is great, there is so much detail in the sound, from your abilities to the sound of the enviroment it all adds up and makes the game feel alive   TL;DR: The questing sucks, performance is horrible, hate rng, but the game is really freaking fun and challenging."
TeraOnline,3c9iak,mikeyeli,2,Mon Jul 6 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your candor!   I've only been on for a little while, and the first impression is - better turn down my settings, check and the quests are as of yet standard fare.  The combat is very interesting, but I'm surprised I'm locked in place during the actual animations, can't seem to move AS my lance is thrusting forward - nor could I hold my shield up with rclick and adjust position.  I'm barely starting out, but I feel like this was their design choice, and I'll have to get used to it and embrace it."
TeraOnline,3c9iak,itmeowsback,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"The lancer as a full tank is designed to be less mobile. If you want a little more mobility and challenge I suggest trying out a Slayer or maybe a Warrior. That said, yes you are immobile during the animations but can cancel them similar to LoL or Dota 2. You can think of them as fighting game ""Combo"" moves but triggered by one button instead of a sequence of buttons."
TeraOnline,3c9iak,itmeowsback,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:25:14 2015 UTC,One thing I really wish they would do is take out a lot of the Zone quests and instead add more puzzle/platform elements similar to a Zelda style game. The combat is already very similar to platformers like Zelda or even Ninja Gaiden. The engine is certainly capable as shown by Rootstock minigames. I feel like that alone would significantly increase the amount of players staying until the game starts opening up (lvl 30).

TeraOnline,3c9iak,Bunlapin,3,Mon Jul 6 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"The visuals, the characters (castanic males are what drew me to the game in the first place), the combat system, friends...  But what appeals me most is that I feel it greatly rewards skill. The action combat makes it so that two players with exactly the same gear can be night and day, you actually need to be good or your BiS gear might as well be fodder. Even right now with gunners being tagged as a very easy class to play while still being top DPS you can still find players (including other gunners) with mediocre gear outdpsing gunners with much better stuff simply because spamming a few skills isn't all there is to Tera. You need to be fluid, flexible and smart in combat. You know a player is probably good when you see them apply skills in non-obvious but effective ways in extreme situations.  The hardest content in the game actually does feel hard for a while until you have it down. This can take a lot of time and practice especially because it relies on teamwork, you not only need to gear and get better yourself, you need to ""optimize"" your team mates as well (kinda like a RPG, except they are actually players too) and help them where they are lacking, while at the same time they will help you if you're screwing up in a certain area. I don't mind throwing a bunch of money or consumables at them and expect nothing in return other than persevering through the content. However plenty of people are not receptive to criticism, are stubborn and give up easily, then complain there's nothing to do in Tera after they do the same easy dungeons over and over instead of actually working towards the bigger challenges. But that's another story. I keep hearing next patch's content is easier than current Fate of Arun's and it certainly does look like that, so in a way this is a good thing for many people as not everyone feels a need to stress themselves over content that requires too much preparation and practice. For others it's probably gonna get boring if there's nothing actually challenging. I'm hoping Timescape HM at least holds up for a while.  TL;DR: I play Tera because I like it."

I got tired of so many games from Aeria at this point, Scarlet Blade PvP was somewhat enjoyable but man those clippings feel right in place with Monster Hunter, but is not Monster Hunter...I might've returned to Dragon's Prophet from SoE after my GPU upgrade, but the class reworks sorta screwed over my mage there with his equipment and the ""theme"" I want, also lost the combo-ish potential of the class for the theme I want, it was really hard to get back in. And oh god that UI. I mean initially I thought Tera's UI was horrible, but the scaling can be somewhat fixed, even if it's limited. DP's UI is just so cluttered after the rework that I don't even know where to begin fixing it.

TeraOnline,3c9iak,vaginaculo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:44:00 2015 UTC,"Just started playing 1.5 months ago. The combat in this game is amazing. Seriously fun, mostly due to its changing rotations and interactivity (e.g. skillshots, movement, & dodging during combat). I'm playing warrior, and I really enjoy the combat. Especially against bosses. I love that I can kill incredibly strong enemies if I am skilled enough to dodge their attacks. RE & mana both provide meaningful limits to skill spam, and I really like that the basic attack replenishes both while being weaker with no utility. Really well designed system. I'm fine with gear having an impact, but I would never play a game without this element of interactivity.  But tbh... everything else kind of sucks. Especially the quest system. Bleh. The combat keeps me coming back though!"

TeraOnline,3calhc,Goorman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:17:34 2015 UTC,"I have bitter, savage, and two pounding.

And it's not the speed that makes the fight hard, it's the fact that if you get hit one of the ""big attacks"" you are practically dead. Warrior at least has three dodges back to back. Lancer and Berzerker have metal armor and an immediate block for defense."

TeraOnline,3calhc,narium,-15,Mon Jul 6 23:35:02 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Zerk is considered mid-tier
TeraOnline,3calhc,JaggerA,14,Wed Jul 8 04:46:16 2015 UTC,"No, they are still top tier. In fact, on a stationary target, they will always provide most DPS, purely because of the fact they have a multi-million hit on a 3 seconds cd and insane crit rate because of how their glyphs work."
TeraOnline,3calhc,Lato57,2,Mon Jul 6 13:56:36 2015 UTC,"Huh. Well that's good to know, considering Zerk is my next char!"

I'm not the best zerk there is, nor would I even consider myself good, but thundering isn't going to outdamage other classes just because of its hits. Not to mention a lot of real bosses in this game don't just stand there and require evasion.  High hits does not equal high dps."
TeraOnline,3calhc,Titandino,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:28:36 2015 UTC,"In theory they are best, even if you consider Gunners. If their main damage from AB doesn't reset, then you have lower DPS because it's on a 18(?) second cd if it does. You can use Burst Fire or one of your other WP skills, but those are on a long cd and Burst Fire will not do more than a Zerk spamming TS.   You are right in that in practice this won't count, but this is just theorycraft. Zerk is a not an easy class and playing it to maximum potential is very hard."
TeraOnline,3calhc,Lato57,2,Mon Jul 6 18:25:47 2015 UTC,Thank you for at least saying it's hard. I just get sick of people saying it's a braindead class that is so easy to blow other dpses out of the water with.
TeraOnline,3calhc,Titandino,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:15:46 2015 UTC,"AB has a 7ish sec CD, if you use replenish right after AB, you still get one more replinish chance when AB has 3ish secs left on CD.

TeraOnline,3calhc,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"Yea in reality the hard dungeons are not stationary and most zerkers have a hard time dealing with their long cd iframes and slow combat speed.

TeraOnline,3calhc,blueteakettle,2,Tue Jul 7 05:57:45 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what people are saying, do not play a zerk if you want a braindead experience especially if you plan on doing hard dungeons endgame. Yes, their skill rotation may not be as complex as other classes, but that is made up for by serious lack of mobility they have. Try evading 1 shot mechanics without having an iframe to use.  If you want a class that has a skill rotation as braindead as a zerk, and ALSO the surivability factor being braindead, play a Gunner."
TeraOnline,3calhc,Titandino,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:06:19 2015 UTC,"Same here (braindead after work). I am playing a gunner and I'm having fun with it. DPS seems good enough.

TeraOnline,3calhc,Leroyyy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"I think Gunner.  Mainly because it's just fun.  The class is designed well, and you can do the things you want to do - when you want to do them.

TeraOnline,3calhc,Alex-infinitum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"There really is not ""easy"" class, people say zerk or gunner, but all classes require their own optimization, and have their own tricks, and while yes they might require less button presses overall, none of them are easy. IF you, however look for a friendly class, Reaper, Warrior, Slayer and Gunner have a lot of iframes to work with, and are also very mobile.  To give a little bit of insight of why people might think why zerk or gunner are easy, think of it this way, both classes have few ""core skills"" (Thunder Strike, Cyclone, Evasive Smash, Arcane Barrage, Rapid Fire, Replenish) and while yes those skills are the source of most of your damage, there's a lot you have to account for, for zerk for example, using your only iframe carelessly means you will be losing backtime, or die if you don't account for what the boss is doing. And for gunner there's a lot more than just use AB and replenish off cd, you have to account for what your stats are, what gear are you on, and then decide what you will fill with when AB doesn't reset (which contrary to popular belief, happens quite often)."
TeraOnline,3calhc,Gbraker7000,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:25:33 2015 UTC,"The only two choices available that come close to what you're asking for is Slayer or Gunner.  IMO you want Gunner. Heavy armor, great DPS, multiple Iframes, ranged class, and a OP healing pet that pretty much negates the need to have a healer heal you (except endgame bosses). It's about as brain-dead as they come with their bag of tricks with no drawbacks.  Bonus: You can solo every dungeon in the game except the lvl 60+ in noob gear (and you might be able to solo them, I just never bothered).

TeraOnline,3calhc,iLoveKuchen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"Gunner: Easy leveling, high crit base on skills therefore ""good""(op) with ideonal basic gear already. Take it and once u get bored u can take another class if u care. The shock combo will get nerfed so it will take a little bit more to play in PVP soon, right now it is too easy.  Zerk feels clunky leveling up, using only 2skills might seem easy and it is killing normal mob but at endgame u will need to learn ways around the limited i-frame and learn which hits u can take and which u need to block or even i-frame. blocking everything will gimp your dps. Needs gear to become fun and if u plan on doing PVP it takes more to get kills unless u plan on trying to oneshot stuff getting the occasional lucky oneshot on bad players.  Reaper isnt about spacebar even though its a funny joke, facebar can kill stuff in pve but not using spacebar kills faster/more dps. It is squishy though, similar to the warrior so i wouldnt call it relaxed. Skill makes reaper from mediocre pvp to awesome pvp, especially 1vs1 in like CS its a lot of fun but takes time to learn.  Lancer is fun too, relaxed leveling lancer means that u can queue up for instances all the time tanking them which i found very relaxing without moving around (especially without paying for atlas). In PVP u giga and barrage combo...timing takes some skill too and really skilled lancer are untouchable."

Slayer  Easiest to play period? Slayer  Just play Slayer. Why? Slayer has a double iframe on a 4 second cd, a second iframe that teles you behind the boss for ez escapes, and a rotation that is not very involved. Gunner in end-game basically just comes down to ""Can you position well or are you gonna be on the other side of the room because you have no clue how to use rocket jump?"" trust me, go do schm as a gunner. Zerker is very few keys in a rotation, but this is negated by the fact that you have an iframe on a 15 second cooldown (outside of Intimidation, come tomorrow), your block is weak (also outside of Inimidation) and you may have to interrupt your charge abilities to avoid getting one-shot, hindering your dps.

Warrior's are nice because about every skill can be i-framed/block cancelled out of and they are quick casting. Except for maybe a few select skills but they are either I-frames themselves or offer damage mitigation.

Death spiral powerlinks to both grim strike and double sheer, increasing their damage by 20%. Double shear also powerlinks into grim strike, increasing it's damage by a further 20%. If you use the skills in order: Death spiral > Double shear > grim strike , then you increase the damage of your double shear by 20% and grim strike by 40%. You can then use your second charge of death spiral before it goes on cooldown and if your grim strike has proc'd its cooldown reset then you can get another round in with all these damage buffs in place.  If you spam spacebar, your combo chain won't be the proper order here and you miss out on these massive short duration damage buffs, basically gutting your damage output."
TeraOnline,3calhc,justdavidt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:34:39 2015 UTC,"Power linked is a certain type of glyph that a skill may have. When you use that skill with the glyph, it will increase the damage of another skill for a short period of time (5-10s or so). Optimally you want to use this skill to power up other skills.  Reapers have a few, though the main one is probably death spiral. It can be used to power link grim strike or double sheer. If you spam spacebar, you will not be able to utilize the power link optinally"
TeraOnline,3calhc,dragonbeast1122,2,Mon Jul 6 15:01:40 2015 UTC,"Just to avoid confusion for newer players, Different classes powerlinks work differently.  Reaper's links are consumed when the next skill is used whereas Slayer's apply to all casts of that skill within a short amount of time.  Ex. After using Death Spiral, the glyph will be consumed in the first Grim Strike used and would not apply to any Grim resets after.  Slayers OHS glyph from Evis (I think?) would apply to all OHS cast while the 7 second buff is active.  I don't know about other classes, so if anyone would like to add, please do, it would be helpful to know.  Edit- whoops, sorry for double post, phone is dumb"

TeraOnline,3calhc,Tangy4tw,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:05:11 2015 UTC,I agree. I never understand people who use the spacebar. Ever since I started playing Tera I've never even once used my spacebar for anything other than Retaliate.  I guess it just doesn't make sense to me that people just sit there and hit the spacebar.

Your heals are good enough that you don't need to be spamming it constantly unless your party is brain dead.

TeraOnline,3calhc,ThePurpleKnightmare,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"yea honestly dude, I don't know what I was thinking, backstab is the most difficult skillshot to land, and have you seen blade draw and their basic attack and other melee abilities, I thought berserker auto was aimed and slayers auto were kinda slow, but I mean those aimed warrior skills and they are so slow, slower than slayers.  But in all seriousness the one skillshot a Warrior has should be used after using backstab, which means, they have 0 skillshots, you use the super easy to hit with backstab ability and then you press binding sword and your cascade of stuns and win.  Or if you're just 1v1ing, fuck binding sword, just press your win button that never misses. Even if warriors did fuck up, they are so tanky that it doesn't matter, 40% bonus endurance and % damage reduction on most of their skills, some of which can be glyphed for high amounts of endurance and that have like 12 iframes.  Warriors are the easiest class to land abilities as, and they have no weaknesses to make up for it, normally in a balanced game someone having an easy move like backstab or any other warrior skill, it would do low damage, not CC it would be a lackluster skill.  The more effort you put into landing an ability the more it deserves to do but for Warrior it's low skill/high reward. All the skill in a 1v1 with a Warrior is on the opponent fighting the warrior, they gotta try predicting and blocking their backstab the second they press it to avoid the stun and have 20 seconds of not getting completely owned."

TeraOnline,3cbs00,just_a_null,2,Mon Jul 6 19:30:05 2015 UTC,"Erm unless you are asking the very obvious question is tensus better than lucid for pvp. (Which I don't think you are)  I don't see how you can possibly think tensus better than lucid for pve. Tensus has a bunch of useless pvp stats which don't affect pve at all whereas lucid has loads of nice dmg reduction.  Edit: Just saw your tldr, dmg > crit rate. Plus there are more than 2 rolls."
TeraOnline,3cbs00,iHenryblah,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"Heh, you commented before I finished editing.  Basically, I'm wondering if it's better for both (for DPS/Healers).  Lucid is better for Tanks because of the increased aggro, and has nice MP regen and defense for PvE too."
TeraOnline,3cbs00,Spiffymooge,2,Mon Jul 6 18:14:39 2015 UTC,"That's not it. Pvp gear has non rerollable lines that only benefit pvp so already you're missing stats for pve so no, tensus isn't better than lucid for pve. And the +% dmg is way better than 5 crit, att spd doesn't really benefit most dps classes.   There may be some merit for healer weapons but definitely not the armor."
TeraOnline,3cbs00,Spiffymooge,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"None of the compared stats include rerollable stats though.  I don't know what rerollable stats are available for each, or if they are different or the same.  Maybe that's the difference."
TeraOnline,3cbs00,Spiffymooge,3,Mon Jul 6 18:31:14 2015 UTC,Look at the tensus weapon lines. There are 2 lines of pvp damage that doesn't do anything for pve. And there is 1 line of pvp stat for each piece of armor that is useless for pve.   Now you may use tensus for pve but there is no way that tensus is even on par with lucid for pve.
TeraOnline,3cbs00,dragonbeast1122,-2,Mon Jul 6 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"For each piece of armor, the Lucid set has 5 stats and the Tensus set has 6.  So while the PvP stats aren't useful for PvE, they are 'extra,' so it doesn't matter.  For the weapon, there is also 1 extra PvP stat on Tensus and they replace MP regen with the second PvP stat, so it's not really a huge deal.  The big difference that I've found through this thread is that, while the non-rerollabe stats 'may' be better on Tensus, the rerollable stats are better on Lucid."
TeraOnline,3cbs00,Bunlapin,2,Mon Jul 6 19:03:05 2015 UTC,"Lucid has 6 lines on weapon, the 6th line is a rerollable line and is displayed as such and you roll it to whatever because they dont have quick/intense/keen distinction anymore. So Lucid has 5 lines for pve (cuz mp5 isnt game breaking) while tensus has 4 lines for pve before rerollable lines.   Tensus cannot roll certain lines that are highly sought after for pve like +/-%dmg to/from enraged monsters."
TeraOnline,3cbs00,Titandino,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:19:57 2015 UTC,Tensus weaponis better for healers for sure because you can get bit CDR and Attack Speed.
TeraOnline,3cbs00,tbui,2,Mon Jul 6 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"I hear Tensus damage % rerollable stats are specifically for players, meaning they don't apply in PvE unlike Renegade. I'm not 100% sure about this though. Either way, Tensus weapons also do not have a rerollable stat line on base which is the major selling point for the new patch's PvE weapons as these rolls can be very effective.  I'd say Lucid weapons are better for everyone except maybe healers who can be more flexible and might prefer something else (I'm personally sticking to older weapons as Go Berserk's healer weapons don't appeal to me so far)."
TeraOnline,3cbs00,PsyStorm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"Found it:  ""Re-rollables:  Due to players using PvP gear for PvE content, as it could be obtained on day one, re-rollables will now be specific between the 2 types of gear.

Additional 4.5% PvP damage when attack (6% when MW) Additional 5.3% PvP damage when attacking from the rear (6.9% when MW)  Enraged damage cannot be rolled on PvP Gear."""
TeraOnline,3cbs00,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:34:28 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure you also are comparing some MW rolls to non-MW rolls. PVE gear is definitely better for PVE. Some of my healer friends are saying that the new gear is not good for healers though and they might be going for PVP on their healer.  But yes that % damage is absolutely amazing compared to a measly 5 crit rate and aspd is only good on archers and warriors and you can still get aspd rolls on the PVE set.
TeraOnline,3caeam,kingrai,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:37:09 2015 UTC,"First of all this here is all done by very good ping. He has like 5-10ms ping (fps counts too). Then he has all bonuses for attack speed, cdr (pots, buffs). It seems he is running full energetic etchings (gloves I'm sure, weapon I don't know, with the attacks he does can by weapon is pumped) what even gives less cooldown and attackspeed. And finally he is using blast on every skill to cancel everything + have even more attack speed (blast glyph). Something else from his rotation. Summon HB-7 when possible, he does not take risks when he knows he needs HB-7 pull iframe in some places. Also he has Scattershot glyphed for no recoil. If you play like this (this is what I do), glyph that skill. Yes that couple of meters can be annoying if you get pushed back all the time. Rest is basic Mana missiles after burstfire for faster cast , same with rocket jump and then mana missiles for faster cast. If you didn't knew that, start using this little trick. Also because you hug boss you don't want to use AB glyph for attack speed. As you detonate it when you cast it."
TeraOnline,3caeam,sev0,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"Generally you should cancel all attacks using auto attack on a gunner; other things he is doing is using HB-7 Summon > Burst Fire > Mana Missiles, half of the HB summon animation can be cancelled by using burst fire and burst fire speeds up mana missiles in turn.  Rocket Jump > Burst fire also speeds up your burst fire; also there is a glyph on the AA that speeds up skills if it procs, not sure it did here since I cant read korean lel. Besides that its the fact that koreans play at 5-15 ping, and thus can be faster than us most of the times.  EDIT: I see that he uses Rocket Jump > Mana Missiles too; that to is a speed chain"

AB is without doubt the priority skill for gunners.   It's just going to decrease the overwhelming lead gunners have in total DPS but it's still going to be their most powerful skill. I personally believe nothing is going to chance, AB is still going the be the most important skill and deal the most damage."

TeraOnline,3c85qp,oristomp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:29:29 2015 UTC,"Dismantle weapons and armour into feedstock - you'll only really need your avatar weapon (I have yet to find a weapon that has been better than my avatar weapons, I'm level 40-ish, so there may be some better late game weapons I don't know of).    If you come across a piece of armour that's slightly worse than what you have equipped BUT it's enchant-able and what you currently have isn't enchant-able, consider enchanting it to make it better than what you currently have. It'll say near the top of the item description if it can be enchanted. To enchant, you need feedstock and alkahests (you can buy alkahests from merchants or from item drops). You need 11 alkahests for each level of enchantment at tier 1, so you need 99 to get to +9 enchantment. Open your equipment with P, next to a piece of equipment that can be enchanted there should be a little orange icon, click that to begin enchanting.    Only keep the avatar relic pieces if you need them for your next avatar weapon, dismantle otherwise (example: if you've created the isren avatar weapon, dismantle any left over isren relic pieces, you'll only need elinu relic pieces now for your next avatar weapon).    Keep all your feedstock up until you reach the next tier of weapons/armour. If you still have tier 1 feedstock, but you're using tier 2 armour and weapons, sell it using the broker, you can get quite a bit of gold for it.    Sell your gathering materials (ore, plants, essence) - ore especially sells for quite a bit. You can gather 200 linmetal ore within 10 - 15mins and sell it for about 150g on the broker. Great way to make a bit of money early on. I've gotten my gathering skills all to 200, and have tried a bit of crafting and alchemy, I've yet to see a use for it, but I'm assuming it becomes much more worthwhile late game, so maybe leave it until you reach 65 and just sell it all for now.    When you're gathering ore, you may pick up things like god tears and scarabs, these sell for quite a bit. I think you can sell something like 50 god tears for 200g. Scarabs sell for 1g or 2g each.    Get rid of any crystals you're not using, try fusing them to see if you can get anything better. Lower level crystals aren't worth it to keep, wait until you reach the late game for the much better crystals.    Use charms when you can, and get rid off any low level charms if they're building up in your inventory.  For health/mana, only use the highest level elixirs/potions that you can use, get rid of the rest.    Some quests award you with items that can be sold for a lot on the broker. When you get to freeholds, there are quests there that give you food items, you can make a lot of gold by selling them on the broker. There's little reason to keep them, they only give you temporary buffs.  Get rid off any bombs you may have, they're pretty useless and have a long cool down.    Throw away strongboxes, the lower level strongboxes are worthless. If you happen to get a strongbox key, don't use it on a low level strongbox. Probably best to just sell the key, they sell for quite a bit on the broker. When you reach about level 30, you can enter the corsair's stronghold battleground where if you win, you can get a seachest and a strongbox key - both worth a lot on the broker. Opening the seachest can net you some rare items, but it may be a better idea to just sell the seachest. I think the seachest is worth 700g, the last time I had one I opened it, I sold the items for about 300g total."

The former is a community issue... the latter is really not a problem at all for anyone who actually plays the game, imho.  A good guide to the new gear is here:  http://zephya.wix.com/update10   Fulminate: Non-Enchantable low-tier set, similar to Idoneal Wroth: Enchantable low-tier set, similar to Ambit Schisma: Enchantable mid-tier set, similar to Discovery, offers a Chest Skill Line and Weapon Base Line re-rollable stat. Lucid: Enchantable high-tier set, similar to Generation, offers a Chest Skill Line and Weapon Base Line re-rollable stat. This is part of the Visionmaker series and has Blacksmith's Hammerstrike.   The new Fulminate gear (Idoneal2) will drop in BRNM it sounds since it will be changed into a 7-man (!) instance.  The new Wroth gear (Ambit2) will drop in Akeron's Inferno (Normal), which is new content."

TeraOnline,3c9wpq,FoolisMe,4,Mon Jul 6 06:19:45 2015 UTC,"I'm 50/50 with avatar weapons. I like that you have a consistent powerful weapon every few levels to keep  your character feeling powerful. However, they seem to do more harm than good. I feel like you shouldn't receive them so early in the game because that's the most important time as a new player when developing skill and habits while playing. If a new player finds that they can just barrel through content with an OP weapon, they will probably do that the rest of the game and will have a rude awakening come level 60+  It would be much better if you received your avatar weapon at level 40. That's when the leveling starts slowing down and you've had enough dungeons and quests to really start learning how to play the game.  It also sucks that throughout the game you are consistently powerful while leveling, but then you get to 65 and you do basically no damage until you stack enough crit. It feels bad that my level 65 character feels weaker than when i was level 30."
TeraOnline,3c9wpq,Bludypoo,2,Mon Jul 6 14:00:01 2015 UTC,As someone who played at launch and has also come back to the game I dislike them. IMO if they want to speed up the leveling process they should just make it so that monsters give far more XP. If they did that you could say run each dungeon once while leveling but it would be more useful and more reflective of what you could expect at endgame. Running GL once or twice where boss fights and mechanics actually matter would be far better than massacring your way through it a dozen times like you do currently.
TeraOnline,3c9wpq,Dorion_FFXI,-1,Mon Jul 6 06:37:25 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that take the choice aspect away? Currently you can have the option to opt to not use the avatar weapon to slow down the leveling process. If you boost XP, you're forcing everyone to get to endgame faster; even those that'd rather take their time and learn. This allows more experienced players to blaze through content."
TeraOnline,3c9wpq,SourDinkleberry,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:43:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they kind of take the fun out of finding new weapons. I played a lot of Torchlight and Titan Quest, one of my favourite things about those games is finding new and better equipment.    When you have an avatar weapon, any other weapon you come across just becomes feedstock, there's no excitement to it, it's just ""oh.. it's not as good as my avatar weapon.. no surprise"". Since acquiring the isren avatar weapon, I haven't used anything but avatar weapons - currently using tithus at level 40.    And it's not like they're hard to get, doesn't take long to acquire the relic pieces, just do a couple of dungeons."
TeraOnline,3c9wpq,oristomp,3,Mon Jul 6 16:08:13 2015 UTC,IMO - no.  The whole of this game is at end game. I like to think the purpose of those avatar weapons is to get you through the agonizingly long and boring process of leveling and get you to where you actually want to be so you can finally start playing the game for real. Leveling before avatar was a ridiculous waste of time.

TeraOnline,3c9wpq,Valanor,0,Mon Jul 6 08:16:39 2015 UTC,Tera has a fair amount of pre-cap content but not enough to justify making leveling unbearably slow. It's safe to say that the game only really starts at 65 and as such letting players get to that point as painlessly as possible is a good design choice as it keeps new players playing.

TeraOnline,3c9wpq,dragonbeast1122,0,Mon Jul 6 10:21:03 2015 UTC,I'd like to say it's probably somewhere in the range of 80-90% Crit Rate... Seems like almost every hit is a crit with an Avatar Weapon vs an appropriate leveled BAM/Monster.

TeraOnline,3c9wpq,noelgnaw,0,Mon Jul 6 10:25:14 2015 UTC,"That is crit multiplier actually. There are 4 parameters to crits in TERA:  Crit rate - property of your character, it measures against the enemy's crit resist to calculate your chance of critting.  Crit resist - property of your character, it measures against the enemy's crit rate to calculate their chance of critting you.  Crit multiplier - property of your character, it is the amount by which white damage is multiplied on crit.  Crit chance - hidden property which is the actual RNG number that governs how often you crit.  Additional notes:  Crits are considerably more probable when attacking from behind.  Though crit multiplier stat itself won't show it, you can stack up a lot of multiplier through back crit crystals on your weapon.  Crit resistance is mostly a PvP thing.  RNGsus is a fickle god."

Especially, yknow, because the same people who draw force as kumas tend to abuse their teammates and the kumas in the next games they get into.  What they're saying is right; it's people as a whole being assholes. To blame the fact that kumasylum is being crippled so hard purely on the team someone is placed into is, to be quite honest, as stupid as the people who are wasting their time draw forcing. And to be fair, I'd wager that a fair few of the people bitching about draw forcing are doing it to cover their own tracks and avoid persecution for draw forcing themselves.  And oh boy, does this hurt. Kumas being removed because players have broken it beyond repair? Wonderful. Being the glutton for punishment that I am (growing up playing NES games does that to you) Kumasylum is actually tied for my favorite battleground, neck and neck with fraywind. It'd sure be a pain if they were to remove it."

TeraOnline,3c5t97,O113,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:26:56 2015 UTC,"Thats also not true. If you read the entire source you would come across this:    Edit: /u/ChaosRevealed brought up a point that Zerker crit chance may be calculated as ""pretending to attack twice"" and critting if at least 1 of the two crits. Hence crit chance = 1 - (1-crit chance)², instead of just doubling the rate. I do not know if this is true. Assuming it is the results are:  Between 0 and 169 crit rate, Keen with 14 crit rate 9.3% enrage and 6.9% back roll is the best. Between 169 and 201 crit rate, Keen with all 3 % roll is the best. More than 201 crit rate, Intense with all 3 % damage roll is the best.   Also on the VM + 15:   Between 0 and 164 crit rate, Keen with 14 crit rate 9.3% enrage and 6.9% back roll is the best. Between 165 and 237 crit rate, Keen with all 3% roll is the best. More than 237 crit rate, Intense with all 3 % damage roll is the best.   And for the SCHM stuff:  It doesn't matter if keen is better in the beginning because Darkan has no timer until he enrages at 24%. And then the enrage roll is much more worth than some extra crit.  If double crit glyphs actually doubled your crit rate you could get over 100% crit so that is highly unlikely. Furthermore I always use a dps meter to see my crit chance and the results support this assumption. Also doesnt change the fact that as a tank zerk you have no friggin backtime to crit so it's still intense>all."
TeraOnline,3c5t97,SmithieWerben,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:22:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with the crit formula (I use that one myself and it seems most accurate to me), but I do not agree with the rolls he uses for calculations.   First, 6.9% back dmg is the worst of the 3 dmg rolls since you can never have 100% back uptime, even with the best tank in the world (secondaries), and 6% dmg is better than back dmg unless you have over 87% back uptime... which is really hard to pull off.  Also, crit dmg is better than crit rate, since +14 crit rate would give you, at a crit rate of 200 (decent gear), 2.46% extra crit rate against 155 crit resist bosses (tho I think new patch's bosses will have 175?), which is about 3.62% extra dmg.   For crit dmg, the calculation is a bit more complex, but with 80% back uptime and 90% enrage (BR), with pristine/fine? savage, bitter and focused niveot (1.26, 1.44 and 1.78), an extra 0.3 crit dmg at 200 crit rate gives you 3.69% more dmg (the power I used for this calculation was 75 (base)+73 (from gear)+buff, charm, energy stars)  ofc it varies based on stats."
TeraOnline,3c5t97,magocchi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:37:08 2015 UTC,"well I said it was better for dps and the best hybrid weap on top, because intenses back dmg doesn't work while tanking, but all 3 rolls of keen do just like quick, but quick is shit for dps... xD so if I'd do both I'd deffo get keen, also on warrior."

TeraOnline,3c4lh8,Kourinn,12,Sat Jul 4 18:54:50 2015 UTC,"Animation cancelling isn't feasible in practice in AStance and the guide seems to be really focused on it. The time it takes to do an evasive roll (which can only be cancelled by scythe, nothing else) outweighs the backswing. It's good if the boss is turning or doing a back-attack but other than that you shouldn't be using it to cancel. It's just too difficult to wait for your chains and predict the exact timing you'll need for a iframe unless you're doing SCHM and Darkan does triple swipes.  Also, double energetic III is just simply not as good for DPS as crit III but are much better for tanking. Since you're focusing on DPS you might want to change that, although I'm pretty sure it won't affect the result.   Here's corrections to things that you found as well.   2   You forgot to mention the edge generated from the 7th hit. I honestly don't even know why you brought that up as information you found. I thought it was common knowledge RoB does most of it's damage near the end.   3   You should cancel traverse every time if you have BD up. It's worth it to try to get the reset. If it doesn't you can always comatitive RoB. Traverse doesn't generate edge so sitting there using all 13 hits is bad unless it's the start of the fight. Only exception is if you desperately need resolve.   4 and 5    They contradict eachother. You should be using reaping slash off cooldown chained as well, when it doesn't take the edge.   6   You forgot the edge again. If you're using rising fury for DPS and not movement and don't use the third hit for the edge, you're doing it horribly wrong.   7   I spam DFA sometimes when safe and I need a filler without any other chains just for edge and Glyph of the Swift, which is core in any decent warrior's setup.  A final criticism I have is that you tried to do this with the amount of attack speed you have playing alone. You should account for things like energy stars.  TL;DR  You focus on way too much animation cancelling when it's not feasible in AStance at all in practice.  You decide to disregard edge generation in skills because it's too hard to figure out, but that unfortunately makes a lot of your findings irrelevant.  You forget to include party buffs."

Evasive Roll/DFA -> Vortex can be a better set-up for Blade Draw than other skills if you don't have Glyph of the Swift procced.  Reaping Slash does not consume edge until 3-5 points are built up. It varies with the dungeon so the threshold knowledge comes with time. This is mostly irrelevant now since the patch will change it.  Plan your edge control at ~5. If you start at 7 it's already too late. For example, if the target is at 6 edge, Combatitve -> Charging Slash -> Blade Draw -> Scythe is the best thing to do, but if you weren't planning ahead you would use Charging Slash -> Blade Draw first, leaving you with an awkward amount of edge for Scythe.  You can hold the third hit of rising fury for about 3/4th of a second to chain Blade Draw. The same applies for using all 13 hits of Traverse.  Account for cooldowns not as they're finished, but whilst taking into account the amount of time your chain starters will take.  Charging Slash and Combatitive Strike can merge your hitbox briefly with the BAM's, so be careful while using it when BAMS are doing attacks that don't normally hit the back but hit in a very close proximity to it."

TeraOnline,3c4lh8,Uchouten,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:01:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback. I think I may not have been clear with my use of the term animation cancelling. I was referring to animation cancelling as using the ability and then chaining into another such as combative strike animation cancelling into rain of blows. I'm sorry if this was not clear and I will try to clarify it in the next draft.   The only evasive roll animation cancelling I recommend is that if you know you will need to dodge an oncoming attack, performing a Blade Draw combo and animation cancelling after the last hit is a good way to minimize dps lost to avoiding damage. If the boss will not damage you, it is better to finish the blade draw and start a new combo. Don't evasive roll animation cancel if you are safe from damage because, like you said, you actually lose dps. I'm sorry if this was not clear, I'll try to word it better in my next draft.  I think you're right that I need to do more research into etchings. I currently main as a warrior tank but I want to be a better dps too.  I'll also make sure to add a note about the edge gained on the 7th hit of RoB. I actually didn't know rain of blows dealt 10/23 of its damage in the last 2 hits before making this guide, so I don't think its common knowledge.  For 3, you have a good point about Traverse Cut cancelling. I sorta said the same thing but I don't think I was very clear. I'll try to reword it in my next draft.  For 4 and 5, this guide uses skill affects that will be live after the July 7th patch where Reaping Slash is being reworked and will no longer consume edge or buff Scythe, it will simply be a damage/cc skill.  For 6, you are right that I didn't consider edge. I just assumed that the higher dps combos would stack it enough that using lower dps skills was unnecessary, but I did not do any tests to support this assumption. I'll definitely take this into account for my next draft and update it depending on the results.  I didn't want to consider energy stars because I play with a mystic frequently, and energy stars will be reworked in a future patch. When I have more time, I will try to add in these considerations and see if the numbers change."
TeraOnline,3c4lh8,CelestialRice,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"I was referring to animation cancelling as using the ability and then chaining into another   Ah, I see. That's a lot more useful then for calculations, but in practice knowing the value is kind of unnecessary. Rather, if you just thought about using skill chains like you're supposed to the benefits of the animation cancelling comes naturally.    I don't think its common knowledge.   Mmm... it's not so much ""common knowledge"" but more of very easily obtainable knowledge from people that care about min-maxing or efficient DPS since you can easily see the damage as it appears whilst using the skill.   For 4 and 5   Well, after the patch, I would strongly recommend using it whenever you can after a chain anyways because it generates edge.   I didn't consider edge.   This is the biggest problem I saw in your guide so it would be great if you accounted for it. This is the reason why Poison Blade is such a good skill even with such low damage; it generates edge per unit of time faster than any other skill. It's also the reason why Cascade of Stuns isn't a great filler despite its high base damage.

TeraOnline,3c4lh8,Iatii,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:45:36 2015 UTC,"Some animation cancelling is feasible... for example chaining reaping after RoB actually cancels the entirety of RoB's wind-down, but the way he calculates it severely inflates the numbers when you use dodge to animation cancel, those numbers are only accurate if dodge roll itself had no animation and simply cut the end of each ability (which of course is not the case...).  If you actually use dodge roll to force the animation cancel, then the numbers should be calculated to include the end of dodge roll's animation...thus providing a more realistic representation of the value of using dodge roll for the sole purpose of animation cancelling in a-stance."
TeraOnline,3c4lh8,Garandou,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:01:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do not recommend using dodge roll to animation cancel unless you have to dodge roll anyways to re-position or dodge an incoming attack.

TeraOnline,3c4lh8,Garandou,2,Sat Jul 4 20:40:57 2015 UTC,"Edge Base Damage of Scythe (no glyph) Value of Extra Edge Base Damage of Scythe (glyphed) Value of Extra Edge    1 446 0 446 0   2 446 0 446 0   3 937 491 1059 613   4 1663 ~726.5 1968 ~908.125   5 2391 ~726.5 2876 ~908.125   6 3117 ~726.5 3784 ~908.125   7 3843 ~726.5 4692 ~908.125   8 4569 ~726.5 5600 ~908.125   9 5296 ~726.5 6508 ~908.125   10 6023 ~726.5 7416 ~908.125    This was done against a mob outside Highwatch that has approx. 3468 defense and I had a total attack modifier of 15643. Since there are changes to damage based on mob type and whether or not you are solo (for warrior, in a rush so can't link patch notes that included these changes), these numbers are probably scaled a little since the 0 edge base damage listed for Scythe is like 371 or something. So, if you want, you can scale all these numbers back down by 20%. As you can see, the value of extra edge is exactly 25% more when glyphed, if you were ever wondering how exactly the glyph works.  I did this testing for you because you absolutely need to redo that chart of yours to include the value of edge. For example, at 0 edge, doing Rising Fury > Blade Draw is completely different to doing it at 4+ edge. This has severe implications on how warrior should be played. Lastly, since Pounce generates no edge, this automatically will rank it a lot lower in the DPS tier.  Hope you find this useful."
TeraOnline,3c4lh8,Garandou,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:06:02 2015 UTC,Wow thank you for this info. I'll see what I can do with it. Honeslty though I've wanted to delete my guide several times since posting it. I main as a tank and thought this would be a good way to improve my dps side but the more I follow my own advice it feels like the worse I do. I'll definitely try to look into this in the near future but for now I just feel exhausted about it.
TeraOnline,3c4lh8,Garandou,2,Sun Jul 5 02:15:29 2015 UTC,"From briefly reading the maths and methodology, I believe your approach is deeply flawed for many reasons:   Most important: Going down the list like that with rotations is not how it works. For example, ignoring scythe, your first 3 chains (charging BD, cs RoB, dfa vortex bd) will be used in that order in your test. In the real world not only is that chain impossible half the time (i.e. BD is now on cooldown), but precisely because of that it might be beneficial in most situations to go through all the BD chains until it goes on CD before doing RoB. Time BD doesn't spend in CD and wasted on using other chains will cause you to have to use fillers after, losing a lot of DPS. CDR roll was designed to circumvent this problem with BD on CD, but you did not take it into account at all. Not accounting for scythe. CDR allows you to scythe more frequently. When the damage difference between the 2 rolls in your calculation is so low (+-10% or less), a couple of extra scythes here and there can really make the difference. ... A few other smaller things, but it's not important to address because unless the big things are addressed IMO the calculations are as useful as coin tosses.   What you should be using is something similar to the Hidden Markov model to statistically calculate the progression of each chain with BD chains having a 50% probability. If you want to use HMM analysis, skill individual breakdown (during the chain) rather than the entire chain as one is more useful data. If you didn't want to be super precise about everything, even a Bayesian approximation is more sound than this kind of calculation IMO.  I don't have time to do it myself atm and people here don't like maths anyway, so I don't theorycraft much anymore. Waste of my time and nobody appreciates it. Your testing data is very useful though, so great job on that!"
TeraOnline,3c4lh8,Garandou,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:25:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback. I agree my test was flawed but I didn't realize how flawed until you pointed this out. So far it sounds like I need to do the following:   remake the list of skills accounting for all scenarios (different levels of edge, all possible skill chains, and damage glyphs) Give extra weight to abilities that build edge (Any ideas how to do this without taking power away from Scythe? Thanks to /u/Iatii, I should be able to determine scythe damage at every edge level but I am unsure how to attribute this damage to Scythe and abilities that add edge) Determine an adjusted combination tier list which considers all combinations under all scenarios (different levels of edge, different glyphs, etc) which prioritizes blade draw usage. Use a suggested statistical method to model blade draw resets and analyze the effect of different stat rolls."
TeraOnline,3c4lh8,Garandou,2,Sun Jul 5 13:44:26 2015 UTC,"Np, this is by far the most extensive testing/calculation I've ever seen for Tera. So hats off to you.   remake the list of skills accounting for all scenarios (different levels of edge, all possible skill chains, and damage glyphs)   I believe the most useful data is individual skill breakdown with 2 values. E.g. BD with speed cast animation time and individual cast. That way it will be incredibly easy to imagine how each skill will transition from every other skill, delimiting your analysis from just chains. With the chain method you can only imagine CS->Traverse->BD for example, but if you have a speed cast and normal cast animation, you can chain any skill together in any sequence allowing you to find the true optimal. Some part chains can be kept in a chain like Traverse->BD and RF->BD, since we know those skills are abysmal when used alone and should never be used alone for DPS purposes.   Any ideas how to do this without taking power away from Scythe?    Because experienced warriors can generally fit scythe anywhere, I believe adding the scythe base damage per edge to each skill that gives edge as base damage should give a close enough approximation. For example: add approximately 700 base damage to DFA because it gives 1 edge. Then at the very end you calculate how much edge your 300 sec timer amassed, divide by 10 and add the speed cast time * number of scythes to your total time. So if you amassed 500 edge and speed scythe is 0.5 seconds, then your total time is 325 seconds.   Use a suggested statistical method to model blade draw resets and analyze the effect of different stat rolls.   This part is actually extremely complicated. I was going to code a program that brute forced all combinations of skills to obtain the perfect combo and build for any class, but gave up due to the enormous amount of testing/time required and the community's general disinterest in discussing theorycrafting properly.  I believe the ""perfect"" calculation requires you to collect the damage (with bonus from crit accounted for since some skills have crit glyphs), cast animation (normal + speed), CD for every skill then a brute force calculation by chaining each skill from every skill in a string of length X casts (where X is as large as your computer can handle).   I'm sure if you simplify it and assign only the top 3 priority skills at each junction manually you will be able to do this without the aid of a computer and it will very likely be accurate.  For BD resets assign a reset and a non-reset junction at each cast point and average the results."
TeraOnline,3c4lh8,TorrentRage,2,Sun Jul 5 14:49:46 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/vXxtxY6.jpg  I drew this to give you an idea on what a good model (without having to use heavy statistics) for warrior DPS would look like. This isn't perfect unlike the computer brute force, but for all functional purposes should be the best combo a human being can intuitively use (the computer might give a combo that cannot be repeated so you'll have to memorize tapping 500 skills in that exact order or something). Obviously the chains will look different at different CDR and AS values. I didn't actually look at the numbers when drawing that so the content might be completely wrong. I also clearly didn't consider other priority systems, so you might have to draw 10 different loops out yourself if you're not sure whether using cs -> rob straight away after charging -> bd is better or finishing all (or 2, 3, 4??) bd chains first, etc. Naturally CDR and AS roll will have different loops too, for example the filler section for CDR will be shorter because high priority skills will come up faster, etc.  Excuse my poor paint skills, but I hope this guides you in the right direction in how to optimize a perfect chain that is actually possible. Using this approach by calculating CD values and cast time, it's possible to follow the loop and obtain the DPS for each loop. For BD 50% junctions, alternate between them (i.e. select BD for one, next time you come to the same junction, select the other path). And just follow your loop until you've been to every BD junction at least twice and ended where the arrow points to your original starting point.  Edit: I accidentally left a vortexbd floating in the middle and didn't add the other 50% outcome to the traversebd chain in the middle. The RF on the right also shouldn't point to the Charging slash in the middle since you just went through filler combo the BD chain after will be 100% off CD, so it should point to a separate C slash chain with 100% BD. 12AM 5minute Microsoft Paint moments but w/e. You get the idea xD"
TeraOnline,3c4lh8,VOTWarrior,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"The diagram definitely helped me understand the ""junction"" concept you were making. I'll definitely give your advice a shot. My only concern with just adding up the edge and then adding back in scythe for every 10 edge is that I wonder if waiting for 10 edge is actually worse than just using scythe on cooldown regardless to edge. From /u/Iatii's comment, the extra damage for every additional edge past 3 is a fixed amount and thus experiences diminishing returns. I think I'll try your scenario and I'll also try adding in as many Scythes as possible while calculating how much edge is generated between each Scythe.  Edit: I tried cleaning up your diagram a bit. Is something like this what you meant? http://i.imgur.com/JDwXlc5.png"
TeraOnline,3c4lh8,VOTWarrior,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:19:21 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely give your advice a shot. My only concern with just adding up the edge and then adding back in scythe for every 10 edge is that I wonder if waiting for 10 edge is actually worse than just using scythe on cooldown regardless to edge.   Every edge gives fixed damage, therefore assuming scythe has a 0 second cast time, it would not matter when you scythe. But scythe has a non-zero cast time, so although scything at 9 edge is still much better than 11 edge, scything at exactly 10 edge every time will give a small damage boost.  To illustrate the concept:  If I generate 80 edge over 100 seconds:  Scything at 8 edge every time requires 10 scythes, scything at 10 edge every time requires 8 scythes. Although the damage is identical, I wasted a small amount of extra time scything.   Edit: I tried cleaning up your diagram a bit. Is something like this what you meant? http://i.imgur.com/JDwXlc5.png   Yup, I'm not sure if that diagram is possible though. Since if BD doesn't reset and you go into CS->RoB then CS again, both traverse and BD will still be on CD right?"
TeraOnline,3c4lh8,zeratos,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for your input. Yeah I don't think the skill rotation in the diagram is feasible without loads of cooldown reduction (it might be a good diagram for while Deadly Gamble is active), but you had already said that in your original post.   As for your 80 edge scenario, they don't deal the same damage. 10 scythes (using the edge damage glyph) at 8 edge deals an estimated 10*6291=62910 base damage vs 8 scythes at 10 edge deals an estimated 8*8331=66648... Well I'm going to stop here because it is now clear to me that 10 edge scythes not only deal more damage but will take less cast time clearly resulting in higher dps than using Scythe at lower edge levels. Yay crisis averted and less work for me! :D"

I'm going to go ahead and push out an update to my guide for now, but I think I will try to make attack speed/cooldown reduction specific rotation in my next tests. Maybe I could look into one of those statistical methods you mentioned before too. Oh and you were asking before about a creating a list of abilities with different cast times?

Sure rising fury 3rd hit is less dps than combo attacking, but what if you only have a short time and no decent chains to do before you know you need to iframe. According to your methods you should just auto attack until you need to iframe instead of using rising fury, while other people will use rising fury and then iframing. Or even it implies that walking with rising fury is worse than combo attack, especially if you only need to go a short distance.  The lack of involving edge whatsoever kinda fucks up this entire guide with the fact that involves a warrior where edge is what you play around."

None of these classes do damage comparable to a DPS class. On the other hand, they get very quick dungeon queues so you can level solely through dungeons if you want.  Otherwise, leveling is pretty fast regardless of how you do it. You can grind mobs, grind dungeons, grind dungeons solo, do story quests, and even spice it up with PvP past level 30."
TeraOnline,3c5y90,Maddyp,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:19:07 2015 UTC,"That lancer was attacking faster then I've ever seen myself do. Is the video sped up slightly, or is gear at 65 the reason?  That charging lunge and spring attack hit like mini guns. I see him block canceling everything he dishes out (both to survive and to move faster) but even then, he's pretty damn quick."
TeraOnline,3c5y90,shadowxshark,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:09:26 2015 UTC,"At work so I am hesitant to load up the video and watch it myself, but he probably has a quick weapon with energetic etchings on it. It's just good to have shorter animation frames because then you can weave in more attacks/shouts to hold aggro in between blocking attacks."
TeraOnline,3c5y90,loneleh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:59:33 2015 UTC,"In my opinion healers and tanks has the most enjoyable leveling experience of them all, due to the very fast queues through the Instance Matching System.

These topics span a broad range and I could practically spend an hour writing something that doesn't answer your question.   I have always loved healing in other games but I also hate not being able to solo well or at all so I was considering lancer. That way I can still be a big team support but maybe have the ability to solo stuff.   Copy pasting my answer to a different thread:  Because soloing dungeons to level is the only purpose soloing a dungeon serves. For all other content in the game that's relevant (endgame), you're going to need a party. Exceptions apply where you run the only 1 man dungeon in the game (or solo vault), or where you're vastly over-geared for a dungeon (by which point running that dungeon serves no purpose). Soloing other dungeons are very much possible, but are both extremely difficult and not worth your time."
TeraOnline,3c5y90,SourDinkleberry,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:02:25 2015 UTC,"To elaborate on   Soloing other dungeons are very much possible, but are both extremely difficult and not worth your time,   Tera has a party reward buff called ""Joy of Partying."" It is an automatic buff that increases dungeon drop rates/rewards depending on the number of players you have in your party in the same instance. The more people you have in the instance the higher the drop rate.  In addition, 1 person will have to do the dps of 3 combined while dodging boss attacks because there is no tank to give you 100% back time, AND no buffs from priest/mystic (solo end game dungeons in 30 minutes? prob not), AND little to no endurance debuffs).  So basically you're trying to solo instances with plenty of handicaps with decreased rewards.. why bother?"

Other than cosmetics i do not see a really big reason why Tera EU is bad... i mean im all in for the Dungeons and game content rather than cosmetics... if that is the only thing that is bad about Tera EU which is cosmetic and NOT game content then i do not mind playing EU and my ping in EU is not bad at all its smooth for me and all i care about is the pve content and whether or not i can play it...  Is there any other reasons that the people leaving EU to NA other than the Tera club and cosmetics or does it have to do with the game content?
TeraOnline,3c595w,niyaz_ul,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:29:17 2015 UTC,"Here are the things that are different, there are more but these make a difference:  1.Tera EU availability of MWA,MES,SES,CCB,dyads, this is most basic stuffs to clear endgames, this should be available for everyone . Recently they somewhat fixed mwa,mes issue but i would say its nowhere close to NA.Gamefirg introduce something called Veteran Masterwork Alkahests  (copied Tera Na  veguadian masterwork box).  Still the issue of SES ,CCB and dyads is not fixed. IN  Tera NA you get all those if you try.Like say when you kill bams,world bosses ,they drop CCP,SES,fashion coupons. You can also get SES and MES from kumaboxes and seachest.  I don’t want to spend much time on explaining why these things are important you can find it yourself. Simple I can say, if you want to live you need water, if you want to clear endgame dungeons you need those.  2.Waste less time gain more items, that’s the whole Na theme I would say. When you login you get federation bill, which can be use to buy xp boost to lvl up faster, buy some things like permanent shape changer ,mounts, and many more on EU you don’t get them for free,either spend lots of money or buy in game gold.  3.More events and more active community, Na you have lost of events ,this event sometimes give you a helping hand if you want to clear end game dungeons, i still remember there was a n event which dropped superior dyads ,yes you heard it right, superior dyads. This was something i really liked, czu i spend less gold on crux more on consumables for the dungeons. Global is always active, there are more than 2 pages full of lfg which will most likely not happen in EU. Why active community is important? Well you have more chance to find people to do dungeons and do other stuff liek daily venguardian quests,cs,kuma.  4.This is very important and the reason people like NA more. The communication between players and ENmass ,Na get feedback from players and make changers according to the users feedback on the other in EU gameforg don’t even care what you think, all they want is more money lol, like what they did to ghiligades, they open it for club members only and it dropped vm4 mats lol. That alone you can see gameforg is not a good pulisher.  That’s some few things, that you might need to know..There is internet you can search lol,i tried to find the thread on gameforg forum that says lot about the Tear EU players opinion on gameforg  but they have deleted it lol."

TeraOnline,3c38b6,Forgotten_Aeon,2,Thu Jul 9 21:24:59 2015 UTC,"To elaborate a bit more on your Mystic question, Mystics can certainly heal any content. The differences between Mystics and Priests are myriad but mostly revolve around play style. For example, Priest buffs are applied at the start of a run and last passively on each party member for a set amount of time (at least ten minutes). Mystic buffs are auras, which are a constant AoE centered on the mystic (they have a large range) and drain mana whilst active. The Mystic power buff, Titanic Wrath, grants 40 power to affected party members, but has to be reapplied frequently. The Priest power buff, Blessing of Shakan, grants 25 power, but lasts for 15 minutes.   You'll hear some stupid things like ""15 power isn't an important difference at end-game/with highly geared players"", or the same kind of thing about crit factor, but when people are losing their minds over a 1 or 2 power difference crystal someone has equipped, it's clear this isn't the case.   To summarise it as accurately (and as generally) as I can, Priests have stronger pure healing, and long-lasting buffs. Mystics have less powerful heals, and their buffs need to be managed and reapplied in combat or cost mana continually, but are stronger. In the end they're both very capable healers, and the REAL difference is in their play style; you'll find playing as a Mystic a lot more active, hectic, and even stressful compared to playing a Priest. In the interests of transparency, I play both, and enjoy both, but I do prefer the focus and attention that playing a Mystic demands.   And welcome to Tera!"
TeraOnline,3c38b6,Garandou,2,Sat Jul 4 11:54:04 2015 UTC,"hectic, and even stressful compared to playing a Priest   I never understood why having to put in more work is considered a ""playstyle"" for some. Clearly if playing a class to same effect is more stressful, it clearly requires more input to be effective, hence underpowered, right?"
TeraOnline,3c38b6,TheZanno,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:45:29 2015 UTC,no its more like ones better single target healer so works better when your team actually dodges and the others a better aoe Healer. Though as for priest Power buff people forget energy stars which also adds power and attack speed.
TeraOnline,3c38b6,Garandou,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:24:28 2015 UTC,"In theory that sounds great, but in practice priests are just as effective as mystics when everyone dodges.   Priests are more effective when people don't dodge by far, and equally effective when nobody takes damage. See the problem?"
TeraOnline,3c38b6,TheZanno,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:59:08 2015 UTC,Crit+power vs straight power also gives high incentive to play mystic also a low CD burst heal belongs to mystic that can hit multiple people if aimmed well. also mystic adds dps to the mix over just healing so when there is idol time for a priest the mystic causes damage. Also for raids a priest+mystic is far more dangerous then 2 priests or 2 mystics
TeraOnline,3c38b6,Garandou,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:54:08 2015 UTC,Also for raids a priest+mystic is far more dangerous then 2 priests or 2 mystics   OK. This is a point I can accept. At least there's 1 reason mystics are good right?
TeraOnline,3c38b6,Forgotten_Aeon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:59:02 2015 UTC,"I... Well, alright.   You can understand the difference between getting a bot to play a class for you and doing it yourself, I assume? And by extension, that some classes require more extensive use of a wider array of skills than others? A sorcerer is very often used as an example of a class that requires a lot of work, and that the rotation is a lot more complex than, say, a gunners.   Great. Now, back to the topic at hand, being priest and mystic, here is one very simple example. The priest casts Shakan at the dungeon entrance. The party gets 25 power, very likely until the end of the dungeon- the priest now can focus on healing. The mystic casts Titanic Wrath at the start of the dungeon. The party gets 40 power. A short time into the boss fight, the buff is about to expire, so the mystic has to position herself appropriately to reapply the buff to as many party members as possible. The mystic cannot simply focus on healing- she has to keep an eye on the timer for Titanic Wrath. 25 power vs 40 power. More power in exchange for more work. More things to think about and manage. And yes, that's more enjoyable for myself and many others.   It's not about highest DPS for the least amount of buttons pressed for many people. Certainly not for me. If your idea of fun while playing this game is the above, that's fine too- we all have different tastes, and liking things easier is no crime nor fault.   When it comes to healing, I play the role because it is a traditionally difficult and yes, stressful job. Not stressful in a bad way- it requires focus, and reflexive actions, and quick thinking. People are counting on you all the time. There is no rotation. And while this is true for both priests and mystics, the latter almost always have something to do that needs to be done- whether that's dropping motes, reapplying TW, positioning yourself for a multi-target pulse, refreshing totem, tagging curse before the enfeeble drops, summoning and directing thralls to help with certain boss mechanics, interrupting certain attacks with one of the many CC skills, dispelling certain buffs- the list goes on. Or, of course, one could spam healing immersion until the reset doesn't proc, in which case you would pre-lock focus heal and use purify whenever a HP bar turns purple. Oversimplification? Yes. But I hope this makes it easier for you to understand why it really is a matter of personal playstyle, and has nothing to do with being underpowered."
TeraOnline,3c38b6,Garandou,2,Sat Jul 4 14:01:30 2015 UTC,"You can understand the difference between getting a bot to play a class for you and doing it yourself, I assume?   Yes. If a class can clear a dungeon while afk with a pet bot and be equally effective, then it's the stronger class. Basically there is no reason to pick a more complicated class unless it performs better at the highest level from a balance/min-max perspective. Mystics don't perform better, they perform worse if both classes are played optimally.   25 power vs 40 power. More power in exchange for more work.   Energy star, triple nemesis, healing circle, mana charge exists you know? Mystics need to apply wrath buff and VoC constantly, priests have 4 things they need to do.   It's not about highest DPS for the least amount of buttons pressed for many people. Certainly not for me. If your idea of fun while playing this game is the above,   My concern was a question about balance not fun. There is no logical argument that can be used for or against fun.    Or, of course, one could spam healing immersion until the reset doesn't proc, in which case you would pre-lock focus heal and use purify whenever a HP bar turns purple.

TeraOnline,3c38b6,Forgotten_Aeon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"Corruption ring, healing totem, and motes exist too. Neither class is brain-dead; they're healers. OP was asking if Mystics were viable, and I've seen a lot of priest circlejerking over the recent weeks on here. My goal was to pre-empt that and to make it clear that they're both very capable healers, and that their differences lie mostly in, yes, playstyle.   Look, your position is very clear, and you very obviously prefer what a Priest offers. Radical- I'm happy you're confident in your choice and enjoy the game.   OP I'd suggest trying both classes if you've the inclination, and pick the one you like the feel of the most!"
TeraOnline,3c38b6,Garandou,3,Sat Jul 4 14:20:20 2015 UTC,"Corruption ring is essentially never used by any mystic in most situations. Healing totem is near useless (a weaker version of priest Balder buff), and motes are healing spells (we're not counting heals).   and I've seen a lot of priest circlejerking over the recent weeks on here.   That's because it's actually true. Priests give 73 power, 13 attack speed, 10% damage. Mystics 1.1x more base crit factor, 40 power and 9% damage.  How much is 33 power bonus priest gives worth on a 170 power target? 12.2%. How much is 13% attack speed worth? About 10% damage. Priest endurance -10% is obviously better than mystic 9%. How much is 50 crit factor from mystics worth at 30% base crit chance? 20% assuming your DPS are all 1337 and back crit every hit. It's worth less otherwise.  Priest damage buffs are superior mathematically.   Look, your position is very clear, and you very obviously prefer what a Priest offers.   Use your brain and think about this statement. CC is not applicable in endgame so what do both healers offer? Healing and damage. Both healers offer the exact same things. One healer offers more of both.  Don't even get me started on QoL issues, like mystic cleanse being so much slower."

TeraOnline,3c38b6,Garandou,0,Sat Jul 4 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"*So I started as an Elin but started to really hate my choice of race. I want to change to Castanic, but of course that requires 25k gold. My question is, is it faster for me to restart my 63 zerk as a castanic, or hit 65 and grind for 25k to switch?   25k will take 3-5 hours to grind for an experienced 65 player. For a beginner it can take a while. I suggest restart if you're not experienced.   *That leads me to my next question, how DOES one make money when they hit 65? I tried asking a few people but just got trolled. I looked for guides but ended up finding out that they were outdated. I know this is probably an annoying question, but I would love an answer!   Right now BRHM spam (2k gold every 15min). Obviously this will change in a few days when the major patch hits.   *How important is crafting? Will I be at a disadvantage if I ignore it? I usually don't craft in MMOs, but if it's really important then I suck it up and do it.   You can usually earn 0.5 gold per point of PP in weapon/armor crafting. So you're losing out on 1k gold a day if you don't craft.   *Are mystics proper endgame healers when compared to priests? I'm thinking about making an alt healer.   Yes, but they're definitely weaker. People always say stupid shit like ""priests carry noobs, mystics carry pros"" but the reality is mystics just carry less than priests and pros don't need carry."
TeraOnline,3c38b6,IamTHEwolfYEAH,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:55:06 2015 UTC,"Everything he said, but in regards to making money you should also be doing Vanguard quests from the 'H' menu.  The second-to-last quest listed at the bottom is a collection quest.  Those are easy to do and get you vanguard credits.  You can do 5 of them every day (on each lvl65 character you have).  The normal-mob kill quests right next to that are also easily done and score you some feedstock as well as vanguard credits.  One of the five daily kill quests is a pain in the butt (not difficult just time consuming), the other 4 are really easy.  Every day I try to do my collection quests on every 65 I have, and I do the kill quests until I get the one thats a pain in the ass to do, then I stop.  Vanguard credits can be used to purchase crystals, glyphs, or alkahest boxes (alkahest boxes will net you the most gold per vanguard point for the time being.  this could change after the patch on tuesday).  There are a couple of vendors you can go to for these things, the easiest ones to find are in highwatch near the banker/trade broker/teleport platform.  edit addition: in addition to doing dailies and collecting vanguard credits, running the lvl65 instances will get you a good bit of money each run.  Feedstock sells well on the trade broker."

Best looking to.  Money can be gained by crafting stuff, battlegrounds give gems, and some dungeons drop stuff worth money.  Crafting only matters if you need the stuff that is crafted.

TeraOnline,3c38b6,swiftstylus,0,Sat Jul 4 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"As far as the mystics thing, you are comparing large scale healing to small scale healing. In large pro groups, you wont need a healer, but when you do, the mystic will be focused on the tank, while the priest does literally every other person. This means the tank can take huge damage, and get more focused healing. The priest can look on the entirety of the team and heal them basically all at once, but usually that isn't needed.  Priest are more convenient to the dps, while mystics are great for small skirmish healing in pvp."

TeraOnline,3c30n5,pqkluan,2,Sat Jul 4 20:43:46 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add one more pretty important thing. Sometimes the boss will reset if it cannot reach you, even if you can deal damage to it and you're within its aggro range. This happened to me once in BRHM where a wave glitched me through the fence. At first I thought it to be a pretty good thing because I could just spam aggro without the fear of taking damage but after several failed attacks (~30s) the fish was done with my shenanigans. It reset from ~15% and priest managed to pull me back in after several tries."
TeraOnline,3c30n5,Kokumai,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:39:42 2015 UTC,"Bosses reset when they no longer have aggro.  This can occur either through every party member who is currently engaging them dying, thus resetting their aggro, or if the tank who holds aggro leaves the roam zone for the boss, i.e running away from a BAM in open world. BAMs have their own radius set out for each spawn that decides how far away each BAM can run from its original spawning point, thus when a BAM resets it runs back to its original spawning point to complete its reset. This can also be induced by skills such as Feign Death and Stoneskin - If they are used with only one player eligible for Aggro within the bosses aggro table, the boss will reset as the player essentially induces aggro-death."

You have to let the lock-on settle on the player for a tiny period of time before the servers will recognize that you've actually locked onto someone.

The Open world PvP does sometimes make things more interesting, I always have my complete crystalbind on so I'm never worried about losing crystals if I get ganked while farming or something.  Getting ganked doesn't happen often, however if you get easily salty when getting ganked while mining a rock or something once in a while then a PvP Server isn't for you.    Aside From the open world PvP, this server seems to be a lot more active in not only PvP stuff (Like GvG's, BG's, ETC), the LFG for making PvE parties is more active as well.  In both CH and Highwatch, GvG's and BG's are almost non existant other then to do dailies.  Also, near all the PvE heroes are way less friendly and way more picky on who they take on runs.    In the end, though more competitive, MT has felt like a more welcoming server.  There's constantly new guilds being formed and even the veteran guilds have core players whom are welcoming to qualified new recruits."

TeraOnline,3c1a0l,Kumasylum,2,Sun Jul 5 05:30:12 2015 UTC,"Town, City , Around dungeon entances, Camps, Alliance halls has safe zones (no pvp), rest is open world pvp. Many people think that this is all time people killing anything they see on sight. Nope, most people don't do open world pvp. Also you need to be careful when killing someone just too easy to get infamy if you don't watch out. Other case some people pvp and hunt for easy kills, but this is rare. Sometimes you see some groups going around to pvp people, but not much. Some areas like around Trading post might have more pvp in channel 1 , but that's it. So it is worth to come into PVP server from PVE server. YES! I came from TR to MT and have had some fun fights random times, even made some friends. For example, I saw this sorc coming on me all red and I managed to kill him and in the end we had chat and now he is friend of mine.

It could be good if the devs had any interest in making it a worthwhile part of the game but sadly there doesn't seem to be any interest. What you end up with is people camping quest locations to attack people who are trying to do their PvE activities and in my experience this sort of person falls into one or more of the following categories;  1) Ganking lowbies  2) So bad they feel the need to attack a player who is at best unprepared or at worst fighting a BAM  3) Are running around in full +15 BIS PvP gear  That said this is all more or less avoidable if you play on any channel other than 1.

A death is a death, and the only way to avoid losing crystals is a crystalbind. I recommend having a complete crystalbind going at all times at higher levels (whenever it is that fine hardy crystals start being worth more than complete crystalbinds). Not because pvp is a serious threat, but rather because shit happens: you make a fatal mistake, or suffer technical difficulties in the middle of a fight, or some higher level outlaw just passing by one shots you as an afterthought; it's better to be safe than out a few hundred gold, and face the inconvenience of tracking down more crystals."

After that run Inferno NM and Timescape NM to learn the mechanics, maybe get the new set from there. Once you get good at those do HM and get the BiS gear. From there you can get Lucid if you want, but its very expensive."
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,FuzionBoost,4,Sat Jul 4 05:00:05 2015 UTC,Check the trainer to see if you've actually learned all your highest ranked skills - learning them from the skills menu is bugged for reapers.
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,euvie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:26:35 2015 UTC,I have checked it. I heard about that bug too and nothing was there :(
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,EndlessRambler,4,Sat Jul 4 05:46:24 2015 UTC,Wait until the reaper buffs next patch to help you out.  As it stands right now reaper single target damage is not very good sadly. (Although in +12 disco you should be fine for SC/BRHM the people kicking you are being unreasonable)
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,Kana_and_Flan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, Reapers are good dps. Without any more information, how are supposed to help? What are your crystals and gear? What skill rotations are you using? What are things you find yourself struggling with?"
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,Kana_and_Flan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:21:16 2015 UTC,"Depending on the instance or what I am doing depends on my skill rotation. For example if I'm doing brhm; I'll open up with shadow reaping then go cable step into shadow burst, into pendulum, into whipsaw. Then I'll do smite into spiral, shear, grim, and finally sundering. I'll repeat that as much as I can until buff runs out. I'll also use retribution whenever its needed. I run the standard pve crystals. Reds: focused, bitter, savage, and carving. Blues: hardyx4. Greens: keenx3 and 1 power (going for full keen)"
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,Kana_and_Flan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:37:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't open with Reaping and then go into Cable Step. Even with the reduced cooldown, you still have travel time and Cable Step will bump you around even at point blank. Shadow Burst doesn't benefit at all from Reaping, so you're sinking a significant amount of time for no real gain.  If you're going to using Reaping, try to get into a position where you can cast Death Spiral - Double Shear - Grim Strike - Sundering Strike without any breaks for the full duration. Don't even use Grim Strike resets at that time, just move on to Sundering and repeat. As long as you have a 15% Nostrum, Sundering Strike will be coming off cooldown as soon as Grim Strike finishes, so you can hammer the entire time without pause.  Be careful about overusing Retribution, as it can slingshot you out of position a decent way. Time spent getting back into position for back-crits is diminished dps. Not saying you are, but it's a thing I've seen happen with a lot of Reapers.  Depending on your crit rating, you might get more damage by switching from Carving to Pounding. 130~145 bonus crit factor is a good place to make the switch.  Other than that it sounds like you have the standard rotations down. Cable Step - Shadow Burst, Pedulum Strike - Whipsaw, and Death Spiral - Double Shear - Grim Strike - Sundering Strike.   You might be able to refine your damage a bit more through glyphs if you care to share (or want opinions on it at all), but you are on the right track to dealing damage.  Keep in mind a lot of people just hate Reapers in general. :/"
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,Caneocan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:07:20 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for this info. It has helped me a lot. I didn't even notice I was wasting time doing cable and shadow burst. Thank you so much.
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,Kana_and_Flan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:26:55 2015 UTC,Any time. Good luck on your future reaping endeavors!
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,Caneocan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:39:48 2015 UTC,I think its better to do Pendulum strike -> Whipsaw -> Grim Strike -> Sundering strike and repeat during shadow reaping rather than the Death Spiral combo
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,Kana_and_Flan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"Doing Pendulum Strike twice is going to push you out of range, so you're still losing time to reposition.   Just adding the base damages, Spiral to Sundering deals more flat damage. Whipsaw has a much higher chance to crit (which would increase your damage), but will also push you out of range from Pendulum Strike very quickly.  Edit: I'm going to give it a try later on. Seems like it could result in more damage, although also seems a bit riskier. Sounds like a fun test."
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,Caneocan,2,Sat Jul 4 20:12:07 2015 UTC,You hold w to move forward as you are casting grim strike and sundering strike. This moves your character forward back to the initial position so you can pendulum strike backwards. This combo will never put you out of range as I always do it myself. The crits do result in MUCH more damage than the Spiral combo imo.
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,Kana_and_Flan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I gave it a try on Forengula since he likes to stun-lock himself for a good spell right at the beginning. You said Pendulum - Whipsaw - Grim - Sundering, right? I had a friend running a dps meter and actually did significantly less damage than the Spiral combo.  Was only one run of each, I'll give it some more testing later tonight."
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,Caneocan,2,Sat Jul 4 22:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was the combo. Hmm well I've never used the dps meter so I dunno, it always seemed like I did more damage with that combo compared to Spiral one but I may be wrong. Could you do more tries and let me know, you may have gotten lucky/unlucky with crits and also buffs/debuffs like plague and triple nemisis and warrior edge. Maybe like 5-10 of each to really make sure (I know thats a lot of runs lol) I tried on the turtle boss in brhm since he stands still a lot and its easy to hit the back. How many sundering do you get of with each combo? With the Pendulum/Whipsaw one I can get off 4 sundering and 4-5 whipsaw a depending on if I have to reposition. And sometimes sundering is up for a 5th after reaping ends."
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,random4lyf,2,Sat Jul 4 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"I did a more controlled test this morning, solo forengula to make sure no one else was mucking up the numbers. Monkey isn't hard to solo and you only need to get Forengula to ~96% before he'll charge a rock and get knocked over.  Initially I was either getting nothing but crits on grim strike or my friends forgot I was trying to test and blew some cooldowns. Going solo the difference between Whipsaw and Spiral combos was only 1% of Forengula's health.  Same Sundering potential, 4 and then a 5th after it all ends. I'll run it some more when I have time and let you know how it shakes out with more extensive testing. Five or so shots.  Edit: I could also record some of the runs if you wanted to see footage. Going solo means I don't have the dps meter anymore so it's pretty much winging it off the bosses' HP bar."
TeraOnline,3c2ok8,random4lyf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:37:00 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for the effort! I could see if I could download the dps meter and try it for myself also. What server are you on maybe we can talk ingame?

TeraOnline,3c1qki,ThePurpleKnightmare,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:03:31 2015 UTC,"All races run the same speed.  Race differences are all very negligable.  If you like Baraka, play Baraka.  If you want to be .5% better than other races, Elin are better than everyone else for just about every class (there are exceptions and I don't know them).    The differences between races you will encounter (other than racial skills) are reach (elin lancers can hit targets 1m further away than other races), animation time (elin berserkers have the fastest flatten animation), and hitbox (elin are tiny, baraka are huge).  If you are concentrating on PvE I wouldn't worry about these differences.  In PvP if you are going to be trying to be the best in the world, maybe you should consider making an Elin priest.  The main reason is that you're tiny, so you're harder to find and harder to target or shoot.  Another thing to consider: I saw in a video guide for sorcs is that this player preferred Popori because they're tiny and have very small casting animations.  They're not quicker, but they're harder for other players to read.  tl;dr - play whichever race you like the best unless you want to min/max, then you should probably play Elin."

On the other hand, it doesn't look like the new Rageblade shards need to be refined for Wroth (but do for Schisma).

TeraOnline,3c0ipn,iCastiel,2,Sat Jul 4 00:33:02 2015 UTC,The easiest way to do ghilliglade is to take your time and finish all the previous rooms. if you do boith rooms you can choose a buff for the last boss. one is healing and one is dmg. its easy to do if you invest in the previous rooms instead of straight out going for the last boss. You can skip rooms once you got good enough gear.

I mean sure aspd is nice but with the DFA/ER proc and Energy Stars, aspd doesn't help DPS as much. That means if you were to compare yourself and another warrior with Intense side by side (assuming everything else to be the same), the warrior with Intense would do 6.9% more damage than you on every single hit.  http://tera-forums.enmasse.com/forums/warrior/topics/is-pounding-better-than-forceful-for-dps-warrior?page=1#post-1246812 ""If you have intense weapon (which you should, as a warrior)"""
TeraOnline,3bzpsu,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:22:49 2015 UTC,"Why would I do only one thing when the class can do both?   There are a huge number of warriors what run with quick weapons as due to the scaricity of lancers, warriors (that can tank), are tanking more often than not now.  Intense has one completely useless base roll for a tank (Damage from behind), quick has 4.5% aspd instead of that, 1 aspd roll makes a huge difference to a warriors skill flow, so most warriors roll that below the line anyway, with a quick weapon you can roll CDR below the line, 7.2% may seem little initially, but with nostrums & that cdr roll, a war can cut down the downtime of deadly gamble significantly.  I generally have a 50%+ crit rate in BRHM/SCNM with +190 crit factor just because I can keep deadly gamble up so much.  Also mystics do exist, cant have e-stars when there is no priest.  TLDR, quick weap is good for both things for war, intense is slightly better for DPS only and worse for tanking, only wars that are 100% sure that they will almost never tank should get intense."

TeraOnline,3bzx2s,waffleninja777,7,Fri Jul 3 14:43:56 2015 UTC,"As you're new to MMOs I'll share with you a few thoughts on keybinding in general:  The main thing is you should do what is comfortable for you. Old timers like me may be set in our ways but half of why I do things are because I've been doing them that way for a long time or because of the size of my hands and my particular dexterity and coordination. Take all advice, including mine, with a grain of salt.  And speaking of comfort, take seriously the distance your hand has to move. I use WASD (more on that below) and with the size of my hands I am comfortable pressing 1-5 without losing my resting position. Some people can hit through 6, some only to 4, but if you overreach in the middle of a fight and have to pause and look down at the keys to re-position your hand after you realize you're pressing the wrong buttons, then you've wasted precious seconds, and seconds are often the difference between victory and defeat. Your left hand should never fully leave where it sits on the movement keys.  Also, consider consistency in your bindings between different classes and different games. For example, my keybindings for some generic but important abilities that are in almost every game - interrupt, auto run, mount, self-heal (pot or ability), mana regen, etc. - are always the same place for me. As you begin to develop your personal keyboard layout, it will help your transitions between characters and games to have some consistencies.  Movement: First, though it doesn't apply to TERA, never spin/turn with the keyboard; leave that for the mouse. You need to be able to move forward and backward and strafe left and right. Most will tell you to use WASD though some recommend ESDF, essentially shifting your left hand one button to the right and opening up more keys to the left. I was unable to make that change and don't generally recommend it because it just feels so damn awkward, especially when you transition to and from typing, but for someone new you might give it a shot.  General keybinding: With character movement and hand movement in mind, the main thing to do is take full advantage of the keyboard real estate that's left. Assuming WASD for movement, Q, E, R and F are prime along with ~ and 1-5 (or 4 or 6), Z and C below are solid and X and V are decent as are T and G. Double or triple up with SHIFT, CTRL or ALT modifiers. Usually you'll only need one to get through everything, and I recommend resting your hand on your movement keys and seeing where your little finger rests. Use that one primarily.  That's the bulk of it, although a very brief synopsis. The only other thing I would recommend to you if you continue to enjoy gaming, and particularly MMOs as they tend to require significantly more keybinding, you might consider upgrading your equipment.  Mouse: A less expensive but incredibly helpful upgrade would be an MMO mouse which adds several configurable buttons your right thumb can press. As an example, check out the Logitech G600 for what I'm referring to. Each of those buttons can be configured, bound, and modified by keyboard combinations. Having a good mouse is important, having a good mouse that also adds a ton more easily accessible buttons to bind can make a huge difference. In particular, I can't more highly recommend the G600. It's comfortable, responsive, and the buttons have a good feel, including tactile reference that means I don't have to look away from the screen to see where my thumb is. I also own a Razer Naga which, unless you prefer to spend more on a cheaply made product with less feedback and more flashy lights, I can't recommend. (To be fair, if you have particularly small hands it would likely be more comfortable.)  Keyboard: This is more expensive and may have less return for you, because at the end of the day it really is personal preference, but a good mechanical keyboard can be immensely enjoyable and helpful. Aside from general comfort and less fatigue, their feedback is more obvious which means easier and faster key presses."
TeraOnline,3bzx2s,benmrii,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:12:02 2015 UTC,"Great post, covers everything.   Personally I use esdf, rest my index to ring finger on movement keys and have my pinky for the most frequently used keys (a and q) while using alt (pressed with thumb) to double up on my bindings. That way I can easily reach every ability of my warrior, and they have quite a lot.   https://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/3aiqbe/how_should_i_do_keymapping_skills_with_reaper/cse9ga2  Regarding the transition, I have to say it was actually pretty easy to adapt to the new binding. I suppose that doing this with new characters is easier though because you only slowly get access to all the skills and have enough time to memorize bindings, compared to when changing everything at once."
TeraOnline,3bzx2s,Yisery,4,Fri Jul 3 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"I found it much easier to bind my chain skills to tab as opposed to space bar. This was initially because a dungeon mechanic required you to often jump to remove a debuff, and pressing space bar caused me to use skills that I didn't intend to use. It gives you more control over whether you want to jump or use a chained skill. In battle grounds, where tab is reserved for the score interface, I moved the shortcut to the tilde key."

I've tried copying the hotbar setups from the teratoday guides and find them nearly unusable.  What I like doing is turning on the extended hotbar and rebinding a few important keys. If you look at your hand placement on the left side of your keyboard, your fingers are always on awsd. What keys are all around those keys and easily reachable without contorting your hand every fight? Q, E, R, T, F, Z, X, C, Tab.  Go to your keybinds and change everything with those keys to Alt+qertfzxcTab. Now they are free to be reassigned for skills you use often on you extended hotbar. A gaming mouse with the buttons on the side of it gives a few more options for keybinds as well.  Edit... Lol I pretty much mirrored what was already said by others. ^"

It's literally about profit margins - you aren't gonna make huge amounts in a single sale but lots and lots of little sales add up because consumables are always in demand. Also means you can save money by crafting your own consumables.  Etching is mostly RNG based. You can generally turn a profit with perma etchings/dendrites but sometimes you'll get no crits and sometimes you'll get all crits. If you can deal with that it has the advantage of being easy to get into because the introductory quest basically raises you to artisan level right off the bat.

TeraOnline,3bv8zz,Xivaxi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:58:17 2015 UTC,People that are still in idoneal v1 might want to go for idoneal v2 since it's non-enchantable yet still pretty comparable to ambit v2 (you'd still need to enchant ambit v2 for it to be better than idoneal v2).  So let's say you're in Idoneal v1. Your options for PVE are to either go Idonealv1 -> Idonealv2 -> VM5 PVE/Discov2  or Idonealv1 -> VM5PVE/Discov2

Just as molten tokens in the past (if you've played back then), current ambit tokens will continue to serve the same purpose as before, and the new cosmoshards will be used for ambit 2.   The additive purpose of the tokens, which was feedstock, is getting a huge blow as well. The exchange rate of tokens (assuming boots because it's the most efficient) to T7 feedstock is about 126:1 2:1 (quick brain math, correct me if I'm mistaken), meaning you'd need 2150 is 250 or so tokens per enchanting attempt."

From what i understand from the information given and what ktera says, Berserkers can only really tank the first few endgame instances and normal mode, for hard mode and the rest you're definitely going to want a lancer or a warrior.   Warrior is hard, most people don't play it optimally, but if you can figure it out, you'll love the class. Took me a while to get down my warrior. You don't need to do every single quest to level up, grinding off bams and in some places, normal mobs is much faster.  http://teratoday.com/content/tera-guide/tera-general-guide/tera-leveling-guide  The only thing questing is really good for is if you want the story and the gold, especially with elite status."

Impact is a modifier that affects your ability to knock down. This stat is built passively and PRIMARILY comes from your weapon, not jewelry. Judging from the overall value of impact, 123 impact is nearly negligible.   100% use the bloodwise over your idoneal, HOWEVER, the optimal setup is 3x Deathwise (set bonus necklace, earring, ring) and 2x firetrill (earring, ring) for DPS; so later you'd need to switch out the bloodwise."

TeraOnline,3byw9e,Alvatore,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:23:59 2015 UTC,"I recently transferred a character off of Celestial Hills prior to the free transfer event. There were costumes and accessories from other un-transferred characters involved in this. Upon logging into this character on the new server, all the costumes and accessories that had been put into the transferred character's inventory were now bound to that character and were wearable.  Shortly after, I moved all my characters from Tempest Reach to Highwatch during the free event. I shuffled costumes around between characters since I wanted to change which ones had which costumes/accessories and did my eight character transfers. All the costumes re-bound to the character whose inventory they were in and are wearable by that character."
TeraOnline,3byw9e,SourDinkleberry,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:12:13 2015 UTC,No. Costumes do not get re-bound and won't be usable on the new server. You'll have to contact support.

If an item cannot be rebound to the second character (Elin only costume, but you changed to Castanic for example), the the item becomes unbound.   Because this is generally a sketchy thing to do, GM's tend to do it only so many times before your account as a whole becomes flagged and they will discontinue doing this for you.   Edit: As a disclaimer, regulations may have changed. Judging by some quick research, I found several cases of people getting denied item rebounding through GM's out-right."

I do know that the double server transfer people did to rebind items was considered an exploit and I do believe it has been patched. I couldn't find the source for this.  The way that I understand it is that each character has an hidden ID without respect to that character's IGN. When you bind an item, it gets bound to the hidden ID (possessed solely by EME) NOT to the IGN. A server transfer as a result has no effects on this. The item will be renamed as having been bound to the new character, but in reality the item remains bound to the hidden ID of the initial character and is therefore not useable.

It isn't. It pales in comparison to ToB in terms of aggro and cast time. The only time I really use it is at the beginning of a fight.  Or on Darkan when he does fire wing.

TeraOnline,3buv3g,Exayex,7,Thu Jul 2 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"You essentially have to use a master enigmatic scroll on an item.  It has a 3% chance to masterwork the item, allowing it the +12. You also must use an intricate identification scroll after each attempt.  Even after all of this, you still need to re roll for correct stats which is also RNG based and also enchant it to +12. I used 75 of both scrolls on my weapon before getting it to masterwork. I used 110 on my gloves and never got it.  It's costly and boring to sit in town repeatedly clicking scrolls. And on top of it +15ing your gear is even more costly and RNG based. Also all my gold I made, even with my elite boost, was going to this. Just couldn't stand farming the same shitty dailies and low tier dungeons to get gold to sit in town and click scrolls for such a minute chance for it to work.   Overall it's a very poor, Korean system that wastes a lot of time and money and is required due to how powerful the enchants are.   I would rather a system like WoW where you could spend the majority of your time farming the mats and then just auto enchant.  Not this system, where farming is inefficient, and you have to sit in town clicking scrolls endlessly.   Edit: I should add that I really, really liked Tera.  From the combat, to the amount of customization to your look, to how you could be a casual and get very far in PvE.  But I cannot stand the enchanting system.  It's time consuming, it's anti-fun and it's so massively RNG based.  It's a blatant gold sink, which the game sadly needs because En Masse cannot control the economy.  For players who have played forever, or those who have limitless EMP to sell for gold, it's alright.  For those of us who hit 65 and within a few weeks was working on SCHM, all my gold was going into enchanting, only to have the feeling that I wasted multiple days of grinding to get nothing accomplished."

Even on my gunner with skilled in BRNM, SCNM and BRHM people still didn't want to take me to BRHM or SCNM because I have an Idoneal chest piece (rest is Disco).  Even though I would often tank BRHM for my guild.  Most groups want you to have gear beyond the dungeon you're doing to make things quick. A lot of players have played long enough to be rich or sold enough EMP to buy a good gear set.  Being a new player trying to progress through the content is tough.   For such a casual PvE scene, EVERYBODY is an elitist when it comes to PuGing. It's kind of pathetic. I was 7 piece T6 in WoW, clearing all content in TBC and I'd still run PuGs in beginner content to help newer players gear up, even though I stood to gain nothing.   Finding things like that outside of a guild in Tera is rare.   You can do it.  You just need to devote a lot of time to accruing money daily and have patience when you're told time and time again ""Sorry your DPS is too low for group."" Often times you'll find a group with all low geared people and they'll have just hit 65 and seemingly have no idea how to play their characters.   I really recommend you guys find an active established guild who is willing to help you gear out. Even then enchanting to +12 is like climbing a mountain for a new player and most groups require it."
TeraOnline,3buv3g,liberatelatios,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"I've stopped playing TERA for a long time and I've always been a casual player. I've put all my focus on socializing and enjoying the game rather than making money. My old time generous friends have all quit. Seconding your idea of joining a nice guild though. I hope there are plenty in TR.  You're definitely not the only one experiencing rejection in parties.  Props to you for helping people out. You do gain satisfaction and appreciation from people though :) I hope you will find some static people to run with you.  Anyway, thanks for replying! I just hit 60 after so many years and I'm so happy. Hopefully I'll get to 65 some time, get some decent gear, and enjoy the end game contents."
TeraOnline,3buv3g,Bryanarby,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:45:40 2015 UTC,"+12 and Masterworking usually costs between 4k-10k depending on your luck. (10k isn't all that much at level 65 to be honest)  now, +15 is where it becomes bullshit, and KTERA is changing how it works so we'll get that patch in about 8 months. if you fail enchanting +13-+15 it goes back to +12, and the chance of failure is pretty high. Though this is much better than the old +6 and above failing had a chance to break the item."

TeraOnline,3buv3g,Roukanken,5,Thu Jul 2 23:42:34 2015 UTC,Same here. Stunning graphics and an amazing combat system. Can't believe I haven't heard about it until now or that more people don't play it. If it didn't label itself as an MMORPG or have all these MMORPG-esque quests I think it would be one of the best games ever.
TeraOnline,3buv3g,beezwacks,5,Thu Jul 2 10:29:01 2015 UTC,"Stunning graphics and an amazing combat system   But sadly, there is not much more to Tera. This could have been the game of century, if only it was done bit better."
TeraOnline,3buv3g,Roukanken,4,Thu Jul 2 11:01:56 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. Still, I feel like it isn't too late for Tera. It's really just varying the gameplay so it isn't just a ton of the same quests. Not sure how hard that would be, but I'm sure the engine could handle it."
TeraOnline,3buv3g,beezwacks,3,Thu Jul 2 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, what I would like more is simply more options.  Glyphs are perfect example - take any class, I guarantee that more then half of the glyphs are completely useless, then one third is absolutely crucial, and you're left with 8 glyph points.

And when you talk about glyphs, are you talking about the points you get at level 10, that would be called a talent tree in another MMO?"
TeraOnline,3buv3g,beezwacks,2,Thu Jul 2 14:27:43 2015 UTC,"Yes you should pick up and upgrade every skill - no reason to not do so.

TeraOnline,3by8dk,Bafooday,2,Fri Jul 3 03:34:13 2015 UTC,"So I've been playing in a PVP server for the past month, after having a bunch of toons on a PVE server. Here's what I'd say:   PVP at level 65 is absolutely awesome. Most of the other 65's will be located in Val Oryn (doing vanguard quests and such), and fighting one or multiple people can be really fun.  PVP at any other level sucks. If you're not max level, you'll encounter a bunch of people looking to kill low-level players for no reason. Even if you do get attacked by someone of a similar level (within 5) than you, it's still tough, a few levels can make a big difference, and classes aren't really balanced until lvl 65. You can almost certainly avoid all pvp by switching channels (any channel but 1). I'd suggest you do this in at least one place (lumbertown) famed for being camped by people looking to kill newbs."

I don't mean your dodge roll (save that for big hits), but rather that your attacks have a very wide hitbox and most move you forward so if you actually aim to the side of the mob you'll still hit it and you'll be moving around it at the same time."

You should be able to curbstomp anything at that level. Can you try upload some video or something ?  Things I think you may be doing / not doing:   Standing still, getting all damage in the face - You should be able to hit monster once or twice, reposition with roll, hit it more, and kite it all around without even hitting you, you may also use movement in your skills to dance around monsters  Stances - at level 10 you get two stances - Assault stance and Defensive stance. Use either one, but most people use assault for higher killing speed   Warriors are one of the best with surviability at the endgame, especially tank warriors."
TeraOnline,3bw605,Bigrook13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:32:17 2015 UTC,Well on 1v1 I always get hit while I'm using a skill and get hit then. I run around it and dodge my target as much as I can but I feel that when I take no damage I hardly am attacking. I'd like to minimize my damage taken without significantly lowering my DPS like that.  But when it comes to killing a bunch of mobs at once I am constantly getting hit. Guess I should be focusing on fighting less mobs at once though
TeraOnline,3bw605,DS_Hottodogu,2,Thu Jul 2 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you this first, do you have your Aggressive Stance on? Ive been playing for two years and I still forget to activate my stances sometimes, lol.  Warriors are squishy in the start, this is a great opportunity to learn how to dodge and get timing down, make sure you glyph RE reduction on roll so you can roll 3 times instead of 2.   Remember warriors cannot face tank you need to dodge or move out of the way when an attack is coming your way, this class is not beginner friendly so expect a good challenge leveling until you get your full skill kit. I started playing Tera as a warrior and it's still my favorite and also my main, I remember it being frustrating at times but you'll learn the class if you keep going at it.  Remember most warrior skills move you forward a bit, use this to your advantage.  Are you wearing damage reduction crystals?

Get used to using these as well as potions, I did a lot of questing leveling up, leveling alchemy isn't THAT expensive but it was well worth it.  As far as mobbing on a warrior your attacks might hit in a wide arc but the damage you're capable of at low/mid levels is suited more for one on one confrontations.   If you're fighting bams you're actually better off activating your defensive stance and killing with the boosted defensive stats up to a certain point.   Things will get better off as you level!  If questing isn't your forte do the vanguard requests, use the crit scrolls and triple charms liberally. Make sure you have your stance activated, this resets when you log or change glyphs which you'll get later, the difference is very noticeable."

TeraOnline,3bw605,sebastiansly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:24:53 2015 UTC,"Tera is all about positioning, consumables and situational damage.  Check out the faqs bar at the top of this subreddit to get all the info you'll possibly need.  If its too much to read at once then here are a few things to get you on the way.  Use the charms you find at any campfire(just use the fires in the mini towns).  Be sure to read what they do(common charms will give you a random buff) and experiment.  Power, enduring, and infused are strong general charm buffs, but others can be situationally more powerful.  Experiment.  Use crystals in your gear.  Hardy in your armor will make a significant amount of difference in the damage you take and pounding will make a large difference in how much damage you do.  After you've progressed a bit the welcome message will tell you what crystals to use.  Just follow that until you can tailor your own builds to suit your playstyle and what you're fighting against.  Dodge.  Unlike most games in this genre tera gives you moves that you can use with a low cooldown that will make you immune to all damage and effects for a second or more.  As a war yours should be on your right click by default.  You aren't limited by that.  Any skill that pushes you forward or back quickly can also be used to dodge attacks.  Rising fury 1st part, pounce, leap attack, etc.  Remember that the game is action combat.  The same rules of hit and miss that you are bound by also affects npcs(who have a way slower swing time).  Constantly try to circle around and hit from behind while watching animations.  They have a limited set of moves based on model type and if you pay attention they can get extremely predictable.  Handy cause you'll always see the model type again later on, with few additions.    Abuse knockdowns to get in free hits with no chance of taking damage.  I believe rising fury second part has high impact and will prolly be your only option for a kd.  Can also use charms to increase the kd success rate.  Many warrior skills have a built in damage reduction during their animation of 30 to 50%.  Use them if you want to face tank something while attacking."
TeraOnline,3bw605,tyronoa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:23:27 2015 UTC,"Timing, warrior like all other classes can be extremely hard to kill.  Taking too much damage could be a result of bad gear. Have you purchased any new ENCHANTABLE Gear? Also there's innerwear that you can either buy or level up that will make a huge impact on your damage intake. You also need to remember to use you iframes AKA dodge skills. In the future you'll get death from above which is a few seconds of invulnerability. I hardly see most noob warriors use. Don't forget about your shadow. So many warriors ignore it and this makes me cry tears of blood due to how painful it is when they forget such a useful skill.  Don't forget about armor crystals, they reduce damage and at your level they can make a bit of difference even if you can only equip 2, but you can also deal more damage thanks to them."

Pay attention to mobs ques and MOVE. Use Health Elixirs from the broker or craft some (you get like 20 free ones at 13) Buy the green bandages from specialty merchants and use them out of combat to heal and just before you enter for a buffer.

Now you have to masterwork it + enchant some more with more expensive alk 30-60g each * 16 each try. You're looking at 20-30k easy for only 4 days of useage.

If you sont have gold or dont have idoneal, you should practice rolling about when he swipes, just warn your parties about your circle tanking  Also you can get +25 endurance for 8 seconds if you glyph it on your dfa, which i do for when i tank as warrior  To conserve resolve or get back resolve at a fast rate, just deadly gamble and spam stuff like torrent, combative, posion, rising fury etc"
TeraOnline,3budd2,Seohyunism,3,Thu Jul 2 08:06:13 2015 UTC,"With a decent gear (eg - it's easily tankable), you should get hit for about 8-10k white and ~35k crit.  If you're getting hit for 30k white -    check your green lines, you want damge reduction on chest and endurance on boots (I think you can even roll endurance on gloves ?) Try getting hardy niveots from Vanguard credits Use some cheap endurance etchings   I'm currently in Disco+9 boots/gloves and Idoneal chest and with Hardy niveots I'm getting hit only when mu stamina goes lower (because Enduring charm is less effective then)  Edit: other ways you can try to soak up damage - DFA's glyph of endurance, spam DFA everytime you can, it adds 25 endurance - Bravery Potion - you can try to get few of these till you get more defence  PS: I hope you're using the glyph for Defensive stance"
TeraOnline,3budd2,Roukanken,2,Thu Jul 2 06:54:45 2015 UTC,"The Dstance glyph honestly does make a huge difference. It gives me about 4k more defense on the stats page. During enraged runs of SCHM, I can temporarily tank it if the lancer dies by switching to Dstance and just blocking while the lancer gets charmed and buffed. When I had my Disco chest (flat damage, enraged damage, frontal damage rolled), Darkan did 50k Eviscerates through my block. When I normally tank him with Dstance glyphed, Eviscerates only do 20-30k through my block. Every single damage reduction roll does matter too. When I upgraded to my Generation chest with 4x damage reduction rolls, I took nothing through block with only the extra 8.7% damage reduction, even with crits. Nightmare Fulminar's arm swings only do 18k each when I don't block them.  You can also just try to evade the second attack instead of blocking it via DFA or Roll. When I circle tank Fulminar, I sometimes just Rising Fury to the side and he'll just keep swinging in the same direction. If you're wall tanking, you can block the first one and DFA the second one. Your healer should easily be able to heal you up for 30k health."

TeraOnline,3budd2,ZonerRoamer,-1,Thu Jul 2 09:13:29 2015 UTC,"It is completely blockable, you just need little better gear for it.   I strongly advise against iframing these swipes:   You try to DFA them both - this needs very precise timing and lower attack speed, and it is still dangerous - when you misstime it, you can't block again in time. Also since boss moves forward, he usually ends in your face, or behind you You roll away - you can avoid damage this way, by rolling to boss feet (also walking works) - this means, that Fulmi's next attack will be Force wave or Saw aoe (the one with debuff) onto where you stand - which is where all the DPS are You block the first one, DFA the other - this is only viable way, though I only do that when the first crits   It's better to eat that damage than have a chance of killing yourself / party.  Edit: whups, you meant other attack .... anyway my point stands, so I leave this here"
TeraOnline,3budd2,Roukanken,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:49:15 2015 UTC,If its a Disco warrior chest then +9 it at least if you dont have the resources for +12  Try to get these rolls: (any 3)   Reduce damage Reduce damage from enraged Reduce damage from highest aggro Reduce damage from frontal attacks   With good gear he cant hit you through block at all (+12 disco chest is enough if it has the correct rolls).. so dont worry; atm if you cant block em well; backstab as soon as he starts the first swipe and ER back to his front when he finishes the 2nd one since he cant change direction in this attack once the animation starts.  The only attack you cant block is the back attack when he swivels the top half of his body backwards and throws down a blue AoE; you need to DFA that.
TeraOnline,3budd2,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:16:57 2015 UTC,"My warrior tank (+12 Disco Wep, Idoneal chest, +9 MW Disco boots/gloves) still takes quite a bit of damage through block. I just dodge the first swipe to the side, then use leaping strike or Rising Fury to re-position myself in front of the boss again. I just wall tank and DFA during enrage."
TeraOnline,3budd2,TheMantello,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:33:32 2015 UTC,"Hi. I had the very same problem with Warrior. Everyone here has really mentioned the crux of the problem. You need to have correct rolls, and potentially try to +12 your armor. Fulminar was hitting me for 35k with block on as well. But once i +11ed it and got the endurance etching for my armor, he doesn't even break my block often anymore. It's great. U can try DFAing, but keep in mind when the boss walks behind u after DFA, you'e either going to waste some RE dodge rolling back to position, or you're going to get hit by the second swing, which if you're getting 35k white damage, will instantly kill you when you mistime it."

Death From Above, backstab, or roll it and tell your healer to get his shit together to keep you healed up."
TeraOnline,3budd2,Soleria,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"No, his double swipe does quite a lot of damage and can crit you for over 30k through block when you're in MW ambit, +9 or +12. You need MW disco or higher to be able to completely block it.  When I tanked him, I actually backstabbed the move, since he usually follows up with either a saw-grinder or a backpulse (which i usually roll through, putting me in front of him again). Keep in that that this might endanger your other party members though. Most tanks prefer to simply soak the damage and trust in their healer to heal him. You should let the healer know beforehand that he will crush through your block when he does the swipes so they know that you'll need heals after that."
TeraOnline,3bv06f,lolita_pudding,10,Thu Jul 2 11:09:45 2015 UTC,Crystals have a huge impact on your dps. Proper crystals alone can pretty much double your damage output in end game gear and no doubt they'll give a good boost for low levels. Also proper positioning is important for dps to get use out of the backcrit crystals.
TeraOnline,3bv06f,Takuuuu,8,Thu Jul 2 11:20:39 2015 UTC,Crystals make an enormous difference. Far more than equipment upgrades.
TeraOnline,3bv06f,melandor0,6,Thu Jul 2 11:20:37 2015 UTC,"Crystals and enchantment make a BIG difference. With avatar weapon you crit a lot, maybe even above 85%   Let's just say you take focused crystal - that's about 1 critpower, depending on level. Most small monsters will enrage quickly, so most damage done to them will be in enrage - let's underthrow this and say 50% enrage on monster without focused - 15% * base + 85% * base * 2 = 1.85 base with focused - 15% base + 85% * base * 2 * 50% (non enraged crits) + 85% * base * 3 * 50% (enraged crits) = 2.275 base  So that's 2.275 / 1.85 = 122.9% your previous damage. That means, just one crystal will increase your damage by 23%, and this is lower bound  Now imagine with proper crystals and enchantment to his weapon - his damage can easily double or triple.  Also make sure he has his HB bot out - gunners main damage skill Arcane Barage does SO much more damage with it out (it hits twice instead of once + bot throws his own shots)"
TeraOnline,3bv06f,Roukanken,2,Thu Jul 2 11:23:47 2015 UTC,"Wow! That's amazing! Thanks (cause I will be leveling my Gunner higher eventually too.)

Thank you so much for mathing it out for me too! :)"
TeraOnline,3bv06f,Roukanken,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:39:18 2015 UTC,"Just so you know - the optimal crystals are the crit power ones - Focused, Savage, Bitter and as fourth take Carving/Pounding/Focused by your preference"
TeraOnline,3bv06f,just_a_null,3,Thu Jul 2 11:46:31 2015 UTC,"To note, carving when below 140 crit factor, then forceful below ~220 power (class-dependent), then pounding.   Edit: and it's an avatar weapon, so probably just ignore carving for forceful anyway."
TeraOnline,3bv06f,Roukanken,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:08:20 2015 UTC,"Hm Power / Pounding seems reasonable, but what formula between crit chance and crit rate are you using ?"
TeraOnline,3bv06f,just_a_null,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:20:39 2015 UTC,"Factor is around 0.0010 chance from the front and around 0.0018 from behind (e.g. my ~240 crit factor * 0.0018 = 0.432, or 43.2%, which in general agrees with my own experimentation). There's more calculations on one of the forums, the main reason pounding only gets good at really high power is that it stacks additively with e.g. weapon increased damage rolls rather than multiplicatively."

TeraOnline,3bv06f,Soleria,2,Thu Jul 2 14:38:37 2015 UTC,"It should also be noted that the Gunner avatar weapon has increased chance to crit on enemies of similar level to it(PvE only). This has the unfortunate side of effect of making the weapon quickly become less effective after a few levels. If your gunner friend doesn't have the highest version he can equip and he is attacking monsters that are higher level than his weapon, he won't crit as often and his damage output will suffer.  That aside, I have been able to reliably get my Gunner's avatar weapon to +9 almost immediately upon getting it, which also provides a huge damage boost. Unless you really are that strapped for the materials, you really should invest at least +6 into enchanting it. It may seem silly since you will level up and replace the weapon relatively quickly, but that short time you have it, you DPS like a god."

Make sure you have crit scrolls, if you don't crit you lose like 90% of your damage. Use leaping smash to gtfo boss mechanics. Spam Flurry of Blows whenever it's off CD.  Setup wise I use a Razer Naga so it's not going to be similar to yours if you don't have one, I mean, 1-12, alt1-12, shift1-12, altshift1-12. . ."

TeraOnline,3buelt,SyrioBroel,4,Thu Jul 2 06:05:29 2015 UTC,"Some classes level a LOT quicker than others. (eg, DPS with good amounts of AoE are significantly faster than other DPS, or healers etc).   That being said, you don't have to have very good gear to get into groups as a tank. This is because tanks are always in shortage, so the options groups have are:   Take you. Don't take you and spend another two hours waiting for a tank :P.   Tanking is harder to learn than DPS, but it's not SUPER hard. You can definitely pick up a tank as a first class and do just fine."

Being a first-timer is irrelevant. The reasoning for that is because tanks cannot be carried by your party. Holding aggro is completely on you. If DPS suck, the fight lasts longer and healers can heal what damage they take. If the healer sucks, the DPS and tank can carry by not taking damage. If the tank sucks and can't hold aggro, welp."
TeraOnline,3buelt,Roukanken,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:40:54 2015 UTC,"would you say that holding aggro is very...active? like in FF14 if I miss an attack or don't do something for 2 seconds...yep, there goes all the aggro.

TeraOnline,3buelt,Obliu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:53:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on your party really. Tera has aggro decay, so you need to consistently generate more aggro to hold it. But I can say, that if you miss certain attacks (warriors Torrent of Blows for example) then yeah, you can say your goodbyes to aggro circle. (If the party is up to par with you)  Aggro generation is very active - it's actually more active then DPSing (for example as warrior I do aggro attacks / blocks / iframes on top of my dps rotation)   For your comparison, it's probably closer to FF14, but only if you have good party. Though you can't completely slack off otherwise."
TeraOnline,3buelt,hlycia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:25:25 2015 UTC,"Hi, I started to play Tera in a light hearted manner three weeks ago. I'm trying to level everything at least once to level 20. So far I found Berserker and the Slayer are the most beginner friendly classes. Lancer is fun but it takes very long to kill stuff after some point. I gather tons of mobs and slay them at once and even so, lancer takes forever. It's the easiest class to solo powerful looking elite-bam type monsters though. Warrior and Sorcerer are a bit harder but I found them more entertaining than any other class (many buttons to push). Priest is boring if you are playing alone but it's a blast if you have friends to play with. Mystic is kind of different but less boring than priest and nice to play with if you like pet classes, the munchies they drop are delicious. Gunner is a better Archer. Gunner is actually good at everything and looks impossible to fail. Archer is fun if you want to play tera more like a first person shooter but I found it the least rewarding class so far. They say archer is better at pvp because of many CC's they can use. I couldn't have a chance to check reaper yet since it wants a level 40 character first. But keep in mind, every class playstyle changes dramatically once they hit max level, or I heard so."
TeraOnline,3buelt,Domx9200,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:48:18 2015 UTC,"Currently Gunner, Beserker & Slayer are the top DPS classes but after the patch next week Warrior gets lots of buffs.  I'm unsure where Warrior will end up compared to those other classes but I think it'll be close, and warriors can operate in either DPS mode or Tank mode then this might be the class for you.  However Warrior has a steeper learning curve, more complex skill rotations, than either Gunner (BANG ""You're dead"") or Zerker (spin to win) so if you want an easy class to level quickly in order to get the feel of the game I'd pick Gunner or Zerker."
TeraOnline,3buelt,hlycia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:32:15 2015 UTC,"Well Slayer isn't that hard to use either, most of its skill rotation is whirlwind into overhand strike into knockdown strike into overhand strike and so on. Later on you get moves like measured slice and eviscerate which also act as rotation finisher moves. Slayer is all about overhand strike and hoping for that overhand strike to not go on cooldown. its really not that hard to play either. But then again, Gunner and Zerker are the easiest classes to play."

TeraOnline,3br70h,LeylinTG,12,Wed Jul 1 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"Theorycrafting in this game is extremely time consuming and not 100% accurate. There are several factors you have to take into account, you'll never be able to calculate the exact damage output for any class on any fight simply because there are too many variables.   You have to consider equipment and glyph builds, individual skills' crit modifiers, several different skill rotations, cooldown reset chance on skills and back dps uptime. Then you have to keep in mind that dungeon bosses have different endurance values which you have to take into account. Then there's party endurance debuffs which may vary in uptime depending on the fight. Then you have boss mechanics which forcefully interrupt dps skill rotations, or halt dps as a whole. Then you have to take into account that some of these mechanics can be partially or completely ignored by ranged classes. THEN you have to consider that player skill, ping and boss pattern RNG massively affects every single point previously stated.   There is no way you can put all of this together and come up with absolute evidence of why a class outdpses another. You can try, but many of your values will likely be fictional ""best case scenario"" static numbers which in theory may sound reasonable, but in a real run will never happen. Therefore, you're only left with info such as dps meters and the overall feeling of class A having more consistent dps than class B.  It's true that Sorcerers MAY outdps other classes in SOME instances, but can they do it consistently against equally geared players that are near their skill ceiling?  No. A Sorcerer in this current patch might come close, but will never consistently output as much damage as a Gunner, Slayer, Zerker, Warrior or Reaper. It's not simple parroting and circlejerking, it's a fact which can be proven at any time by simply pitting skillful Sorcs vs skillful class X in a party and comparing their damage output. Even if no one can provide exact numbers, Sorcerers simply don't have the kit to equally match most other dps classes.  I don't have any meters or logs to present you to ""put up"" with my claims, I'm talking from simple experience. Go and ask Yosha or any other great Sorc player what they think about their class. Ask them if they honestly think Sorcs are on equal standings with other dps classes, because no good player will answer with a yes. That doesn't mean sorcs are useless, they do their job - they deal a decent amount of damage. It simply means other classes can do what they do better and with less effort."
TeraOnline,3br70h,Yisery,4,Wed Jul 1 15:05:45 2015 UTC,This is true in almost any game and not a good reason to not attempt to theorycraft DPS. There is still a ton of value in simplifying everything and using a base set of assumptions that make for easy calculations in order to develop quantitative understandings of DPS.
TeraOnline,3br70h,Dreamin-,2,Wed Jul 1 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"Indeed. By eliminating a few variables (i.e. not considering them) you can not control you can at least get a grasp or even good understanding of the rest, and then interpret that into your own play. Back time is a good example for such a variable."
TeraOnline,3br70h,narrill,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"A lot of other games have DPS meters, and some even have training dummies which would significantly reduce the variables, whereas Tera has none of those things."
TeraOnline,3br70h,iscuxcar,0,Wed Jul 1 22:56:01 2015 UTC,"Every game goes through the same steps to calculate which classes are considered better than others when it comes to DPS. I guess it comes down to this game having a lower population and therefore a lack of players that actually want to do it.  Nothing you've listed in your second paragraph is different than any other game. The only difference is that back-time is more important in this game (obviously).   ""Best Case Scenario"" is all the ""Absolute Evidence"" that is required. You can then create averages based on that for different Dungones/Bosses. Players in other games do it all the time. Of course certain classes are going to be better for certain dungeons/bosses/monsters. That's how MMOs and raiding work.  Any type of data is better than ""Uhhh, i feel like if there isn't an archer in my party the run goes a bit faster."". At least with data you can get an idea of how things should be playing out verses having absolutely no idea if that random archer is using proper gear/glyphs/rotation and so on. The data part is kind of the point in ruling that stuff out.  Take ""Slice and Dice"" from vanilla WoW. It is a rogue skill that increases attack speed by 30%. The more combo points you use when activating it, the longer the duration lasts. The attack speed only affects the auto attacks that happen between skill activations. For quite a while in vanilla WoW it was not used as it was assumed to be a DPS loss versus using eviscerate or something else for the points spent. People started working with it and taking logs and meters from various fights and found that using  it at the start of the fight, at 3 combo points, and then at 5 combo points when it was about to run out, and then maintaining it throughout the fight turned out to be a sizable damage increase. If you weren't using it in your rotation at that point and maintaining 100% uptime you were considered bad. Furthermore, Data showed that ifyou re-activated it too early or too late it was a DPS loss. If you activated it before or after 3 combo points at the beginning of a fight, it was a DPS loss depending on the length of the fight.  All this shit adds up. It blows my mind that people are so complacent with the information being fed to them in this game."

TeraOnline,3br70h,SourDinkleberry,5,Wed Jul 1 23:55:07 2015 UTC,"i agree with OP.  ..  I would prefer to see this exchange  BOB posted damage of his gunner vs warrior:  ""Gunner skills chained like so A > B > C > D"" Damage = 5000""  ""Warrior skills chained like so A > B > C > D"" Damage = 4000""  Therefor Gunner out-dps warrior in this instance.  JOHN replies: ""Thats why,  Warrior skills should chain like so B > C > A > D = 5500 damage""  PETE then says: ""Yes but according to my short test of 50 hits, Blade Draw did not have the 50% chance it claimed so therefor the damage did not reach 5500."" .  Non of these examples are accurate or 100% true. thats why you take them into account ALONG with anecdotal evidence. And with numbers and tests, it'll be better proof.  Many would take the numbers 'as is' and not think about all other possibilities ..  ""oh 5k damage. cool. best dps ever""  but thats no difference from them taking the word of someone who said ""sorc now mid tier dps""   I would rather have these mini tests than someone saying ""From simple experience, go and ask So and So or any great warrior player what they think about their class."""
TeraOnline,3br70h,SourDinkleberry,3,Wed Jul 1 15:34:37 2015 UTC,"As an aside, Warrior dps isn't at all like ""use a > b > c"", since they have to maintain debuffs, stack edge, reaping slash at 3/4 edge (boss-dependent, some as low as 2), deadly gamble, and scythe with minimal waste, all at the same time.  All of that makes it really difficult to measure warrior dps on anything but a very long timescale."
TeraOnline,3br70h,IevaFT,18,Wed Jul 1 17:25:42 2015 UTC,"Any empirical data that supports what the masses have been parroting is correct? Have i missed it completely?   No. You can't know the exact equations that BlueHole uses to calculate how damage is dealt. There are accurate representations of this using some equations people have come up with over time that can be used in excel charts that are fairly reliable; even these aren't spot on though.   Your argument isn't flawless. Sure, sorc isn't as weak as everyone is crying about - I fully agree. I even posted this myself a while back:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/3903wa/sorcerer_or_slayer/cs0mcvz  But you're assuming that any sorc can have the potential of a player that's been playing for ages on both Korean and NA servers, who's also a highly active member of the community especially regarding patches and content information. The average sorc can't hold a candle to Yosha because sorc is naturally a more difficult class to play. And even if we assume that Yosha's DPS comparisons hold true, what's to say that the slayer that this information is being compared to is of equal skill relative to his class (ie. if Yosha is in the 95th percentile of all sorcs, is that Slayer also 95th percentile of all slayers?). This is impossible to justify. What if the slayer was unlucky with crits (after all, critical hits are RNG). What if the slayer didn't reset as often as he should have?  Is there no merit to the upcoming patches' affects on sorc? Some of their skills' base damages are getting a 100% damage boost, some others 10%, and yet others 20% - they're also getting QoL changes and some of their glyphs' effects are being DOUBLED. Warrior is getting a similar treatment. Yet Berserker and Gunner aren't really being affected. In fact, both of those classes are having some PvP damage taken from them. Can we consider BlueHole to have a good grasp on where the classes that they design stand and manage accordingly? I would say so.   Or how about the fact that the only classes that have ever managed to out-dps me judging by DPS meter results are Slayers, Gunners, or other Zerks? Have I simply been lucky enough to not come across a good assault stance warrior? Are all the decent reapers avoiding party's that I happen to be in?  I can argue some classes hit harder and hit faster, and some classes have some issues. There is without a doubt a difference in damage output between most of the classes. Why would that matter though?  This is what I'm trying to get to: Why is this so important to so many people? Why is it so important for people to know a tier list. It doesn't affect your game play whatsoever. I'm not saying gaps don't exist - there are definitely differences between the damage output of some classes over others. My issue is whether it's justifiable to consider this ""DPS tier"" as an important concept. Incremental damage differences make no real difference in dungeons - if it was an issue, you'd see the players of certain classes complaining that it's literally impossible for them to do X dungeon. I haven't seen anyone decline a class for being weak, but I have seen people decline gunners at release - because skill is the defining factor, NOT class stats."
TeraOnline,3br70h,SourDinkleberry,5,Wed Jul 1 16:01:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your Response. It touches on a lot of good points.  As far as player skill is concerned: You can't use that as a basis for attempting to make an assumption on the state of a class. The Average player isn't very good; similar to how the Average person isn't very intelligent. The ""Average"" is a very low set bar to try and jump. It is the very beginning. It is the minimal that is required in order to decide if something is at least important or good enough to assume they kind of know what they are doing.  Averages are important. This is one of the flaws in Yosha's Data. He is in the absolute minority when it comes to someone attempting to post Data for others to use. Because he is one person out of thousand, it cannot be taken for face value. Now, if every Yosha from each class came forward and posted their data as well, it would make a much bigger difference. Sure, we won't know if the slayer or other DPS in his parties were any good. We don't know their gear, their skill, or their luck. This is when masses of other players help. If 1000 slayers post data from various it encounters, you can assume that at least 500 of them are bad, 300 of them are decent, 150 of them are good, and 50 of them are playing to the best ability of the class. You take the top 50 and see what they are doing differently. Their skills, their gear, their rotation, not only which skills are doing the most damage for them, but how much more damage and so on. This is how you find out which gear is best, which classes are easier or harder, which rotation is best, which glyphs and blah blah blah.  It is entirely conceivable that in your Tera career that you have never played with a good reaper. It is also entirely conceivable that you did play with a good Reaper, but RNG was just not on his side for that run. You are one man after all. You don't cover very much area in your dungeon runs. The real question is whether or not the reaper was ever even set up to out DPS you to begin with.   Buffs/nerfs happen for various reasons. They do it to add new gear, new encounters, new options, new meta. They do it to make classes more accessible to worse players as well. If Bluehole is able to run simulations and collect the data they require, it should be quite easy for them to see how hard it is for a certain class to be played correctly. If sorcerer is much harder than any other class to play at a competitive level, then they already know that. Their job at that point is to make it so an average player can pick up the class and still be decent. Depending on the popularity of the game, they might also have to worry about what happens when that class is buffed a bit too much and put in to the hands of a good player. Or maybe they won't worry about it because only a hand full (comparatively) of players are even at that level so in the grand scheme of the game it really doesn't matter if those players become OP.  If a class becomes too easy for average player to do better than a good player of a different class then that's when you know to nerf it. Anyway, i'm sure you get my point.  As for your final point: No. DPS, and tier lists, and data don't really matter. In fact, they only matter as much as the community makes them matter. This is the point of my Original post. People are pretending they know whats up without really knowing. They are telling other players that archer and sorc and reaper and warrior aren't very good simply because that is what they have been told by others. So like i said. Put up or shut up. Be the person who has the data that backs up their claims or don't bother chiming in with anecdotal evidence. Note: that last bit was not directed at you, just to the populace in general"
TeraOnline,3br70h,IevaFT,2,Wed Jul 1 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"As far as player skill is concerned: You can't use that as a basis for attempting to make an assumption on the state of a class.   So by your logic if I invite a friend over who's never touched a PC game (let alone tera), let him run a dungeon in a fully geared gunner without telling him what to do and save his damage output, and afterwards hop onto my zerk and run the exact same instance, and compare the differences, this is still a fair way to compare the state of the class? Player skill is just as important as the kit of the class itself, if not more.  I agree with you on having the top 50 of the data and comparing that. This is the way it should be done, if any.   It is entirely conceivable that in your Tera career that you have never played with a good reaper. It is also entirely conceivable that you did play with a good Reaper, but RNG was just not on his side for that run.   By that reasoning it's also entirely conceivable that in my Tera career that I HAVE played with a good reaper with good RNG who simply can't do more damage than I do.  I agree that buffs and nerfs are for various reasons. But buffs that literally DOUBLE your damage, DOUBLE the usefulness of your glyphs, and bump the rest of your most important skills damages by 20% - can ONLY be because the class is inferior. There can be no other explanation for such a drastic change.  While we do disagree on some details, I think we both definitely  agree on the overarching problem. DPS tier isn't actually a significant thing."

TeraOnline,3br70h,SourDinkleberry,2,Wed Jul 1 16:24:43 2015 UTC,"Incremental damage absolutely does matter. I'm on the phone so I'll try to make this short but everything goes by margins.   Every piece of new gear marginally increases your chance at clearing a dungeon (granted some give larger margins than others). Every time you improve it marginally increases your chance at the same. Its the accumulation of these marginal increases that really make ""the big difference"". Incremental damage from class differences during progression might mean a difference of 5% on clear chance and that is huge for some people.   Of course some people don't care about maximizing their chances or being able to clear a dungeon a day or 2 earlier and that's OK. Different things for different audiences. I'm just trying to say that for certain players knowing their class will do MARGINALLY more damage with equalized skill is absolutely important."
TeraOnline,3br70h,InRustITrust,0,Wed Jul 1 21:58:25 2015 UTC,In the context of the states of different classes regarding their damage output within a dungeon? No. Marginal differences in DPS can easily be negated through other means. There aren't any DPS races where the 5% makes or breaks you in this game. The closest thing to this is nightmare perimos - which no class actually has an issue with. You don't see herds of sorcs complaining about being unable to do enough damage to perimos do you?
TeraOnline,3br70h,SourDinkleberry,2,Wed Jul 1 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound like you understand my argument at all (or you're completely disregarding it) and are simply rehashing points you've already made earlier.

This is a very silly assertion.  Of course you can work out the math.  Practically no MMO company shares their formulas, but players still manage to get rock solid math.  It's really not so difficult to fit a curve to data that we can't get a really good idea what's going on, but we need data first, and people don't want to post parses that came from software that will get them banned for using.  This game doesn't log everything and you can't dump the logs to disk as far as I can tell anyway, which leaves only packet interception or hacking memory, and I'm far too lazy to do that.

(Pure) mathematicians are all about parsing the language used in proofs to ensure that every statement in it perfectly jibes with every other statement.  Your final statement is patently false.  It is absolutely possible to determine the exact formulas in use since we're talking about a system purely driven by formulas.  This isn't like data collected from natural phenomena which we analyze knowing there are error bars associated with the measurements themselves and external influences can easily screw something up.  This is a completely closed system generated purely by mathematical formulas and our data collection is perfect (the numbers that pop out cannot be mismeasured).  Nobody wants to do the kind of work necessary to figure out the exact formulas (especially given that they may change at any time), but that absolutely does not imply that it can't be done at all."

It's exceedingly unlikely that they're using any natural random source even for seeds.  The algorithms themselves can be worked out due to inherent biases in most of them.  Finally, that hardly matters at all because if a PRNG is so good as to have no biases (unlikely) then any other equivalently good PRNG can serve as a substitute.  It may come as a surprise to people, but people have done work specifically to find out PRNG algorithms used in games in order to abuse said biases.  Granted, that depth of analysis is typically only used for games where you can make money (for example, video poker), but the work certainly has been done and will continue to be done."
TeraOnline,3br70h,blueteakettle,4,Wed Jul 1 16:56:31 2015 UTC,"Forgive me. It's completely out of line of me to expect you to read what I have to say. I should have formed my discussion in a manner that expected you to skim over the first sentence and immediately respond as opposed to read what I have to say in its entirety.    You're telling me we can derive the exact formulas used to calculate damage output based purely on the numbers I can see on my screen? And we can fully incorporate our builds into that even though we have no idea how the system works in the first place?   If I crit 265,000, you of all people should realize there is an infinite number of possible formulas using the exact same values to get to 265,000. What tells you the one you came up with is the same one that BlueHole uses? Just because it works for 265,000 doesn't mean it works for 640,000.  How are you going to incorporate my attack and the trade off with the monster's endurance stat (which - by the way - you don't know the value of).   We don't even know the correlation between crit rate and crit factor. All we know is that it's inverse exponential and probably plateaus somewhere. We aren't even sure of that.  The problem is that the system gives you a bunch of numbers, doesn't give you a bunch of others, and it gives you the output. You can put those initial numbers together in a million different ways to get the same output. You're not even considering the existence of random constants somewhere in the formula that we don't know the value of.  If you say we can figure all of this out fine. I'm not buying it."
TeraOnline,3br70h,xTiCT0C,4,Wed Jul 1 17:29:25 2015 UTC,This is very possible to do for those with advanced undergrad or graduate education in math/stats. These systems tend to not be as complicated as you would think. Generally most of the complication is figuring out issues with how resist/armor is calculated and honestly that's not something you really need to worry about since normally your goal is to figure out how to do max DPS (which is unaffected by resists since that is a constant).
TeraOnline,3br70h,justdavidt,3,Wed Jul 1 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"This is solely a matter of statistic analysis and then interpreting some math into it. Once the sample size is big enough (assuming little changing variables), you can spot differences caused by PRNG. After that, you can work on figuring out a formula for the other numbers, assuming you have enough samples for those too."
TeraOnline,3br70h,CorrosiveFox,5,Wed Jul 1 21:38:40 2015 UTC,In an action combat game so much relies on player skill and the movement in the encounter.   In tab target MMOs like WoW it's much easier to theory craft how much DPS a class should be putting out with a proper rotation. Abilities aren't aimed and boss movement is much more scripted/easily accounted for.   The theoretical DPS of a class in Tera with 100% uptime is often drastically different from the realities of your average player - let alone someone learning a fight.
TeraOnline,3br70h,blueteakettle,0,Wed Jul 1 22:59:34 2015 UTC,"The potential of a class is always going to be higher than the applied. This is nothing new. Getting an understanding of why classes rank where they are can help people see the potential as well as see why they aren't reaching that potential. This is why gathering the correct data is important.  If we had the evidence to suggest that a Sorc using ""This Rotation"" with ""This glyph Setup"" with ""This gear"" while keeping ""This amount of uptime"" has the potential to do ""This amount of damage"" in ""This time frame"" is on par with Slayer and Zerker DPS, than that is saying quite a lot. It does not matter if 80% of the players aren't good enough to pull off ""That rotation"" while keeping ""that amount of uptime"" on the boss.   It's not only about the damage of skills either. Cooldowns matter, as well as movement abilities. Why is a sorc considered so hard to play? Is it because their rotation is so hard to manage? Is it because boss movement effects them more than most classes? Is it because getting interrupted in their rotation is hugely detrimental to their damage? If it IS that detrimental, which part of the rotation is the most beneficial to their DPS? Do we have the answer to any of these for the sorc class? How about any other class?"
TeraOnline,3br70h,CorrosiveFox,3,Wed Jul 1 23:44:25 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, you're basically asking us to get ourselves banned.   There's no on pen and paper statistical study anyone in NA can do, but if you play the game a lot and run the meter and compare with other top players in gam , you get a sense of idea. And that's all we can really do right now.   Sorc has always been a class that played well, can pull off damage on par.  And again this game is a skill based game, not pure numbers and gear and 123 order optimization.  Even if gunners are strong, they need to be in the right hands and even if archers are weaker, they can do well in the right hands. But again, good can be a relative term. Someone can be considered 'good' compared to noobs but he might in reality be far behind compared to other top pve-ers."

Unfortunately the video owner put some of the videos on private.   Even if you were to provide some data on the dps of every class like above, everyone has their own belief of who is strong and not. If you find something that does not agree with their beliefs, they will reject it. They will point out possibly errors in the testing, and then ignore the data. Like if it turns out that archers and sorcerers had the highest dps in the game, do you think people would believe it? No, they will say that the other classes that you sampled were not good."
TeraOnline,3br70h,j258d,2,Wed Jul 1 15:02:20 2015 UTC,"Have an upvote.   But seriously, thank you. I came to Tera after breaking my From Software habit and found the community of Tera vastly different in approach to understanding the game. It was jarring to say the least. Especially when it comes to proper gear. Any way, I'd like to point out two things. First, each class has different skill curves, they maybe slightly different but different enough to affect DPS. I've played Slayer, Reaper and to a much lesser extent Gunner (lv25). I've found I have a much easier time playing a reaper, so maybe that spacebar hero joke has some merit.   Second thing, those who do math also make assumptions. The most common assumption is back time for crits. I understand that's necessary, but instead of making assumptions we should be recording so that we can analyze later. I want to link a dark souls 2 video demonstrating how DPS for different halberds many weapons was very different and which was best in his opinion but I'm on mobile. Maybe I can edit this later and add it. Any way, he uses the premise of using one full stamina bar as a meter and shows how much damage he can rack up, then goes into analysis of DPS vs attack speed and stamina consumption. The only assumptions I remember he made had to do with stats. Other than that it was just video footage and math. I think we need to move in this direction to get accurate representations of each class.  Edit: Found the video. He has a strong accent, but his method is more what we should apply. I.e. # of hits per second, damage per second (DPS), damage per hit (DPH), crit damage (crits would have to be applied differently because they work differently in Tera)"
TeraOnline,3br70h,just_a_null,0,Wed Jul 1 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you Sir. These are the types of things i'm talking about. Anything can help. A 1 minute clip of different boss fights showing damage. Slow it down, add the numbers up. Calculate how much time the class had access to the bosses back. How easy it was to maintain back time. How quickly he was able to get back to back-time when the boss did something or moved. All of this helps. You can then extrapolate that to longer fights and different things. You don't necessarily even need meters to calculate something that might be close to what can be expected with proper gear/glyphs/player skill. Any data is better than no data."
TeraOnline,3br70h,Happymapler,7,Wed Jul 1 19:59:43 2015 UTC,"One minute clip would not help and would be wildly inaccurate. It would favor burst classes vs sustained damage, doesn't take into consideration things like brooch usage/timing, enraged mode, rng crit streak vs lack of crits. How long a clip would need to be to be accurate depends on the boss too. RG bosses could easily be a 1 min video but what about Nightmare Darkan? Dreadspire shandra Manaya?   When my guild tries for top crusade scores, we will easily spend 5 hours resetting a 5 min dungeon for lucky combination of boss combo attacks/targets, crits and lack of even minute mistakes.   I understand the sentiment of wanting data, but this is not a simple task and requires a lot of effort and control and luck and even then, the results could still be inaccurate."

TeraOnline,3br70h,Tangy4tw,2,Wed Jul 1 17:17:02 2015 UTC,"After reading some interesting posts, will include my thoughts. So I can't really back up anything in the form of data/concise numbers or videos. But from my experience of having leveled 4 chars recently to 65 (Gunner/Lancer/Reaper/Priest) I feel like player skill is most important even above a class that is considered weaker than others, eg I've seen sorcerers outdps any gunner or ""stronger class"", being it positioning, correct skill order, animation cancel, etc (not dying :D). When playing my priest seen tanks where their hp won't go lower than 90% helping party in general like priest doing energy stars on reuse and plague, etc. And when playing lancer the dps standing on correct places to dps behind the boss, not taking unnecessary aoe damage. I don't use any dps meter, but its not hard to see when someone is doing a very good job maximizing his dps to boss.  So to finish, I like to think that Skill>Classes(op/underpowered). Then ofcourse if you want to take it to the situation where you compare excellent archer/sorcerer to excellent gunner/berzerker/etc. You could start doing math/theorycrafting, for me as far as players have decent knowledge of their roll Ill take any class to clear any dungeon. PS. Didnt mention gear which also affects dps, would like to put it inbetween skill and class."
TeraOnline,3br70h,Daydays,2,Wed Jul 1 18:07:24 2015 UTC,"One thing many posters are confused about is that most variables they bring up as concerns are constants and therefore not something you need to worry about.   For example, if your goal is to figure out either maximum person DPS or relative max DPS between classes, things like time attacking from behind, armor/resists, etc affect numbers but not relative numbers and can be safely ignored."
TeraOnline,3br70h,mejai,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:41:44 2015 UTC,"Instead of posting meters (as many pointed out, is not the best idea), what about comparing GGHM times at equal gear/buffs? It's obviously not the best metric (since actual appliance of DPS should involve ability to fight while dodging/kiting/tanking the boss + boss mechanics), but it's still the closest thing we have to a training dummy (a stationary target with a limited HP) and should provide a way to measure optimal DPS and rotations."

TeraOnline,3bslrl,j4c0x,3,Wed Jul 1 20:34:47 2015 UTC,"Well if iframing is ping dependant on these classes it will be on the other ones as well. Its rather the rotations of Sorc and the use of certain skills like Rapid Fire of Archer which make them ping dependant.  To the topic:  Even after the Sorc buffs those two will remain the weakest PvE DPS classes so to be honest it doesnt really matter which one you will pick there. I would rate both as hard to play even if Archer might not seem to be too hard in the beginning. Not quite sure why you think Archer has poor CC, they have several stuns, slows and staggers (and some of them are on a really low CD). I have no idea how Archers are in PvP in ktera right now but I know Sorc are considered top tier. I would assume that Archer will still remain great in mass scale PvP as always although Im a bit concerned about 1v1s/3v3s as Zerk, Warrior, Reaper and Sorc are getting some (big) buffs/changes.

You have two main skills for dps, Penetrating and Radiant arrow which are both 3-bar charges (Radiant is 2 early on). As an archer you really lack aoe until the late game -- penetrating needs line of sight and only goes 18m unless you glyph it which is not worth IMO; and arrow volley which is not worth its cast+animation time unless you're clearing minions. Mana is not an issue by slotting in a Rapid Fire somewhere to regain mana. A lot of other spells are not worth using because the damage value isn't good enough compared to the main two.

Warriors can certainly pull DPS well if they're geared up (as can any of these classes).  The thing is... Most classes can pull their weight through instances, it's more of a matter of experience with boss fights and mechanics (dead people pull 0 dps)  Furthermore my list takes into account how difficult the rotation for each class is.  Gunners basically only have to worry about 4 skills, whereas a sorc has much more rotational complexity just to not be dead weight."

I play warrior, and i'm pretty sure WAR and SORC are the bottom of the barrel right now."
TeraOnline,3bssw2,Catalystd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:46:09 2015 UTC,"Have you played both classes? For one archer is a ranged DPS class with limited options (unlike gunner) for getting back dmg. Its skills are very fickle for maximizing DPS as well, generally you don't want to completely overcharge RA or PA, yet you're forced to if the boss turns slightly since you have to re-position, losing you DPS.   Meanwhile warrior has ridiculous endurance debuffing, boosting not only personal DPS but the entire party as well.  Warriors can dish out DPS similar to reapers/slayers this patch, but their DPS is somewhat more limited to blade draw resets, so if they get unlucky their DPS falls behind. But warriors, much like other melee DPS have extremely high mobility and can keep an extremely high back uptime. Next patch gives warriors a very decent pve buff, and it pushes them to the top dps tier, along with berserkers and gunners.   As for a source or whatever, Armell is an extremely skilled and knowledgeable individual in pve, and this is his pastebin where you can find DPS tiers (including tiers for future patches) all categorized with DPS meters. http://pastebin.com/vg6YsJ03"
TeraOnline,3bssw2,Ready_Able,0,Wed Jul 1 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't played both classes, I main a warrior, but was just asking. o.o I wanted to make an archer, but if it's really that horrible I might forgo the idea of having an archer. It's kinda lame that gunners are truly the only viable ""ranged"" class.   Also, i've seen some archer gameplay where it impresses me how often they can find their way behind the boss, like dodging with camera away from boss, etc. Are you making your conclusion based on experience? or based on that pastebin thing (can't see it since im at work.)"
TeraOnline,3bssw2,Catalystd,4,Wed Jul 1 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"Let's make it a rule that every dps class is viable as long as you take time and learn your class. Some dps need more skill than others, agreed, but please don't say that you shouldn't play the class just because you need more skill to play."
TeraOnline,3bssw2,Lato57,0,Wed Jul 1 22:00:37 2015 UTC,"archer's mobility is limited to backstep+breakaway bolt, both of which   cancel your charging abilities (backstep doesnt waste the cooldown, but breakaway forces you to use your charge skill first). You want to stay something like 8-10 m behind the boss, so you can actually utilize explosive trap and RoA, yet that kind of range is crippling to the class's ability to get behind the boss if it turns. (Think about how the arc of the circumference of a circle increases as you increase the radius, a melee character, or smaller radius have to travel much less distance to get to get behind the boss if it turns as opposed to a ranged character which would have a larger radius)  I've played both classes in pve, and this is really general knowledge to people who've played both classes as well. Even disregarding turning, archers STILL have less DPS than a warrior according to the DPS meters, and this is pretty much objective/empirical/not up to debate.   That being said archers don't have HORRIBLE dps by any means, the point of this thread was to rank the classes by DPS, and although warriors may be higher than archers, that doesn't make them unviable in pve. Competent archers can hold their own, and personal skill always prevails."

TeraOnline,3bssw2,LordBamF,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:28:50 2015 UTC,I don't understand why you keep mentioning how the game SHOULD be played. There isn't one way to play this game. Some people play to have fun and for those people tier lists don't matter and they should play whatever class they like. Other people play to compete and they want to get high scores for dungeons and that is fun for them so they would need tier lists to play the classes that do the most damage.

""How much time had passed, the woman did not know as she was trembling in fear of a horrible scene about to unfold in front of her eyes. However, the sight she saw was not what she expected.  It was definitely a horrible silhouette but it wasn't of the one she had expected to see. Instead, it was two armed thieves, one with a sword and one with a blunt weapon.   Suddenly, within matters of seconds, a sword had gone flying off somewhere and one of the thieves was on the floor, clutching onto his nose as his face was flowing with blood. The other one, armed with a blunt weapon, dropped his weapon in surprise and started to tread away from the scene. The girl aggressively chased after the fleeing thief and released a swift uppercut onto him with her huge fists which surprisingly blasted him into the air.   The girl then proceeded to beat the thief with constant barrages whilst he was still suspended in the air.  The sight of those barrages were spectacular and there were spectators who had forgotten everything they were doing and just watched. As the thief was about to fall back down to the ground, the girl, as if releasing a finishing hit, kicked the thief's body with a mighty force. The thief's body went tumbling towards a nearby fruit store and rammed into the assorted watermelons and apples with his body...""

TeraOnline,3bqesm,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:09:06 2015 UTC,The practical use is to block cancel your stagger attacks on warrior so that you can immediately use another stagger. This stagger locks your targets and you can 100-0 someone without them ever getting to fight back. Its a dueling nightmare. There is someone on LoT that has mastered this and uses a really old gear set to accomplish it with stupid amounts of attack speed. He's still one of the best warriors on the server because he has only lost a duel like 3 times and one of those was him throwing the fight after getting the guy to like 100 health.
TeraOnline,3bqesm,swiftstylus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:23:57 2015 UTC,"No, that isnt how stagger locks work. If you auto - block - immediately auto your second stagger will not register.   You have to space out the staggers.  You can macro, but unlike lancers, on warriors it would be no better than manually doing it (provided you dont fuck up.) The point of no RE blocks on lancer is for skating, which normally consumes a lot of RE. Stagger locks on warrior consume no net RE because you can regain RE between the blocks"
TeraOnline,3bqesm,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:14:01 2015 UTC,In any case; isnt stagger being moved to the 2nd hit of AA?
TeraOnline,3bqesm,ZonerRoamer,0,Wed Jul 1 13:48:21 2015 UTC,"yes it is, but honestly this will just separate the good warriors from the crap ones slightly more than currently. Those that know what they are doing are going to be able to continue being stupid and locking someone from 100-0."
TeraOnline,3bqesm,swiftstylus,0,Wed Jul 1 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"It definitely works for warrior. I've been beaten into the ground enough by this guy to know that it works. I've done it before as well. If you auto - block - combative - block - auto - block - poison - block - auto - block - combative - block  and repeat, you will get the win, because it will stagger lock permanently. There is no need for a macro on warrior.  Also you don't need to do anything special on lancer, since they can use shield barrage and block canceling to get a super fast cast on their barrage. It is hard, but definitely workable. You then use your stuns to hold them still for a full combo and a wallop. Tossing a virulent crux will allow you to get poison when they get knocked down, because wallop tends to do that.  Anyway, you're full of it if you think that stagger locking isn't a thing for warriors. It very much is, you just aren't doing it right."
TeraOnline,3bqesm,swiftstylus,2,Wed Jul 1 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"poison doesnt stagger  if that is the real combo then he must have insanely high atk speed. otherwise, i think poison would be used after backstab or something (would need really low ping)"
TeraOnline,3bqesm,RaidenXT,0,Wed Jul 1 21:19:02 2015 UTC,Yes he does have insanely high attack speed. Legit every stat on him is basically attack speed. He is using a really old gear set that allows him to do this. I said this already.
TeraOnline,3bqesm,swiftstylus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:59:18 2015 UTC,I KNOW stagger locks are a thing. You just don't know how staggers work.  Auto block into immediately another stagger DOES NOT RESTAGGER.  You MUST space out your staggers if you want them to stagger.  So it has to be auto - block - WAIT half a second - auto.  Not to mention poison doesn't even stagger and your entire paragraph on lancers is irrelevant. Skating has nothing to do with shield barrage.
TeraOnline,3bqesm,ChildrensPlayground,-1,Thu Jul 2 05:14:15 2015 UTC,"The problem is it DOES stagger and there is a guy that has made a name for himself as one of the best if not the best warrior on the fucking server, using stagger lock.

For example if you skate a few times with low ping and a stable skate speed, I can say with confidence that at least one of the blocks will be a non-resolve one. Take a look at the barrage canceling aswell. You can't do that without doing a non-resolve block because then it will be completely interrupted.   Now don't tell me ""but every lancer who uses barrage canceling macros!"" because then you're just being ignorant. How would you find out barrage canceling in the first place? You don't just randomly make a macro and ""find"" this mechanism.  I'm a long time lurker here and on eu/na forums and I'm tired of all the misconceptions and ""rumors"" that people talk about.   I'm not saying I can't be proven wrong, I'm just stating this because the macro hate is underserved, especially for lancers that do play well.   Warriors can do it aswell.

Comparably, out of ~100 tries, I did only one 20ms one, and 50% of time I can do <35ms. This seems to be trainable to 35-30ms, but would probably need ping around 30ms or less for it to work."

TeraOnline,3brk6y,magocchi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:50:24 2015 UTC,"If I've learned anything from the TERA community, it's that nobody actually cares if your gear is better or not, because having +0 automatically means you're a worthless scrub and having +12 automatically means you're a super-skilled player.  The whole reason you need +12 Ambit right now even though it's only slightly better than Idoneal is to somehow prove that you're not bad at the game. ... somehow. I don't know how it proves anything except that you can sell EMP, but :endgamers:."

TeraOnline,3brjet,zedfighter,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:45:38 2015 UTC,"While this sounds good in theory there are many variables in actual combat that would affect youur actual DPS output.  How would these dummies take into account buffs like Blessing of Shakan, Energy Stars, Titanic Wrath, or debuffs such as Combative Strike, Traverse Cut, Debilitate, Triple Nemesis, Volley of Curses.  Enrage status and other things that affect your damage  There's other things to take into account such as bosses moving and turning, as well as certain bosses' attacks.  For example, because of the way Nightmare Tantibus works (drain mechanic, pull attack) I have to use a completely different rotation on my Berserker to do optimal damage without getting killed, since it's not the typical spam skills and block everything fight."

TeraOnline,3brjet,alchemist87,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:12:53 2015 UTC,"Just like any other game does... You use dummies to test your base DPS output. From there, buffs only increase it.  Moving and actual combat need not apply. The better a player is, the better they will be at maintaining up-time on the boss.   For some reason people keep using your ""Argument"" on why this stuff shouldn't be known. Maybe this is your first MMO, but knowing what a class can do when when given the green-light to go all out is always good information to have. No MMO allows players to go all out from start to finish in a fight.  The only difference in Tera from any other game is that maximum amount of back-time for bosses ranges from player to player instead of mechanic to mechanic. IE: Slayers and warriors can keep DPS rolling in a lot easier than Sorcs or Archers because of mobility."

Lancer are still required as tanks, but don't be expecting to tank much pre-65. The avatar weapons are so op now it hardly matters if there's a tank in the party pre-65. You'll also enjoy almost insta queue for instance matching as a tank... For now anyway. The coming patch introduces the ability to queue and start without a tank."
TeraOnline,3bqqh6,annoyedGamer,3,Wed Jul 1 11:42:26 2015 UTC,"The no tank patch is already out. Doesn't really affect the queue that much, it's a bit slower when there's less activity, but that's all.  Also you still can tank, making it even faster, you just need avatar weapon yourself."

I used to queue as tank on warrior and always got insta-queues (then I just DPS'd anyway since tanks are obsolete on early dungeons). Endgame dungeons also usually lack tank over a healer (in my experience on Highwatch atleast).  On some occasions as in vaults and such where tanks aren't really needed either, healers are in great demand though."

I don't wanna run dungeons only to have my gear become useless in less than a week  EDIT Just read this reply of yours:   If you're currently in Idoneal, it's likely that you'll be able to go straight to Ambit 2 using Idoneal 2. If you're in a reliable guild, or have a group of people that you can run dungeons with, you might be able to go to Disco 2 with Idoneal 2. Do NOT +12 ambit. Idoneal 2 is free and is much better than current ambit. Vanguard -> only for crystals (first) and masterwork alk (secondly). Never anything else.  so I'll go by that advice :P"

Ambit and Idoneal will be the only current gear that I would drastically recommend against with the new patch. You can still run BR 7 man and use vanguard credits for your Idoneal 2 which will allow you to begin the new content without needing to waste money on enchanting.

TeraOnline,3bn3hx,mejai,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just because of the generation gap, but I feel that the death of Aeris in FFVII was so much better played out.  She was involved in a love triangle with Cloud and Tifa, and I think Cloud's obvious intense personal issues made it that much more believable.  It's because he was so broken and unable to see love in  front of him from the girl next door and unsure if he should pursue anything with the girl he'd only just met.  Aeris was a part of the party, a powerful healer and prominent part of the story up until her death.  Other games didn't have the guts to kill off a character you'd come to rely on and pretty much always opted for a resurrection quest (e.g. Chrono Trigger) or surprise reappearance after a faked death.  Then there's Nobuo Uematsu's masterful score for her character which, up until that point, didn't seem sad at all and captured the character's innocence.  During the scene itself it transforms into this intensely sad orchestral that so well depicts the kind of malice it takes to utterly crush someone who had never harmed a single thing in her life.  Her body is allowed to sink at the end of the scene so the player is hit with the reality that the character is never coming back.  In case the player still doesn't believe what they've witnessed, Cloud sinks into a deep despair.  They toy with you, let you get drawn into the story, and there isn't even a hint at the event, and Uematsu strikes the fatal blow with one of the most memorable tunes ever composed for a video game.  It's as vivid in my mind as the day I first heard it.  It has ruined me for fictional deaths, including this one, ever since I first encountered it."

TeraOnline,3bp37a,Tossaway28966982,6,Wed Jul 1 00:17:35 2015 UTC,"Is it feasible to be a tank warrior and DPS warrior at the same time? Like not at the exact same time obviously, but on the same character? Like one dungeon I'm the tank, next dungeon I'm a DPS?   Yeah, that's perfectly doable. You will need more time/money to get both dps and tank equipment if you want to do both effectively, though.   How are Warriors in terms of DPS? Middle of the pack?   Right now it's kind of middle of the pack, however it's VERY dependant on the player. Very few people in NA actually play Warrior near-perfectly, and player skill highly affects dps output, especially for warriors. Next patch (in roughly a week from now) will bring them on par with the top tier dps, at the cost of reduced effectiveness on their endurance debuffs.   How's their skillcap?   High. Only comparable dps class in terms of skill cap are sorcs.   I plan to put a LOT of seat time into Warriors. Anything I should know?   Ping can affect your performance considerably, Warriors are perfectly playable at 100+ ping but you ideally want something under 60.   When fighting bosses/long fights, make sure you have your endurance debuffs up 100% of the time. (Combative Strike and 13 stacks of Traverse Cut) These highly affect not only your dps, but the dps of the whole party.  Your main damage output comes from Blade Draw and Scythe, find the fastest ways to chain into Blade Draw and work on managing edge stacks so you always Scythe at 10 stacks. Research glyph builds and crystals, always dps from the back of the boss. Work on cancelling ending animations to maximize your dps (meaning you're always executing your next chain skill as soon as all the damage ticks of your previous skill are finished).  DON'T SPACE BAR AS A WARRIOR. Don't get used to being a spacebar hero, as it will negatively affect you the most out of any other class. Manually input everything as best as you can.  Don't neglect skills. Warriors have a TON of skills, probably the most of any class (except maybe mystics/priests?), and most of them are used in some way. If you don't play with a gaming mouse with several buttons, you will have to reconfigure keybinds (use anything around WASD you find comfortable, you can also shift+key for shortcuts) Get used to every single skill you have, set up two different bars if you absolutely have to, however I would personally find a setup to have everything in one bar.   Unrelated to Warriors, but which classes have skills that self-heal (besides Reapers attack healing and Lancers Second Wind. Just trying to expand my game knowledge)   From the top of my head... (Most of these are from skill glyphs)  Zerkers have Vampiric Blow and Tenacity glyph, Gunners have HB7 self heal and Burst Fire healing glyph, Slayers have Overhand Strike and Fury Strike healing glyphs, Archers have Feign Death HP Glyph, Warriors have Rain of Blows glyph and something else...  For the healers, Priests have self heal, Kaias Shield HP glyph, restorative burst, divine respite and healing immersion (requires a nearby party member). Mystics have Thrall of Life, HP Motes + HP mote healing glyph, and warding totem.  I probably missed a lot of glyphs. Not sure about sorcs."

My ping is 40-50, topping at around 60. I should be okay. I don't spacebar, but am finding it difficult to balance attack and defense (then again my previous classes were Reapers, Lancers and Archers who either were full offense or full defense, so there wasnt much balance anyways.)   I do have a gaming mouse (Steelseries Sensei) and am finding it very useful.   Is the Rain of Blows glyph significant at all? :/"

TeraOnline,3bp37a,ZoidReborn,3,Wed Jul 1 19:39:42 2015 UTC,Yes it should be feasible. You can set up different shortcut bars (alt + 1 for skill bar 1 for example). So have 1 set up for tanking and another for dps. Also keep your gear/crystals on hand in your inventory if you need to switch without travelling to your bank etc.   As for self heal; priest and mystic obviously and then the gunners robot can self heal fairly well too
TeraOnline,3bp37a,Cathlulu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:22:41 2015 UTC,"Warriors have two types of gloves that can drop/craft.  There are gloves that are good for offense, and those good for defense.

TeraOnline,3bp37a,TorrentRage,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:17:09 2015 UTC,"Completely possible. You just need to need to invest into 2 sets of equipment. I save my equipment and glyph sets so I can quickly swap when I want. Also, remember to swap your glyph/hotkeys/equipment every time you want to switch. Honestly, don't worry about this unless you a pro trying to make record runs. A good Warrior will likely outdps an average <insert class here>. Arguably the hardest class in the game. However, if you are good at MMOs or games in general, then this isn't an issue. It just takes time to learn the combos, but by the time you're 65, it will be second nature. They are getting a buff next patch which will should remove any stigma towards the class so expect to find groups even easier. Personally, I find them very fun since you have to keep up your combos. Also, being able to queue up as a tank and just go  DPS is also very nice. I have no idea :/ Reapers, Mystics, Priest, Warrior AFAIK"
TeraOnline,3bp37a,MildLife,0,Wed Jul 1 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"1) yes, completely. I switch dps or tank depending on what is needed for schm.  2) Middle-top atm once played near perfection.  3) You can get a lot more out of warriors than people give them credit for. You become near top tier dps once you get 100% uptime which means that you need a lot of skill to use it to the full extent.  4) Once you perfect warrior you become a god among dps."

TeraOnline,3bp37a,MildLife,2,Wed Jul 1 05:43:36 2015 UTC,"you're not wrong to question TorrentRage's comment. his 4th claim is false and is a complete bias. warrior dps at the current patch can reach nowhere godlike. the max you could ever do at a relevant boss, for example perimos is roughly 670k~700k/s where gunners can reach 900k~1kk/s. that is roughly 50m-70m total damage in difference assuming enraged perimos takes 3:30 (which is approximately 12950+ score). even if gunners do not benefit from the traverse cut debuff, they will still be up tens of millions of damage. 670k-700k dps for warriors is essentially critting 80%+ on scythe so that in itself is a volatile factor in terms of warrior dps"
TeraOnline,3bp37a,Catalystd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:24:38 2015 UTC,Yeah nice to hear someone who knows about the class chime in. The reason they are valued is their debuff however that does not account for personal dps. On July 7th that power from the debuff will be moved to individual power so essentially to put it into perspective my 45 second vault highscore will soon be 30 seconds
TeraOnline,3bp37a,VOTWarrior,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:37:30 2015 UTC,How does someone get 45 second vault on warrior? I feel like my damage is severely reduced and it takes me atleast 2-3 mins in full disco / correct setup.

TeraOnline,3bp37a,dragonbeast1122,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:06:03 2015 UTC,"Warriors secretly provide ~11.05% of their allied DPS due to Traverse Cut, so they are technically top DPS right now. The patch moves the damage they provide to the party into the Warrior themselves, so they just become a top DPS on their own merit.  Warriors can clear current vault in around 1 minute?"
TeraOnline,3bp37a,TorrentRage,0,Wed Jul 1 11:43:59 2015 UTC,"Just providing boss dbuffs does not make them top tier dps. It makes them a desired class, but until the patch, they just can't output the shear numbers that other classes can.  Also, vault is an AWFUL way to compare dps, and 1 minute is pretty average for a skilled disco dps. The best I've seen is 30 seconds on archer that a guildie did."

I also included another picture in there of my damage from the same run, it shows that I do indeed crit often.

During one deadly gamble, I can get off 2 reaping slash and use a third one right after with reduced cooldowns, so I have like 42 seconds of reaping active just from one deadly gamble, and then I fit in one more while deadly gamble is off, so it is up like half the time."

TeraOnline,3br0yq,Catalystd,2,Wed Jul 1 14:04:09 2015 UTC,Judging damage from a few hits doesn't really show anything. Run a meter so you can see a more accurate dps over the course a fight. Just don't talk about the meter in game.
TeraOnline,3br0yq,Kourinn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:23:15 2015 UTC,"I don't run a dps meter myself, but I have seen the results of other people's dps meters in my runs, and I usually surpass expectations. Warriors are unfairly labeled as low dps class with party endurance debuff. While its true that traverse cut is a major component of why warriors are awesome, they also have good damage themselves, which many people seem to not understand until they see the results of a dps meter."
TeraOnline,3br0yq,Penetrat0r1,3,Wed Jul 1 14:31:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's unfairly. I have a disco war. Skill can bridge many gaps. But equally skilled dps will always have the war below slayer/zerk/gunner.   I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the most skilled player in the world. But when you can switch classes and try less hard and still get the same numbers, a buff is needed."
TeraOnline,3br0yq,Soleria,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"He's running double healer, so his dps is going to be sky high as well.  That's what happens when you run double healer.  I actually think the second highest score on MT is a double healer+war archer comp"
TeraOnline,3br0yq,Xivaxi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:32:31 2015 UTC,"Just because you have stacked gear doesn't mean warriors don't need a buff. You can do damage with any class if you have the gear for it. Go compare a warrior in full disco vs a slayer in full disco or a gunner in full disco. If all of them are equivalent in damage, while everyone is equally as skilled, i will eat my shorts.   I'm in full disco and i can beat incompetent people playing OP classes. But from an objective standpoint, Warriors don't have much going for them in terms of raw power. It's high risk low reward. We also have to go through so many more actions to achieve something a gunner can do with 1 button.  At the end of the day, it's not about individual power, because i can still do solo stuff no problem and run RG reasonably fast. But when you take a step back and look at all the classes, Warriors and Sorcs are clearly the losers at the current moment."
TeraOnline,3br0yq,Xivaxi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, warriors did not need a buff, but they do need a rework.  The next patch reintroduces 10 man raids. In case you weren't around back during Wonderholme or Rift's Edge era, raids were very prejudice against taking more than one warrior because a lot of a warrior's power comes from their strong debuffs and scythe burst. Nobody wanted a 2nd dps warrior because they could not add debuffs and had the lowest burst damage for shield phases because you cannot stack edge during shield phase, and if the two warriors are sharing edge it is incredibly difficult to coordinate who scythes, when they scythe, and when to hold onto scythe to save it for an upcoming shield/enrage/knockdown phase.  The next patch's rework moves a bunch of power away from warrior debuffs and instead adds the damage back on their favorite skills and greatly simplifies edge usage. It changes reaping slash to give edge, not consume it, lowers blade draw cooldown to increase edge generation, increases damage from several skills to give warriors more damage without scythe, lets us build edge on shields and removes cast animation from deadly gamble to give us burst damage for burn phases, and much more.  It is possible that after the changes, warriors will be a bit buffed from this rework, but please don't overvalue the raw number changes from translated patch notes and don't undervalue the -9% endurance debuff and +25% scythe damage debuffs we're giving up in exchange. It is not as big a buff as the raw numbers may appear."
TeraOnline,3br0yq,narium,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:55:01 2015 UTC,Nobody ever really said that. So many people are playing Warrior right now and it may be true they arent the best DPS class but I think most people would agree that they are at a decent spot and provide nice survivability and more DPS for the whole group. I never really understood the upcoming changes for Warrior.
TeraOnline,3br0yq,Dorion_FFXI,2,Wed Jul 1 13:54:11 2015 UTC,Basically all the damage that your team mates got from your debuffs is just being put into the warriors hands now.
TeraOnline,3br0yq,Afan9001,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:01:04 2015 UTC,I made this post more or less in response to people who refuse to take multiple warriors into their schm groups (or any party for that matter I guess) claiming that warrior damage is low and that its useless to have multiple warriors etc etc. I get incredibly annoyed when I apply to a group and get denied because they have a warrior already.
TeraOnline,3br0yq,ZankaA,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:05:48 2015 UTC,the issue with multiple warriors is sharing edge is a pain.

I've never seen pug warriors coordinate it well without someone clipping a scythe, and most of the time one warrior just gives up his scythes altogether."
TeraOnline,3br0yq,TheSpoon1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:24:50 2015 UTC,"That's definitely true, you make valid points, sharing edge can be less than optimal at times. However, its not so significant that it hinders any game play, and any pair of good warriors should be able to share edge (decently) well. I don't see the point in rejecting a willing dps and then sitting in LFG for 30 mins looking for a ""skilled"" dps for schm since the number of players who are online on a given server who are looking to join an schm party is pretty low..."
TeraOnline,3br0yq,Afan9001,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:39:01 2015 UTC,2x warrior DPS can get pretty sketchy for the first room too. It's less of a problem now with Generation but when the best you had was +12  Discovery it could get questionable.  Every other boss in the dungeon can be 4-manned even in +12 Disco (I know from experience...)
TeraOnline,3br0yq,just_a_null,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:27:16 2015 UTC,I can understand why people don't like Warriors. Generally speaking they do do less damage than other DPS classes. This isn't because they can't do good damage but because most warriors don't play their class well enough to do so. I've met some good warriors but would never intentionally grab one in a PUG since it's a bit of a gamble and IMO not worth the risk.

TeraOnline,3boojd,Idkfax,3,Wed Jul 1 00:13:55 2015 UTC,I have done rigerous testing between EU and NA. On EU I have 30 ping ad on NA around 130 stable.   Before putting the 2 clients side by side it might be difficult to think there would be much of a difference but it is very noticable with ~100 ping difference.

TeraOnline,3boojd,the_shadow002,2,Wed Jul 1 08:57:32 2015 UTC,I played warrior for a while and avoided priest or mystic as my ping is  220-240 from Australia. It's gotten worse now however due to my ISP buying another and being terrible at integrating their networks together.   There are also a lot of congestion issues now because the exchanges cant keep up with bandwidth demand since Netflix came out in March this year over here.  I got back into things with the gunner and I often get ping spikes of up to 400-500ms - 1000ms and desyncs. For me compared to my warrior the gunner is much more forgiving if you have to deal with bad ping - plate armor helps cut down on damage and the HB-7 heals you even if your ping is bad.   So far I'm just learning to compensate and work around the ping because my ISP has no idea how long its going to take them to fix anything.

I've tried every other class though, lowest ping was about 190ms (not constant, jumps around).   I've done everything this game has got to offer in terms of challenge @ said ms, and cleared them perfectly until now (tanking, DPS, etc).  I've played Priest, Berserker, and Gunner. So far, Gunner is the most forgiving in terms of ping, and especially so in equalized battlegrounds like Corsair.   I found Warrior to be easy too at higher latency, more so in PvE than PvP (due to stun times and set-ups), but it could be just my playstyle adapted to the lag.   Anyway, yeah, Gunner, and a class that has high attack speed will offset the latency. Won't help you though if you're used to 30ms."

TeraOnline,3bmr0r,realdeal111111,3,Tue Jun 30 13:55:33 2015 UTC,"Never rely on crits as healer. Keen is immediately out the door. Attack speed is nice, especially on priest, but vyrsks only give a 1% increase, totalling 4% for a complete set. It's particularly underwhelming vs +10% healing or +12 endurance (and this is coming from someone who stacks maybe a bit too much attack speed on priest). The only two real options (for PVE) are grounding and succoring. From my experience succoring is almost always better but grounding has particular niche uses when you are undergeared, learning a dungeon, still learning to use iframes properly or any other scenario where you're expecting to take a lot of damage (learning the last boss of SC comes to mind)."

TeraOnline,3bmr0r,fluffy-tails,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:46:41 2015 UTC,Its preference between swift/succoring/grounding. Personally I use attack speed because I heal enough as a priest where the difference succoring makes is negligible with a decent weapon and I don't get hit enough to justify grounding.
TeraOnline,3bmr0r,MildLife,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:50:08 2015 UTC,"I would go between Swift and Succoring.  Carving is just RNG so not very reliable. Grounding is a crutch for learning boss mechanics and i-framing. Unless you are learning the fight, then they are okay.  Use enough Swifts until you feel fast enough, if you have leftover slots, go succoring."
TeraOnline,3bmr0r,Happymapler,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"I like swift for healers personally, faster animation speeds means less time vulnerable stuck in place while casting.  Succoring is decent but you shouldn't need the bonus heals if you're keeping on top of your teams health situation.  Grounding isn't useful for much, carving can be nice for dps but as a healer you don't want to rely on crit-heals to save people."
TeraOnline,3bmr0r,Kitsune241,-2,Tue Jun 30 14:19:24 2015 UTC,These kinds of questions are really tough to answer without knowing your build. Do you feel like you need more healing or is your healing adequate? Do you feel like you need more endurance? How often are you critting with your heals? Take all of that into account and pick accordingly.  On my priest I use 3 grounding and 1 carving (I am already rolled pretty heavily for healing and don't feel like I need any more healing to get the job done).

From one of Espei's earlier patch translations:   Enchanting and Equipment  A new alkahest has been added: Premium Extensive Alkahest    This new alkahest can be used to enchant regular and awakened gear, has a higher success chance and if the enchant fails, gives a higher correction % New alkahest can be obtained through their new loot box    TL Note: I have no idea what the above alkahest would be called in English so since it seems to have the two features of currently known alkahests let’s just merge the names.  The Awakening System has been adjusted  When awakening gear the following alkahests may now be used to awaken and enchant the awakened gear along with the Masterwork Alkahest:    Premium Extensive Alkahest Extensive Alkahest Premium Alkahest The number of alkahests required to awaken and enchant the gear will be slightly lowered for the alkahests mentioned above    TL Note: I am unsure whether the names mentioned equates to Extensive and Premium Alkahests in NA. KTERA seems to have different Alkahests and this may be adjusted for NA. Please don’t ask me if it will apply to NA, wait for EME to release information or I will stab you with a spoon.

Priests can just heal better and their buffs are easier to acquire."

TeraOnline,3bmh7z,SourDinkleberry,3,Tue Jun 30 13:32:09 2015 UTC,"I still don't know about that... People go to the obvious ""lack of iframes"" as a reason why zerkers have it especially rough in current end-game content. Sure you have a 15 second roll and a 5 minute Unbreakable. But I don't think people are learning their animations and using their skill rotations, including leaping + lethal strikes when appropriate (watching cooldowns too).  When I was still learning SC (coming right out of BR) I would always use my shouts whenever and hold down block when things look iffy. It's not particularly hard to realize that there are new mechanics that you can't just block like you could in BR anymore.  I think as long as people are able to realize that fact and realize that zerkers have leaping + lethal it's really not difficult to clear SCHM and even get title in a few weeks from 0 clears."
TeraOnline,3bmh7z,Happymapler,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"Totally with you. I used to complain quite a lot about where the melee zerk stands in the game overall. My thought process was that, constantly, each set of new content was focused on mechanics, and as a result, the amount of block-able damage that comes from each boss is being reduced and being shifted to ""avoid-this-or-die"". I'd been playing zerk for a year and hadn't even thought about using lethal or leaping; nor had I even bothered to consider that esmash can be used to reposition instead of being a reserved iframe for mechanics. Over the 2 years I've played the class I've actually come to believe they're more mobile than people give them credit for. Once people realize that berserker's aren't a 2 skill character, they'll begin to realize the full potential of the class.  I've incorporated both leaping (the addition of being able to block cancel leaping REALLY helps) and lethal into my playstyle and I honestly can't complain about where they stand. Their dps is unbelievably high, and if you use them without the 2 skill mindset you'll actually realize there's a lot more to them. I haven't had any trouble dodging or otherwise iframing any sort of damage in any dungeon ever since."
TeraOnline,3bmh7z,loneleh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:17:08 2015 UTC,"Kudos for learning how to be better at your class. I'm  pretty sure the game testers have attempted every boss with every class and made sure that they are all do-able with relative ease if you know what you are doing. Sometimes it will be harder for a specific class, but you just have to find workarounds such as reposition earlier."
TeraOnline,3bmh7z,loneleh,2,Wed Jul 1 19:23:34 2015 UTC,"For next patch, reapers because they will be so much stronger next patch. Gunners because gunners. Priest because they're better with gunners. Honestly lancer or warrior because both will be able to infuriate and traverse is always good (nerfed tho). Last dps is up to you. Run the meter and figure out who does more damage and pick him."
TeraOnline,3bmh7z,dragonbeast1122,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:28:25 2015 UTC,"I play on russian server, we will get gunner and SC sometime next month, so reaper buff is a long way ahead =) so i was thinking slayer warrior and since i've been informed that zerk will have a bad time i'm thinking rerolling to gunner and my party is golden, but i love my female amani so much lol"
TeraOnline,3bmh7z,loneleh,2,Tue Jun 30 13:33:25 2015 UTC,"Oh if you're only going to get gunner then if you care a lot about DPS then definitely roll at least 1 gunner into the party. Assuming your tank knows how to do his job. Slayers are still extremely strong, and same with zerkers. Warriors are also very good with traverse (the nerf will come later but it's definitely a huge DPS boost to the rest of your party).  On gunner patch I think one of the strongest comps you can take now (thinking towards SC) is definitely: Lancer, Warrior, Gunner   Slayer (low entry barrier; good mix of doing big damage and plenty of iframes; self explanatory) Reaper (low entry barrier, higher skill cap; can do insane amount of damage in sky cruiser if she knows how to absolutely maximize everything - but has higher skill cap than slayers in order to match slayer's damage retributionstillop) Berserker (higher entry barrier [for end game content, not BR..]; a lot of zerks rerolled because they gave up on learning it this patch - things can 1 shot through blocks a lot without gear and needing to learn leaping + lethal + saving roll + timing unbreakable - but zerkers are still as hard hitting as before)   Basically you still want to focus more on the actual players than the classes they play, and their willingness to go through wipes without getting frustrated and giving up easily. For a general gauge on skill levels, people who have Surgeon/Shandra Maniac are all good candidates. Another good option is to run BRHM and run a dps meter to see who actually is doing their job and who isn't."
TeraOnline,3bmh7z,dragonbeast1122,2,Tue Jun 30 14:04:40 2015 UTC,"I would like to add that Reapers are also really helpful with ghosts in SCENM/HM. Their 3 low CD stuns make ghosts a breeze and in HM double ghosts, if those are not enough Shadow Reaping makes 2 of those 3 stuns have almost no CD and offers a massive boost to damage.   retributionstillop   Seriously, there is nothing in SCE that this skill can't block and even in BR the only thing it can't block is Annihilation.

TeraOnline,3bmh7z,CenomX,2,Tue Jun 30 14:35:38 2015 UTC,"If your entire party is able to avoid debuffs I'd switch to the Mystic route, they are much harder to play and have fewer heals, but if your party is good enough at iframing they provide a huge crit aura that will make your entire party do a lot more damage. they're also getting more damage buffs in the future and becoming a bit more healy.  If you decide to go with a Mystic your dps should be Zerker/Slayer/Archer/Sorc (any combination, including doubles) and not Gunner as they don't rely on crit factor due to the already high crit chance of their spells.  If you decide to stick with a Priest, which will make the run easier for your entire party survival wise, but nerf your damage, and thus make it more gear dependent to run fights that have enrage timers, you can really run with any combination of dps, I'd suggest having a Gunner as they're probably not going to be any weaker anytime soon, and Slayer is pretty easy to learn, I'd stay away from having 3 melee with a zerker, as zerkers have issues moving away when other players are blocking them from doing so."

TeraOnline,3bp68a,blueteakettle,-8,Wed Jul 1 01:00:42 2015 UTC,"So wait... you're telling me it's built into the game that I must do this every time I execute a skill to get smooth game play? Sounds like terrible class design to me. And I see zero purpose in locking me down after I use a skill. I can live with a lock during an animation on some skills, but never after."
TeraOnline,3bp68a,blueteakettle,7,Wed Jul 1 01:11:17 2015 UTC,"Shrug you don't have to do it but you're not going to be the world best zerker any time soon.   Most every skill based game has something like this. Playing marksman in League of Legend, you should auto attack animation cancel.  Anyways, keep in mind that as you build attack speed, a lot of the animation lock time goes down. With +12 endgame gear, it's not that bad. But you should still be block canceling if you want to do good dps."
TeraOnline,3bp68a,Ryndis,3,Wed Jul 1 01:14:54 2015 UTC,Shit like this exists in almost every action game. Wave Dashing in Melee is a good example of an unintended increase to skill ceiling.

TeraOnline,3bp68a,Yisery,2,Wed Jul 1 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's bad design imo and it's only purpose seems to be for satisfying the mechanically affine players who like animation canceling. Besides that, animation cancelling is such a linear mechanic it barely ever makes sense not to do it, which is what makes it bad design.   Animation lock after skills is okay for punishing the execution of hard hitting spells that should leave windows open for punishment. Animation cancelling is just for egos."
TeraOnline,3bp68a,SourDinkleberry,3,Wed Jul 1 05:40:06 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is that you don't have to play it if you don't like it.  Most every class needs some sort of rotation. Block cancelling just happens to be a part of Berserker's kit. With some practice you'll be able to block cancel every single skill you use on a regular basis, and this will allow you to get out of the animation almost instantaneously.   For example, Slayers and Warriors approach borderlines uselessness if they use skills unwisely/in the wrong order/without thinking ahead."

Also keep in mind that Zerkers don't actually get their fun abilities until like level 50 or so. There are some REALLY cheesy things you can do in PvP and you can still play them how they're meant to be played and outdps others in PvE, though with the animations you REALLY need to get used to when you can and cannot attack."

Your friend needs to be checked into a mental health clinic, not much of that actually makes sense in the context of Tera. You get better gear by playing the game, not by spending real money (and tier 3 is lousy levelling stuff so we'll assume he meant tier 6). Needing a mount to get gear is quite silly. Also gems =/= real money.  Getting gear enchanted to +15 is quite expensive, so that makes pvp slightly unbalanced but it's still doable without paying real money."

It's a balancing thing you can't do much about and the fact warriors can tank or dps. Gunner was my first class and I've played a lot of classes after that, arcane barrage pretty much auto crits and HB(robot) follows up on it, and the skill can reset. Plus back crits. Hard to compete with gunners. But beyond that it's pretty much what people have already said so you can get comparable damage to a slayer"

I just always try to choose the quickest skill that will chain me into blade draw. If you're using traverse cut and you already have the 13 stacks, just cancel traverse cut early and go straight for the blade draw this will increase your DPS a bit. It's hard to write down what a good warrior rotation is just do whatever is on CD to get to blade draw the quickest.  Blade draw does the most dmg over the course of the battle and scythe is the hardest hitting skill.  Warrior dps depends a lot on RNG to, because blade draw has a 50% chance to reset you can't always produce consistent numbers on a warrior."

As of now i can get up to a 9 sec cd on my scythe with nostrums and cdr rolls and enegetic etchings.

Anything else you glyph is really up to preference or the situation/dungeon.   As for UI, I see most priests replace their left mouse button with either Healing Immersion or Focus Heal. The skills you use the most (Purifying Circle, Triple Nemesis, Healing Immersion/Healing Circle/Focus Heal, Restorative Burst, Mana Charge, Energy Stars) should be somewhere comfortable for you to reach as you'll be using them often. Movement skills (Backstep/Fiery Escape) should be put somewhere that you can press quickly. The other skills you have that are situationally used, so put them wherever you want.  As for setting up the skillbar itself, I use F1-F4, 1-6, Q, E, R, T, V, ` as additional buttons not including mouse buttons. You can also use modifier keys like Shift, Ctrl, and Alt as well if you find that more comfortable. I use my NumPad for consumables.  Tips and tricks I can recommend for you are:   Don't waste Backstep if you can avoid it in HM dungeons. Most of the time, Fiery Escape or just walking will do you just fine in most situations. Use Backstep to iframe something that you can't get out of that will actually hurt. Although your main priority is keeping teammates alive, you should focus on keeping your support skills active to help improve your parties DPS (Energy Stars, Triple Nemesis debuff, Mana Charge/Restorative Burst) and to keep everyone buffed up with your long duration Blessings for Power, Endurance, and HP regen. Please read up on guides for level 65 dungeons. Knowing the healer's role in a dungeon will be extremely important. From cleansing debuffs to using Plague of Exhaustion or Ishara's Lullaby at the right time can often save the party from a wipe or make DPSing the boss a lot easier. The healer is often the most important part of the run and staying alive is going to be a huge priority for you. When keeping people alive, prioritize yourself first, then the tank, then the DPS."

But you want to put your low CD spammable skills on nearby keys.   For example you want to try to make use of keys such as Q, E, R, T(maybe), X, Z (assuming you move with W S A D like I do) and another favorite of mine is Alt+S (I use that for Kaia's Shield) but that's just what works for me. I also use a button on my mouse for the Zenobia's Vortex you get in your level 60s. I put my self heal on Q and my Focus Heal on ""1."" it's really different for everybody and you'll need to experiment with it.  The key is use what works for you, you want to be able to get to it easily and one important factor and question to ask yourself for really important skills, can you move around easily while reaching for that key?

Also I must have dropped it at least 200 times and it doesn't seem to have any problems yet  If you don't feel like wasting 60 bucks on a mouse, you can find similar models for ~5 dollars as well.

So at least Manacharge and your normal teammate heal seem essential to me. I also like to keep self heal on there because of how often I use it in an emergency.  I put stuff like Energy Stars, Sleep, Kaia's Shield, Plague of Exhaustion or Triple Nemesis on buttons near my movement keys because while essential, they're cast less often and are generally less of a spit second decision than the first three skills I've mentioned. I did have all of the abilities in my post bound to my mouse at one point or another though.   If you're running out of spots near your numpad it could be worth it to make some 'weird' keybinds consisting of 2 keys as well. I personally use shift+key, though that's probably easier with WASD.  P.S: I have dodge on right click, but I don't remember if that's default or not."

Contrary to what the other guy said, salivating (as well as griefing) apply ONCE PER SKILL. Whirlwind = 1. Barrage = 1. Rising Fury = 1. Cyclone = 1. It does not apply once every tick of a skill.   Cruel applies to the skill that applies the KD. (Eg, if you crit on MS it will count on MS).   Forceful applies AFTER the buff shows up on your bar. You do NOT get forceful on the attack that procs forceful.  Brutal procs on KDed targets only. It does NOT proc on the initial skill you KD with. It also gives nowhere near 10% damage boost but that's another issue altogether.   Retaliate is considered STANDING. You can test this by using leaping strike. People in the retal animation do NOT take full damage from leaping strike."

TeraOnline,3bjj8u,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:49:26 2015 UTC,"So based on what you're saying, so far all crystals bar Virulent apply AFTER the triggering attack does its damage. Interesting.  I'm lvl 37 on NA but I think I can still test this. I'll try to do it now, let me see if I even have Cruels, Forcefuls and Brutals at this level.  Also what do you mean Brutal is ""nowhere near 10%""?  EDIT: Had no Brutals but here's the other two. TEST RESULTS  Weapon rolls: 5,3% damage from behind, 5.3% on prone targets.    NO CRYSTALS  Front damage: Crit 14.653 | Noncrit 6.541  Back damage: Crit 15.396 | Noncrit: ---- (couldn't manage to get one)    FORCEFUL ONLY  Front damage: Crit 14.653 | Noncrit 6.541  Back damage: Crit 15.396   WITH FORCEFULNESS BUFF  Front damage: Crit 15.773  Back damage: Crit 16.573  FORCEFUL DOES NOT BOOST THE TRIGGERING ATTACK.    CRUEL ONLY  Front damage: Crit 14.653  WITH BUFF  Front damage: Crit 17.458  (The +5.3% damage on prone monsters is affecting it too but the difference is too big to be just that, if the boost was just 5.3% it should be exactly 15.396 [the backcrit damage value] since i only have +5.3% damage from back, and +5.3% damage to prone, so frontal prone damage = back non-prone damage. This was to make sure that there are no doubts that the buff is indeed affecting the damage.) So...  CRUEL DOES NOT BOOST THE TRIGGERING ATTACK"

Generally the servers come up about 15 minutes before the end of the scheduled maintenance time, but I've gotten in up to an hour early before. Although it's not uncommon for them to use the full duration, and situationally they may extend maintenance an extra 15-30 minutes if they're trying to be thorough such as in the preparation for the upcoming mega patch."

TeraOnline,3bjtun,Nanilu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:53:32 2015 UTC,Blessed unless you have ungodly bad luck.
TeraOnline,3bjtun,stealthrazor,2,Tue Jun 30 14:00:52 2015 UTC,"Really all depends on RNGesus blessing you or not.  I personally use Blessed. I think that the rate tends to be lower, and you also have to purchase less of the Intricate Ident Scrolls. They might be 53g a pop, but those can add up when MES rerolling."

Anyone manage to overcome this issue?"
TeraOnline,3bjtun,Forgotten_Aeon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:22:15 2015 UTC,"Hold block.  If you're using attacking skill, running, or simply standing the boss will clip through you. However, if you stand directly in front of the boss and hold block you will always get pushed back instead of being trampled/glitched through.   If the boss glitches through you while blocking (not the same as pushing you aside which can happen), this is due to network issues (most commonly packet loss) to which I recommend changing your DNS, Flushing your DNS cache, and if possible, port forward to your server through your router's firewall."

Boots are debatable (how important is the extra mana regen, move speed, and endurance to your class?). If you have a discovery weapon it should already be +12. If you're still using ambit and its not +12, hold off and upgrade to Fulminate (Idoneal II) or Wroth (Ambit II) and +12 that.

TeraOnline,3bkt7g,illitirit,3,Tue Jun 30 01:08:55 2015 UTC,1) only 1  2) Depends on what you want to do with it. Weapons master allows for midtier weapon crafting that can yield a lot of money but takes a long time. Alchemy tends to be the way for making money and is the most useful since you can make your own potions.   3) ^   4) Not even remotely. Let gathering go up passively. Worry about that when you're 65. You can craft things here and there along the way.
TeraOnline,3bkt7g,SourDinkleberry,2,Tue Jun 30 01:13:03 2015 UTC,"Just wait until at least 60 they give you quests at that level for them. You can raise them all to 400, but you can only get one to 800. The profession really doesn't matter for what class you are its more if you want to make gear or money. Alchemy and Etching are most money, alchemy is consistent  while etching is a gamble."

Duo account isn't difficult, pre avatar I used a lancer and a sorcerer to level. (which at the time was far quicker then getting groups/ question).   Leveling in general now is a joke, though depending if you're a priest / lancer it can become tedious. During the leveling event my fastest was maybe 12 hours total leveling with the occasional +9ing gear after a run / brokering gear for big profits. So it'll take a rough average of 3-4 days for a casual player to level, unless you don't plan to solo 5 man dungeons.

Cascades and Signets are jewelry and they're called Signets and Cascades.   There are different accessories that give different set bonuses to benefit the class you play. There are different tiers of accessories. Tier 1 accessories are referred to as rings and hoops (in PvP) and “-trill” (in PvE); Tier 2 accessories are referred to as signets and cascades (in PvP) and “-beat” (in PvE). PvP necklaces can only be bought through the Bellicarium merchant. (Note that PvP accessories that drop are not re-rollable through semi-enigmatic scrolls while PvE accessories are rerollable.)

If you aim for that 150 mark then your burst fire will crit 90% of the time which maintains insane DPS for when AB is off cooldown. If you go full power you are relying on your AB reset for DPS, not optimal in my opinion. You want to AB off CD and build your willpower up and then you want to summon bot (makes sure it lands on a back crit as it's equals half an AB worth of damage) into immediately dumping all that willpower out using Burst First until AB is off cooldown."
TeraOnline,3bkz00,tyrenzo,2,Tue Jun 30 07:01:16 2015 UTC,"This is SO RIGHT! I went full power at the begging after this I sarted noticing how most of my skills wouldnt crit at all, I changed a few, got more crit and I stopped depending on the ab reset to do proper dps. Anyway, you should try it yourself ^"
TeraOnline,3bkz00,Priest_Dps,2,Tue Jun 30 12:54:45 2015 UTC,"Yup this; you need around +90/100 CF besides the base CF, generally a Deathwise Signet, Cascade, Crit rolls on gloves, Belt, brooch should get you close. I have seen a really good gunner roll +14 crit on his gene weap as the 4th roll, but I personally went for CDR."

TeraOnline,3bkz00,fluffy-tails,0,Tue Jun 30 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"The thing about Gunners is that like 70% of their DPS comes from Arcane Barrage and Burst Fire, which already have insanely high innate crit chances. Most gunners will stack Power so that these skills can crit for larger numbers. Most of your other filler skills (Scattershot, Time Bomb, Arc Bomb) are really used to build Willpower for Burst Fire rather than deal damage."
TeraOnline,3bkz00,tyrenzo,2,Tue Jun 30 05:53:40 2015 UTC,With low crit factor burst fire is a mediocre skill. Going full power it'll crit 50% of the time compared to 90% of the time with crit factor. The difference is huge and should not be ignored.

The only other thing I would add is that you should use the Battleground Matching icon in your menu to see the full PVP map options. You'll be able to see which maps have multiple options available as far as equalized, unequalized, pre-made, etc. On my L65s if I open that tab I have a total of 11 battleground options: 4 for Skyring, 1 for Coliseum, 3 for Fraywind Canyon, 2 for Corsair's Stronghold, and 1 for Kumasylum."

But that gear is accessible from PvP?   the ""maps""(battlegrounds) that have equalized gear provide you with credits(currency) to purchase designs and materials required to craft your pvp gear(you do not really need to level up your crafting, however, this would require you to buy some of the materials as they are processed/refined).  FWC, for example, will take you a long time to queue for if you do it equalized, most people do non-equalized(utilization of the gear you actually have) because their gear is usually top tier(some ppl will go in with +15 renegade) enabling them to wreck.  you don't need to PVE, but it makes it a lot more useful; people mentioning the vanguard credits, this currency allows you to purcahse crystals and vrysks, usually these crystals/vyrsks can cost upwards of 1300g a piece, thats at least 15k in gold to get these. these are essential for PVP.  and lol, there are annoying people that attack lower levels because it makes them feel superior. on Valley of titans, we have a berserker lvl 22 with top gear dueling new players, yet he is extremely experienced. . ."

TeraOnline,3bitvc,stealthrazor,5,Mon Jun 29 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"For 1 month of gameplay you have a decent grasp of the class.   Just remember that CS isn't a true representation of large scale PvP/player skill since there's too much chaos and too little communication for them to actually stop you from freely casting and killing several people. There's a lot more to the class than throwing fireblasts (albeit that's your job for large scale pvp), but don't forget about CC and positioning. They'll be focusing the gate and dropping like flies and maybe some people will try to kill you but most people aren't that good in CS.   Be sure to start learning combos(that includes removing all spacebar chains that you have popping up, even if you dont use them) and other class skills if you want to start PvPing seriously. You can practice by dueling and watching other sorc videos.  Learn to use all of your skills, since you only use damaging ones while forgetting about your debuffs. You can sleep, silence, drain mana, reduce healing, and stun people.  Keep up the good work, it's only been one month. You'll get much better over time."

You mostly stuck to your heavy hitting skills, and for large scale PvP that isn't too bad, but you're going to want to practice with your stun/silence/mana drain. One thing I noticed is that the enemy team didn't really attack you much; I think that a good slayer that targeted you would take you down fairly quickly with the moves you were using. Try posting videos where you are getting focused more (perhaps duels or 3v3s) if you want a better assessment of your PvP skills."

TeraOnline,3bkbx6,jetah,5,Mon Jun 29 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"That is the only difference really, i'd personally just pick a pve server since i don't enjoy getting randomly PK'd and oneshot by a max level or getting max level and running around doing it to lowbies. But whatever floats your boat. Tempest reach is the most populated, followed by ascension valley.  As for the differences, one is not really better than the other they're vastly different. Priest being a pretty much pure support class while sorcerer is pure dps/aoe. Just choose based on whether you want to be a support or a dps. I'd go with the priest since you're already going to have a gunner. Maybe try out Mystic, they can solo a bit better than a priest with their summons although it's still going to be slow.  As the other two said, you're not really going to be soloing anyone as either of those classes, especially with cloth classes being extra squishy. You'd be better off rolling a Lancer, Warrior, or Berserker especially with the upcoming patch if you want to 1v1 people."
TeraOnline,3bkbx6,acematador777,3,Mon Jun 29 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"I would also choose Mystic over a priest. I have leveled both healers and with my play style and commitment, Mystic was much more fun for me."
TeraOnline,3bkbx6,Lexicon929,3,Mon Jun 29 23:27:12 2015 UTC,"Would you choose a Sorcerer over a Priest as well?  If so, why?  Thanks in advance!  Honestly...the only reason I'm considering the support role is due to the fact that I come from the MOBA universe, where building damage items leads to easy kills, even for supports.  I also dabbled in TF2 a few years back.  I played medic a lot, and I had fun healing the enemy spies.  Or sniping noob snipers on 2fort with the Crusader's Crossbow (2-shots them).  So I guess I'm asking if support classes can carry themselves forwards through dealing damage as opposed to defensively healing."
TeraOnline,3bkbx6,acematador777,2,Mon Jun 29 23:42:17 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you got down voted, but there's not really a clear answer there for a flat out, i'd play this class over this class because they're so different. Based on your past experiences for you personally, i'd choose a sorcerer as you're looking to be able to deal damage.   But to answer your later question, as a moba player myself no, supports cannot really carry themselves compared to those games. There's not really a alternate dps spec for the support classes like those games where you can just build yourself differently, you could try to gylph for damage but that's a terrible idea as you'd get out damaged so hard by any of the 6 dps classes. While the developers did put skills in to allow the mystic and priest to be able to solo things such as Shocking Implosion for priest, you're still going to be vastly slower than any of the dps classes. Your life will be 10x easier if you just duo with someone who is playing a dps.   Tera healers are more geared towards traditional mmo healers where it's defensive healing and constantly being topped off, not sure what mobas you play but think old soraka in LoL as the closest example, although they do have auras and other things and you have to pay attention as healing does draw aggro, although if you have a good dps or tank you should never be drawing aggro in a group.   The mmo/rpg trifecta of Tank/Healer/DPS is very much in effect in Tera."
TeraOnline,3bkbx6,ChildrensPlayground,3,Tue Jun 30 00:16:34 2015 UTC,"Priests are pure supports with the bare minimum offense necessary to level / do some things.  You aren't soloing anyone on priest unless they're extremely undergeared or extremely dumb.  Sorcs are pure DPS so they can kill/fight stuff. How good they are at that depends on the patch :P. Not so good at the moment, but getting buffed REALLY soon so we'll have to see how they fare in the new patch.  That's sort of what a PvP server is. You can go PK people just because. Though leveling in this game is really quick and you can change channels so you get past it pretty quick.  GvG isn't really a thing on any server because of the latest patch."

Before this patch, this highest was +12, which was moderately expensive to achieve, but not too bad.  They then introduced +15 which is FUCKTONS more expensive to get, even for a single piece of gear. It's also MUCH MUCH stronger than +12. So basically if you don't have the gold to +15, you're fucked."

It's not impossible to beat them, but if they're halfway decent and playing a ""balanced"" class it's just really stupid when they can randomly one shot you.  And then now add in consumables (since we're talking GvG), and it gets even worse. Everyone has access to the same consumables (if they choose to bring them), but it scales with gear so..."
TeraOnline,3bkbx6,Veetus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:29:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  What classes are ""balanced""?"
TeraOnline,3bkbx6,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:30:32 2015 UTC,"Lancers are the most ""balanced"". But to be fair they actually require a fair amount of knowledge/skill to play.  Slayers/Gunners are ""balanced"" and also really stupid to play against. They're both really easy classes, lots of damage, good escapes, etc. Gunner is probably the most annoying out of the two because they have more defense, better escapes, bigger AoEs, skills that don't make sense unless you know what they do, a 2nd life if you do manage to kill them, etc.   Rest of the classes aren't OP, but can be really annoying if they want to as well. Reapers have a lot of really stupid properties (similar to the gunner) where a lot of their skills do stuff that aren't really consistent with other skills in the game. Dstance warriors can be stupid too if they decide they wanna stagger-lock you to 0 (which is a true infinite combo but very low damage and boring in 1v1s.)"
TeraOnline,3bkbx6,obsidianpanther,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:46:24 2015 UTC,"I think you should test out both classes.  It doesn't really take very long at all to get to level 11 (off the starter island) and that kind of gives you decent enough idea of what the play style will be like.    Personally, I didn't enjoy sorcerer.  From what I understand, sorcerer is amazing in PVP but not really in PVE.  I'm not much of a PVPer so I ended up ditching my sorcerer and making a mystic which was more fun imo.  But I do have a max level priest, which was easy enough to level.  The only issue I had was doing one of the final solo instances for story. There were a lot of mobs and priests aren't that good for big aoes.  PVP servers are exactly what you described about Crystal Saga.  I tried MT because my friend wanted to be on a PVP server and as soon as you hit level 12, your courtesy buff that protects you from being PKed wears off.  Once we got to Lumbertown, the first levelling area outside of the starter island, we were met by small groups of level 65 people who had nothing better to do than snipe new players.  You can change channel in this game if an area is too populated, but that didn't help as they had people switching between channels.  If you dislike that idea, PVE is for you.  I swapped to PVE and have had a much more pleasant experience."
TeraOnline,3bkbx6,acematador777,2,Tue Jun 30 02:56:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly 11 is no where near enough to get a good idea of the playstyle. I personally hated playing my warrior and berserker until 20 for example and got the evasive roll gylph for my warrior and the ability to move during my thunder strike and whirlwind on my berserker. You don't have a character's true playstyle until 60 when you have all of their skills but you can get a decent idea in 20ish range once you have a few gylphs and skills.

It was more about maneuverability and 'clunkiness' for me deciding what I liked, which I sort of figured out by 11.

I don't know how you even think making new stuff (content) cost them money. Content for say like Fate of Arun that is a different thing as they would need to possibly upgrade there hardware to support it since it was a huge patch with tons of content, as for archetypes, templates those files once created are very very small and there is no reason why they cannot do it besides being lazy and not wanting to put time into it, which is a big turn off for me I'm tired of having gear that looks like old gear, gear should increase in looks in higher levels instead of looking like crappy old low lvl gear."

TeraOnline,3bj6iz,Spiffymooge,4,Mon Jun 29 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"You answered your own question.    10+ gloves, 9+ chest and boots"
TeraOnline,3bj6iz,SourDinkleberry,2,Mon Jun 29 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"The main difference is probably that your chest is not rolled perfectly. The rolls on your chest should be 10% reduced damage from enraged monsters, and then 2 out of the following 3 (6% reduced damage, 6.9% reduced damage from frontal attacks, 8.7% reduced damage from highest agro). If you have those and you are still taking a lot of damage, it is because you are missing a lot of defense and endurance. Having +12 on your chest and boots not only gives you more defense modifiers, but you gain a lot of endurance also. Further, the disco lancer might also have etchings on his chest and boots that give either 5 or 8 endurance depending on if he went for tier II or teir III grounding etchings. With your gear, it makes sense that you take some damage through block, if ambit gear could block everything perfectly, whats the point of getting disco or generation?  Assuming you don't want to spend a lot of money on enchanting or etching your gear (although etching II's are pretty cheap, like 2-3k for the endurance ones) with only a few days until new gear comes out, your best bet is to glyph your challenging shout to give 21 endurance, that endurance would reduce damage a lot.  For darkan, the dash attack is really finicky. Once he stops and chooses his direction, he will charge in that direction only. So if you move even slightly to the left or right, he will go through you. To combat this, reposition only while he is running away from you and ""charging up"", and once he finishes, just stay still.    As for the dust attack, you have to get back to the boss as fast as possible after he finishes. If you take your time slowly walking back, the dps might be able to get there faster and steal agro from you. Assuming you use backstep and charging lunge to get out of range when he does dust, you should use shield bash -> onslaught chain to quickly get back to the boss and continue generating agro. It might help to watch some lancer point of view videos on youtube. Even warrior tank point of view videos might be worth watching to get the general idea of what to do for each mechanic.   If you are on TR, I could maybe run with you and help you out by giving more specific advice."
TeraOnline,3bj6iz,godofolympus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:07:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely the extra endurance on chest and boots then. I have enraged, highest aggro, and frontal rolls on chest. Endurance, mp5 and something on boots. I'll get the higher tier etchings for chest, but I have disco chest and boots, still trying to MW both so don't want to invest more into ambit.   I've watch a lot of videos of Lancers tanking Darkan but actually tanking him is different. Just dust and dash is problematic now. I have the other patterns 90% down. Still getting too hasty shield counter before the charged sword strike that leads into the little fire burst.   Edit: disco Lancer had +8 power etching on intense weapon. Reading through posts here I thought energetic II was better."
TeraOnline,3bj6iz,fluffy-tails,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"If you're getting hit by only 15k per swipe in +9 Ambit, you really shouldn't be worrying about it too much in the first place. Enraged Nightmare Darkan does around 30k Eviscerates through block with full +12 Discovery with perf rolls (before Bravery, Food, etc.).  But if you do have your Discovery chest, I would just focus on that. For your Ambit, temporary etchings are good enough while you work on your Discovery. If you're on CH, I can give you some MES and Feedstock to help you out.  For Darkan's dust, you can just Backstep and Shield Barrage x1 then just walk to get out of range (he should be 19m away). Charging Lunge can be used to return. Alternatively, you can CL out and Shield Bash > Onslaught back in (you can do the same for the pools). For his Eviscerates, you should be able to fit in a Shield Counter between them rather easily if you see it coming, and get two stacks of Hold the Line. For the Dash attack, he will go through you if he's facing a certain direction. If you are in the red areas relative to him, he will go through you (credits to Yosha's SC guide for the picture).  As for Energetic vs Pumped, it's really up to preference. Attack speed and cooldown reduction are really good, but so is power."
TeraOnline,3bj6iz,Roukanken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:59:25 2015 UTC,Appreciate the offer but I'm on Lake of Tears. I already burned through 80 MES on disco chest. Still no luck :'(  Disco chest is 9+ and boots at 7+. Not gonna bother using them till MWed.
TeraOnline,3bj6iz,coehl,2,Mon Jun 29 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"Actually that's pretty bad I think - my warrior in Idoneal chest (3xfine hardy niveot and one normal hardy niveot - don't look at me, just haven't gotten around to replace it) / Disco +9 boots and gloves takes about 2-3k white damage trough block. Maybe you should run with Endurance etchings or get some extra damage reduction either with niveots / zyrks / vyrsk. That said 4k white damage is about 13-14k crit damage in my experience, which isn't that bad even if he crits twice, if you have decent healer. You should learn the combos, dash attack is always after double swipe back, you should keep still a bit before the he dashes and bit farther away from him. I actually seen lancers start leashing him everytime on double back swipes and then just block when he comes back.   Edit - you can actually dodge Fulminar's double swipe with just a walking a bit to his left leg, if you can learn this you should be able to dodge it consitently. I don't do this though, too much risk for only some marginal damage."
TeraOnline,3bj6iz,coehl,2,Mon Jun 29 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"I used to backstep the 2nd swipe on Fulminar but it's risky and yeah I tried the stepping to his left too, but the hit box is glitchy and I'll take random damage even when I'm behind him on swipe or I'm lagging. Oh well.   Tanking Fulminar isn't hard, there's a lot of things I can do here and there for damage mitigation but I'm not running brhm with a static so I don't trust healer or dps to dodge. Safest to take the damage through block while holding him as predictable as possible. Lol. The walking desyncs and goes through me enough as it is."
TeraOnline,3bj6iz,coehl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"Do you infuriate immediately like a good lancer?  Problem is, if you aren't geared to do that, you'll get slapped really hard.

TeraOnline,3bj6iz,Xivaxi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:44:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. But the discussion was how to take less damage.....  I can do it now though. Disco chest + boots are doing wonders. But the fact remains, I don't trust strangers to actually be skilled at dodging. Infuriate would be risky."
TeraOnline,3bj6iz,Roukanken,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:08:16 2015 UTC,"Right. It becomes habit for lancers, so I thought it worth the mention. Since it would result in,  get this, taking less damage.   Anyway, I'm done with this conversation."
TeraOnline,3bj6iz,Roukanken,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:12:40 2015 UTC,"Hi bud. I tanked HM Fulminar in +9 Ambit Lance, +9 Ambit Chest, Idoneal Gloves/Boots without taking any damage. My best bet is that you may be using the wrong crystals. You should be using 4 Fine Hardy Niveots.  For Darkan, after his double back swing you know he is going to dash right back at you but you need to actually aim your crosshair on the center of his chest then hold block. If you just continue to look in his general direction but your pointer isn't on his body he will scrape off your shield and dash through you."
TeraOnline,3bj6iz,soundwafflez,2,Mon Jun 29 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"Huh I always though it was just a matter of me being too close, or moving after he locked on me - when I stand a bit farther and still before the dash, he never passes trough. I'll try this later."

I'm the gunner class and so far loving it, the combo system in this game is super satisfying :) anything worth spending real money on? Elite status worth it?"
TeraOnline,3biaxm,Tangy4tw,2,Mon Jun 29 13:40:23 2015 UTC,"Elite is super worth it for the Atlas and Travel book alone. IT reduces your time traveling across Tera by literally 100%. You also get awesome perks like exp boosts, gold boosts, and reputation boosts, not to mention a daily gift box and consumables box.  The only reason people really spend real money in game is to get cosmetic items from the cash shop or to buy account service items (bank tabs, name changes, race changes, etc....) everything you need can be obtained in game for free gear wise.  Depending on what level you are majority of what you need to know as a new player comes from just playing the game. If you ever have any burning questions you can check the FAQS at the top of the page in this subreddit or just Google it.  Most people learn their class through experience and watching youtube videos and reading guides on optimal skill rotations/gear setup. Researching dungeon mechanics before you enter them (applies to endgame) will help you understand the dungeon better and will help your party out more because you spend less time wiping cause you know what to expect.  Other than those main things, just enjoy the game. This is one thing no one can really teach you."
TeraOnline,3biaxm,Tangy4tw,2,Mon Jun 29 13:58:05 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm loving it so far :) I found out about the game after a friend convinced me to try the Skyforge beta (only real MMO I got into before this was SWTOR and FF14) I felt Skyforge was boring and was told this game was the holy grail in terms of the action based control scheme it uses (SWTOR and FF14 are more traditional in terms of controls) I do miss SWTOR's full voice acting though lol  So wow a daily gift box 0_0 SWTOR did a monthly one if you used their subscription model and it was pretty needed to really enjoy the game, the free model always felt like more of a demo to me :( What kind of stuff comes in the box? Is it mostly boost? Cause I'd never complain on boost lol"

The daily gift box can contain a myriad of things like spellbinds,alkahests,federation bills,scrolls,etc.... and if you're super lucky you can get a permanent Felicity Pet that can auto-gather.  The consumbale box gives Elite Cenaphora potions that increases your damage, Crafter's cure to replenish 1000 production points, and some other consumables I can't think off the top of my head. These are non-tradable and only meant to be used by you, however, you can bank them and use them on all of your other characters."

TeraOnline,3biaxm,4LTRU15T1CD3M1G0D,2,Mon Jun 29 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"Elite status is 100% worth it, and if you buy elite vouchers for gold in game, it literally pays for itself.  If you really wanted to spend money, I highly receommend getting Founders status, its permanent and comes with full bank slots + 8 char slots on all servers, a permanent increase to broker listings, no gold limit when sending mail, a move speed 280 mount, etc. If you redeem the code backwards you get even more goodies.  To get founders all you need is a physical retail copy of the game or just the code inside the box, assuming the code hasn't been used.  As for tips:   don't give up. the leveling process (especially at 50-60) can get tedious, but it pays off.  Don't enchant anything but your avatar weapons until you get your first endgame gear set, its a waste of gold and you go through gear very quickly. Gather in your spare time, try to make sure your gathering skill cant go higher before you move to the next zone. This isn't necessary but it saves you a lot of time once you actually need to craft. DO NOT open locked strongboxes unless they are Spellbound or Extensive strongboxes, and even then wait until EnMasse does a lottery to open them.   Welcome to Tera! I dropped you a follow on twitch too :)"

TeraOnline,3bicho,mentosxo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:06:09 2015 UTC,"To add to the above: Vyrsk - Threatening Offensive - 2x Threatening, 1x Pounding, 1x Focused Defensive - Hardy x4  For Defensive Dyads for PvE DPS, I would easily swap out a Hardy for any armor dyad with a Glisteningly prefix if you have one as the mana regen you gain from it is very useful and saves a ton of mana pots and is totally worth the loss in defense for me. There's a lot of discussion already about Forceful vs Pounding already, and the general consensus depends on what your power level is including charms and priest/mystic buffs.  You should never be using Bitter in PvP as it doesn't work. I personally use Forceful, Savage, and 2/3 of Carving/Cruel/Salivating (Carving is good for getting some extra crits (around 20 crit factor worth, Cruel is good if you're more focused on KDs with Scythe than using it at 10 edge for the damage, and Salivating if you have mana problems). You also have the choice of going 3x Relentless and 1x Resolute or Grieving depending on the situation.  I'm going to assume that you mean Carving Vyrsk. If you meant Zyrk, the Griefing Zyrk is a clear winner. Griefing Zyrk vs Carving Vyrsk - I tested this out and Blade Draw went from 8832 + 22086 to 8721 + 20349 (We're in PvE gear and the second hit had the Forceful crystal effect). It's really up to whether you want a few extra thousand damage per crit or crits more often."

Find a guild or a group that's willing to take you. Otherwise your gearing is far more important that infusions; I'd worry about that far later once you're comfortably geared.   BRHM dropps an average of 10 infusion boxes/person every 2 runs. If the average box drops 50 infusions, that's 500 infusions every 2 runs. Another 200 from vault makes 700. I reset 4 times a day for BRHM because I frankly don't have anything else to do, so that makes 10 runs a day. So I basically net 3000 noct per day."

TeraOnline,3bi2a1,SourDinkleberry,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:19:22 2015 UTC,"I attain reset scrolls passively - From boxes and from being elite.  Being elite also allows you to run endgame dungeons twice before needing to reset.   There's 2 reset scrolls - one for elite, and one for non elite, and they do not share a cooldown. This means you run twice, pop one scroll, run twice, pop the other one, run twice, wait 5 hours for the cooldown, pop another, run twice again, and finally pop the last one to run another 2 times.  Edit: I reset to run the dungeon constantly because I'm in full awakened generation. I have nothing else to do."

TeraOnline,3bg9b5,jetah,2,Mon Jun 29 02:36:09 2015 UTC,I'd keep at it. telling them the transfer shouldn't have messed the item up.
TeraOnline,3bh1vp,CorrosiveFox,2,Mon Jun 29 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's greedy to roll on crafting items/fodder gear in pugs. I'll always pass if someone calls need, but I did the work so I don't see why I shouldn't roll on drops. Sometimes I'll win two or three rolls in a row and sometimes I won't get anything from a run, that's up to RNG. Also even if you could why would you kick someone after a run for more loot? That's a pretty asshole move for someone calling other party members greedy. If you PUG roll on whatever isn't need, or if you want you can pass on crafting mats after you win once, but don't expect others to. Blocking people just for rolling is a little ridiculus, just trust in RNG, you ahould theoretically win the same number of rolls as everyone else long run."
TeraOnline,3bh1vp,mdk_777,2,Mon Jun 29 08:59:21 2015 UTC,"In the case of crafting mats, I guess it's just a consideration thing. I know if I win the first plume roll, I'll pass the next two, or whatever (I'll ensure we each get 2 at least). If I see someone win and roll again on it though, fuck that, I'll roll too. I've had DPS roll on healer gear in the past (party leader wouldn't set class restrictions). That was really annoying. Thankfully I don't think it was malice, just ignorance, and it happens rarely enough that it's not a real issue. Crafting mat rolls can be though."
TeraOnline,3bh1vp,Forgotten_Aeon,0,Mon Jun 29 09:44:24 2015 UTC,"Rolling on mats isn't greedy. Rolling after you win two or more of one type is, and that is when I'd want to kick. How is blocking ridiculous? It was a PuG on a large server, I don't want to party with them again and blocking prevents them from trying to join when I lead a LFG.Guess I'll just pray for a renewed blessing from the RNG gods then."
TeraOnline,3bh1vp,Zakaru99,2,Mon Jun 29 14:11:58 2015 UTC,Because there is no reason they shouldn't be rolling on those mats.  Sometimes you win 4 scales in one run.  More often than not you win 0.
TeraOnline,3bh1vp,YummyRicez,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:31:12 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think of is making sure the moment you get into a dungeon you set it so only the class that uses the equipment can roll for it. Usually people will agree with this and if they don't, you could kick them but that might be going a bit too far. Also, I don't know what level you are but once you're level 65, I've noticed this happens less. Earlier on, players that already have the item still want it to sell, but later on, a few gold is nothing and people won't roll for stuff they don't need. Now in the case of things like Nimistrix Plumes, don't get too mad and lose faith in humanity when somebody rolls (and gets) all of them after you just carried them through the dungeon..."
TeraOnline,3bh1vp,jetah,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:05:48 2015 UTC,"I'm 65 and while gold is more plentiful it isn't endless. I only get irked when they pick up plumes now since they've become so common. However, I had someone pick up 5/6 tantibus scales and then someone else pick up 2/2 perimos hearts. Kind of frustrating that they didn't pass after they got one when everyone else rolled and these mats are expensive (~500-660g on MT) or untradeable."

TeraOnline,3bely6,MisterLone,9,Sun Jun 28 14:45:30 2015 UTC,"Here's a bunch of good information to get you started:  http://zephya.wix.com/update10#!10th-update-gear/c1seg  VM just means visionmaker. Vanilla Tera, the Best in Slot (BiS) gear pieces used the set name ""Visionmaker"". So when new gear comes out, the gear set that has been the Best in Slot is referred to as VM2, VM3, VM4, etc. Just means they are BiS."
TeraOnline,3bely6,spaghetticatt,8,Sun Jun 28 15:07:09 2015 UTC,"The gear isn't actually called VM. VM stands for vision maker, and was - a long time ago - the name of the best gear in the game at the time. The name stuck and now people use it to describe the best gear in slot for every patch. Currently, the fourth iteration of this item is called generation, and is hence called VM4. Consequently, the next patch will release the equivalent of current generation gear, which will be called VM5.   Gear always comes in the same progression increments. There's a non enchantable gear, then ambit, then discovery, then generation. The same logic applies to all patches, and as a result, the equivalent gear relative to the increments of this patch will be called disco 2, ambit 2, etc, until the actual names are known.   Discovery is 100% worth the investment, it's generation that's no longer worth the investment, as you won't be able to awaken your pieces before the patch hits, meaning you're better off getting disco 2."
TeraOnline,3bely6,SourDinkleberry,4,Sun Jun 28 15:14:11 2015 UTC,"Alot of people skip VM5 gear and stick to generation since its almost the same. Most of my guildmates and me are getting just the new VM5 weapon and belt, rest remains generation."
TeraOnline,3bely6,Aenyeweddien,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:23:10 2015 UTC,"Generation is only worth investing/keeping insofar as it's enchanted to +14 or +15. If this isn't the case, you're losing gold as well as stats you could otherwise be taking advantage of. Generation only being ""almost the same"" once it's +15, meaning you need to use tons of gold to get it there (my axe took 300k). If you're going to spend that gold when the next set of gear comes out in just over a week, then power to ya. But you do need to take into account a few things. There is the possibility of them removing the mats required to make generation with the coming patch (it has happened before without being announced). In the scenario where the mats do not get removed, you also need to consider the price of t6 feedstock skyrocketing because of t7 feedstock. If you can't +15 before the patch hits, it simply isn't feasible. You'll be better off going disco - disco 2 - vm5. If you already have full generation this is a completely different story. I plan to +15 all my pieces, and skip vm5 entirely and retool to vm6. I don't recommend this method, but it is what I settled on for various reasons."
TeraOnline,3bely6,SourDinkleberry,3,Sun Jun 28 17:06:12 2015 UTC,I thought t6 would go down. It's replacing what t5 currently is. Dailies and dungeons will go up to t6 and t5 will go down to t4.
TeraOnline,3bely6,Kumasylum,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:30:32 2015 UTC,"All speculation. We don't actually know what happens until the 7th. This is why I said possibility. T6 goes down, then you need to consider masterwork alkahest costs. You also need to consider master enigmatic scroll costs.   Ultimately it's both safer, and more advantageous at this point if time, if you don't have generation, to not craft generation. If prices do go down, you can opt to craft generation now (and if mats continue dropping after the patch), and enchant once T7 comes out because then it'll be very cheap to do this. But why bother enchanting what is essentially sub-par gear and risking RNG to get it to becomes +14.   What you essentially upgrade to is a matter of time and cost (mostly) - these, among others, are the main reasons people stick to the same kind of gear they have for the next patch (disco -> disco 2):  Time - The slower you gear, the further behind you fall. For example, if you're a tank, this means you can't hold aggro against people who crafted full disco 2, while you're waiting to even craft your first piece of generation (the same logic applies to dps and healer as well). Most people also don't want to waste their time running brhm or scnm for mats; even currently most runs in lfg are fodder runs, and don't accept people who need gear. People are much more likely to be running the new instances where they can achieve T7 gear instead - making it more difficult to find a group to  help you get your mats for generation. You're also still not up to par with +12, which means awakening cost and playing around with rng quite a hassle.   Cost - This becomes arbitrary as nobody actually knows what happens to the prices of different mats. Any kind of combination is possible, and even if we accept that T6 feedstock crashes in price, you also need to consider MWA, MES, T7 Alk. We also don't know whether or not generation mats are being taken out of the game. If they do (and we assume you already have your hearts/tiles), then we don't know what happens to scale prices. Even they might go up because supply is cutting off but there might still be demand."
TeraOnline,3bely6,SourDinkleberry,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:35:56 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, does disco 2 build off disco 1? I read through the website that someone else posted and it showed comparisons between the new gear, but would disco 1 be worse than / equivalent to the ambit 2 gear?"
TeraOnline,3bely6,SourDinkleberry,3,Sun Jun 28 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"No. There used to be a thing called retooling, which is being introduced for the next-next iteration, (VM6 patch) where you can use the previous VM gear, in this case VM5 or VM4, to reduce the costs of crafting VM6. This is to make it so that crafting VM4 wouldn't feel so bad because it'd become useless fodder otherwise. This does not apply to any other gear; only to visionmaker."
TeraOnline,3bely6,SourDinkleberry,2,Sun Jun 28 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"Okay last question, sorry - when you say it's 100% worth the investment for disco now, what do you mean? It seems like it would kinda get overshadowed by all the new stuff."
TeraOnline,3bely6,MysteryMeister,3,Sun Jun 28 15:53:01 2015 UTC,"What are you gonna run the new dungeons with in order to get disco 2? It's not happening in ambit. Getting better gear makes it easier to gear up in the long run. Of course, you can ignore this if you have guild/friends that are already heavily geared and willing to carry you through new dungeons to get you to skip gears. You may be able to go to the unenchantable gear or the ambit 2, but a geared discovery has the ability to skip that and go straight to discovery 2 instead. It's really subjective. If you can get yourself geared before the 7th - then do it, if not, don't."

Right now, I'm using Idoneal gear but I've saved up enough Ambit Tokens and Vanguard Credits to get my Ambit set (which I plan on getting to +12). Should I be going for Ambit +12 or Idoneal 2 / Ambit 2 / Disco / Disco 2 when the patch is released?"
TeraOnline,3bely6,SourDinkleberry,3,Mon Jun 29 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"Idoneal 2 > Current Ambit +12.  If you're currently in Idoneal, it's likely that you'll be able to go straight to Ambit 2 using Idoneal 2. If you're in a reliable guild, or have a group of people that you can run dungeons with, you might be able to go to Disco 2 with Idoneal 2. Do NOT +12 ambit. Idoneal 2 is free and is much better than current ambit.   Vanguard -> only for crystals (first) and masterwork alk (secondly). Never anything else."
TeraOnline,3bely6,evolutionvi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:14:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  I'll definitely go for Idoneal 2 then Disco 2 then. However, I thought the only way to obtain Idoneal 2 was through BRNM 7 Man or Vanguard Credits, as shown here."
TeraOnline,3bely6,SourDinkleberry,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:43:45 2015 UTC,It is. I meant the boost in your power and the fact that it doesn't need to be enchanted for that boost in power being free.

TeraOnline,3bely6,SourDinkleberry,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:25:57 2015 UTC,"It's an easy comparison to make since current Idoneal is already vaguely the same thing as current Ambit at +10. Because of this I typically give the advice of not building Ambit and skipping directly to Discovery either through drops or crafting it. Following gear progression directly is super expensive and unnecessary.   The timing of the new patch with the sudden resurgence of player base throws some new players off because they're not comfortable with how gearing in this game works.   I recommend saving as much as you can until the patch hits, and running dungeons in order to get yourself Idoneal 2 after the new patch.  Edit: Or, alternatively, using the 1 week left to get yourself into full discovery and go from there."

TeraOnline,3bely6,rawkers,3,Mon Jun 29 20:00:06 2015 UTC,Visionmaker and all subsequent sets are called VM because Visionmaker and every BIS gear after it have a roll line called Blacksmith's Hammerstrike which randomly procs stun.

TeraOnline,3bely6,magocchi,2,Mon Jun 29 01:19:42 2015 UTC,"well, the patch hits in 2 weeks, I don't assume you have ~100k gold nor alot of mats, but unless you do, getting +12 gear at this point is a bit of a waste since idoneal even gets buffed next patch to ""idoneal2"" kinda. I guess it would be similar to ambit +12 right now, then, but can't tell for sure, didn't see the stats.  if you do have the mats/gold for it, you could get discovery, but in that case you have to run brhm/scnm with idoneal, so it depends on if you are comfortable doing that or not.  the gear chances are basically, every new set of gear has higher base stats (attack mod/defense mod). also, the discovery/vm of next patch will no longer have intense, keen or quick, just an additional roll above the line. other than that no difference iirc.  EDIT: what I said about idoneal might be wrong, but I heard it's getting buffed. sorry if I spread misinformation. there will be a new idoneal set tho, but no idea about obtaining method."

TeraOnline,3bghnu,Aenyeweddien,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:02:37 2015 UTC,It's more crit chance from back
TeraOnline,3bghnu,Roukanken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:48:56 2015 UTC,"Renegade weapons have a roll on the weapon's base that increases PvP damage dealt from behind by 10, which is quite a lot. I'm not too sure about whether this was equalized or not, but if it wasn't, the weapon should also have 6.9% damage when attacking from behind rolled on it. I don't know about the rolls on  the equalized Skyring gear, so someone can further elaborate on the rolls on that.  PvP gloves also have 15% reduced incoming crit damage, so that will affect it too."
TeraOnline,3bghnu,fluffy-tails,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I suppose it's a combination of several defensive mechanics and lack of advantageous positioning (IDK if the Priest is even considered as knocked down or standing when the Slice hits them). If they're standing they just take crit frontal damage but if they're considered KD'd it's even more complicated as there are defensive rolls that decrease incoming damage when KD'd, but there are also offensive stats/crystals that increase damage on KD'd targets.  So you may be right -- reduced incoming crit damage, reduced incoming frontal damage, reduced incoming damage while KD'd (or any combination of them) plus disadvantageous positioning (which results in the absence of a backcrit modifier, and the lack of the 10 back PvP damage you mentioned, as well as the typical increased damage when hitting from behind -- or any combination of them depending on what are the actual gear rolls).  But we cannot know for sure until we know the EQ Priest gear stats and the EQ Slayer gear stats. If someone knows, be sure to let us know pl0x :D    Aside from that, I keep getting amazed at how deep and dynamic the combat is, especially at later levels. One misjudged Eviscerate KD and you can ruin your damage output by knocking the enemy on their ass. One correctly executed combo on their back, and all the stat lines and crystals activate. And then MS can crit for 30k alone.  (Although proper Measured Slice backcrits are an exceptionally rare treat, expecially if you want to do it when the EV Powerlink is on. But it's not impossible. You just gotta activate Forceful, Cruel and also the Powerlink, and then make Measured Slice backcrit. With one power buff, two critical amplifiers, one power glyph and one powerlink glyph running on it.  Splat goes their pretty little head as it falls and rolls cutely on the tiles, painting them in blood. <3)  This kinda makes me wanna try a MS based combo, using (wasting :P) everything you have only to set up the perfect MS, just to see how high can it hit. Pop ICB, activate all the crystals and Powerlink, then use Kick from back, and then Overpower > Overhandstrike (cancel it before it does damage, right into) > MS. Sure, it kind of ruins any utility and flexibility a normal combo might have, and will probably do less damage overall, but I'm totally going to try this at least once, just to see the pretty numbers :3"

Bluehole is soon removing the increased critical chance from the sides and back in PvP. Hits to any side will have equal chance to crit. We do not know if it'll be equalized to front crit chance, back crit chance or anything in between.  The increased damage from crystals is left untouched but the PvP crit frequency will be affected.

TeraOnline,3bfwv5,blackshiinobi,2,Sun Jun 28 21:38:16 2015 UTC,Kinda.. but you shouldn't worry too much as quests give a ton of gold later on (lvl 60+ quests give more than 50 gold each) you could also sell ores/etc on the brokerage (which you can gather while leveling) No.

It's not a big concern anyway, as you don't start to earn large quantities of gold from levelling until you're up in the 50s.  2 - When you click the Roll button, the system rolls the dice for you and distributes the item to the winner.

TeraOnline,3bevzf,LiMeh,4,Sun Jun 28 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"I won't give you a full rundown for two reasons- first, some of your glyphs are down to personal preference (if you use a skill often, glyph it- it'll help a lot more than an ""ideal"" theorycrafted glyph that rarely or never sees use), and second, multiple builds are available for perusal, as you've seen.   What I can tell you is that you should have at least two glyph sets, one for Healing and one for soloing, and possibly one for PvP if you go that route. Avoid glyphs for mana cost reduction as they're rarely worth it, and use glyphs like cooldown reduction, target number increases, and casting time reductions. The glyph for the debuff on triple nemesis is a must have. As you get more comfortable with the class, you'll fill out multiple glyph sets for specific scenarios (although this isn't necessary outside of the healing/soloing/PvP scenarios).   Until you get to 65 and get some master glyphs, just go with what you use most often. Once you have unlocked the master glyphs, take into consideration that there's a reason some glyphs are highly recommended, and you should consider altering your playstyle to make the most of them. Above all though, as you get even more experienced you can leave behind cookie-cutter builds and glyph to suit your party/strengths at the time."

TeraOnline,3bdcfz,Dorion_FFXI,3,Sun Jun 28 03:43:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert at Lancer (yet), but I've read power in PvE is preferred since the boss will be facing you most of the time and you won't be landing as many crits compared to the back as well as relying on RNG. Also, it's a safer way to deal pure and more consistent damage. With that being said, if you crit enough, you'll be doing more damage than just pure power. This is if you're tanking for a party, ofc.  I don't do PvP so hopefully someone else will fill you in."
TeraOnline,3bdcfz,Aerija,5,Sun Jun 28 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"imo the whole crit build as a lancer for PvE becomes incredibly moot once you start doing scnm/schm with 2/4pc +15 gene in your group where every roll of +aggro matters (this means 5pc forrestune) and there's not many places where you can build power or crit after that. And if you can build it anywhere signinifcantly from a hybrid build, your threat generation is complete garbage until you're on par with their gear (meaning you are also 2/4pc Gene) but even still then a crit chain from a slayer is going to rip aggro off you like it was nothing."
TeraOnline,3bdcfz,FrostyPeachez,4,Sun Jun 28 08:19:22 2015 UTC,"While I've seen this question many times, I still don't understand it.  Where do you even get a choice between power and crit?  Jewelry you can only roll crit on the rerollable for tank set. Brooch you can roll aggro. Belt maybe, but I mean you can roll 6 crit 3 power on that. Etchings you should be using energetic...  Where does this crit/power choice come from?"
TeraOnline,3bdcfz,CelestialRice,3,Sun Jun 28 09:13:34 2015 UTC,mostly vyrsks  12 power vs 24 crit. or a mix in between  the 4.5% aggro and 4 endurance set bonus is not worth it when u can have deathwise earrings (forest earrings do not give aggro) when u can have +12 crit from both earrings and another +12 (24 total) from 2-piece set bonus  it may also be mathematically better to have a certain amount of dmg over aggro percentage. some guides say the extra crit/power would end up generating more aggro than the aggro crystal counterparts
TeraOnline,3bdcfz,RaidenXT,0,Sun Jun 28 15:17:46 2015 UTC,"When it comes to keeping aggro from current generation uers (as a lancer), there isn't a choice. It's pretty much mandatory that you run full forresttune with everything aggro'd out."
TeraOnline,3bdcfz,FrostyPeachez,3,Sun Jun 28 10:16:31 2015 UTC,"That's not true.  Having full aggro and no damage leads to less aggro.  For example, having a focused crystal on your weapon is better than having a 4th threatening crystal when the boss is enraged.  I've tested this by comparing the aggro between two tanks, one keeping the same setup, and the other switching the focused to threatening.  It was a very significant difference with the focused setup generating more aggro."
TeraOnline,3bdcfz,helpdiene,2,Sun Jun 28 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"Although power is a good stat for lancers, I find that crit is still going to be much more beneficial especially if you use a Focused crystal and even more so if you use a Crit Power scroll. Most lancers I see go for Forest rings and necklace and Deathwise earrings. This will put you at around +70 crit rate, which actually matters a lot throughout a fight. Yes, critting from the front is worse than from the back, but getting even a single crit will give you a lot more damage and aggro. Critting really isn't that bad either, tbh. I get around a 15% crit chance throughout a fight, which does add up."
TeraOnline,3bdcfz,fluffy-tails,2,Sun Jun 28 07:09:47 2015 UTC,"maybe good to also check the guides at tera today, such as dantes or renai´s. they cover crit vs power and alos how to hold aggro including ideas for a correct glyph setup. all glyphs, jewls and gear configuration are a unity including a proper combination of skills, so it´d be a bit lengthy to sum up here."
TeraOnline,3bdcfz,niraxtc,2,Sun Jun 28 12:04:31 2015 UTC,"You should not usually take power, as there are more beneficial stats, but I prefer taking the not RNG stats for tanking - so you can spread your threat generation more evenly. There is always that one time when you get no crits, so do not rely on then to get aggro. Take flat aggro / attack speed / cooldown reduction / power, over crit power and crit rate."
TeraOnline,3bdcfz,Roukanken,2,Sun Jun 28 14:31:24 2015 UTC,"I've read that I should be grabbing power over crit for PvE    Yes, this is correct as bosses have some fucking insane Crit Resist from the front.   going full crit for PvP. Is this correct?    It really doesn't matter too much, but Crit is Nice. But if you play Lancer right, you are just a god."

Good job :D  The face is balanced, the overall scene is quite dynamic for a static pose, the analogies and anatomy are good (the torso, waist and knees could use a tiny bit of improvement) and the silver/steel metal parts look convincing. If they had more accurate reflections/shading they'd look fantastic, look it up and give it a go, it'll make the armor and blades look sick :) The golden ornaments are perfectly combined with the armor and look precisely as they're one with the steel, and not like they're fake plastic pieces glued on it (it happens often with armor decorations), which contributes immensely to the picture. Finally, the cape is nice, but what is absolutely terrific is the cloth parts on the arms, the ""sleeves"". Fantastic. Impeccable creases. Not too much, not too flat. Same for the lighting and shading.  Last but not least, try to keep a single set of light sources active for the whole thing. A few places look like they're lit from the opposite side than the rest of the lady.   Overall, quite a great piece - keep it up! :D"

Thanks again for your reply"
TeraOnline,3bbmxe,N0rthWind,2,Sun Jun 28 03:17:46 2015 UTC,"Well I'm quite involved with art as I'm studying Architectural Engineering so I'm happy to help, because fan art is one of my favorite things :D  Reflections on metal seem difficult but they work on very simply principles. A simple Google search like ""how to draw..."" will benefit you greatly. I am a Digital artist so things like this have helped me a lot, but I see you're a Traditional so Photoshop tutorials can only show you how metal should look, but not how to make it look that way.  After a quick search I found this which could help you ""feel"" how the shadows work even though it's a pretty low quality pencilwork. Metal (and other reflective, glossy materials) do not work like matte materials - ""lighter at the side the main light comes from, and darker at the opposite side"". Instead, their reflective properties cause them to reflect every single tiny bit of light, which also does not get dispersed across the surface (cus it's glossy) so you get much more intense lights and shadows that contour the shape of the object. Duller metal will have less intense changes and tones - polished metal will have extreme shifts from light to dark.  Although it might sound counter-intuitive, metal objects usually have lights and shadows on them that ""override"" the basic ""light goes at this side, dark goes at this side"" gradient you have learned to use. Often, the darkest side of a metal object is not the one directly opposite to the ""light"" side. The darkest shadow is still towards the opposite side of the light, but not quite at the edge. A bit something like this. You see, the side opposite to the light is not really dark cus it's reflecting stuff too. The shadow is towards that side but not at the edge.  Similarly, the lit side also reflects the surroundings so as we get to the edge it's not 100% white. In addition to the basic gradient and the secondary ""counter""-lights/shadows, you can see that the kettle also reflects a load of small random shit, that also provide some subtle darker and lighter reflections which ""override"" the underlying tone.  Matte materials have only primary lights and shadows (plastic).  Glossy materials also reflect some secondary lights and shadows (old armor).  Very polished/reflective materials only have very sharp and stylized lights and shadows, because the light does not disperse and thus they reflect very clearly everything around them (stupidly, obsessively polished chrome armor :P).    This might not make any sense cus I can't show you on paper, but I did my best xD"

Burn (and state which gate) is the try and destroy a gate extremely quick.  15/20 south gate = 15 of the 20 players are going south gate according to leaders plan.  Ninja is to try and sneak in (often using ss) with a small group of 1 to 5 and destroying the crystal.  Can't think of any others atm. Hope this helps!
TeraOnline,3bdbru,RNGod2512,3,Sun Jun 28 04:00:56 2015 UTC,"SS = South ship. NS = North ship. OG = Outer gate. IG = Inner gate. Pyre's are the respawn points; mid pyre being the most crucial one. So when you see someone say, ""defend mid pyre"" you'd go there and help your team defend the respawn point. Siege refers to the tank/cannoons that are on the map. Anchor is simply a short term for the anchorstone, your team's ""life"". The whole point of CS is to either defend or attack it. If there are any other ones I might've missed, don't hesitate to ask. :3"

Not to confuse things too much, but some people love to say ""left"" and ""right"" as well, which is all manner of crazy, but typically I believe ""left"" means the northern side and ""right"" means the south side of the map (based on both the attacker's point of view and left/right looking at the castle map from above.  When the defending team starts to call for ""protect inner"" or ""get to the inner"" they mean for people to fall back inside the crystal room to help defend there against either people coming through a broken gate or, more often, from above via the ramps (be it from ladders or a drop off the airship).  Conversely, attackers will often ask things like ""how is their Inner?"" which means for someone up there to relay how strong the defense is either at the top of the inner walls or inside the crystal room.  A call for a ""scan"" is the raid leader's ability to ping the (main) map and reveal the locations of all enemy players for a second or two as red blips on the map.  The raid leader can also set down numbered waypoints for the team to follow if they are actually doing their job correctly.

TeraOnline,3be9dq,LA_nobody,2,Sun Jun 28 12:10:37 2015 UTC,"Looks like you're seeking one of the higher skillcap classes. Since you like short queues and aren't solely after a DPS class, I would recommend Warrior and Mystic.   Warrior is a melee DPS and Tank (dual role) class, while Mystic is a healer/support. Mystic is my favorite class, and is very annoying in PvP due to the slew of CC and debuffs it has (most of any class, AFAIK- haven't played every one yet, so this might not be entirely accurate). Their healing/buffing is also very active, as it requires constant re-application and well-aimed skillshots (as far as their burst heal goes at any rate)- there's never a dull moment. I'm no expert on warrior and don't have mine at level cap yet, but it's so far been quite an active class in terms of skill use.   Keep in mind that leveling in TERA isn't very arduous compared to many MMOs, so don't be afraid to try a variety of classes to find one suitable to your style."
TeraOnline,3be9dq,Forgotten_Aeon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:32:25 2015 UTC,"Warrior and mystic were the two I think I ended up looking at. Just out of interest, what's it like levelling a mystic?

TeraOnline,3be9dq,TheZanno,3,Sun Jun 28 12:51:18 2015 UTC,Leveling a mystic can be relatively easy especially due to a recent patch that would allow a run without a tank and just be a dps and healers. Also mystic has a decent dps due its thralls it uses
TeraOnline,3be9dq,Roukanken,2,Sun Jun 28 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"I think what I'm looking for is a class which offers an ""active"" combat role, which can survive solo PvE without it being a war of attrition, and is useful/fun in dungeons. Also, if they're annoying in PvP that's a bonus.   It's like reading warrior's job description.  PvP - I don't play that much PvP, but warrior brings lot of stuns into play, making him really annoying.  PvE - Warrior is a 2 in 1 class, meaning you can switch between damage dealer or tank on demand (but if you want to be more then average in both, you may need 2 gear sets). As dps warrior is decent, mobile melee class with lot of surviability thanks to immunity frames. You can easily deal damage while on move, or make very hasty retreat.  Warrior tank has too dynamic gameplay. While you'll be trying to mostly stand in one place, your job as a tank in this game is to steadily generate threat, block/dodge incoming attacks, manage your resolve (used for blocking/roll, generated by other skills) and mana, keep up defence debuffs on the boss, ... Let's say you won't get bored, or you'll have your head cut off (by boss or angry party). Also you will get more parties as a tank, since the current game kidna lacks tanks (at least on my server).  Keep in mind that warrior doesn't get most of it's skills till lvl 30, and then later get's another gameplay upgrade on level 60."

TeraOnline,3be274,Fazure,2,Sun Jun 28 10:03:15 2015 UTC,"As a rule of thumb, those extra stats (rollable or nonrollable) that a gear gives you is much more important than base attack modifier. This is why Intense is better than Keen even though Keen has a higher attack modifier (and therefore Intense shows red lines).   Green lines are more important than the modifier at the top:  http://puu.sh/iFAKd/fe42070563.jpg  Keen (right), Intense (left) - green > difference in attack  http://puu.sh/iFASM/4b5d8ca8f6.jpg  Idoneal also allows you to use level 65 crystals.    You can't actually stack impact, it's just a stat that comes with gear (it affects your ability to knock down reliably). The main things you modify are rerollable stats (green with rotating icon at the end):    http://puu.sh/iFAVb/55ae1b33e9.jpg  You want % back damage, % enrage damage, and % attack for your 3 rolls. With VM gear (later on) you get an extra roll, where you use that for crit rate. Etchings can be used to further either crit rate or power, but they are usually used for crit rate as critting more reliably>doing higher noncrit damage.   Carving, Savage, Focused, Bitter. There is no argument on this whatsoever. Some people use Forceful; I disagree with those people.  This is poor timing as new content is around the corner. You want RG, BRHM, BRNM, and SCNM farming. With your current gear, you probably want to run Sabex and Catacomb for glyphs, and move on from there. Joining a guild really helps (let me know what server you're on, I might be able to help you out).  Vanguard is used primarly for crystals (the merchant on the right) and for masterwork alkahest (the merchant on the left). Saving them doesn't really do anything. Buy your crystals, then stack masterwork alkahest to enchant your gear later on.    Edit: If you're not clear on anything ask for clarification."

I know that if I wear my idoneal gloves i would lose crit rate (-4) and balance (-3). Since crit rate is so important i thought i tmight not be good to use it. I would get more attack and defense though and the extra stats are better. (this is all in total stats shown).   I will note down those crystals and be sure that I get those. :)  I am currently in one of the highest guild on Veritas. Lots of people would be able to help me out, the question is if they would take a complete noob on runs. Haha. I love the game so I'm very dedicated to learn.

TeraOnline,3be274,SourDinkleberry,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:39:00 2015 UTC,"Balance is the opposite of Impact, it increases your ability to withstand knockdown abilities used on you.   The 4 crit rate loss is worth it for the boost in defense modifier. I don't quite remember the green stats on the idoneal gear, but I'm sure I can find a reason to use Idoneal over any other gear you might have at the moment. Only switch out of Idoneal if you get Ambit (+10 or higher), or Discovery, or Generation.   At this point in the progress of the patches, most people are already where they intend to be once the patch hits; I'm sure there are people willing to take you into harder dungeons so you can skip a few tiers of gear :)."
TeraOnline,3be274,iHenryblah,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:49:58 2015 UTC,"You should specify what gear you are using instead of idoneal. I suspect it is emina lv 62 armour or something. If I am correct in thinking this, you should immediately dismantle your emina gear and use full idoneal set. The set bonus more than makes up for any lack of stats.  Statswise, you want a mix of power and crit. A basic rule of thumb is to take power unless switching will increase your crit rate by 1.6x more. i.e. if you are offered 1 power or 1.7 crit, take crit. 1 power or 1 crit, take power. Balance and impact are useless.  Dungeons right now, prioritise Sabex Armory and M. catacombs for your master glyphs, keep running them until you have your crit rate glyphs for HT, WW and MS at minimum. All the other dungeons you can do will drop gear, but you will not be able to enchant them fast enough to make use of them much as they will become obsolete in just over a week (new patch). Dungeons you can go to are BRNM, RG but play them just for fun not for the gear."

TeraOnline,3bdyrj,sev0,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:36:23 2015 UTC,"Tensus gear won't even work for PvE anymore because of the rerollable stats being changed to PvP only (i.e. 6% more damage will become 6% PvP damage for example) and it can't roll for enraged monster damage, etc.   But as the others have said, if you have Discovery, it's very highly recommended that you go gear up with Discovery2/Timescape gear, as your Discovery will hold you just fine until you decide to do Timescape HM, which should have +12 Timescape gear as a minimum unless you and your group have already mastered the instance."
TeraOnline,3bdyrj,fluffy-tails,2,Sun Jun 28 22:22:24 2015 UTC,"There are several factors that come in to play when you ask this kind of a question. The general consensus is that, if you have a certain iteration of a set, you stick to that iteration for the next set (ie. you have discovery, your goal should first be discovery v.2). The gap between discovery and vm5 is immeasurably vast.   With PERFECT stats and 3% rolls on all your gear, with the addition of etchings, innerwear, belt, jewelry, and crystals, you may (very suspect about this personally) skim by in the normal mode of the new instances (I personally highly doubt that you can, but saying may because it isn't impossible). This is because you also need to consider other members of your party - not just yourself. If you're farming for this gigantic leap in gear, other DPS who have managed to already attain their discovery 2 (much earlier than you because it isn't vm gear), you will not hold aggro from anyone irrelevant of how good you are. This would deem you as a useless tank.   tl;dr   no you probably can't run the new vm mat instances with discovery gear you'll probably end up being unable to tank if your gearing takes as long as it does, other people will gear more quickly than you will"

As you'll be losing a lot of stats from the modifier difference between D1 and D2 and thus be losing a lot of aggro making it harder on yourself. While you might be able to facetank the stuff in the new dungeons, that doesn't mean you'll be able to keep aggro off your better geared counterparts, especially since lancer (come next patch) will have the shittiest aggro gen of the 3 classes able to tank."

I know it seems like the federation team has the advantage, but just because it is harder does not mean people shouldn't try. I have won and lost games from both sides. If you get teammates that don't want to play making your job impossible, then I completely understand forcing a early draw. But please try to queue up with the mindset that you want to win, regardless of which side you join. Personally, I prefer draws over rigged matches.  Edit: My point for this comment was that there may be a group that dislikes rigged matches more than draws. I'm sorry if I failed to make this point clear in my original post."
TeraOnline,3balvp,Kourinn,2,Sat Jun 27 11:44:23 2015 UTC,"I think this is more of a matter of ""don't push it"".  Even though you cannot chat to the other team in battlegrounds, I believe some degree of sportsmanship is important and direly needed. To put in first-person perspective of the kumas in such a situation: ""I admit defeat because my teammates do not want to play, so I'm giving you a free win. Just be respectful and take it."" To stay and PK the kumas is just being a complete asshole and succumbing to bully tactics. And cmon, ""I'm already giving you the free win, credits, daily quest, etc. I have all the power to disband/leave/draw it and I'm not doing so, so just take the win and go."" The kumas is nice enuff to let people have their win instead of drawing it, so is asking for some respect too much to ask for?  Of course I agree that people should try to win and not rig the match, but when you already have uncooperative teammates and you know you will not be able to win because of that, you should know when to admit defeat.   This is much unlike CS where people give up to a good team and afk in base - in CS you HAVE the potential to win with your team with the right strategy and skill, but in Kumas when two of your other kumases log off it is systematically impossible to win.  On the converse side, I strongly despise kumases who intentionally lead to the draw, be it the ones who initiate the draw or the ones who log off and leave their teammates to lose.   You may prefer draws over rigged matches but not everybody does so. Most people do kumas/bg for the credits and winning does give a lot more credits than drawing, not to mention that the cooldown is still the same anyway. If I ever met with such a situation described by Goldrush453 as humans, I would quickly take the win and be thankful for the kumas for not drawing."
TeraOnline,3balvp,ohw258,-2,Sat Jun 27 12:16:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you have said, especially the point about when you have uncooperative teamates and knowing when to admit defeat. But playing the game only provides more points to the winning team. In a hopeless match due to uncooperative teamates, the remaining payer has no incentive to play and will likely draw the game because drawing gives the same rewards for no extra time investment. I've commented ideas about a how to fix this in the past but nothing ever came from it.   In your case, you decided to play for the value received from helping a group of players on the other team, but some obviously did not appreciate the gesture and instead decided to harass you because to them, the rigged game had less value than a draw or a real match. I think there are two different perspectives that are butting heads, the side that dislikes rigged matches and wants to play a challenging match or not play at all (draw) and the side that wants to just get a daily win and don't care about the game-play. You were appealing to the latter side, but the former side was upset and acted harshly towards you for it. I'm not sure your message will be heard by the former side because their values conflict with yours and will unlikely ever find common-ground, which is probably why this battleground was in Korea removed. I'm sorry that they treated you harshly, but there are conflicting view points and reasons they did so. The result of ""pushing it"" is exactly what they want to have happen. I wish this wasn't the case, but it is what it seems to be true based on my experience and various posts about it on forums and this subreddit."

Why?   If you're good at the game, running the dungeons for the disco gear equivalent of any patch is a cakewalk. If you're not good at the game, it's safe to assume you aren't going to be going into the schm/abhm/mchm of the patch. Therefore, the disco gear equivalent dungeon will be your dungeon that you run to play the game. You also won't need the disco in a rush to attempt the hard mode since you won't be doing it. What's the point paying for the gear just to remove the point of playing the game. If you have trouble with the dungeon, improve yourself instead of paying for a gear carry because that's how you get better at the game, and honestly speaking the disco equivalent dungeons are easy enough that anyone can do it with just the minimal amount of effort put in."

You sure as hell:    Don't have enough time to wipe constantly to learn the harder dungeon Won't be able to find a static group to clear the dungeon since no one wants to be in a group where everyone can run, except for that guy."
TeraOnline,3bcdbc,CelestialRice,3,Sun Jun 28 19:32:46 2015 UTC,"1)  You don't have to be a hardcore player to get gear.  Putting in the time to learn the fights and get through them can be done by anyone, limitless amounts of time and hardcore status not required.    But lets say the people in question aren't able to get the clear in Idoneal/Abmit+10-12.  Buying better gear to get through initally shouldn't be looked down upon.  Hopefully once they clear it they can look past ""having to get it done"" and move onto ""getting better"".  If you're such an elitist about it, next time you get a BoE Disco weapon drop dismantle it and post a video.    Additionally, drops are never guaranteed.  Even if a group does get past the learning process and gets to farming a dungeon that one drop can be forever away.  36 BRHM clears later and my priest friend has never seen a staff drop.  So why not just buy it.  2)  While statics are nice they are not for everyone.  Guilds/friends lists with a player base of people willing to do odd timed runs on alts or mains with the ability to clear the dungeon work just fine for people with chaotic schedules.  Just because someone can't run the same dungeon at the same time of every day doesn't mean they should not be able to get gear."

TeraOnline,3bcbha,Maddyp,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"The others have summarized it pretty nicely. The general quick (maybe not optimal) way to level is to quest grind to 20, then queue for the level-appropriate dungeon to 60, then do the story quests to 64/5. Being a tank or healer class helps a lot for dungeons obviously, but if you're leveling a DPS you can just do story quests while you wait for the queue.   I would check yellow quests on the way too, and accept any that give better gear as a reward since they happen to be near/on the way to the story quest. This is mostly if you're a DPS, as you might not have all the gear from the previous dungeon due to lower number of runs before you get into the next one, and having the better gear makes the run faster.   As for what's fun, only you can answer that. Experiment and find out what you enjoy doing the most!"

TeraOnline,3bb3qz,987Problems,2,Sat Jun 27 14:56:43 2015 UTC,"You'll want to use both of your movement abilities.  Breakaway Bolt is usually glyphed to chain more damage on Penetrating Arrow, so it's best to follow up to get the effect if possible.  Backstep is currently your only iframe (invulnerability frame while using it).  It can be used to reposition, but you should be cognizant of mechanics you may have to avoid when doing so.  The more you get to know the fights, the better you'll be at that.  There's no way around having to learn the habit of using either of these skills while facing backwards to put you on the back side of something you need to be shooting so you can do maximum damage.  Use skill cancellation (fire one shot of Final Salvo) to avoid the long animations at the end of Radiant Arrow and Penetrating Arrow.  Those will hamper your movement and occasionally get you killed if you don't develop the habit of canceling them every time.  I prefer to use Arrow over Rapid Fire whenever possible simply because Rapid Fire has a animation time at the end that can keep you glued to the ground when you need to move, though the stagger it provides is of great utility in PvP.  Use of glyphs to permit you to move at normal speeds while charging was already mentioned in another comment."
TeraOnline,3bb3qz,InRustITrust,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:09:11 2015 UTC,Currently I have Penterating and Radiant arrows as my right and left clicks since I can one shot most mobs in my area with them. In the future when is the best time to use these skills in a chain? I have always just lead with them or the poison arrow but generally I used the poison arrow right after the penetrating if it has more health.   Is there a suggested keyboard short cut for each skill? I have the loads at the clicks and arrow at e and rapid fire at shift+e. Breakaway bolt at shift-s and I dont even have back step keyed in right now but might place it on x.
TeraOnline,3bb3qz,InRustITrust,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"Archers don't really have real rotations.  There are a few abilities worth chaining, but those become pretty obvious when you look at the glyphs.   I have always just lead with them or the poison arrow   Don't use poison arrow at all.  The paltry damage it does isn't worth the time spent using it.   Is there a suggested keyboard short cut for each skill?   I don't know, sorry.  I use a Logitech G13, so my key bindings likely look nothing like what anyone else uses.  I'd suggest reading Pac's guide.  It gives an excellent breakdown of which skills are actually worth using and which are not.  It's all still really true even today (though he was hoping the buff that was coming to thunderbolt might make it worthwhile to use, but it didn't)."
TeraOnline,3bb3qz,ZeeKow,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:46:52 2015 UTC,It gets better with time. The charging whilst moving is either a passive skill or a glyph. So. It's not something that can be taught. I'm betting your movement speed will get better with a passive you've yet to unlock.
TeraOnline,3bb3qz,Spideraphobia,2,Sat Jun 27 15:03:28 2015 UTC,This was the answer that worked. Once i got glyffs I jumped straight to the one that offered the movement upgrade and it enhanced my skill level immensely in my eyes.

TeraOnline,3b8ikz,Priest_Dps,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:06:36 2015 UTC,Lmao. Sounds like what happened to my friends friend. They played a game together and his friend got super elitist cause he got ahead in terms of gear (he was carried though and didn't really earn it). They have a very open/solid friendship and my friend called him out on it and they settled it. He was still elitist in game afterwards but out of game they were fine.

Ambit +9 MW and she'd only heal BRNM if we were ""strong"" in her eyes. Lol, please.. She was just all around rude. So yep, I know how you're feeling right now. I got her out of my life because once she took a break, came back and I got her into my guild, things went downhill and she began to ignore me and stuff.  If you guys try to solve it and he doesn't want to cooperate, it's better to just get that negativity out of your life. Having friends like that isn't fun, trust me. I wanted to outburst on her several times. There's better people out there, and if you guys are real life friends and he's acting like that then he's probably not a true friend and is only interested in his needs."

Our guild was ""country base"" so more people from our country join and suddenly this kind of ""superiority feeling"" grow on those incial members, they wouldn't take new oculus players, or explain instances or nothing, after a while their behaviour was so stupid that I left the guild, I joined a 4 man guild, started running abhm and selling bones non-stop, those same players that were ""too advance to teach those noobs"" (actual words from 1 player) were asking me to make a disscount on the bone, quite of those few noobs got the bone themselve and wipe with me whenever we would lack a dps. Moral of the story, don't even bother about other people behaviour, play the game to enjoy and to get better yourself, people that are ""too advance"" usually don't get better 'cause they think they know it all, think like this, you are a nab but you can get better, the question is, can your friend get better ragequitting whenever he faces a challenge?"

These types of interactions just make RL super awkward and weird. No sense losing a friendship over dying in a video game for heaven's sake.   This guy is obviously used to playing with people more experienced or at a different skill level than you are right now. He's not used to dying and obviously doesn't know how to handle it when he does. He expects perfection from people just learning fights - let him play with those types of people in his elitist guild.   Say you're going to start on another server (if you still even want to play) or whatever.

TeraOnline,3bb7u7,random4lyf,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:45:52 2015 UTC,"Currently the limiting factor in the game is MWA, and will more than likely always be that way. If you're looking to make long term investments, stockpiling MWA is always a good idea. Additionally, most are speculating a MWA price increase two patches from now when it is removed as a drop from the level 60 instances. Naturally, MWA also goes up at the start of each patch as people are in a rush to +12/15 their gear, and those with sufficient gold will spend what is necessary to complete their gear. The only downside to MWA investment is you wont see your return for quite some time."
TeraOnline,3bb7u7,Chiral_Systems,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:12:23 2015 UTC,What's MWA? I'm level 25 with about 80k gold so might as well invest it since I don't need it.
TeraOnline,3bb7u7,987Problems,0,Sun Jun 28 00:08:29 2015 UTC,"Masterwork alkahest. It is an item (used in quantities specific to an item level) to enchant gear through +10 - +12 enchantments. Additionally, it is used to awaken gear (1000 MWA per piece) and enchant it through +13 - +15 (at significantly higher quantities than regular enchantment). Reasons behind its high price are quite simple: limited accessibility with near universal demand. Efficiently farming out large quantities of MWA does not appeal to the majority of players (due to the monotony of repeating vanguards and running LoT across two characters repeatedly), so that keeps the price relatively high and stable. But to reiterate: do not expect to see immediate returns on your investment. Returns will either be evident when you sell your MWA at a premium price when demand spikes, or when you use it for your own purposes when the prices are higher than your initial investment."

TeraOnline,3b7cxn,dragonbeast1122,-1,Sat Jun 27 02:07:28 2015 UTC,I transferred my reaper to mount aids from AV during the transfer event because I did more damage in corsairs than in PVE LOL. I wish I knew this before. I guess it's not hard to get another reaper to 65 though.  And to OP: Try not to compare ambit to idoneal either since the difference between the two is almost nothing. Also comparing any class to a gunner in the current state of the gunner is pretty insane. My idoneal gunner can outdps some of my other geared classes that I know what I am doing on (and I have no idea about optimal rotations on a gunner).
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,Yisery,3,Sat Jun 27 05:11:39 2015 UTC,Comparing a reaper to a gunner is like comparing a canoe to a cruise ship. The classes are very different from each other and have their own perks and utilities. Gunners are a powerhouse for dps right now and reapers are not built that way.
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,dragonbeast1122,2,Fri Jun 26 21:16:00 2015 UTC,"I understand that no one can match a gunner right now. My question was more, is 95k dps around what I should be expecting?"
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,Meekyle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:57:47 2015 UTC,"That's right. I have 65's on both reaper and gunner. I can tell you reapers have way more control in a 1v1 fight. Given the window of opportunity, they can also wreck group fights. The mobility is a plus point. I have constantly out-kited multiple players trying to kill me, turning back to pick them off. That has been my experience as a reaper."
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,randomgrunt1,2,Fri Jun 26 16:11:30 2015 UTC,"95k is kind of low for +12 weapon and +9 gloves. I would estimate that around 110-120k is average for ambit gear.  The reason for this difference is probably your jewelry, crystals and how you use grim strike.  Most people don't know that Grim Strike hits 3 times (actually 4, but 2 hits are at the same time) Most people cancel the last and strongest hit, you have to wait until you pull your scythes out of the ground. Secondly, your rotation is really good, but instead of using spiral right away and spamming grim at the end until you don't reset, wait on the second spiral until you can go Spiral > Double Shear > Grim again. This lets you use both powerlinks of Spiral, and both the grim powerlinks. After that, don't spam grim until no reset, non powerlinked grim is underwhelming and you are better off using other skills until you can get at least Double Shear again.  Just some minor tweaks to try, hopefully this helps"
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,Xenaida,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"Wait, the last hit is the strongest? I always felt like it was same or slightly less than the second.  Next patch will remove the hit on pulling the chains back and move damage to the second hit anyway."
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,auggis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:28:23 2015 UTC,"From my experience it is, I've only ever crit over 1mil on the last hit.   I don't always pay attention to it, so maybe I missed a big second hit or something. I wouldn't be surprised if both hits had the same min/max range for their hits and I'm probably just getting max hits on last tick.  But like you said, in a month it won't matter!"
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,Xenaida,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:16:03 2015 UTC,I've gotten my mill crits off the second hit of Grim Strike.

TeraOnline,3b7cxn,Gkhn_,2,Fri Jun 26 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"Are you letting the third tick of grim strike go off? Also, I'm still learning reaper are you supposed to allow the third damage tick on grim strike to occur?"

TeraOnline,3b7cxn,justdavidt,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:58:24 2015 UTC,You waste probably .5 seconds to do the 3rd hit over not doing it. I would think in PvE that would still be good.
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,Masterpop1337,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:28:30 2015 UTC,"Reaping lasts for eight seconds and by following the default rotation you will do Grim Strike ~four times, which is two seconds. Two seconds is enough to do one extra Sundering Strike or Pendelum + Whipsaw combo. Either way, letting the third hit trigger while in Reapings is a waste of time and damage."
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,-Vexed,4,Sat Jun 27 02:41:23 2015 UTC,"First of all you cant out dps same geared skilled gunner rightnow.  Ido set vs +12 only ambit weap is almost same.If your crit rate is low gunner can out dps you.  And for final you cant compare your dmg to gunner if you dont have same ""end game"" gear.Gunner dont need crit like others so lower the gear bigger the difference  Ps:Your jewels are wrong most of time its 3 deathwise(neck,signet,cascade),2 firethrill.your crit rate should be min +120."
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,Spideraphobia,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:48:58 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, if you do not want to farm battlegrounds for the necklace, you can use 1 deathwise ring and 2 deathwise earings with a fire ring and necklace. This alternative setup is only slightly worse because you give up 4 crit factor but gain 2 power."
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,auggis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:56:23 2015 UTC,"While it is true that a skilled gunner will outdamage a reaper, the difference should not be that significant.   There can be a lot of reasons why you are not doing enough damage. Gear, crystals, and rolls make up for a lot of damage. Having proper equips will significantly increase your damage. There are lots of guides out there that have this information.  Using skills properly is another possible reason. Ensure that you are getting all 3 hits of grim off and 2 hits of double sheer. Using your skills properly will also mean less downtime on attacking.  You should be at the back of the boss at all time. You have many tools that repositions you. Having a high backtime impacts your damage greatly as your crit modifier is significantly higher from the back. Knowing when the boss is going to turn should dictate how your combo will flow. If you know the boss is locked in animation for a long time, you can afford to go for longer combos. If not, save a spiral or pendulum strike for when he turns, then reposition and start the next. Hitting the boss from the front will mean that you lost a lot of potential damage"
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,helpdiene,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:01:03 2015 UTC,My reaper isn't in the best of gear and I've pulled off of +12 gunners (can't see CR but know by the glow). With a crap idoneal scythe and playing proper this holds true.
TeraOnline,3b7cxn,dragonbeast1122,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"YYou probably need more critrate for shadow burst since it is really inconsistent ability and varies wildly from one dungeon run to another how much it wants to crit, for me personally at about +200 critrate it crits anywhere from 15%-60% of the time depending on how nice it feels like being which affects my dps wildly. Also you might want to try out prioritizing whipsaw in your rotatition, I feel like it tends to out damage every other ability by a decent amount unless grimstrike resets a million times in a row because of its gylph for whipsaw boosting damage, and the critrate powerlink glyph from pendulum and how often you can use it compared to sundering and cable into burst. Also don't forget to use reaping cause that hugely affects your damage as well"

The skill thing helped. I can't believe it was at low level. Also from what it seems crit needs to be stacked hard. On a gunner a lot of skills have high crit rate and pretty much auto crit(arcane barrage) and do a ton of damage. As a reaper I notice I barely crit so I have been trying hard to up my crit rate

There's lots of variables, but I'm doing on average 140k on brhm turtle on my slayer with +9 ambit and cruxes, with just a crit power scroll v and nostrum.

TeraOnline,3b9ols,pphp,2,Sat Jun 27 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"Been exclusively playing an archer since closed beta. I love the class, and it gets a lot of shit because back a long tome ago, they WERE shit. But now, they're just as viable as any other class. The stigma has just kind of followed them. The class takes love, though. Its definitely worth it if you can get into it."
TeraOnline,3b9ols,Spideraphobia,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:25:41 2015 UTC,Archers are fun and can easily carry a group (leveling up I easily solo'd 5 mans pre gunner/avatar weapons using proper crystals and traps). In vault with 2 +12 ambit (chest and boots) I've hit for 1 milion + at the 3-4 min mark. The issue is that sometimes as with a few other classes certain moves get stuck. (final salvo is a notorius one for me). Finding the right button combo to stop it can be annoying / get you killed and sucks especially in pvp. It's a fun class though and watching a health bar drop after a nice piercing arrow hit is also enjoyable.
TeraOnline,3b9ols,Masterpop1337,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:02:26 2015 UTC,"Lol this guide isn't outdated. If anything it is by 1 Patch, and he even address' the issues in the guide itself.  And @ the lag heavily effecting DPS. It is in Regards to a number of skills.  First skill is Stunning Trap, which is canceled using a movement command. The more attack speed you have and the higher your ping is, the harder it is to cancel it which puts it on a 25s cooldown which then hurts your DPS. You Cancel Stunning Trap to Speed the Casting of Penetrating Arrow.  Next skill is Penetrating Arrow and Radiant Arrow. These skills take longer to charge when you have a higher ping.  Now the last 2 Skills that are heavily impacted with ping are Final Salvo and Rapid Fire.  Final Salvo is a skill in which you mainly use to cancel Radiant/Pen Arrow Animations, but with higher ping there are gaps in between each attack.  Rapid Fire also has the same fate as Final Salvo in that there are Gaps in between Each attack.  As I am lazy I can't be bothered to find really good Archer game play. But honestly, Archer is a fine class. I enjoy playing it, although it is harder for me to play it because I play at 250 ping.  A bad DPS is a DPS that eats shit and can't rotate their abilities correctly. So if you spend the time, practice and get good then the class is fine. Besides, they got this shit buffed out of them again last patch."
TeraOnline,3b9ols,random4lyf,0,Sat Jun 27 03:27:00 2015 UTC,"question is, how much does this high ping hurt our DPS?"
TeraOnline,3b9ols,random4lyf,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:48:17 2015 UTC,"Idk my DPS isn't as good as my Slayer because I can't take advantage of some specific glyphs. Namely Double Damage Rapid Fire.  Just play the bloody game. DPS in this game is based on how well you know the class. Not about the class specifically, although some shine more than others.  Archer you need to put in work. If you blame your ping, this game isn't for you."
TeraOnline,3b9ols,SourDinkleberry,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:52:30 2015 UTC,"All ticks of charge communicate with the Tera server once per tick. The implications of this is that charging spells (mainly affects Archers and Berserkers) do technically speaking charge slower as latency increases, though realistically you won't notice this with human eyes.   So yes, latency affects DPS, but not really.   Also, this is an MMO. Unless the class gets a complete overhaul, how you play the class stays the same. The only expected guides coming out I expect will regard tank stance Berserkers. The reason the guides are old is because it's simply unnecessary to update them (except where new spells/damage modifications are so important that it affects play style)"
TeraOnline,3b9ols,KoalatyBear,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"Archer main here. Started the game with archer and never regretted it. If you enjoy the class, you can always make it work. We do get a bad rap but with the recent archer buff, we can definitely hold our own in dps. Ping does affect several skills but can be worked around. If you have any questions, I may not be the most ""Koalified"" but can definitely give you a hand."

TeraOnline,3ba7o5,hhsstory,3,Sat Jun 27 06:54:32 2015 UTC,There is a tab in the top right that says channel.  Switch channels and hopefully they won't be on that one.  They generally stay on 1 since it is most populated and they get more kills.  It basically is the games way of letting you stay on the same server  but switch to lower population if several people are doing the same quest.  Works for getting away from trolls that kill low level people too.
TeraOnline,3ba7o5,perjunk,3,Sat Jun 27 06:58:55 2015 UTC,You can PvP on PvE servers.  Or just change channels.
TeraOnline,3ba7o5,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:25:06 2015 UTC,All you have to do to avoid this is change channels. Most pkers stay on channel 1. I've leveled smoothly on a pvp server just by questing on low population channels.

In the top right of the screen there is something that tells you what channel you are on, click it and pick a different one with low population. You default to channel 1, but if you swap it's significantly quieter. I leveled 1-65 while being killed by high level players less than half a dozen times just playing on a less populated channel. Also once you pass level 30 or so the amount of PK'ers goes down a lot, they  mostly hang out in the beginner zones."

TeraOnline,3ba5v5,Sirocco_,2,Sat Jun 27 06:29:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Avatar weapon is pretty much the best weapon you will get while leveling, every few levels pieces for the next one will start dropping.  Your main skill is Arcane Barrage, while leveling your best combo is probably lead with mana missiles, then arcane barrage and scattershot then use replenish and if you reset cooldowns use arcane barrage/scattershot again. Throw timebomb/arc bomb combo in as well as roll/scattershot combo to kite and wait for cooldowns then repeat the process, and once you have willpower built up use burst fire (also good for killing a large amount of grouped mobs, once they are about 25-50% health you can stand still and use burst fire to kill them). Ideally you want to use Arcane Barrage and Replenish whenever they are off cooldown."
TeraOnline,3ba5v5,mdk_777,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:21:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, and one more thing:   Are all the skills worth the coin to upgrade? Or do you never upgrade certain skills?"
TeraOnline,3ba5v5,mdk_777,2,Sat Jun 27 08:30:50 2015 UTC,"You should probably just upgrade everything, Gunner doesn't have that many skills and upgrading is pretty cheap. However if you really don't want to spend the money you can skip command: recall (more important at level 65 because it's an i-frame, but not necessary for leveling), command: self-destruct you don't really need, and learn point-blank, but after you don't need to upgrade it again. Those are probably your least used skills, but the cost of upgrading skills is pretty negligible. You can make several thousand gold per day easily in end game so it doesn't matter how much gold you have while leveling. If you run short on cash to level just gather plants/minerals/energy in the area you're in for a few minutes then you can sell it on the broker. The lower level materials are used for a level 60 quest and level 60's don't want to go gather them, so they still sell for around 50 silver to 1 gold each on the broker which should be enough gold to upgrade."

Someone else said this, but I believe the person who translated stated that the original Korean teaser does not use gender-specific pronouns, so they used ""her"" in the translation since it made sense from the teaser showing a female character.  There's still hope that males will be able to be this class, but currently we don't know. There isn't really evidence supporting a female-only class, but there isn't evidence that it's for sure a male/female class."

BHS is going to do what will, guaranteed, give them money. It is nearly 100% guaranteed that people will play female characters, maybe because it's an actual girl that wants to, or a dude that ""wants something nice to look at"". Maybe people just want some variety too, there are many reasons. People will, at some point, buy costumes for this character, either with real money, or gold (still requires someone to spend real money to get the costume). Add the fact that elin animations are superior in pvp, thus people of all genders that want to min/max will play elin, and will buy costumes for elin.  tldr: male only class would not be as financially viable as a fem only class"

I rather they put gender/race lock, than they leave fate of arun patch for 6 more months 'cause they had to develope new animations for the other races."

New female castanic animation are pretty similar to the female high elfs that's why, I think, those 2 were choosen, it's a conviniance more than anything the gender/race lock imo"

TeraOnline,3b3zck,warriorgriffinheart,2,Thu Jun 25 21:12:36 2015 UTC,Why are you doing this to us EME. Production points are precious. 20 pp to gather one vegetable is too much. Also lines are longer due to the sudden influx of new players. Please add more channels! Two hours of waiting just do finish a whole set of rootstock dailies is just a ridiculous amount of time. Plus dailies and running dungeons you are going to tire everyone out.

TeraOnline,3b3zck,PurifiedFlubber,3,Fri Jun 26 02:43:23 2015 UTC,"It depends on how many people bet on the bam. The more people favoring one bam, the less you win if he does win. Not all bams are created equal, and some bams are stronger than others, and usually receive more bets. Betting on the underdog is more risky, but your reward is larger if he wins. Or at least that's how I understand it."
TeraOnline,3b3zck,Ready_Able,0,Fri Jun 26 03:35:50 2015 UTC,That is how it works but the house gets a cut of the winnings as well. You can remedy that by selling the tokens to player(s)

Everyone was chatting (getting drowned out by the screaming from the Bamarama arena) and having a good time, even though we were waiting for around 30 minutes. Then two people came and started cutting the line in turns, one spamming the npc while the other played. Of course they wouldn't comply with the mostly polite requests to stop, and then...   Well one by one people abandoned the line and it just went back to spamming the NPC. It was so disheartening to see. The worst thing is that some of the people who had been waiting patiently got so frustrated that they changed channels and did the same thing. Seeing something that was so much fun almost instantly turn into a cascading torrent of shit across multiple channels just ruined the festival for me so I left with plans to go back later.

TeraOnline,3b5f5o,GlobalProxy,4,Fri Jun 26 02:57:49 2015 UTC,"Sorcerers have the lowest mobility of all, because some of their attacks forces them to stand still (Fireblast, Nova, unglyphed Arcane Pulse)   Archers are in between.  Gunners are mobile on the level of melee classes."
TeraOnline,3b5f5o,Swaay,2,Fri Jun 26 03:15:30 2015 UTC,"Certain glyphs can get rid of the movement restriction while casting a spell. Specifically, penetrating arrow and radiant arrow are the two I know of."
TeraOnline,3b5f5o,triplespadez,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:07:36 2015 UTC,It's important to note on Sorcerers that a few animation locks are being removed/adjusted and Jaunt/Backstep are going to be on separate cool downs (giving you three iframe moves - and glacial retreat - on separate CD). In many games I've played the mages/casters have had cast times on their higher DPS abilities and the play style might not be a problem for people accustomed to that.   There are also a ton of abilities you CAN use on the move   Fire Ball Magma Bomb Ice Needle Painblast Mana Siphon Void Pulse Hail Storm   And you get burst of celerity (on a very short CD) that increases casting speed by 30% (50% with glyph) for when you need to stand still and cast your higher-DPS rotation(s).   The abilities you can use on the move are obviously not going to give you TOP dps... but you're also not 100% forced to completely stop DPSing if you can't stand still to pull off your main rotation under celerity.
TeraOnline,3b5f5o,sebastiansly,2,Fri Jun 26 15:27:14 2015 UTC,"Reapers are semi-ranged and if you really want a mobile class, Reaper is a perfect choice"
TeraOnline,3b5f5o,Xenaida,2,Fri Jun 26 09:58:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have an archer, but I'm pretty sure they just have the typical backstep move as well as Breakaway Bolt, which damages the ground you're on while jumping backwards.  For Sorcerers, they have 3 different mobility spells: Backstep, Glacial retreat (similar to breakaway bolt, but slows enemies), and Teleport Jaunt which blinks you forward. At the moment, Backstep and TP Jaunt have a ""shared cooldown"" meaning that once you use one move, the other will go on a 5-second cooldown, but I'm pretty sure they're eliminating this next patch (while adding 5 seconds onto TP Jaunt's cooldown). Basically, they should have 3 mobility spells next patch if I'm not mistaken. Currently, Sorcerers effectively have 2 mobility spells because of the shared cooldown.  In terms of mobility while fighting, Sorcerer relies on channeling certain moves for damage (similar to Berserker), but you can use those mobility spells in between your attacks for a fluid rotation.  Edit: I'm not sure if Archers have an ability like this, but Sorcerers get an ability called Burst of Celerity which boosts their attack speed by quite a lot. Attack speed also affects animation speed, so in turn it will speed up your mobility spells as well.  Note: I edited this thing like 5 times so I apologize if you noticed some ninja edits happening."

Sorcs need to stand still and cast the skills. Archers only get 1 iframe? backstep where sorcs have 2 (jaunt and backstep, where next patch shared CD will be removed), and ofc the explosion thing what is not iframe, but can move you around. Similar to Gunner rocketjump."
TeraOnline,3b5f5o,sev0,2,Fri Jun 26 07:17:08 2015 UTC,"Gunners don't need to stand in one place to do anything other than Burst Fire and Mana Missles. On top of that, Arcane Barrage(Their most frequently used skill) can be used while running around. Their roll has a 45% chance to reset with a glyph, their Command: Recall has a 24s cd when glyphed which also has an iframe, and Balder's Vengeance has another iframe as well but that is a much longer CD plus their rocket jump has a 9 second cd when glyphed on top of a 50% move speed bonus when glyphed.

To put it into perspective, you could reverse the question. ""What's the hype with Castanics/Elves?"". Because they're cool/dark/pure. No more reason needed.  Of course, there are some people that find it a sexual thing, but many people also find the other races sexual too. That's a separate issue altogether."

Depends on play amount and which class. can be a few days to a month.  there's a sticky up top with a very nice FAQ, i suggest reading it."
TeraOnline,3b5vmi,jetah,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:46:48 2015 UTC,"thanks will read the FAQ!  just another question: you mentioned it might take days to a month. If I play the game around 3 hours a day, can I reach it before a month? and after I reach level 65, what does the focus of the game become? is it pvp?   Thanks a lot in advance!"
TeraOnline,3b5vmi,AlwaysSitting,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:01:30 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what class you choose, and if you are playing with another person or group of people.  Playing a DPS class for around 3 hours a day everyday will, I would say, get you to 65 in 1 week to 1 1/2 weeks. Playing tank or a healer class would definitely take longer because it takes a little more time to clear mobs and clear quests, unless you are playing with another person or group of people.  After 65 it really is up to you what you want to do. The majority of people PvE. But their are still a good amount of people who PvP. Both PvP and PvE come with their own gear progressions so taking either route is still is pretty fun.  And you aren't necessarily blocked from doing either PvE or PvP. PvP gear isn't too bad in Instances and there are equalized gear BGs for PvE people too."

TeraOnline,3b5vmi,Wakabala,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:13:48 2015 UTC,"My GF's laptop has a shitty integrated AMD Radeo GPU (7520G iirc), 4GB of single-channel RAM, and a mediocre CPU (not even the i series). She does play on the lowest settings, with a few little perks enabled, and it plays a consistent 20-30FPS in heavy areas, and fine everywhere else.  Honestly, it's free, no harm in trying it out. The cash shop is mostly cosmetic and is integrated very well. Haven't seen anything pay2win yet, but even if you DO buy the best gear, the games factors your actual movement and how you control your character over raw stats like other MMOs."
TeraOnline,3b5vmi,CidImmacula,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:17:40 2015 UTC,"uuh  currently I'm sporting a Gen 2 i5 with an HD5670, with settings on a customized ""Medium"", I could scrape about 24fps, 14 when Gunners around me spam their skills (lots of flash even at my low level).  Medium is already relatively good quality, I think Low is still of a pretty good image quality, but I just have a bit of pride I guess...even if it means running 27fps. My rig is pretty extreme on the low end though (Intel Proc + phased out AMD GPU) and I could manage that much, most low-end to mid-end cards nowadays can probably net you even smoother runs on medium.  It's not a pay-to-win game...unless you're in EU, or so from what info I can get from this sub. I've only played NA and haven't gotten very far but just browsing through the Item Shop tells me the game is more of Pay2BeFashionabluh..  Ping to the server is much more sensitive than FPS though.

TeraOnline,3b56k5,Karmies,3,Fri Jun 26 01:42:14 2015 UTC,It's generally considered good to take Crit if the trade-off ratio is 2 crit for 1 power.
TeraOnline,3b56k5,Splintrr,3,Fri Jun 26 01:58:53 2015 UTC,"For Warrior DPS, I personally have +193 with a Heaven's Elixir on, but I can get more from a DW Signet rolled with Crit and a Keen III etching instead of the II. IMO, warriors should get around +180 to +200 crit so that everything can crit frequently, as a lot of your damage is Blade Draw, which doesn't have a crit glyph. For when I tank, I would also use crit since getting even a single crit on say Rain of Blows will add more threat/damage than a full white damage RoB (I use a Focused crystal and a Crit Power scroll).  Edit: To clarify, I would choose crit over power depending on what your current crit rate is."

TeraOnline,3b56k5,VerticalRadius,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:17:25 2015 UTC,"I have the rare power innerwear (+6). And I would've chosen the crit ones not because it's better, but because you can move your power/crit around with vyrsks. I sit at about +165 (in stance) with the power innerwear and keen vyrsks and I already do great damage. If I had at least rare crit innerwear I would have +177 and could drop up to 24 crit rate (from vyrsks) for power should I want to.  I have had +200 crit rate before on warrior, I didn't notice much improvement in critting from the old +165 and my dps didn't suffer at +165 with the power I regained from dropping crit. Though I would still want like +170-175 personally. I also got energetic etchings and CDR. Also remember that scythe gets a crit glyph buff soon.  EDIT: Why do people keep saying power:crit is 1:2 and then go on to say what's better? It is not 'safe' to assume it's 1:2. If it were truly 1:2 then it wouldn't matter what you got on anything since the item bonuses in the game are 1:2 (except for pumped etchings and power charms). Get enough crit to reliably proc your dps crit crystals and crit power scroll - there are different resistances for each boss, the ideal crit stack is different for each character class, and even base crit on each skill on each class. And there are diminishing returns for each stat. Get at least +150 crit factor if you don't already as a DPSer (unless you're a gunner). If there weren't diminishing returns, crit would be far superior to power at any amount."
TeraOnline,3b4t3j,deadchick9182,2,Thu Jun 25 23:44:30 2015 UTC,"everything in the cash shop can be traded (some exceptions may exist but I know of none right now).  the best value is to pickup a boxed copy of Tera (at least for the NA version) for 20$ at gamestop or look online.  Mounts are good, auto-loot pets are good. rest is just about looking pretty.  It's possible to get a better value by selling the EMP and buying the item you want for gold.

We'll have to wait and see, I guess; gunner is available to the females of two races, after all, so they may do something similar. Or perhaps it's race-exclusive to humans, male and female. I guess we won't know for certain until all the details come out closer to KTERA patch day."

Granted you can spend I think 15 vanguard credits for the scroll at the vanguard merchant, too.  The shape changers might be worth it for 100 bills if that interests you. On TR right now, cheapest Chest changer is 2.6k, Height is 2.9k, Thigh is 3.2k.  I personally don't think anything's worth the bills yet, though. I've spent one on the 24-Karat Hauberk pattern, and that's it.

TeraOnline,3b2e1w,spaghetticatt,2,Thu Jun 25 12:41:23 2015 UTC,I'm actually planning on purchasing elite soon! I'm just waiting for Sunday to buy it because I have a big thing on Saturday and don't want to distract myself with that.  I actually bought a height changer for my male human lancer... His legs started to look chunky because of all the heavy armor and making him +3 height fixed that (for me at least). His body looks way more proportional now. I've just been sitting on the rest of my fed bills for a while...  Maybe I'll just hold onto them for now and see where that takes me then.  Thanks for the answer!
TeraOnline,3b2e1w,Narissis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:50:49 2015 UTC,"That reminds me I want to height-up my male human lancer for the same reason... and maybe also the side-effect of making him easier for healers to spot with lock-ons.  I find that with castanics and high elves, they're already so slim that any height increase higher than +1 makes them look comically stretched-out. But thicker races like humans and amani wouldn't have that problem."
TeraOnline,3b2e1w,Narissis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:33:02 2015 UTC,"I personally think the amani are tall enough, but I guess it would be fun to tower over everyone. I haven't made one yet, but I might plan to do just that if I get around to making one.  +3 Human males aren't even the height of amani but it definitely fixes the proportions in my opinion.  While you're at it, take a look at -3 Human male for fun (since you can preview the changes before finalizing). I think it looks pretty funny because the torso and arms don't really change, so you end up looking like a square-person. I don't think I'd ever play a human male at -3 though, but for comic effect it does its job."

Since it's a 61 dungeon, it's generally faster to kill the mobs.  Though to be honest, I don't know what the queue times for them are relative to each other. And since you can just queue for both at the same time, you'll get into whatever's faster queued. I just remember that SA is done in about 10 minutes with a decently competent group (only ran it with pugs and still took about that time for me), while I generally take longer in MC."

TeraOnline,3b2e1w,leeep,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:40:02 2015 UTC,"You could grind them quite quickly on your lancer solo as well, by going for level 55-60 BAMs that are easy to kill and drop them 10 at a time.  One very popular spot for this is lithikumases in Seeliewood, south of Scythera Fae. They take a long time to stand up and turn around once engaged, so you can backcrit them from 100% to 0% without too much difficulty before they even start attacking.  Another spot that I like personally is Naga Battlemasters on Serpentis Isle. They're around level 50 so they only drop 5 coupons at a time, but there's less competition, more of them, and they die even faster, so the rate of return can be just about as good.  Also, as a lancer, keep in mind that you have insta-queues and using IM rewards 10 fashion coupons per run. Obviously this would be slower than grinding for them, but if you're going to be running instances anyway and are choosing between IM and the LFG channel, consider IM. You won't want to use it for places like BR, of course, but since you just hit 65, you'll probably be running SA and MC to get your glyphs... use IM and you'll get free fashion coupons too."
TeraOnline,3b2e1w,ibswimmin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"Anecdotally, the ice giants by the Vale of Spires seem to drop noticably  more Fashion Coupons than other BAMS. They drop 10 at a time and seem to drop them more often than the Dracoloths or Kumases in Seeliewood. I haven't done any actual studies of this, but have read other peoples' information."

""Oh, he just bopped(faceplant move) me to death, apparently my gear can't block that.""  ""..anything oneshots me, guess I'm on rock duty.""  We assembled through LFG and one of our guys was a fresh idoneal warrior. After two runs through BRNM I just blurted it out there: ""Wanna go BRHM for shits and giggles?"".  The best things were the jokes about getting to love the floor etc. Que for bullshit deaths left and right. We did two runs (both ended at the turtle). First run 22/30 bars and we died.

TeraOnline,3b6d0a,Yisery,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of lolita) :      Lolita is a nickname for Delores.  It is also a term used to describe a prepubescent or adolescent girl who is attractive and sexually responsive.  She lusts after older men, and is lusted by them in return.  The term originates from the Vladimir Nabakov novel ''Lolita'' which told the tale of the love affair between middle aged Humbert and his 12 year old stepdaughter Lolita.  It became a popular term in the 90's when the teenaged Amy Fisher who shot the wife of her older lover Joey Buttafauco, was called ''The Long Island Lolita''.  The term was also used a lot during the controversy surrounding the 90's remake of the 1962 film version of Lolita directed by the late Stanley Kubrick.  The film which starred Jeremy Irons and was directed by Adrian Lyne, had trouble finding backers due to the controversial subject matter.  14 year old Dominique Swain played the title character, and the fact that a child actress was playing an underaged character involved with sex with adults fueled the controversy.  Lolita is also used as a euphemism for child erotica, child porn, or barely legal adult porn.     My 13 year old daughter is starting to act like a lolita.  Amy Fisher, the Long Island Lolita, was arraigned today.  I just saw the new version of Lolita, and it's better than the 1962 version.    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

I am actually fine locking classes to one race, but locking it to two races one gender is complete bullshit and neither En Masse or BHS has created any lore justification for it like they did for reapers. Does creating new female only classes really generate so much more profit than creating a multi-gender class that they won't even consider it? I thought there were enough players that prefered playing as a male character to make it worth making. :("
TeraOnline,3b0yax,mdk_777,2,Thu Jun 25 07:36:02 2015 UTC,"People don't dislike female-only classes specifically.  They dislike gender/race-lock. It just happens to always be female-lock for tera :P.  There are a lot of development/financial reasons for why the gunner was only castF/elfF, though outside of a few interviews we don't have any actual details. It's generally understood that female toons are much more popular than male toons, and also that players tend to buy more costumes for their female toons than male toons. So yes there are people who play male toons, but they probably don't spend as much as those who play female toons. Additionally, castF/elfF use the same animations so they really only designed one set of animations. And they obviously decided it wasn't worth designing another set of animations given their budget/deadlines.  As for lore, at the end of the day it comes after everything else. You could also argue that there's no lore reason for there not to be female baraka / male elin / female popori. The point is that lore is centered around their game design, not the other way around.   And I guess the final reason is that it simply isn't as big of an issue as you make it out to be. It's a bad part of the game, as gender/race-lock is in any MMO, but it is neither ""complete bullshit"" nor ""shitty practice"". There is nothing wrong with it ethically, morally or legally. It's simply a design decision the devs have made accounting for their budget/time/motivation."
TeraOnline,3b0yax,Kourinn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:30:15 2015 UTC,"But still how come female human, one of the least played female races ingame , get this class while castanic and helf males, one of the most popular male races ingame, still have nothing. Obviously tera makes more from the sales of helf and mcast so why not them?  I'm just curious here, but i see far more hels and mcasts than human females."
TeraOnline,3b0yax,-aesthetically-,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:03:49 2015 UTC,"Because they probably actually make more from human females :P.  Remember that the popularity of races isn't the same between NA and KR.   Otherwise idk, they probably didn't want to give castanics and elves another class."
TeraOnline,3b0yax,Kourinn,3,Sat Jun 27 14:06:50 2015 UTC,"It's just a smart business decision by them, it's faster to make animations for only one race or two races/and a single gender. The faster they can create and put out content the better they retain players and generate revenue from the class. The decision for female (and likely castanic/elf or in the case of Reaper Elin) is because female characters are more popular than males, and people probably spend more money on outfits for females than on males. If 50% of the new players started making male Amani or Barakas then the next class would almost definitely be male only Amiani/Baraka because it's fast and if they are going to pick a race/gender to restrict it to then pick the most popular ones.   You obviously can't fucking sue them for creating the types of content that they want. They aren't breaking any laws by only making female characters (that would be a stupid law if there was one). Also even if you did find an even semi-legitimate reason for a lawsuit they are based in Korea, so good luck trying to sue them. They would be hurt worse financially if they stopped gender/race locking characters than anything you could do. The only thing you can do is try start a Baraka/Amani movement and get everyone playing those characters, because otherwise there is no reason to restrict to unpopular race/gender combinations.   Also how are they inconsiderate to you for doing this? It's not like they are forcing you to play females. Just because you don't like playing females doesn't mean they will cater the game to a minority. In fact you're being inconsiderate towards everyone who likes playing female characters by demanding Bluehole Studios should make male characters by that same logic. I prefer playing male characters too and don't really like the restrictions, but playing female characters isn't some horrible ordeal, it's the exact same game. They are doing it for a reason, and there is nothing wrong with the practice because it means we get content faster."

I prefer playing male characters too and don't really like the restrictions, but playing female characters isn't some horrible ordeal, it's the exact same game.   But they are forcing me to play females if I want to play any of the new classes that have been released in the last 2.5 years. I'm not being inconsiderate toward people that prefer female characters, I want both genders to be able to play as the new class. You say that they make more profit by making female only classes, but I believe that may not be true as they have no examples of creating a new male class. With all the pent up frustrations about female only classes, I think creating something for males too would sell very well. I believe the best things people who want to do-away with genderlocking is to cancel elite, stop buying emp, and most importantly send a message to En Masse clearly stating that you are not giving them any money while this practice continues. If enough people do so, I'm sure they'll start to consider it. I know I'm not alone in this because of other responses in this reddit post and half of the comments about the brawler on En Masse's official forums.   Juuiken  Fuck this... I'm tired of the female only crap, by the time this comes out I will be happily playing a Martial Artist in BnS. I refuse to make another female character to enjoy a class.  ch1k  Yeah it kind of bothers me you're restricted to things because of ""lore"". I don't like playing female characters but if you want to experience everything you're forced to, kind of bummed out, hopefully it isn't.  Aluze  Well, if it turns out to be female locked there goes my only reason why I returned to this game. Pretty dissapointed, specially after the recent article where it said that BHS was paying more attention to it's NA community, and pretty much everyone here is demanding for more some male content  Zoknahal  I will be extremely salty if this class turns out to be again female locked. I was looking forward for brawler, but now that all the odds point that it will be once again, for the 3rd time, female locked, I do not know what to think about BHS anymore.  Arnik  Disappointing.. Was hoping BHS will wow us by bringing in the guys. xC  Vazu  It looks really cool in that picture, though I hope it's for males too.  NimanderNaal  I'm tired of the ONLY new class' being gender locked female... it means I will NEVER get a chance to play as I refuse to break my immersion by playing a female toon :("

Introducing Samael first is actually a much better segue into the existing story arcs than mentioning Elleon briefly in the quest text in an otherwise unrelated arc... plus, with the argons, they're talked about constantly but you don't even start seeing them until your level gets into the 40s.

It's cool that it's actually relevant/highlighting the main conflict of the overall story line. Not as pretty as the Island of Dawn... but I think the story/fights make up for it.
TeraOnline,3b1fp0,Penetrat0r1,2,Thu Jun 25 13:53:34 2015 UTC,Well its not bad but I wonder if it was really worth replacing Island of Dawn..

TeraOnline,3b1fp0,hlycia,3,Thu Jun 25 09:32:46 2015 UTC,Yes they both appeared in this new zone. I feel like they are trying rewrite the whole story or something.

TeraOnline,3az0p0,UnnecessaryPost,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:01:03 2015 UTC,Because warriors aren't even close to top survivability.  Lancers still have a big self-heal and shield.  They also have gshout/pledge to make your party tanky as fuck.  Whether warriors will be top dps is highly questionable too.
TeraOnline,3az0p0,ChildrensPlayground,2,Thu Jun 25 01:18:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't consider a 10k self heal on a 1 min CD (nerfed to 2 min CD in KTera) to be that big of a bonus.   With Warriors gaining Infuriate, as well as removing the CD on their Cross Parry, there isn't much that a Lancer has that a Warrior doesn't at this point. The damage Warriors can put out make it much easier to hold aggro, and they also have a lot more mobility and iframes.   DFA can last throughout most attacks, whereas Backstep's shorter duration can result in you getting tagged during longer attacks.   I have a 65 in both classes, and will enjoy playing my Warrior after the patch, but it seems as if Lancers will end up being a slightly easier to play version of Warriors, but with less utility and also without the ability to switch to a DPS spec if needed."
TeraOnline,3az0p0,FrostOX9,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:02:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't consider a 10k self heal on a 1 min CD (nerfed to 2 min CD in KTera) to be that big of a bonus.   Its getting BUFFED in KTERA. To 50k. Which is insane. On top of Iron Will going up to 30k.   And again, gshout pledge being big safety nets for your team.   Lancers will still be the much safer tank. Hence, the whole survivability thing."
TeraOnline,3az0p0,ChildrensPlayground,-2,Thu Jun 25 02:10:03 2015 UTC,"Iron Will's ""buff"" is more like a nerf. Absorb an extra 8000 damage bringing it up to 32k but gets the CD increased by 10 seconds. It's not a big enough increase to justify the increase in CD. It's only used to buy some time waiting for cleanse.   The Second Wind buff was expected when you consider that Zerk tanks could self-heal beyond anything a Lancer could. And that before the buff it healed less than 10% of most Lancer's HP pool.   Guardian Shout has a 5 minute CD which is once per fight. Pledge barely protects against anything truly lethal. Plus it's getting nerfed. Both abilities suffer from the fact that they need to be cast pre-emptively. Which means it needs to be used before a big attack. The CD is long enough that they can't be used willy-nilly. And therein lies one of two big flaws: if the Lancer can see it coming everyone else can see it coming. If everyone can see it coming they can iframe it rendering the group buffs pointless. The second big flaw is that those mechanics are usually 1-shot iframe only attacks so those group buffs do nothing ANYWAY. Regardless, both abilities pales in comparison to Kaia's Shield in terms of actual usefulness. Not to mention the Priest's Endurance buff and HP Regen buff.   Self-heals and damage absorption has nothing on just straight-up avoiding the attack. Especially true since so many attacks MUST be iframed.   If Guardian Shout gave the whole group Unbreakable like Rallying Cry gives the group Mocking Shout then you have a point. As it stands you're just showing how little real experience you have with Lancer. The ""safety net"" you describe is put so low to the ground it may as well not be there."
TeraOnline,3az0p0,Grimlokus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:38:04 2015 UTC,"It's only used to buy some time waiting for cleanse.   This is exactly why it's a buff.   Iron will is a skill that grants you a shield on demand. You don't use it off cooldown normally. You use it when you ""oh shit I got hit I need a heal/shield NOW"". Therefore, the most important aspect isn't the cooldown, but the actual amount.   Gshout pledge are situational, but that doesn't mean they aren't useful. Pledge itself will save a group through failed turtle shield phase, as well as various other situations. Meanwhile a warrior can't do shit except save himself.  Lancers will ALWAYS be a safer choice than a warrior if you were to pick between them for a party (especially one that is not as skilled and does require safety nets), because lancers offer party defensive options while a warrior does not. Hence the whole discussion over ""top survivability"".   Especially true since so many attacks MUST be iframed.   All of which can easily be dealt with a single short CD iframe as shown in the current patch.   As it stands you're just showing how little real experience you have with Lancer.   Very mature.  If you want to continue believing that warriors have better defensive options than a lancer then be my guest. I won't bother with further discussions if it's just going to devolve into insults."

Hence the whole discussion over ""top survivability"".   Hah. That's why prefer Lancers to Warriors in SCHM. Oh wait, they don't. Only good for Infuriate and now Warriors get that too. When those situational moments never arise it means it's not useful. At least for current content the vast majority can be done tankless. Then when it updates, of that small amount of content Lancers are only useful when the group is super scrub. A decent group doesn't need saving outside of a Priest. Way to move those goalposts. Somehow ""safety net"" abilities are now ""top survivability"" abilities too.    All of which can easily be dealt with a single short CD iframe as shown in the current patch.   Short is right, though probably not what you mean. Why settle for one iframe, which is the WORST in the game, when Warriors can have up to 4, one of which is the BEST in the game?    I won't bother with further discussions if it's just going to devolve into insults.   Feel free to stop. Forgot how sensitive you Reddit people are. By the way, that was an actual insult.

Not quite there yet, but I can already see it  Class balance #42  We've noticed lack of healers, so here:  Serenity stance - healer stance - changes cooldowns and skill effects. Reduces RE gain, disables RE regen. Arc of life - throw swords of postive energy in curved arc healing for moderate amount. Battle cry - effect changed to buff alies in range for short time (attack speed + power). Restores RE. Torrent of blows - heal for high amount. Fountain of life - costs 1300 RE - Ress + heal for extremly high amount. Battle readiness - costs 1300 RE - grants great buff to party (crit rate ?) + stuff like cleanse, ress (all by throwing fancy swords)  Would be interesting to balance RE regen skills (yes even attack) to healing for optimal play"
TeraOnline,3az0p0,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:50:07 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, that's why Traverse Cut is going from an 11.05% endurance reduction at 13 stacks to a 3.9% endurance reduction at 13 stacks."
TeraOnline,3az0p0,MrThresh,0,Thu Jun 25 03:03:19 2015 UTC,"./cheer  So how many Zerker's out there plan on turning on intimidation and just leaving it on for that proper Iframe we get while intimidation is active instead of the shitty clunky evasive smash we have now!?  Evasive smash = awesome damage, horribly thought-out and designed Iframe.  I'll give up some crit any day of the week too get a proper iframe ability that doesn't take hitting other buttons before I activate it..."
TeraOnline,3az0p0,ESOprudishArmor,5,Wed Jun 24 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't just lose crit though.  You also wouldn't be able to charge cyclone, and fiery rage wouldn't be a DPS buff.  It would be like DPSing in dstance warrior."
TeraOnline,3az0p0,iWreckYouz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:15:33 2015 UTC,Also as a zerk crit is probably far down the list of things you want to give up.
TeraOnline,3az0p0,ESOprudishArmor,0,Thu Jun 25 06:04:09 2015 UTC,"True it would be some DPS loss, however not as much of a dps loss as being dead because we're forced to use a shitty/clunky iframe that never should of been made and so caused us to die because of the 2 button requirement!"
TeraOnline,3az0p0,Roukanken,2,Thu Jun 25 13:31:44 2015 UTC,"You're complaining about eSmash being a bad skill? Are you kidding me? It's probably one of the best thought out skills in the whole game. A versatile skill that offers both survivability and damage output, which can be used for either reason independently. In terms of active frames, eSmash is also one of the longest iframes in the game. It's only drawback is a high cooldown which is going to be lowered in the following patches.   ""But I have to press two buttons!"" <- That's a terrible argument. It MIGHT be an issue for you if you play at 250+ ping, but otherwise you can esmash with very little delay. There are very few things this patch that force you into a reactionary iframe, and I doubt you've even ran dungeons that force zerkers to actually save their esmash. You have axe block, which does the job perfectly well against anything except 3 bosses in the game, dash, charge skills and movespeed glyphs make up for the lack of repositioning through iframes.  I'd rather have esmash over backstep, jaunt, or pre FoA evasive roll, any day."
TeraOnline,3az0p0,ESOprudishArmor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree. It's ok, you don't have to be angry over it.  If you are in the middle of cyclone (for example) you have to hit 3 buttons to iframe. Block > charge ability > eSmash. That is a perfect example of a ""clunky"" mechanic. You have no arguments that invalidates this.  You can have eSmash over backstep, jaunt, or pre FoA evasive roll any day. I (and I imagine the fast majority of zerkers) would take any of those over the iframe of eSmash any day. It's a horrible iframe.  Far as blocking goes it is great to a point. A 36k point. If you outgear the dungeon then you can easily soak up the remaining dmg (lasers/smashes/whatever), however if you are actively trying to get upgrades in said dungeon then block becomes a lot less reliable way to absorb those ""big hits""."
TeraOnline,3az0p0,Horus23,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:51:26 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be in middle of cyclone when boss can do attack so fast you can't make it (and it's dangerous enough to warrant dodge). Use more conservative skill, till you know what boss will do.  The only two real problems I have with ES is the long cooldown, 15 seconds is too long time to predict if you'll need an iframe or not, and the second is - it's really hard to dodge multipart attacks with it. Think the fish's jump - you want to iframe the second hit if you're too close, but the fact that first hit interrupts your action, makes it a rng affair (at least for me). You can see it coming from mile away, and you can do nothing except praying and button mashing"
TeraOnline,3b1yz2,Caekie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:05:49 2015 UTC,"Given that you've hinted at the long-term viability aspect of things, I'll approach it from that angle.   Archer is the more consistent of the two. Both classes have had their golden ages in the past, but slayer has fluctuated significantly more, being a top tier class in one patch and bottom of the barrel in another. Archer has always been really good (actually even better than it is now, before several nerfs).  So if you are looking for a class that you can rely on to be good/viable for patches to come, archer is the better choice."
TeraOnline,3b1yz2,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:09:15 2015 UTC,"Archers are pretty solid in duels and very good in mass pvp. Plus if anything they have buffs to look foward to, if you want all round pvp id go archer"
TeraOnline,3b1yz2,Ganonspike,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:05:16 2015 UTC,I see. Thanks for all of your inputs. I'll probably be making an archer from your opinions but just a thought... Are archers capable of fullcomboing someone? Like if a perfect string of skills were made would they be able to 100-0 someone?
TeraOnline,3b1yz2,potatosol,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:18:27 2015 UTC,Id say both are. Now I only have a slayer but I know from experience that I've been 100-0d before by a archer. I also frequently 100-0 people in cs but not without crits and thats only when i dont have to worry about being disrupted.

TeraOnline,3b1yz2,katzeyez,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:10:08 2015 UTC,Srsly? They were by far the worst class to pvp with (3's) back when I played. I guess there's been some balance changes?
TeraOnline,3b1yz2,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:36:02 2015 UTC,"Yea they were really shit until FoA (lv65) hit.   They got absolutely huge buffs to every skill. Like 30%~50% depending on the skill. It feels more like 2x~3x, though that's partially due to eq gear being really shit.  And they also got eviscerate, which is arguably one of the most broken skills in the game lol.   Also evasive roll got changed so its similar to reaper dodge. Can be used twice, hardly any lag.  And ICB doubles OHS damage, amongst other things."
TeraOnline,3b1yz2,katzeyez,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:43:26 2015 UTC,Holy shit. Sounds like I quit the game at a bad time. How's the skill cap now? Is it still considered hard (zerker lvl) or is it actually easier now?
TeraOnline,3b1yz2,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:27:55 2015 UTC,A lot easier lol.  Slayers regained their spacebar hero title in PvP.

I was thinking on making a slayer till i got ganked by 2 slayers same lvl as i, and i kicked their ass. HARD. They might have been super bad, but they did kill me another time and i could tell they knew what they where doing. Im only lvl 19 so maybe not the best example and im new but not to pvp or mmos.  Have you considered a lancer for pvp?"

TeraOnline,3azl20,Turmoil4Fun,7,Wed Jun 24 19:46:07 2015 UTC,"you should use corruption ring with the 50% dmg reduction glyph to facetank the jump coming out of annihilation face. that'll save you your jaunt for dodging the aoe saw.   If you don't want to do that and like to iframe the jump from anni with jaunt, then you should be jaunting TORWARD him (the center or at least relatively close). That way you can simply walk around him to avoid the big saw."
TeraOnline,3azl20,megatonfist,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, the corruption ring is something i really need to get used to using a lot more. im pretty scared to jaunt towards him though but you're totally right about that too haha"
TeraOnline,3azl20,Lisrus,2,Wed Jun 24 22:17:16 2015 UTC,Try to stick as close as you can to the melee dps. By that I mean try to stay close to the boss and behind him at all times.
TeraOnline,3azl20,blueteakettle,3,Wed Jun 24 22:51:17 2015 UTC,"You can save your jaunt for jumps and dodge everything else (like saw) with pure positioning. Keeping good positioning (stay to the side of the boss, not front or back) will let you keep your iframe for more dire situations."
TeraOnline,3azl20,mrjao,2,Wed Jun 24 20:14:26 2015 UTC,"Get the cd reduction for teleport jaunt on your new disco chest. Don't need it at +12, Masterworked with good rolls will do more good than the little extra defense +12 gives. Also if you have the disco weapon, the flat cd reduction was very useful for my mystic. If he targets you with the saw slam after annihilation then its just bad luck, but being opposite of where hes facing should reduce that chance. Other things for fuli, once he enrages at 15%, stay +22m away from him. If you are caught in animation when he does the donut move, then you will probably die. I usually only prioritize keeping the tank alive in this stage.  Otherwise, just try and keep the mote count plentiful. The more motes you have, the better chance you have to recover if you get behind."

TeraOnline,3azl20,xtrem-,2,Wed Jun 24 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"You can avoid this easily by being quite close to him (literally almost touching him), that way you can just kite around him as he is about to slam you, make sure your not in front of the tank too! or whoever has aggro so you don't face plant into his other moves, until jaunt is available again."

Most of the time errors for range classes stem from positional errors. And those can be a cause of tank positioning.   The side cut and back cut are definitely deadly but shouldn't be happening during annihilation. Annhi phase is bugged right now and the orange areas do minimal damage.   Without more info it's hard to give specific suggestions.  And about +12ing gear , no learning the mechanics will save you. And by mechanics I mean what to iframe what to dodge. Not just he's using blades , or run to the center."

TeraOnline,3b0aru,danthesexy,3,Wed Jun 24 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"Given that disco has an extra damage roll and you decide to not update your armor at all (keeping disco 1 armor throughout the entirety of the next patch), the extra roll should make the difference between the weapons negligible. You won't lose any power though, as long as you still have a full set of disco armor including belt (5th piece set bonus gives you endurance iirc). However, with that being said, unless you somehow don't have the resources to obtain disco 2 (which would be surprising, seeing as you already have disco), you should aim for that as it will easily outshine either of the setups that you've mentioned."
TeraOnline,3b0aru,NanakoC,2,Wed Jun 24 23:28:40 2015 UTC,"The general consensus is that you progress to the same iteration of gear per patch. If you are on discovery right now, it is best to move straight into discovery 2.0 etc.. This is especially true for the discovery and above set versus ambit 2.0, because the lines are simply better. The investment to bring ambit 2.0 to +12 for little to no benefit is simply not worth it.  Tl;dr: If you have a +12 disco set already, stick with it. If you have anything less, just farm out idoneal 2.0 and reap the free stats for little to no effort."

TeraOnline,3b1em8,Narissis,5,Thu Jun 25 05:12:39 2015 UTC,"I have a 45 priest, something you can try doing is ""pre select"" who you want to heal. if everything is going good and you know someone is going to be taking some damage soon, I.E the tank and anyone else close. You can click, target, and then just wait for them to take damage then click to heal. You can use this between skills. If you use another skill it will cancel this without delay. I don't know how effective this will be in later levels, or even how much longer I will be doing this. but you might try it if it works for you."
TeraOnline,3b1em8,Rami1455,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:37:37 2015 UTC,"I will try, thanks for the tip!"
TeraOnline,3b1em8,Narissis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:11:34 2015 UTC,I've been doing this for years; it's not a bad idea.
TeraOnline,3b1em8,Rami1455,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:41:18 2015 UTC,does it ever become unfavorable to do at 65 instances?
TeraOnline,3b1em8,Forgotten_Aeon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:15:56 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the thing. At level 65, you tend to be very busy while healing an instance. You're refreshing Energy Stars, refreshing Triple Nemesis, laying down cleanses, dropping puddles...  So, holding heal targets open in advance isn't necessarily ""unfavourable"" in and of itself... but you can only afford to do it when there isn't something more important to do.  Generally, I would pre-target if I know that the group is about to take a big AoE or something like that. Otherwise, there's not much of a reason to do it."
TeraOnline,3b1em8,Narissis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"Good insight, thanks."
TeraOnline,3b1em8,Narissis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:08:10 2015 UTC,ok. thank you for the info!!!
TeraOnline,3b1em8,Narissis,2,Fri Jun 26 01:16:39 2015 UTC,"Just in case it's not clear (I assume you're aware but just making sure) you don't have to click to lock on for any lock-on skill. It's always <binding> to activate skill, mouse over target(s) until they're green (depends on latency and FPS- more on FPS), then click to cast.    I find that waiting half a second before the second click to ensure a cast is preferable to accidentally canceling since the resulting delay can result in a death.    Edit: As has been stated, pre-locking can be very useful, especially for a Priest since you'll often find yourself with little to do but wait. Once you get comfortable with specific boss encounters, you'll be able to anticipate incoming damage within a few seconds, which allows you to cast the heal as the targets get hit so the projectile delay is all they have to wait for for HP. You'll also look really classy when doing it!"
TeraOnline,3b1em8,BriskTears,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:28:58 2015 UTC,Awesome.  Thank you for the explanation.  I'll start trying that technique out.

TeraOnline,3b1em8,warriorgriffinheart,2,Thu Jun 25 19:42:11 2015 UTC,"Here's what I like to do:  Instead of trying to point directly at the person I'm trying to heal, I'll press the Focus Heal button to start the aiming mode while aiming a bit to the side, then I'll sweep the cursor over the player horizontally, then press the button again to throw the heal.  For me, this makes it a little easier to aim and time, not to mention simpler to heal multiple players since I adjust the 'sweep' to pass over more of them."
TeraOnline,3b1em8,Narissis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:40:16 2015 UTC,I've actually just started doing this to sweep 3 people and make the most out of focus heal.  I like your game plan.  I strafe to pick up close players.
TeraOnline,3b1em8,Narissis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yep. Much easier to strafe and sweep across the party than to try to ""bounce"" the reticule precisely over each player."

TeraOnline,3b0ipz,TKhrowawaY,2,Thu Jun 25 00:05:06 2015 UTC,"What it takes to get rank 1 is to have a faster time than rank 2. Vault times are super straight forward. The faster you clear the better rank you get.  Best score I got was 6776, I hope to break 6780 once I get my 6% vanguard buff back. I'm also curious what server has 6727 as the second fastest time gunner. MT is like 6770+ for the top ten."
TeraOnline,3b0ipz,AboveArcadia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:43:52 2015 UTC,I am on MT. I got my best score today at 6736 / something past 1:04 but I was an idiot and didn't use infusions. For rank I am referring to the end of instance rank rather than individual standings.
TeraOnline,3b0ipz,AboveArcadia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:05:26 2015 UTC,"Oh I always thought that end of instance screen ranking was broken because it always tells me I've reached rank 1, when clearly I haven't.  It could mean your tier (tier 1: 1-5, tier 2: 6-10, ect.), but even then I got a score of 6764 today and it still said rank 1 when I was actually rank 11 and tier 3."
TeraOnline,3b0ipz,fluffy-tails,3,Thu Jun 25 05:03:31 2015 UTC,"The ranks in solo vault aren't really ranks relative to others. It's just based on score off of a list, sort of like Sirjuka Gallery ranks if you know about that. Let's say 6750 is the requirement for a Rank 1 (not sure of what the value actually is). Getting a 6751 would net you rank 1, while a 6749 would give you rank 2. It has nothing to do with your rank on the scoreboards."
TeraOnline,3b0ipz,AboveArcadia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:44:39 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, Thanks for the explanation. I must admit it's kind of weird to have a ranking system like that to exist for the sole purpose of showing you a rank that isn't listed anywhere."

TeraOnline,3b05mt,Raienryuu231,0,Wed Jun 24 22:32:53 2015 UTC,Because you desynced past your target and missed.  Cyclone doesn't have this issue because it has a huge hitbox.
TeraOnline,3b0sz7,Opulescence,6,Thu Jun 25 01:32:37 2015 UTC,Race does not have a major impact; almost negligible unless you're die-hard min-maxing for pvp
TeraOnline,3b0sz7,warriorgriffinheart,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:35:32 2015 UTC,Race doesn't matter in PvE. For PvP smaller hitboxes are better but your teleport skills get fucked up iirc
TeraOnline,3b0sz7,DuckDuckFlow,3,Thu Jun 25 03:07:34 2015 UTC,"It's not just smaller hitboxes. For Zerks, the range and reach on Thunder Strike is larger on Elins (though this is being normalized soon), and animations of certain skills may execute faster or have longer range. For PvE, this will almost never matter, so you can choose what you want based on aesthetics, but if you want to min-max the most, Aman is probably not the best race."
TeraOnline,3b0sz7,fluffy-tails,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:56:27 2015 UTC,Interesting stuff. Difference between popori and elin?
TeraOnline,3b0sz7,DuckDuckFlow,2,Thu Jun 25 07:12:51 2015 UTC,"popori and elin zerker? well poporis thunder strike is almost as fast as elins flatten, also elins auto attack animation is way faster"

TeraOnline,3azsug,Rape_is_my_fetish,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:43:04 2015 UTC,If it's keen or intense version of the weapon it's worth enchanting it all the way to +12. Don't be that cheaplord by stopping at +9. Disco is actually worth investing in.
TeraOnline,3azsug,pakman32,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:48:30 2015 UTC,I've heard masterworking takes a lot of gold which I don't have yet which is why I'm saying +9. At least until I have enough gold to go for it..

TeraOnline,3azsug,crypticzsyn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:04:47 2015 UTC,"Depending on the roll (keen/quick/intense) you should definitely masterwork the scythes. Discovery boots are incredibly cheap and worth picking up so you can get the Disco 2-set bonus. Mixing is completely fine as long as you are abusing the set bonuses, in my opinion. As for the Ambit, just masterwork any piece you're gonna wear - they are easy to masterwork and easy to enchant, making them worth your time if you cannot afford other Disco pieces."
TeraOnline,3azsug,Gkhn_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"Well disco gear is worth to mw.Probably disco will be better than next patch starting gear(ambit 2).

TeraOnline,3azsug,Meekyle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"Reaper Main reporting in, if you plan to play this character a lot or as your main/primary next patch you at least want to get full discovery. If you can skip ambit the better however it is really hard to do that without people willing to carry you through BRHM or SCNM. If you are not able to get BRHM with your guild (should join one if not in one atm) then run BRNM also try to get vault of allies runs (Alliance 5 man vault) and grab some deathwise jewlery and mix with your firetune. That all said, RNGesus has blessed you with that Disco Scythe so try to +12 and use it when you are able to do so. If its keen/intense/quick doesn't matter since you can roll the stats you need with enough MES.  If you're on TR I'll be happy to help you out, other wise fill free to ask me any question about reapers."
TeraOnline,3axd1r,rare,16,Wed Jun 24 06:55:46 2015 UTC,"Dungeon mechanics and i mean teaching them (putting anotations or editing the video with texts explaining what to watch for or where to stand and so on).  Especially with new dungeons coming out, new players that weren't here before will have no clue what to look for (me included), i don't think they will be that hard, but its always nice to watch a video as a ""heads up"" for any 1HKO mechanic."
TeraOnline,3axd1r,alchemist87,6,Wed Jun 24 07:06:25 2015 UTC,So something like this Darkan scnm guide which has video from multiple perspectives (dps and heals or tank) and has on-screen annotations?
TeraOnline,3axd1r,Kourinn,2,Wed Jun 24 15:19:46 2015 UTC,That is an awesome video. I wish there were more boss guides like this one.
TeraOnline,3axd1r,Jerb0t,2,Wed Jun 24 17:14:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Best way in my opinion to teach mechanics is to pause the video when a queue comes and explain it, stop time then show how you solved that situation. General noob and class guides are great to see too."
TeraOnline,3axd1r,ch1k,2,Wed Jun 24 11:28:48 2015 UTC,"This. Plus, it would beneficial to have additional explanations from each perspective where needed, that is healer, tank and damage classes.

TeraOnline,3axd1r,Deathspike21,7,Wed Jun 24 13:04:03 2015 UTC,"I found the tutorial of the game terribly confusing, for someone who is just coming back to the world of MMORPG, the UI was very overwhelming.

TeraOnline,3axd1r,warriorgriffinheart,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:54:44 2015 UTC,"But some of them still doesn't explain enough.  For example, there are some achievements like (I think it was for that labyrinth thingy): Kill 20 of this monster, 20 of that monster and 10 another monsters.  20+20+10? Should be easy. But then you find out that you have racked up the 20+20 part and still have 0 in third.  What now? You search for that monster everywhere and after an hour you give up, google it and it turns out it's a rare BAM that has 5 year respawn time.  Also - you need to dig very deep in various forums to find any info on both achievements and BAMs.  I know that nobody wants to edit/create wikis, but some kind of BAM-o-pedia would be great! =/"
TeraOnline,3axd1r,pieshels,5,Wed Jun 24 17:29:55 2015 UTC,I'm not new but I think videos about Battlegrounds would help a lot of players
TeraOnline,3axd1r,sekundes81,6,Wed Jun 24 12:07:31 2015 UTC,For me the biggest thing was positioning and camera placement and the daunting endgame. For fights maybe detail the camera angles you want best in different scenarios how often to move it what will give you the best chance at dodging hard hitting attacks. I find after being so in tune with mobas it's easy to get fixated at one camera angle and stick with it. Key bindings are also something that you could touch on. As a fresh 65 it's hard to understand what your skill bar should look like and what skills would be easier to reach. I understand it's preference but maybe a video describing your setup would be very helpful.

TeraOnline,3azfsf,darnbito,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"http://pastebin.com/vg6YsJ03  I've been using that guide. So looks like for Slayer you want to go Firetrill Earring/Ring, Deathwise Necklace, and Deathwise Earring/Ring.  Deathwise necklace can be kinda hard to get if you are only a PvE player (it requires PvP credits I believe). So you could probably use a Firesong necklace for a while."
TeraOnline,3azfsf,DantesS_P,2,Wed Jun 24 19:11:14 2015 UTC,Deathwise can be dropped from Alliance Vault/Vault of Allies(5 man)/Ghillieglade and I think I heard Channelworks.  The Deathwise necklace requires 40k Bellecarium credits. Which if you do your Kumas and Corsairs daily can be had in around a week.  4 Days if you are Elite and have the reputation boost.
TeraOnline,3azfsf,random4lyf,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:16:05 2015 UTC,Can get all of those from Ghillanis or w/e the spelling is. It's a random drop but 'cheaper' than spending PvP credits but could be much slower.
TeraOnline,3ayz8e,Thuking,3,Wed Jun 24 17:04:27 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's just random."
TeraOnline,3ayxr7,Spiffymooge,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:53:24 2015 UTC,"That's about right.   Intense or quick for lancer, quick for priest and mystic.   For healer, the less you're animation locked in healing, the less you're vulnerable to getting hit and dying. The less you're animation locked, the more heals/buffs/debuffs you can throw out. The only downside is that the single short iframe that you have gets shorter as well. But the fact that you're not immensely animation locked by everything else outweighs the con."
TeraOnline,3ayxr7,blueteakettle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:10:07 2015 UTC,now that's something i never thought about with +AtkSpd... iframe is shorter.  i wonder if that's an intended mechanic?
TeraOnline,3ayxr7,leeep,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:18:19 2015 UTC,"It is. Almost all skills scale off attack speed, and in 99.9% of cases more attack speed is better up to a threshold. An example I would give is warrior's death from above; when first skilled with level 30 gear, the animation is stupid long, which grants huge iframe uptime. However, DFA also comes with an animation lock on the ground towards the end of the animation, in which a warrior is vulnerable. This vulnerability poses as a serious liability to the warrior's survivability; all that really matters is the initial iframe that allows you to skillfully dodge the intended attack, rather than shooting in the dark as to when the attack shoud be dodged and hoping that the length of the iframe saves your ass. The one class I know that suffers is mystics with tp jaunt and dodging perimos red lasers in SCHM, but tp jaunt is a nasty skill to time with in the first place.   Tl;dr: Yes, it is part of the game."
TeraOnline,3ayxr7,Chiral_Systems,0,Thu Jun 25 00:57:27 2015 UTC,"My knowledge goes only so far to answer your last question.  That being said, Quick weapons are definitely viable for healer classes.  Quick weapons for healers give attack speed, so your animations are faster.  Keen isn't that bad either.  The last keen healer weapon I saw in this game was during the Wounded World update though.  This was posted a few days ago.  It was a discussion over the types of weapons other lancers use.  From what I see, it's based on your playstyle and ping."

TeraOnline,3axdbn,random4lyf,2,Wed Jun 24 07:28:56 2015 UTC,Itd be a lot more fun if you could queue up as a party instead of having to synchronize up your queues and still potentially not getting in.  Its a BG about team work that you can only soloQ. Therein lies the problem
TeraOnline,3axdbn,PlasticSammich,3,Wed Jun 24 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"When I first started Tera, I thought Kumasylum was just some temporary event battleground. I've played many MMOs and across all of them it is the worst battleground I have encountered. There is no actual PvP in it and the whole concept of literally stealing candy from big fat babies is not fun, let alone passable as a permanent battleground. I have often wondered how the idea for the battleground managed to seem appealing to the developers and actually get implemented.  Kumasylum is utterly retarded. Thankfully we are getting a new one come July so that I won't have to subject myself to the dick cancer that is kumas in order to farm pvp gear."

TeraOnline,3axdbn,N0rthWind,5,Wed Jun 24 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"It's more about strategy and teamwork than actual pvp, but fuck that. As the infiltrator team it's cool when the leader is smart and you can get a clean win but otherwise you just get beaten up by babies for 15 minutes. On the defending side: I didn't make cute girls and hardened badass characters so I could hit level cap and finally be a giant rippling pink baby with 6 skills.  It's only an incoherent shitfest like 75% of the time but I just can't take it seriously."

You're asking for an entire guide's worth of information.  Also get to 65. Not having all your skills/glyphs makes it basically a different class.
TeraOnline,3axr86,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:33:53 2015 UTC,basically this. I also like to spam volley of curses as much as i can on people. if they don't have any way to cleanse it they will tick to death even if they get away usually. level 65 and having all of your spells and glyphs makes mystic a way better class. the -3% endurance debuff glyph on volley of curses is good for seiging gates in cs as well.  Healing is priority though.  If you have a friend you can coordinate with on skype or whatever (like a sorc for example) you can catch people out and sleep them so your sorc friend can get back crits on their fireball since it has a long cast time. they are so much fun with friends.

TeraOnline,3axr86,SourDinkleberry,2,Wed Jun 24 10:20:26 2015 UTC,"Very good question.   Upon slight inspection of the provided links, you'll notice this in the very first result.   ""This guide is currently being updated for the Fate of Arun expansion (Feb 24, 2015)""  Speaking as a berserker, the vast majority of the guides that are available are around 2 years old but apply currently just as well as they did previously. Nothing essential about the combat system has changed, nor has anything changed about the basic concept of the class. Slight damage modifications and additional spells may add some aspects to playing a class, but the overall experience will remain the same (as this is an MMO). If a complete overhaul of a class occurs whereby an update is required on play style, You'll notice new guides will come out to compensate."

Edit: The news article states:    New recruit accounts must be separate En Masse account created on June 22 or later.   So there is a good chance that applying codes to existing accounts will not the host account with the rewards.

TeraOnline,3axik7,Goldrush453,3,Wed Jun 24 08:11:05 2015 UTC,"just learned the requirement for diamond will be raised   I don't remember this in any patchnotes?  AFAIK the requirement won't change, it'll still be 80% achievements, except they remove ""old"" achievements (eg dreadspire) and introduce new ones for new dungeons."
TeraOnline,3axik7,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:57:18 2015 UTC,"Well exactly. Some of the current dungeon achievements will be moved to ""special"" since they will be removed (RE and dreadspire) and thus wont count towards your laurel anymore, and if you  barely have enough for diamond, you might lose it."
TeraOnline,3axik7,iWreckYouz,4,Wed Jun 24 09:23:13 2015 UTC,"Which isn't what I'm asking about.   I'm asking about the part where he mentions that ""the requirement for diamond will be raised"".  Replacing old achieves with new ones isn't raising the requirement."
TeraOnline,3axik7,ChildrensPlayground,2,Wed Jun 24 09:39:35 2015 UTC,"OP just didn't choose the best wording; it's no big deal.  What (s)he means by the requirement being ""raised"" is that the invalidation of achievements that presently count will cause players to lose points and possibly the laurel, requiring more achievements earned to regain it.  You're right that the requirements aren't being raised, but they are being shifted such that some players will need to earn more achievements to reclaim their laurel. This has the same net effect to the player as a simple increase in the requirements would have, all other things remaining equal."
TeraOnline,3axik7,Narissis,-2,Wed Jun 24 19:20:51 2015 UTC,"Achievements in the ""special"" category do not count towards the achievement points required for laurels. When achievements are moved to this category, you are effectively losing the points they gave you in regards to laurels.  Additionally, the amount of points required for each laurel is not fixed. They're a percentage of the maximum obtainable achievement points (excluding the special category). More achievements means the same laurels will require a higher score to obtain. This, in conjunction with the aforementioned loss of achievement points will result in some people losing their laurels and having to earn more achievements to obtain them again."
TeraOnline,3axik7,3rdVisage,4,Wed Jun 24 10:09:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what I'm asking about.    just learned the requirement for diamond will be raised   I am asking for the requirement. That is all. Is it still going to be 80% completion (as it is now) or will it be higher (as implied by the OP)?  I know points will be lost as they move to legacy. But that does not change the actual requirement for diamond, which is 80%."
TeraOnline,3axik7,ChildrensPlayground,2,Wed Jun 24 10:25:30 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you're confused about this. The point value of 80% will be higher.  If the maximum amount of points is 10,000 and additional achievements are added making the maximum amount of points 11,000, then the requirements for diamond have indeed been raised.  You don't gain achievement points in percentages. You gain static points.   But that does not change the actual requirement for diamond   Yes, it does, as the number of points 80% represents has changed."
TeraOnline,3axik7,LuxuryScience,0,Wed Jun 24 14:20:34 2015 UTC,"Because it will NOT necessarily be higher.  Lets take your example of 10,000 points. 80% is 8,000.   Lets say they take out w/e achievements and drop them in legacy. Lets say its -1000 points for simplicity.  Lets say they only add back in +500 from new dungeons.  The final total count is 9,500. 80% is 7600. The requirement has actually LOWERED.   In fact, if we took this to the extreme, we could take an example where the player has 7999 points (gold), but has NOT done any of the achieves which have been removed. For this player, he will NOT lose any points and actually get bumped up to diamond for free.  Therefore, the number of points is not an actual measure of ""requirement for diamond"". The 80% is.  The requirement for diamond is 80% and that is it. 80% is what truly reflects a diamond laurel, not the overall points."
TeraOnline,3axik7,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"""Let's assume up is down and down is up""  They're adding more than they're removing. The point value requirement is going up. Therefore, the requirement is going up.  That simple."
TeraOnline,3axik7,LuxuryScience,3,Wed Jun 24 14:57:40 2015 UTC,better to have diamond'd and lost than to never diamond'd at all.
TeraOnline,3axik7,jetah,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:18:53 2015 UTC,"Achievements are moved all the time, doesn't raise any req."
TeraOnline,3axik7,Kaspanova,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:48:33 2015 UTC,So achievements that have been moved to the special category also remove it from your score? How are you supposed to have completed 1500 quests then without nexus? Do normal repeatable quests count?  How are people getting to champion laurels then?
TeraOnline,3axik7,VerticalRadius,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:15:17 2015 UTC,"The moved achievements are removed from your score, but they are also completely ignored for laurel calculations. As in, you only need to get 80% of the non-special category achieves to get a diamond. You don't need 80% of ALL achieves.  You can complete 1500 quests by doing yellow quests. I don't remember if it counts repeatables, but you could go test it.  You get champion by doing 95% of relevant achieves."
TeraOnline,3axik7,ChildrensPlayground,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:41:30 2015 UTC,"Well, upon the reflections made in this thread I went and looked again at the message regarding laurel changes. ""Seasonal Adjustments may earn you different laurels for the same activities"" would imply that the current achievements are what are modified, not the requirement. As most of my achievements are world bosses (and not a single DS achievement) i'll probably end up keeping my diamond laurel with each patch as long as i earn a few more achievements each patch. Thus eliminating the loss of Diamond. That's a huge relief!"

TeraOnline,3aya74,ChildrensPlayground,9,Wed Jun 24 15:41:23 2015 UTC,"about $1,172.90 per ounce  source  30-40M is still a ridiculous amount of money today."

TeraOnline,3aya74,Dreamin-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:31:41 2015 UTC,"Didn't gold used to work differently? Not sure when it was changed but I'm pretty sure at launch it was just measured in gold, no silver or copper. So if it changed after OP quit, then 40,000,000 gold would be 4,000 gold 00 silver 00 copper? (that sound like too little for endgame though, either there was huge inflation or they converted it differently)"
TeraOnline,3aya74,Kitsune241,2,Wed Jun 24 14:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it was changed long before MCHM. Like, during beta or something.  But at the same time, 4k is measly. 1 gear drop from MCHM would've been over 10x that at the very minimum (before splitting between the party)."
TeraOnline,3aya74,ChildrensPlayground,2,Wed Jun 24 14:45:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, I wasn't sure when that changed, so I'm just as confused as everyone else at the 40 million gold."

TeraOnline,3axb9x,iLoveKuchen,-1,Wed Jun 24 07:42:36 2015 UTC,"Fraya is not dead at all.  Grinding for months is a huge overstatement unless you mean +15. Gene costs ~ 100k on Fraya (I got vm4 gloves & weap for my gunner this week), you can make 30K per day selling MWA, MES and SB, so if you do all runs generally it takes less than a week to get enough money to craft the best gear in the game, im kinda peeved that its so easy now because it cost 400k for my warrior.

TeraOnline,3awkw8,random4lyf,2,Wed Jun 24 07:41:19 2015 UTC,"Actually it will be fixed with the July patch. Quoting Yosha from here and here:   The gunner patch has screwed up certain skills that doesn't land back crits like they used to do. Back crits on these selected skills are determined by the location of the skill, not the direction you are looking towards your target(s). This was later fixed stated from the KTERA 2-12-15 patch notes.   I’ve got a good understanding on which class changes are coming when it arrives on our version. Treeshark has given us the scoop that the Dressing Room (aka Style Shop) will be included in our July patch so that means we are catching up to the 3-5-15 build from KTERA. Perhaps we’ll get the crusade rewards but we’ll see.   And yes, our patch will be including the back-crit fix where skills like Rain of Arrows and Hailstorm will be functioning the way it was. I’m certain EME patch notes may not state this, but take my word for it."

TeraOnline,3ax4ns,Bigrook13,2,Wed Jun 24 14:26:29 2015 UTC,"Besides the obvious healing/cleansing/surviving, you should be trying to keep Energy Stars up at all times, use Mana Charge off cooldown (unless everyone has 80%+ mana), and keep Triple Nemesis debuff up at all times. Restorative Burst is a great skill to keep people topped off while also providing them with extra mana if glyphed and Healing Immersion and Healing Circle are good for healing for large amounts when necessary. Focus Heal isn't really used too often for me, but it has its uses as medium heal; just be careful of the animation lock it has.  As for the don'ts, there's not too much you shouldn't be doing other than not using Divine Intervention unless it's necessary, as it can bother your party members by interrupting their rotations and positioning."
TeraOnline,3ax4ns,fluffy-tails,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:33:49 2015 UTC,"There are quite some good guides on Priest, you can spend time on reading them for details. But, I think the most important things for Priest/Mystic players are to keep your tank health bar full at all time and dispel debuffs (Purifying Circle/Arun's Cleansing). Dispel is highly  important: if you let your tank get stunned for a couple of seconds, he/she won't be able to keep up aggro and this could lead to a fail.  You can clearly see the difference between a good Healers and the bad one by the way they using dispel (healing is fairly easy)."
TeraOnline,3ax4ns,usagi2607,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:17:49 2015 UTC,Take priority to heal/resurrect the tank. DPS has the lowest priority for every endgame dungeon except for the second boss of sky cruiser.
TeraOnline,3ax4ns,kumo_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:32:42 2015 UTC,"Priority #1: Keep yourself alive. Priority #2: Keep the tank alive. Priority #3: Remove debuffs from tank. Priority #4: Keep DPS alive. Priority #5: Remove debuffs from DPS. Priority #6: Refresh Energy Stars and (glyphed) Triple Nemesis debuff on boss. Priority #7: Drop puddles (ideally glyphed for +MP). Priority #8: If anyone is low on mana, Mana Charge. Priority #9: ...shoot at things?  There are some glyphs that you simply must have, like Multiplicative Focused Heal for instance, and Enfeebling Triple Nemesis. Also a very good idea to glyph your puddle for +MP, your res for 120 stam (once you get the glyph, probably from spamming Sabex/MC at 65), and both glyphs in Energy Stars.  There are others, but I'm sure the guide in the top comment goes into those in great detail.  A personal favourite of mine is Kaia's Shield; I find it sad that some priests don't bother to leverage this skill. Glyph it for CD reduction and Restorative, and it's absolutely phenomenal. Lets you stop damage entirely for a few seconds so you can catch your breath and lay down some quick heals if needed."

U can add 4xRG and the resulting 400vanguard, one more ghili within another 30minutes. There u go, easy like 12-15k gold playing 2h and its getting more the more u play and the more 4xRG u can do on your characters. Farming the HM is another good way but i do not PVE a lot so i cannot tell u how much it nets, shouldnt be less and 300-400k should be cake to anybody commiting to it which means that the omg omg i can never ever +15qq crap should stop :) PS: Doing PVP all day will net 10-15k a day too i guess."

TeraOnline,3ax0ny,UnnecessaryPost,2,Wed Jun 24 04:36:25 2015 UTC,"At endgame warrior is the most survivable class, they can use 6 iframes back to back in addition to having high mobility.   At level 10 there is no way you will get a proper idea of how warrior plays, they get a few important skills at lvl 28 and another gameplay changing skill at lvl 60. Warriors are also very gear dependent, so as you gear up they become less squishy.  It really easy to avoid every attack as a warrior in the endgame instances, so you will only get hit if you are lazy or decide to take a hit to deal more damage.  However I personally found warrior to be unplayable at 250 ms ping when I had some internet issues for a week, mainly because warrior is very dependent on using certain skills after certain other skills for faster animations, at 250 ms, skills like Blade Draw and Rain of Blows, which have significantly faster animations if used correctly, refused to chain properly and I kept on getting stuck in the long animations.  Note that its also possible that I was having packet loss and so it was not really related to ping since I know at least one warrior who even runs SCHM with no issues at 250+ ping.."

Can do all dungeons just fine. Usually top 5 in CS also. Tanking is a hit and miss for me sometimes but otherwise, you can do everything.  The only thing that's impossible with this latency are the combos that weave in abilities between Backstab and Cascade of Stuns. Also stagger locking is harder to pull off."

TeraOnline,3ax0ny,Dreamin-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:45:24 2015 UTC,Is level 28 the level when you can comfortably solo? I found warrior the hardest to solo. I found myself taking to much damage. And having to dodge all the time meant few opportunities to do damage.
TeraOnline,3ax0ny,ZonerRoamer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:05:01 2015 UTC,"Warrior is the fastest class to level up; you dont need to solo anything, just queue as a tank for instances you get IMs in less than 1 sec, generally 2 instance runs = 1 level.  If you wanna pull huge crowds of mobs and kill them then that is not gonna be so easy as a warrior, but if you want to solo bams, its quite easy.  Also use the correct crystals, savage, bitter, pounding & focused and use only the avatar weapon."
TeraOnline,3ax0ny,zeratos,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:06:15 2015 UTC,They're slow if you're DPS and not queuing instances because a lot of the skills that make warriors shine come at later levels.  This is one of the best warriors in the world if you want an idea of how they play out at high levels.
TeraOnline,3ax0ny,megatonfist,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:39:48 2015 UTC,"Every single class in the game is dependent on ping; so generally speaking, the more you have, the less fun you're going to have.

Ability to teleport to camps within your current area without having to visit them first   That's a huge one for convenience and will save a lot of time for sure. I remember riding on a 140 mount (!) to each campsite when I was levelling haha
TeraOnline,3at4jz,zazpi,7,Tue Jun 23 08:37:04 2015 UTC,"At one point they mentioned making monsters in the levelling zones stronger and creating lengthier fights.   I play a priest and often enough i'm solo when doing side quests, I find enemy encounters are long enough, particularly when fighting things bigger than me (Field bosses I think they're called).   So would this change make killing things unbearably lengthy for me?"
TeraOnline,3at4jz,Zachbot20,7,Tue Jun 23 15:08:23 2015 UTC,That's when Story Quests will come into play for healers I think. Partying and running dungeons will also be an option with the ability to queue without a tank in pre-65 instances.  There are always options.

TeraOnline,3at4jz,Genus_Apis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:05:28 2015 UTC,"This is because u are either questing or not doing it right (no charms, crit scroll = half damage).  So you should do dungeons only and get to 65 in about 2d played, which is how long my mystic on EU took with only rarely using double xp. Questing is bad, be it heal or dps it doesnt matter u will take longer if u need to kill yourself but with the avatar OP-crit weapons and crit scrolls its pretty good aoe potential on the priest so u can grind the good spots for better XP too, so grind and do instances thats how u should level up if u care about getting to 65, its doable on one or two weekends."

The only time I've felt in danger of dying is when fighting a mini boss (I don't know of they're called that, it was a basilisk roaming around) and that time I actually did die because it does damage. I want other monsters to be like that, but to a lesser extent obviously. I want to have to dodge all their attacks skillfully or pay the price with some health"

TeraOnline,3at4jz,megafilipe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:48:27 2015 UTC,"i think this is a good change because right now. soloing 5 man dungeons(hard to do for new players,) Grinding Bams or Lots of normal mobs (20+) is the best way to level up. You can get from 1 to 65 in 9 to 10 hours from grinding only not doing a single quest once you off island of dawn. It takes A LOT longer to level to 65 by story story or side quests, so this way they will make it so you can just do the story quest to level to 65  pretty quickly and without having to do any grinding or dungeons."

TeraOnline,3at4jz,hlycia,4,Tue Jun 23 09:09:17 2015 UTC,"This. I love the game and story quests, hate the fact that i have to spend a good 20-30 minutes grinding because I finished one part of the story while a level short of accessing the next quest. Half the time I just quit and procrastinate the grinding for a week. It just feels like a ""filler"" without having much meaning or interaction to the game, so I think it's a smart change. Plus all the lvl 65 stuff, since that's when the ACTUAL game starts the first 64 levels are pretty much just a tutorial and needs to go faster for more players to enjoy the game."

TeraOnline,3at4jz,jetah,0,Tue Jun 23 15:14:34 2015 UTC,I can actually see these changes as being counter productive. I know several casual players who prefer the levelling experience over the endgame experience. Making the levelling process smoother (aka faster) will just hasten casual players through the levelling phase towards the quitting phase (aka the endgame).  Certainly I can see the benefit to a faster levelling experience for the more dedicated player but I think their needs to be a fast lane and a slow lane for levelling so that players who just want to enjoy the world of TERA can do so without being rushed into the endgame .
TeraOnline,3at4jz,Narissis,6,Tue Jun 23 09:19:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly the leveling in this game is by far one of the most boring in current mmos. The quests suck, most enemies are the same, bams are okay but after the first one of a specific type you know exactly what to dodge/avoid for their attacks, dungeons are okayish, and you barely get spells when leveling and without specs everything feels the same soooooooo people get bored insanely fast. Everyone I've known who tried the game got bored to death during leveling and simply quit"
TeraOnline,3at4jz,jetah,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:15:17 2015 UTC,my Mystic and Warrior have to many spells. I hear Priest is worst than both.
TeraOnline,3at4jz,Narissis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:07:30 2015 UTC,"Priest has a ton of abilities, but they're compartmentalized. You've got your attacks, you've got your in-combat buffs, you've got your out-of-combat buffs, you've got your heals and utility.  This makes them manageable, with some effort.  The ones that I've complained about lately are sorc and archer. They have a lot of redundancy in their abilities, and no need to have as many as they do for the single job of ranged DPS. Classes like priest, warrior, mystic, and (soon enough) berseker have a lot of abilities because they have different sets for different roles/tasks. You're not expected to manage them all at once."

TeraOnline,3at4jz,Kali711,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:43:27 2015 UTC,"NP!  To expand a little, what I did with my priest was to put all my pre-combat buffs on a separate bar that I can flip over to for buffing before a fight. It works well enough. All my offensive skills are on the top side of the keyboard on the number keys and E, and my heals and support abilities are on Z, X, C, and my many mouse buttons. Plus a few outliers, like curse and energy starts on some of the number keys, and sleep on.... F1, I think. I'd have to open TERA up and look. :P"

TeraOnline,3at4jz,DdubbleDubs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:56:13 2015 UTC,"I started out with Priest and while it did have a lot of skills, as Narissis said, they are compartmentalized. While I was leveling Warrior I felt overwhelmed by all the skills you keep learning, but when you get a bit used to it and separate them between tanking and dps, it gets much more manageable.   As for Mystic, it actually felt kind of underwhelmed? Like it needs more skills? Lol. A good chunk of them are CC for pvp, so if you aren't into that it reduces the amount of skills considerably. Also, a lot of the really useful ones are after 60 anyway."

I'm not going to go through each enraged/nonenraged/crit attack but here are the 3 main variations:  1) Hand slam > back spin This one can be blocked in disco gear but the second hit will bleed through block for minor damage.  2) Primary aggro hand slam This is the one that you're probably having difficulties with. My disco lancer will get 1 shot if I don't block and will bleed for 80-90k through block with a crit. This attack occurs on whoever has aggro and is usually done at the beginning of an attack chain. (Most notable one being coming out of laser and turning toward whoever has aggro to hand slam). Other cases would be after he finishes targeting a different target with secondary aggro  note* if you're dying to this attack when blocking, i'm going to go ahead and assume that your chest is probably not optimized, i.e. you dont have triple dmg reduction lines (dmg, highest aggro, enraged, or frontal) and/or missing endurance etches/endurance rolls on gloves and boots  3) follow up hand slam If you survived the initial destructive hand slam, chances are there's another one coming your way. This one can be blocked enraged and shouldn't bleed through block. Be advised, after the follow up he will often do move set number 1 (slam>back spin)"

You can q up while ur grinding them which isnt too bad if ur getting a good group and u could get some gear but fire mob are by far the most xp.  38-42 is more tricky, do the storyline at Frontera (rotten core, something like that) its good XP, it will get u to 40 which is when u can start grinding sabertooth and always q up for CR, getting a CR group could be a little faster but do not spend time looking for it.  Priest buffs help to start grinding sabertooth and then devan early, its worth it and always use greater charms and good crit scrolls.  After that its DEVANS as early as you can do and until 58, followed by bear grinding and storyline."

TeraOnline,3atqtn,Heratikus,2,Tue Jun 23 13:11:04 2015 UTC,"I recommend Ornamental Robe since it looks somewhat close to the Dragonwing Robe with the whole ""skimpy flowing robe"" aesthetic, costs the same and has more dyeable sections, though it has clipping issues if your character has long hair. The Conjunct Robe looks exactly the same as Ornamental while costing 100 more coupons, but it uses the upswept hairdo if you're concerned about clipping."
TeraOnline,3atqtn,warriorgriffinheart,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:42:05 2015 UTC,"The problem is that I want the hair let down because my character is a sorcerer and I just think it looks so cool when you're channeling spells and the long hair starts flying up. It's weird, but yeah that's why I like those kinds of outfits. Most of the female castanic outfits have the hair tied up.

TeraOnline,3auddv,Soleria,2,Tue Jun 23 17:18:27 2015 UTC,"The crystals in SC can be interpreted as ""time remaining"". The current design philosophy of instance kill scores is based on how fast you clear, so it would be pretty difficult to integrate the two. Best example I can give would be skipping crystals to down the boss faster. The pain of trying to min/max dps versus crystals remaining is an unnecessary complication of the entire system.   Short answer: Down the boss faster = win."

TeraOnline,3auddv,soundwafflez,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"Although the sarcastic tone is unwarranted, u/soundwafflez does make a valid point. Using a metric such as the # of crystals alive after perimos dies in SC is both counterintuitive and somewhat RNG based. Many experienced groups skip lasers for more back damage uptime (and in turn faster clears and higher scores). By implementing the aforementioned metric into score calculations, these skilled groups would end up receiving much lower scores, which would not accurately reflect their performance. Also, the crystal that peri chooses is random, meaning that two groups with identical DPS/skill could get vastly different scores (ex. Group 1's peri decides to target 1 crystal until it dies; they end up with 5 full/almost full health. Group 2's peri targets each crystal in turn; they end up with all 8 remaining, each at ~ 1/2 health. Group 2 gets a higher score.)  Additional factors (deaths, hard enraging vs not, etc.) affecting score isn't a bad idea though, shame BHS didn't implement them."
TeraOnline,3auddv,NanakoC,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:52:38 2015 UTC,"You're already punished for dying, and rewarded for doing enrage. There's no need to add any bonus.   When you die while speedrunning other games, you don't get penalized for dying, and you don't get time removed for finding a faster route, all the rewards are implicit.   If there were different speedrunning categories, that'd be fine, but as it stands, there's no optional objective in current dungeons such as all collectibles in other games, except for rg."

I'd like to add that until the latest patch Gunner was constantly nerfed on kTera and they still are the best DPS class with Zerks (And yes I am aware of the Reaper, Warrior and Sorc buffs).   So if you want to rock in PvE, its easy. Go with Gunner. Archer is no competition to a Gunner in PvE now and it wont be in the next patch. Right now Archer can compete with Warrior and Reaper but next patch it will be pretty much at the bottom again.  In PvP however after the latest buffs Archer is finally one of the best classes in small and big scale PvP. Gunner is good too but not as strong as an Archer.  Even if most of Reapers skills are aoe it doesnt mean they lack damage on single target."

TeraOnline,3arsht,Splintrr,2,Tue Jun 23 00:23:39 2015 UTC,"Okay, so one of the main things I've noticed is that I don't crit nearly as much as this person. Judging from another one of his videos he has over 200 crit, and I am sitting around just barely above 110 (if my memory serves me right).  I currently have Ambit boots/gloves, Ido chest, and a Disco bow (I got lucky at BRNM). I have 2 deathwise earrings, ido rings, and a firesong necklace.  Am I going to get a huge bonus in crit anytime soon due to natural gear progression or am I just lacking some important piece of equipment that I'm forgetting?"
TeraOnline,3arsht,Xaioli,2,Tue Jun 23 00:34:26 2015 UTC,"Well, keep in mind that the dude in the video has a bulgogi and almost every consumable running.   Your big lack of crit is most likely from your lack of gear. You definitely need at least blue innerwear with a properly rolled 3p/6c or 6c/4c  belt AND brooch.  In addition, you definitely need to replace your rings with at least one deathwise ring/signet for the large crit factor bonus. I suggest you try getting a firetrill earring and band for  a huge power spike and a deathwise ring/signet while keeping one of your current earrings. Additionally, you'll need to farm 40k Bellicarium Credits to get a Deathwise Necklace which will also drastically increase your crit rate (you want a crit or crit dmg roll on neck, I prefer crit).   Asides from all that, just make sure your bow and gloves are properly rolled/etched. Since you have a Disco bow, you want flat dmg, back dmg and enrage dmg (don't roll for crit) but definitely put a Keen/Carving etching on it. For gloves, you want power, attackspeed and +9 crit with again, another Keen/Carving etching. Note: you might want to hold off on perf rolling/etching your gloves til' you can get a disco glove.   Once you achieve the above, you'll notice that your crit will definitely be a lot higher. Your crit rate should something like this - a bit more or less depending on what bow/how much you spent on innerwear, accessories etc."

I'm using renegade gloves which also have an energetic roll instead of carving and my deathwise is also short a crit roll so that's probably why I'm a bit short on crit. Also, I could replace my empowered brooch for a cleansing/quickcarve but at that point, there's such a thing as too much crit.   Regardless, the cool thing about archer in its current state is that it can clear schm ezpz whether you're in pvp or pve gear."

TeraOnline,3arsht,PewpewpewpewpewExe,4,Wed Jun 24 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"You won't be getting a huge increase In crit just by getting better gear. My main points would be to go for death wise rings/signet since you get a minimum of 12/16 crit per ring.  Also  guessing you aren't using permanent keen etchings. Lvl 2 keen etchings give 12 critical and can be used on your weapon and gloves, that's another 24. I would do some pvp content to get 40k credits to buy the death wise necklace, that's another 10-14 critical when rolled correctly. Having disco/rengade/generation belt can give you another 6-10 when rolled correctly. And lastly critical innerwear. The rare ones give 12 critical and they have dropped in price a lot.  Sorry for the wall of text, those are just some of the things I though of, let me know if you have any questions"

TeraOnline,3apgb6,eynonpower,20,Mon Jun 22 13:00:09 2015 UTC,"There's a stigma against sorc/archer, I wouldn't say they're underpowered, more like their 'power' to 'skill required' ratio is lower than other classes. (I'd consider 'underpowered' as a class with a lower power cap)  Plus for a game with 'true action combat' a lot of people just find it more fun to get up in the fight with melee characters."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,Kitsune241,17,Mon Jun 22 13:06:52 2015 UTC,"I'll also say, as a Sorc, you rely an awful lot on the tank/other dps characters not completely fucking you over. If the target runs out of your big, long cast spells because the rest of the party needs ADD medication you end up with like 0dps and are sad. Sure, by watching the boss patterns and stuff you can usually time stuff but you're still doing significantly less damage than you could be.  Conversely, if your first two spells crit on a boss you'd better be prepared to run around in fear for 30 seconds while the tank (who was not expecting this level of aggro draw) tries desperately to get its attention.  Compare to certain other classes where you can just spaz out for free deepz and it's easy to see why people don't pick sorcs, regardless of anything else.  (Warning: opinions are not of a 65 Sorc player.)"
TeraOnline,3apgb6,WinterAyars,3,Mon Jun 22 16:22:58 2015 UTC,"rest of the party needs ADD medication   I sir would give you gold if possible, Major issue I have with dps, they get all horny and adhd like jumping around and running away from me as a priest when they need heals!!!"
TeraOnline,3apgb6,ifancy,3,Mon Jun 22 17:05:16 2015 UTC,"I find the mouse/keyboard troubling (coming from WOW, everything's backward).  I'm getting used to it, but it's easier to play an archer or gunner for a noob like me"
TeraOnline,3apgb6,wetsneakers,2,Mon Jun 22 15:16:36 2015 UTC,what do you mean by a lower power to skill required ratio?
TeraOnline,3apgb6,r1bsteak,2,Tue Jun 23 03:48:49 2015 UTC,"I covered that farther down the comment chain, but basically you need more knowledge of rotations and to pay more attention to positioning in order to output the same dps as a melee dps. They can get up to around the same damage as other classes, but it's going to require more work on your part."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,Kitsune241,5,Tue Jun 23 03:57:52 2015 UTC,so basically it's a class that's gonna require a lot more skill to master compared to other classes?
TeraOnline,3apgb6,r1bsteak,2,Tue Jun 23 04:16:49 2015 UTC,"yes but you get the same result as any other class, why put in so much effort when you can just play something like a reaper or slayer or gunner and end up with better results with less effort.  also a huge problem with sorc is that they play really weird, Tera ""sorcerer/mage"" type class plays extremely different to any other mmo or any other game in general, this probably turns off players before even trying them. they also have a lot of skills that feel so unsatisfying to use, it just seems like a out-dated class compared to all the others.  also long charge skills feel really bad to use in tera for both archers/sorc, it's probably why they didn't add any to the reaper class and only 1 short one onto the gunner class."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,fubgun,2,Tue Jun 23 11:46:24 2015 UTC,"yeah, i agree with that. I recently just startred the gunner class and it's way easier to play like 10x easier, monsters and BAMs are so much easier to kill, i die less often and i finish quests really quickly. with sorcerer i often die when fighting BAMs so quests take awhile :/"
TeraOnline,3apgb6,r1bsteak,0,Tue Jun 23 13:34:42 2015 UTC,"and also, could you explain to me what you mean by ""rotations""?"
TeraOnline,3apgb6,r1bsteak,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:18:44 2015 UTC,I actually always prefer to have a sorc/arch in my party especially in SCNM/SCHM they clean up the mobs real well. They have an easier time battling Darkan as well.
TeraOnline,3apgb6,Soleria,0,Mon Jun 22 13:18:08 2015 UTC,"So if i'm understanding you correctly, they're ok, just don't need a lot of skill to play them?  Other classes can produce more dps, but if they're ""skilled?""  Meanwhile archer and sorc are face mashers?"
TeraOnline,3apgb6,acematador777,19,Mon Jun 22 13:24:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's actually the opposite...Gunner is the most face roll dps in the game, then slayer and zerker aren't too hard. I don't know archer too well but i'd place sorc/warrior at the top of most difficulty required. A typical sorc rotation looks like this:   Burst of Celerity Nova Overchannel Fireblast Arcane Pulse  Void Pulse Ice Needle Magma Bomb Flaming Barrage Mana Infusion Flaming Barrage  Nova Overchannel Fireblast Hailstorm Arcane Pulse  Void Pulse Ice Needle Magma Bomb Flaming Barrage Mana Siphon <repeat from beginning>"
TeraOnline,3apgb6,InRustITrust,4,Mon Jun 22 13:28:17 2015 UTC,"The Archer is similarly complicated.  You're squishy, you're at melee range half the time and at range the other half due to how the two biggest damage abilities (Rain of Arrows and Explosion Trap) function.  You've only got one iframe.  Unlike the gunner, you can't DPS on the move, and some of your abilities have really long animations, so you're glued to the ground until they're done with.  Thus, due to the squishiness, you can pop pretty fast if you RoA at the wrong time and there isn't a damned thing you can do about it once you've started.  It's a constant dance of motion and forcing as many abilities out of the character as humanly possible just to maintain good DPS.  Not stellar DPS, just good.  You can keep up with the mid-tier DPS but you've got to work hard for it and that's just too much for most players."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,Goorman,5,Mon Jun 22 21:20:31 2015 UTC,"Zerker is easy in that you only really use 3 or 4 abilities to deal your damage, but the skill comes in avoiding damage without wasting your 15s CD evasive roll and still dpsing or charging constantly, as well as making sure you're staying behind the boss with your limited mobility.  I'd say Zerker is actually one of the hardest classes to position on and that it matters the most considering one attack missing bonus back damage is a lot of missed damage, but their rotation is pretty straightforward, while other classes have an easier time positioning and longer rotations that have more variations then just Cyclone -> Raze -> Thunderstrike repeat with the occasional Vampiric strike when it's off CD."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,_iBryan,-5,Mon Jun 22 18:25:59 2015 UTC,"As soon as I didn't see Mana Infusion and the beggining, I knew you don't even main Sorc. Get outta here."

TeraOnline,3apgb6,Acerolion,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:30:36 2015 UTC,I think a sorc rotation starts with Celerity > Arcane Pulse into ground > Overchannel? Followed by Void Pulse or Fireblast.  But then again I'm not a 65 sorc.
TeraOnline,3apgb6,cloudy_rendezvous,3,Tue Jun 23 01:07:43 2015 UTC,Nope. What acematador posted is a very standard rotation setup for Sorc since the introduction of 65.
TeraOnline,3apgb6,random4lyf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:18:36 2015 UTC,Mana infusion is used as a filler in between Rotations when waiting for key skills to come off cooldown.  Please. Enlighten us if I am wrong and the person you commented to is as well.
TeraOnline,3apgb6,uui23,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:41:18 2015 UTC,"uhh, you guys didnt' see the mana infusion in the rotation? And that is pretty much the rotation you're gonna use if you want 2+2 nova+fireblast combos under celerity. Also mana infusion is generally done under celerity since it is really slow byitself.  oh and another point to actually do that rotation sorc also need melee nostrums since nova is considered a melee skill."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,cloudy_rendezvous,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:38:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a wise choice, mostly because if you need to dodge, you'd cancel your stupidly-long cast time of Infusion and would have to do it again.   Of course you can/should always use Infusion before the fight, but aside from that, it shouldn't be casted with Celerity off. I'd much rather use Arcane -> VP, Flaming Barrage, or Siphon off Celerity than a Mana Infusion."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,_iBryan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:21:57 2015 UTC,"Mana Infusion isn't a filler since the animation is too long, is better to use it at the start and end when your Burst is about to go on cooldown. You can fill in with any of the other 123456 skills you have or just get some magmaa bomb resets. I could tell you a rotation but you know, lazy."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,szemere,-2,Tue Jun 23 04:31:26 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it doesn't have a rotation, so it obviously looks overcomplicated like this.  Sorc has an ability priority to press, with very little procs/buff/combos that impact that, so it's basically after every ability you pressed, you just look at your priority list (which is a long one, can't deny that), and press the most important button.  If you could get one really long actionbar and still have a good overview on it, you would probably do decent DPS if you just placed the abilities in order, and always pressed the leftmost button that is available.  (I know that is oversimplifying it, but listing something like you did there just makes very little sense. in MMOs you either have a rotation or a priority based DPS spec, and Tera's Sorc is obviously the latter)"
TeraOnline,3apgb6,cloudy_rendezvous,2,Tue Jun 23 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"That's not true.   Sorc are the most rotation oriented class. There's a specific reason for nearly every step in every reasonable rotation, and there's hardly ever a reason why you should do one step before the other. (You can't have Nova/Arcane Pulse on cd if you want to get the most out of Fireblast/VP, you can't throw out Hailstorm immediately otherwise you can't take advantage of Overchannel, there's no reason to immediately start out with Ice Needle/Magma Bomb, etc.)   The only ""priorities"" involved are dealing as much DPS as possible (hence why Fireblast and VP combos go first) and recharging mana.  Sorc rotations are a little flexible, and Sorc players do have to adjust their rotation in the event of a boss moving or having to dodge, etc. but that doesn't suddenly make it a priority based class like Mystic. A Sorc won't suddenly say ""I need to do something different now"" and drop their optimal DPS rotation because, at that point, they must have already fucked up and lost a lot of DPS."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,Kitsune241,7,Tue Jun 23 16:58:22 2015 UTC,"Other way around, lower ratio means you need higher skill required in order to get higher power.  I.E. To get 1 power, Zerk puts in 1 skill (1/1). To get 1 power, Archer puts in 2 skill (1/2)."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,omfgkevin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:36:32 2015 UTC,"Personally when I tried Archer I didn't like how it felt. You kind of stop and fire, and I didn't really enjoy it much. Gunner on the other hand was so much fun (even though it was op, I liked the skills and the feel of the weapon). Same thing makes me enjoy lancer too (reminiscent of MH lance)"
TeraOnline,3apgb6,Penetrat0r1,7,Mon Jun 22 22:19:05 2015 UTC,Bad reputation  Also both still need some PvE buffs.
TeraOnline,3apgb6,acematador777,7,Mon Jun 22 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"Underpowered mainly but it doesn't mean they're  not fun. Sorc is a really late bloomer, your dps doesn't really come online until 48, while Archer has been at the bottom of the dps charts forever. It's not like you're going to get kicked for being a archer though especially if you play it well. You just get to put in half the effort as a gunner plus gunners are semi-new so everyone's playing them. Sorc and Archers are receiving buffs in the patches that are coming."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,acematador777,5,Mon Jun 22 13:09:01 2015 UTC,"Hm, maybe i'll just play an archer anyway.  See if it gets patched and go from there."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,Soleria,8,Mon Jun 22 13:25:25 2015 UTC,"I'd just do that. Play what's fun and enjoyable for you, you'll still put out a lot of good damage as a archer."

TeraOnline,3apgb6,WhyReaperWhy,2,Mon Jun 22 16:27:23 2015 UTC,"As a pretty decent gunner I'm kind of excited for a patch, because with a good rotation I'm stealing aggro with eclipse on SC with an idoneal weapon."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,SorcsDoNoDamage,2,Mon Jun 22 17:24:49 2015 UTC,Good rotation? I don't think double arcane barrage is a rotation.

TeraOnline,3apgb6,random4lyf,2,Mon Jun 22 22:42:16 2015 UTC,yeah it's just the knockdown/hit when he comes down from the sky. work it into your dps rotation every 24-30 sec (forget the CD). It's a DPS increase to use him like that on CD. The short range is pretty tricky but usually not a problem on bosses' giant hit boxes.  I would be scared if you could boost AB+HB damage even more.

TeraOnline,3apgb6,MrSnowShow,3,Mon Jun 22 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah hard to make direct comparison to classes because of the differences in skills, base crit/power/speed, utility tool kit, ""range"" vs melee, armor types, etc.   It's also hard seeing when other classes get buffed but yours seemingly gets ignored.

Sorc is VERY slow since a lot of the abilities have a long wind up, but they hit hard. Archer, however, is SO much fun to play with. It's a constant stutter step as I solo dungeons (not the 65 ones, those are a pain even in a group). The constant dodging and running around is a blast and being able to charge certain attacks while moving but most stopping you leads to this sort of dodge-dodge-dodge-SLAM THEM-dodge-dodge-dodge play style that I just cannot get enough of. I often find myself in close to the enemy to drop traps or use melee abilities on the enemies.  I've had friends offer me help seeing me die a lot but learning enemy patterns and openings and how I can use them is something I wouldn't trade for the world. That said, I'm a HUGE dark souls dex build player too, so that may be why..."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,thisissteve,2,Mon Jun 22 16:46:36 2015 UTC,I'm a HUGE dark souls dex build player   That explains your tolerance for repeated deaths. :P

Eventually, I gave in and ran it with a party and since have gone back to soloing it. It's hard, but having seen the bosses before now and learning a bit of how they work, it's doable, especially with my 65 gear. Before, I would die in 2 hits from the boss, as a single hit dropped me to some 4th of my health. Now I can actually take a couple hits and deal a decent amount of damage."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,ChaoticPenor,4,Mon Jun 22 22:32:44 2015 UTC,"Right now it's all about gunners in terms of ranged dps. It's funny you made this topic because when I think about it now, I can't recall having a sorc in a party for end game dungeons in a long time. Since the gunner patch at least. I'm even having trouble selling an intense sorc disco weapon.   And like others mentioned, to play the sorc right you need to execute a rotation of skills. In my opinion, I find sorcs to be ping reliant. My ping's around 100-110 and I still had trouble pulling off a rotation, especially when it calls for canceling certain skills. Sometimes it just doesn't cancel and so you're wasting seconds during celerity."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,thisissteve,3,Mon Jun 22 15:18:03 2015 UTC,Archers are the most ping reliant in the game. Most archers have to forego using skills that in ktera everyone uses and considers a dps increase because we don't have 20 ping like them. I'm not playing my archer until they make the dps output of my skills not ping reliant.

There is a lot of variables that could really ruin the testing and the sample size is really low, so take it with a grain of salt. Rng and skill are probably the biggest two issues.   It appears that archers are not significantly worse off, but they were buffed in this testing."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,evolutionvi,3,Mon Jun 22 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"I've been playing sorc since the free to play patch. I think Winter of 2012? Back in the days of VM 1. The thing about sorc I like is that you go super saiyan during Burst of Celerity. You have that one skill that lets you go crazy for a bit. Honestly, I feel their biggest drawback in PvE is mana issues. I remember having to use mana draughts and infusions while using mana siphon and mana infusion, and still being out of mana. I think after this buff with the mana reductions and Buffs to mana abilities/glyphs I think their PvE will be better. That said, their super saiyan mode has drawbacks, that high attack speed increase means you have so many abilities to use in a short time window. And when bosses move around all over the place (looking at fishy) it's kinda annoying because you might waste that precious CD.   Now for PvP. Sorcs are NOT underpowered in PvP. Their CC is insane and their combos are fucking legit. With the coming buffs I feel they will be top 2 for DPS. However, I always had troubles 1v1 vs defense warrior. Too much stagger/stun vs cloth class."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,hlycia,3,Mon Jun 22 18:58:18 2015 UTC,"Back when the game launched there was a consensus that sorcerers were the worst DPS. I didn't play long after launch - I just came back for the gunner/steam launch. I've been playing classes to 50+ to get a feel for the play sytles/learn to pvp better by knowing all the classes moves. I was still reading that sorcerer was under performing so I was reluctant to try them.   I just made one over the weekend, after trying a handful of other class to around 45-58, and she's around 42 now. I've been having a really good time with her. Last night I was in another room equipping/enchanting my 38 Avatar weapon and the tank and other DPS had round up a room full of trash. They were having a hard time DPSing it all down (don't think they had all their avatar weapons yet)... looked like they were struggling barely brining any of the mobs below 90% health - but the tank was keeping them in nice tight ball. I walk over and with 1 fireblast destroy 15+ pretty high-health dungeon mobs in one shot. Such a satisfying feeling to see a big AoE explosion like that.   Leveling the sorcerer up I've been top agro in groups with no tank and usually end up taking agro from all the tanks I've been grouped with (not on purpose - I'd have prefered to have their backs). I know this is just all anecdotal but I feel strong playing this class at least - I don't see why they're considered the crappiest DPS.   That being said...  I know 65+ the game is probably a lot different. Classes that only have to use a handful of abilities in their rotation, like gunner, will probably have a much easier time maintaining DPS. Sorcerer seems like it has a lot more abilities to work into their rotation to maximize their damage. You also have to make decisions how best to apply your damage - a gunner for example just needs to know basically use AB on CD and use fillers between and they'll have top DPS - a sorcerer has to decide which abilities/rotation fits as the encounter changes - there's no ""one size fits all"" move like AB."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,sebastiansly,2,Mon Jun 22 15:41:14 2015 UTC,"I've wondered this as well, I have run with mostly gunners which isn't too bad since a triple gunner dps group tends to annihilate things with my stacked endurance debuffs.   The few times I've run with sorcs and archers there's ALWAYS been a gunner in group that gives them almost zero dps time on trash and sometimes they can't even get off a full rotation on a boss.  As far as threat goes my opening rotation usually gets and keeps a boss in my face, gotta love dash > bd > tob > bc as an opener."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,hlycia,2,Mon Jun 22 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"My very anecdotal evidence in the battleground dungeon, an Archer always ranked at the top. Some dude was 13 kills 0 deaths. Pretty amazing. pew pew pew!"
TeraOnline,3apgb6,sebastiansly,2,Mon Jun 22 17:55:24 2015 UTC,"I used to love sorcerer, it was my first character and I mained it for nearly a year however as I've played other characters and, especially since the gunner came out I now view sorcerer has having some serious issues in PvE.  Sorcerer used to be a great DPS class being able to do almost as much damage as a Zerker but since the FoA patch they have fallen away.  Sorcerer is a tricky class to play but it's more than that, if you had two classes with equal DPS output but differing levels of difficult but played by good players most of the time they'd do equally well but in a tricky situation the trickier class to play would inevitably fall away compared to the easier as the players were pushed to their limits at different rates. Having said that Warrior is also a tricky class to master but it is also a highly agile class and so, in TERA terms, can get out of tricky situations more easily.  Even though sorcerer is getting buffed soon I don't feel that it will ever compete in general terms with other DPS classes, although I think it will be powerful as a niche class. The reason for this is mobility. All the majors DPS classes in TERA are highly mobile:   Warriors float like a butteflu and sting like a bee Slayers aren't as fast as Warriors but are still agile Reapers zip all over the place Gunners have a slow base combat movement speed their skills are quick to use, have variable range and can even score back hits when in front of a target. Even Zerkers can move while charging their main DD skills   However a lot of Sorcerer skills have long cast times, fixed ranges, and/or root the sorcerer to the spot while they cast their spells. This  limits the effectiveness of sorcerers to the ability of tanks to control agile monsters.  I don't do PvP so I don't know what Sorcerers are like in PvP (although I've heard they can be be really good) but since the Gunner Gunner has been everything I'd hoped sorcerer would be with the added bonus of having metal armour (and the gun is a bit annoying).  If you want a ranged DPS class to play you should look at Gunner, even after hte upcoming nerfs they'll still be a highly effective and dynamic ranged class, easily having the longest reach in the game."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,hlycia,2,Mon Jun 22 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"I'm just wondering if you read the upcoming patch notes? A few of the animation locks are being removed, jaunt and backstep no longer share a cool down (more iframe mobility), many ability coefficients/cast times are being improved, etc. Sounds like a lot of your criticisms of the class are being addressed next month(?)."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,Kanekis_bitch,2,Mon Jun 22 19:35:57 2015 UTC,"I have but I was thinking about the cast time of Fireblast mainly. I realise that the buffs will make a big difference to sorcerers and also that Gunners are getting nerfed but I still think gunner will outrank sorcerer for PvE by a significant margin.  Edit: PS. It won't stop me from trying Sorcerer again, I'm just not optimistic."
TeraOnline,3apgb6,grumpywumps,2,Mon Jun 22 23:02:36 2015 UTC,yeah a change from 17%-25% faster cast may make it slightly better feeling/worth taking as a glyph now?   I just started liking sorc so I'm trying to be overly optimistic i think. between the two of us it'll balance out.
TeraOnline,3apgb6,gENTlebrony,2,Mon Jun 22 23:28:43 2015 UTC,"The upcoming changes will make Sorcerer almost a new class. The glyph choices will be different as glyph points will go further and certain glyphs will be better value. Some of the skill changes might mean that skills that were once deemed trash/filler skills now have meaning, and changes to cast times (as you mentioned) could mean completely new skill rotations.  However the big question remains for me, what can a Sorcerer contribute, overall, that a Gunner can't?   Sorcerer will still have fixed range skills that centre around the 10m mark (out to about 15m) plus skills for dealing damage when getting in close (Nova) while Gunners have variable range skills that work equally well at any distance up to 20m for many skills and up to 30m for Mana Missile. So while sorcerers need to manage distance to target and adapt skill rotations to match their current popsitions Gunners can pretty much use their optimal skill rotations constantly. Several sorcerer skills will still have a noticeable cast time that will require them to be stationary while nearly all gunner skills can be used on the run (Mana Missiles & Balder's Vengeance are the only stand still skills? Bombardment only roots you to the ground once you trigger it after aiming). Speed plus variable range still likely mean that Gunners will hit an agile target more often than Sorcerers. Sorcerers have cloth gear while Gunners have metal gear, a bot that heals them and an iframe that can also relocate them to a safe place. Also Sorcerer iframes either don't move the sorcerer or move them backwards/forwards, depending on which one you use while Gunners have a directional iframe similar to melee classes.   The only thing left is DPS output. After the Gunner nerfs and Sorcerer buffs will a Sorcerer's DPS output compensate? From what I've read about the state of DPS classes in KTERA Gunner is still top-tier DPS while Sorcerer is 2nd tier so it seems not.  Sorcerers still have superior CC skills but I think sorcerers would need something massive here to give them balance with other DPS classes. Something like making Hail Storm and Ice Needle movement debuffs override endgame bosses' movement debuff immunity. People would want sorcerers in their parties if they could slow down boss mechanics by delaying their ability to get to the centre of the room (or wheverer) with a well times Hail Storm."

TeraOnline,3apgb6,johnny363,2,Tue Jun 23 11:14:45 2015 UTC,"I've been playing archer for about a year or two, so not that long compared to my main (warrior).  I don't PVP much so I don't know if they're considered top tier anymore, but they're tons of fun in PVP. Multiple stuns and KDs, high movespeed, high burst = kill everything!  Archer is pretty fun and challenging to play correctly (need to be in melee range, one iframe, slow-charging skills, need good positioning). Not the highest DPS of all the classes, but the recent patch really improved things. I personally feel they're a little underpowered but they aren't useless. I still pull my weight in my brhm/schm static, even though the other dps in my static (+15 gen slayer and gunner) outdps me by quite a bit.  IMO the level of effort you need to achieve good DPS is a lot higher than it is for some other classes, which is why you don't see them often. Same for sorc."

TeraOnline,3apgb6,screampuff,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:11:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, so while archers are low skill cap to be good and learn, they are fairly decently capped to be amazing. Also, warriors tend to have more appeal as rolling and being all flashy looks cool. Archer is a practical class more than a cool class. In a recent patch they were considered the weakest dps available.  Now sorcerer is a different story. You have to know what you are doing or your dps is going to be lackluster at best. If you don't do a good rotation, you're not going to be able to cast everything and your BoC will run out before you get to cast your mana regeneration spell meaning for your next BoC you will have to either take a ton of time casting your mana regen, or you'll be at half mana and not get a full rotation for a second time. If you stop your rotation and cast your mana regen early to get it in on the BoC and lower the cast time, you're missing a lot of other potential dps. Sorcerer can still be considered at minimum average dps, if not on the higher end. They still do not compare to a zerker or slayer.  I'm a terrible archer, I can't speak for archer, but I'm an ok sorcerer. (don't ask how that works idk) In pvp sorcerer NEEDS a smart team or he's going to get wrecked. In pvp for archer you can kinda do things yourself if you are good. In pve an archer can keep up with, but not surpass some other dps classes. In pve a sorcerer could potentially surpass some other melee classes in dps as they could be lucky on crits.  The only class that is currently behind in PvE dps is Reaper and it is solely because Ktera didn't make them scale into the late game gear very well, but they do great in PvP. If you have a high skill capped anything-that-isn't-healer and a high skill capped Reaper, you will 8/10 see the not-healer-dps beat the Reaper in numbers. The other 2 are RNG where the dps gets like no crits and the Reaper gets like all crits. Again, that is PvE only. In PvP they are very much adequate.   If you do decide to play a sorcerer, you won't really know if you like it or not till you hit 65, find a really good sorcerer to teach you the rotations and how to play, and then give it a shot.  If you decide to play archer, you can pretty much get the general idea of if you like it or not by the time you hit 60. Still suggest getting a good archer to teach you how to play it, but you should be warned that archer isn't always the ranged class you think it is as they have a passive that allows them to deal more damage the closer they get to their target. This means that in PvE you should basically be acting as a melee class. Your defensive stats are close, but not equal to, an attack stance warrior so you shouldn't die if you take a big hit. Though if you are good you wont take that hit.  There may be another reason you don't see archer right now. Because slayer is so good at the moment as well as zerker with their upcoming tanking patch and their crit damage, it is highly possible that people are just opting to not play yet-another-leather class as every party ever has at least a slayer, reaper, or warrior now and it's hard to justify gearing a class that could fairly easily be out-dps'd.  TL;DR: Archer can be fun if you like that style, but it is melee despite being ranged. There are currently no issues with their dps if you know what you are doing. Hard to justify another leather class if slayer is better dps. People wanna play ""the best class"" and not ""the thing most fun to me."" Sorcerer has a high skill cap to be really good so many just can't follow up. After losing a lot because they aren't good, they think the class sucks and stop playing it or get discouraged in general."

TeraOnline,3apgb6,Scellow,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:37:29 2015 UTC,"In short, those 2 classes are the most difficult to play correctly, they have a lot of skills and glyph that probably don't make a lot of sense, like archers, they have a powerlink glyph for PA on stun trap, which you have to cancel (which you can't do above 200ms or to much AS) or sorc have a speed cast glyph on their sleep, which is good on PvP but not so much on pve. On top of that they have really uncommon builds, which require their share of investment, just to see them perform a somewhat decent job. And all of this requires you to know really complex rotations. Some people know how to pull it of, and in exchange they can probably outdps your standard zerk/slayer/gunner by a large margin. Anyways, if you find them fun, they definitely have potential, it is just harder to achieve."

TeraOnline,3apgb6,Narissis,0,Mon Jun 22 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"Remote as in getting you killed and allotting very little back time. The reason why melee classes are top among the list is because they can easily get back time just by walking around the boss in seconds. (Plus Gunner because they can Rocket Jump through the boss and always get back damage with Arcane Barrage.)  At end-game, playing ranged classes at a range kills your DPS and could easily get you killed with AoEs. The sweet spot for DPS is 8-10m, far from the Archer's allotted 20+.  edit: Get downvoted and yet I have not a single reason as to why.

Sorcerers are difficult to play if they don't already match your playstyle. With how close you have to go to the enemy while being that squishy, just counting on your ability to land a sleep.  Neither of the classes really play as ranged in PvP their both very close range classes, Archers have a really easy to pull off 100-0 combo that uses a total of 1 arrow, and makes them pretty much the trap master class. Sorcs put you to sleep and then often come up close for damage."

Although, of the 9 characters I have, the only ones that aren't 65 are my sorc and archer and I don't think that's a coincidence... one of the issues I have with them is that there are simply too many skills. It's not like a priest or mystic, where you have a lot of skills because many of them are buffs, or a warrior or post-upcoming-patch zerker, where you have an 'alternate' set of tanking skills...  Sorcs and archers just have a really giant array of skills that all do the same thing: attack. It's to the point where there's a lot of redundancy in them, and it's a pain in the butt to try to figure them out, manage them, and get a feel for playing the class.  Say what you will about gunners and reapers, but I think that's one of the things they did right... they don't have that overproliferation of skills (I would go as far as to say that gunners have a little bit too few, but that seems a better problem than having too many).  It's not really a matter of ""dumbing down"" the sorc and archer; I'd describe it as more like ""streamlining"". You don't need one class to have three or four different ranged AoEs; why not just two with a shorter cooldown? Why does the archer need six unique trap skills? What's the point of having so many utility skills when they're so niche that you use each one with vanishing rarity to the point that you start to forget which one to reach for in the heat of the moment; why not roll some of them together into combined skills so they can be more useful? It feels like they just added skills for the sake of adding skills without designing them to be efficient and manageable."

TeraOnline,3aqi7u,Tsukame,3,Mon Jun 22 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"I still believe it should be considered a shark for several reasons, one mainly due to it's vertical tail fin. Aquatic mammals have horizontal tail fins (i.e. dolphin, whales, orcas, seals. etc ). It has a pointed nose, where most whales have a very round and fatty noses. It has razor teeth, unlike the round or hair like teeth of whales. Note it also swims left to right, like a shark. Aquatic mammals swim pattern is down to up. Whales have like 4 fins, sharks can have 6-8 fins. The Sky ""whale"" has, counting caudal fin as one and not counting tentacles , has 6 fins. Another thing to note is that it seems to have gills shown in this video at 0:39. The only thing I found it has in common with a whale is its throat grooves."

I am still working on my gear but tbh which ever path you take, it'll take lots and lots of time to obtain. I am not entirely sure of how the PVE works but PVP consist of countless hours of Corsair Stronghold (CS). You'll be playing that mode for days.  PVP Consist of: Doing CS to get credit - Bellicarium - Killing Spree (You can check by pressing P and going to Reputation). You want to try to max out the amount of credits you can get per week but that actually takes long. The best thing to do is duo que with someone because ques are really really really long....  Once you rack up in those credits go to Velika Headquarters and there will be NPC's with the Bellicarium and Killing Spree under their names. You'll find recipes to make equipment for PVP. Just make sure, that you do Controvert before Defiance. You'll need controvert gear before you can make the equip into Defiance. After you got recipe, most of the materials will be obtainable from those two NPCs.   This is the way i was taught and i picked up the game around May."

TeraOnline,3as6jh,Bigrook13,-1,Tue Jun 23 14:42:26 2015 UTC,"U heard? It all depends on how much u play or how much money u keep to play broker. Playing broker a lot, 1m each month is cake going up once u got multiple millions .. .but damn its boring and to me i did it on other games cannot ruin my tera fun with it, YET.  U can easily do like 1200vanguard rep within one hour if u got multiple characters which makes for 4ghili a day (not overdoing it). so after 1.5h u did 4xghili and u got like 6-8k gold each without even running instances like RG. U can add 4xRG and the resulting 400vanguard, one more ghili within another 30minutes. There u go, easy like 12-15k gold playing 2h and its getting more the more u play and the more 4xRG u can do on your characters.  Farming the HM is another good way but i do not PVE a lot so i cannot tell u how much it nets, shouldnt be less and 300-400k should be cake to anybody commiting to it which means that the omg omg i can never ever +15qq crap should stop :)  PS: Doing PVP all day will net 10-15k a day too i guess."

Damage meter allows you to see how well you're performing, your crit percents, evaluate your skills depending on your rotations and last but certainly not least - it allows you to see people who are underperforming. That will divide the comminuty into people who want to be good and people who just faceroll or abuse their team mates. Regarding the bans, that won't happen, period. Makes me remember how people were afraid of the first addons for wow and refusing to install them for raids, claiming bans are coming xD"

While I do agree with you that its a pretty objective way to see an individuals performance, I've also been in parties where people are being called out left and right about their % (not even dps lol) and beign flamed on by using this. If its not your case then good for you, but not all players are saints or positive critics."
TeraOnline,3as10f,DeackonFrost,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:11:20 2015 UTC,"Not really braindead at all. I actually happen to agree with them.   First and foremost - It's their game. They can do whatever they feel like doing; you agreed to that when you installed the game.   http://tera.enmasse.com/legal/end-user-license-agreement  Clearly labelled under section 2B, third party software is blatantly banned.   Secondly, these bans aren't claims. People have already been banned and will continue to be so.   http://tera-forums.enmasse.com/forums/general-discussion/topics/TERA-DPS-Meter-People-are-Banned-for-Using-It  Thirdly, you can already evaluate your damage/crit/rotation based on combat history (a part of your chat log). You're more than welcome to see your damage output, and a base idea of how often you're critting.   Fourth, your argument makes no sense because anyone that has the experience with the game can tell who is underperforming within 1 minute of starting the dungeon. Furthermore, if someone dies, tank loses aggro, boss doesn't get knocked down, you don't get healed, etc. You shouldn't need a DPS meter to confirm who is underperforming.  And fifth, dividing the community is an issue. In a puny community of a game especially before the steam release, dividing the gaming community is the last thing they want. This divides the community into people who've played for 2 years (like myself) and people who just started to get some good gear. Not only are they already being discriminated against in LFG, but now you're telling me we should discriminate against them in dungeon too? How could you possibly expect them to get good at the game? In what world does that increase player base? What if they have high ping at the time? Would you even care to ask or will you just assume they're a shit player? You're using an argument without even thinking about the subject in depth."

Firstly terms of service are there to protect the firm from any legal problems, i.e. account itself is actually being leased to a user, he doesn't actually own anything, the point being enforcing 3rd party rule will happen on bots, not on any harmless addon. Provided link on bans does not yield any info on the mater, official post suggest there might be actions taken, not that there actually were any, and you won't find any proof of a ban for dps meter also. Your blabbing about evaluating without dps meter is moot, it simply helps, if you deny that, you're not even worth reading. And the diving commutiny matter doesn't matter. People who don't join guilds and make friends after a few months are doomed to move on, and people who do will not be divided by this as they play with people they know and any particular argument over dps they might have in a LFG will not affect them, as they'd know why their dps was subpar, be it a mistake they made or simply a challenging boss mechanic for their class.

This still falls into that category. I should also add that people were not getting banned for bots if they were physically present at their computer.  http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/3as10f/gunner_dps/csg55pj   Provided link on bans does not yield any info on the mater   Except for the fact that a GM claims that a DPS meter is blatantly against the rules. This is not a blunt statement, it clearly defines DPS meters as against the rules. I'd consider that ""information on the subject"".   evaluating without dps meter is moot   Added benefits of DPS meter is that it also measures dps relatively not strictly absolute values. If you're looking to improve on your own performance, the combat history should suffice. Your own performance is not relative to others' performance for the same reasons you state yourself later on - hence relative dps being, ironically, irrelevant.    it simply helps   At no point did I claim otherwise.   diving commutiny matter doesn't matter. People who don't join guilds and make friends after a few months are doomed to move on, and people who do will not be divided by this as they play with people they know and any particular argument over dps they might have in a LFG will not affect them, as they'd know why their dps was subpar, be it a mistake they made or simply a challenging boss mechanic for their class   And people who do join guilds get marginalized because they can't perform relative to other players. Not only will this cause newer players to be less likely to stick to the game, it also causes the vast majority of the players to consider dps as the be all and end all of a player. This is where I poetically return your own statement to yourself; "" if you deny that, you're not even worth reading""  I understand you're severely passionate about the subject, but my original comment was answering someone else's question, not yours."

TeraOnline,3as10f,Astoriane,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:41:26 2015 UTC,"Dude if you're not feeling it then this game isn't for you... at the moment, Gunner is the most overpowered. Maybe you're doing something wrong? Not sure what lvl each skills is unlocked but here are some tips:  Arcane barage - Shoots a ball and then when it gets to the enemy or behind the enemy, press the skill again to shoot a lazer beam. The range is 20m max.  Mana Missiles - It's a charging skill so the longer you hold the button, the more missiles come out.  Maybe you're not glyphing. Press ""K"" and there are some red/green/blue balls next to the skills that you may be able to click on.  Again, i'm not sure what level each of my tips are avaliable but trust me, Gunner is SUPER OP and SUPER FUN!   Good luck!"

TeraOnline,3aqqt8,Sodachi,8,Mon Jun 22 19:13:48 2015 UTC,Playing archer with 200+ ping is suicide.  Difference between 60 and 200 ping. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-nR-G9wV0
TeraOnline,3aqqt8,Afan9001,6,Mon Jun 22 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"Avoid using Rapid Fire at all costs. Your ping will ensure that Rapid Fire will go off at almost the same rate as Arrow with even less damage. Only use Final Salvo for cancelling the backswing of Thunderbolt and Radiant Arrow.   Your rotation will not include Rapid Fire anywhere. Even if you need a filler skill, the basic attack will fare better than Rapid Fire. It should go something like Velik's Mark > Rain of Arrows > (only if you use Powerlink glyph: Close Quarters > Breakaway Bolt) > Radiant Arrow > Salvo cancel > Penetrating Arrow > Thunderbolt > Salvo cancel > Penetrating Arrow > filler skills/any of the skills on the main rotation off cooldown > repeat. You won't be nearly as effective as an Archer with low ping, but you'll get by. The rotation is not a strict guide, Rain of Arrows is situational on whether the boss/mob moves or not so use your own discretion.   For the record, I play an Archer around 200 ping as well. I wouldn't recommend Archer to players with high ping but if you like the class as much as I do, you'll adapt."

I've heard archers are dependent on their ping, if you’re sitting at 250ping you aren't too far from being disconnected from the server.  If you are insistent on playing the NA version of Tera, I don’t blame you the publisher is a lot cooler. I would suggest using WTFast it’s a network tunneling program that gives you the best route from your PC to the Enmasse servers. It could save you like almost 100ms of ping in extreme cases. Or you can be like me and use it and get a 1ms difference (I live in Detroit, the servers in Chicago.)  If you really want to play the NA version consider using WTFast or some other tunneling program."
TeraOnline,3aqqt8,Soleria,0,Mon Jun 22 20:01:39 2015 UTC,Ping has nothing to do with being disconnected from the server. You could have 1000 ping and still be connected (although there will be a massive delay)

TeraOnline,3aq0p2,Kitsune241,3,Mon Jun 22 19:53:02 2015 UTC,"a way to make a weapon's/armor's looks mimic something you preferred   Use fashion coupons, IMO they're actually better than the old system. (You can't mix and match pieces anymore, but you don't have to redo it every time you want to switch out pieces).

TeraOnline,3aq0p2,rundelhaus,3,Mon Jun 22 20:56:55 2015 UTC,Well I was kinda after the weapon skins though. Are they still actively putting more items in the Fashion Coupon store (or what it was called)?
TeraOnline,3aq0p2,Kitsune241,3,Mon Jun 22 21:00:00 2015 UTC,"They're trying to, but it might be a while. Basically a lot of the old really cool weapon skins don't exist in the current build (idk how that works since I'm sure some people still own them, just quoting EME here) so they need to ask BHS to add them back into the build before they can be made into fashion coupon skins.

I have full Idoneal gear of course, but I have around 35k gold, which, to my understanding, is too poor to afford disco gear. My question is: where do I go from here? I have been told to skip ambit and go straight to disco, but I am too weak to be running SCNM/BRHM for the gear. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks."
TeraOnline,3aq0p2,ChildrensPlayground,3,Tue Jun 23 00:18:06 2015 UTC,"I actually crafted my disco weapon with 35k and +12'd it, also bought boots for 90g for set bonus. I had  all the essences beforehand though, and a good guildie crafted it for me. Also it did crit so now I have an extra 40K~. My advice is if you can spend some time gathering basic materials, it will be alot cheaper than buying. Then also you get a feel of the prices for keen/empyrspades and the enchanting stuff, also if you like crafting like me then you'll enjoy the process!"

TeraOnline,3aq0p2,ChildrensPlayground,3,Tue Jun 23 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"You only skip ambit if you have a reliable method to obtain discovery soon. This typically means having a group that is willing to take you through SCNM/BRHM.  If you are a new player, you typically won't have a guild/static/friends who will carry you, so you'll need to get ambit.  Idoneal isn't too weak for SCNM/BRHM, but you have to actually be good to carry your weight."
TeraOnline,3aq0p2,wollollolloll,2,Wed Jun 24 01:33:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I also heard that with the upcoming patch, ambit will become worse than Idoneal or something like that, so do you think that it would still be worth it to invest in that? Or would it be ideal to just focus on getting as much gold as I can?  Also need to hone my skills haha I'm a bad warrior."
TeraOnline,3aq0p2,Horus23,4,Tue Jun 23 05:58:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything about ambit becoming worse than Idoneal. It wouldn't make sense either.  You're probably getting it confused with a new set of gear people are referring to as ""Idoneal 2.0"". It isn't actually related to idoneal in any way, it simply plays a similar role as the ""starter set for X patch"".  Ideally, you can just wait till next patch and start gearing up then.  However, do keep in mind that your current gear will facilitate that. Having better gear will increase your chances of getting into groups as well as clearing. This will depend on if you have a guild to fall back on, or if you feel like you can convince LFGs to accept you.  I would probably spend the rest of the current patch farming and also running BRNM. Idoneal 2.0 will drop from BR7M so you'll want to be very familiar with BR. Additionally, by running BRNM you will very likely be able to get a few pieces of ambit. You can hold onto those pieces for now, and when next patch hits you can decide whether or not you need the upgrade. If it turns out you don't need ambit, then you just turn it into feedstock."
