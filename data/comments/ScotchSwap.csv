ScotchSwap,3dmtc5,devilsadvocate23,3,Fri Jul 17 15:27:12 2015 UTC,What type of single malts are you after? How are you valuing the EWSB?
ScotchSwap,3dmtc5,aliteralnoob,2,Fri Jul 17 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"I am valuing it around the secondary market value but I am not wedded to getting full value.  Basically, I have wanted to try EWSB for a while but never felt a rush to buy it because it is everywhere.  A couple of my buddies so a monthly whiskey club and I decided to buy this for our July meeting.  When I noticed they had a 2001, I figured hey maybe I can upgrade it into a single malt.  If not my buddies and I get to make the 2001 vintage 1 bottle more scarce.  If that makes me an ass, I'm fine with it.    I hesitate to list specific malts as pricing is so vastly different depending on location.  Dalwhinnie, Ardbeg, Caol Ila, Scappa, Craggmore, Arran, Springbank, Laphroaig, Aberlour, Balvenie, Longrow, Glenlivet, Glenfiddich, Glemorangie, Glendronach, Glenfarclas,Bunnhabhain, Kilchoman, Strathsia, are all of interest as are IBs and more or less anything that may not be available in my area."
ScotchSwap,3dmtc5,slanderousu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:28:41 2015 UTC,I'm not in this game but what is considered secondary market value for 2001?
ScotchSwap,3dmtc5,slanderousu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:15:22 2015 UTC,Answering this is just going to bring on a flood of downvotes.  The website I use says market value is $75.  For reference they say that the Stagg Jr and ECBP #8 are about the same.
ScotchSwap,3dmtc5,slanderousu,2,Fri Jul 17 17:47:57 2015 UTC,I don't think it's worth downvoting (definitely not helpful to anyone).  Your website's guess is as good as mine.  2001 is only 4 years old though so I would be somewhat suspect of a tripling in value.
ScotchSwap,3dmtc5,slanderousu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:51:27 2015 UTC,Perhaps.  I get a little frustrated with the whole topic. When you want something from someone else the secondary value is gospel but when you want to trade something for secondary it is BS.  My thoughts were and are that since prices vary so much on scotch I might be able to get a bottle that costs $70 here and it only costs the person who trades it $55.  For example in CT you can get Springbank 12 CS for about $60.  Here it is $90.  In Florida Caol Ila is $45.  Here it is $60.
ScotchSwap,3dmtc5,afterthinker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:06:53 2015 UTC,It's usually about who wants what.  If someone comes to me and really WANTS something I have control over pricing.  If I come on here and FT something then the bidders have control.    Usually I only FT things if A)  I think it's really valuable and I don't want it anymore or B) I need to make space and I don't want it any more.  If I'd just as soon drink it then I hold onto it until someone ISO's it.

ScotchSwap,3dc5as,tvraisedme,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:22:26 2015 UTC,I suppose that sending them at the end would work too.  I just assumed we'd send them in before because I've been in a few leagues where collecting at the end of the year has been a problem.

I did get another of their direct imports last year - from Domaine Pouchegau and thought it was fantastic.  I'm pretty new to brandy and don't have a lot of experience with Armagnac but that one was way better than others I've had and that (along with generally good experiences with their Scotch selections) makes me curious to try their other Armagnac selections.  I'd be happy to swap you a sample of the Pouchegau if you're interested."

ScotchSwap,3cy808,braille_teeth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:46:10 2015 UTC,"""best"" is subjective, they are undisputably among the most old-school, hands-on calvados producers. I would say relatively little ""funk"" especially as compared to i.e. boulard or lemorton.  Definitely some oak in there depending on which expression you get. The 12-year old is just fucking fantastic. Bright, apple appley nose, smooth and a touch leathery/smokey palate, rounded but not innocuous finish that lasts.... I should also say I found my bottle for $80 which is like half price... Calvados is fucking expensive."
ScotchSwap,3cy808,braille_teeth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:34:48 2015 UTC,Can you highlight some overgeneralized differences in the flavor profiles of the different producers? personally I like a good bit of funk like you find in Spanish/Basque ciders.

ScotchSwap,3ces89,Devoz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:15:39 2015 UTC,"Millstone 100 Dutch Single Rye vs. Rittenhouse 100 Rye   Nose: Both have similar rye notes, the Rittenhouse is slightly sweeter, the Millstone is more complex, with greater wood influence. Millstone’s nose has more wood, my wife describe it has reminding her of a cabin in the woods. Vanilla, oak, caramel, and pine. Millstone opens up after 10 minutes in the glass.   Palate: Both have the traditional rye notes; oak, vanilla, pepper and other spices. Millstone is has more complexity again. Additional floral notes, less prevalent spice. More mint in the Rittenhouse. The Millstone tastes more full bodied.   Finish: Longer finish that lingers with the Millstone. Both have some bitter notes on the finish. The flavors are a little disjointed on Millstone. Good, but not the same as one of the all-time great ryes.   Overall, the Millstone is the clear winner against Rittenhouse 100. Rittenhouse 100 is my default rye for mixing, and it works as a sipper. The Millstone 100 is twice the price in Ontario, but a far better sipper."

Ill probably decide tonight. Didn't get a lot of responses and Ive already gotten 3 very nice offers one of those yours"
ScotchSwap,3c8zuf,mountaindram,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:42:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds great. I'm heading out of town for work tomorrow afternoon, so I can get it out before then if you decide. Let me know!"

ScotchSwap,3c8oz5,celocanth13,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:01:32 2015 UTC,"Would you be willing to do HWMWND, Jim Beam Black (Age Stated), and a bunch of samples?"

ScotchSwap,3c8oz5,celocanth13,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:16:18 2015 UTC,I also have an unopened Jim Beam Signature Craft- Rare Spanish Brandy Cask Finish.  And some unopened Willett Ryes.

Not something I'd normally buy for myself, but maybe it's perfect for this sorta thing.  Tell me more about these Willett Ryes, please.  I know very little about Willett."
ScotchSwap,3c8oz5,celocanth13,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:31:21 2015 UTC,I have a 2 year and 7 year unopened as well as an opened 4 (wax top) and 8 year.  The 4 and 8 are opened with one pour taken out.  my inventory

ScotchSwap,3c7ets,Lasidar,3,Sun Jul 5 16:14:06 2015 UTC,"For anything not that rare - I don't value it anything above MSRP and often am glad to trade it below MSRP. For anything especially rare/discontinued, I value the sample at roughly the secondary value, but am far more flexible on that with samples than with trading whole bottles. I don't get too worried about it though if I get a bunch of samples I'm excited about in return."
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,madgraf,2,Sun Jul 5 19:55:26 2015 UTC,This should be summarized in the side bar for new swappers IMO.
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,tintin777,6,Sun Jul 5 20:21:28 2015 UTC,"Trading samples really should be about seeking out something you're interested or excited in trying. People shouldn't rip each other off, but if you're focusing primarily on value in sample swaps, you're probably doing it wrong."
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,mfpark,4,Sun Jul 5 22:18:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is more of am I ripping this person off, rather than am I getting ripped off."
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,mfpark,2,Sun Jul 5 23:01:53 2015 UTC,Can't go wrong with the golden rule ;)
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,NJWhiskeyHunter,3,Sun Jul 5 23:45:37 2015 UTC,"I use a complex formula that uses the secondary value, MSRP, the latitude and longitude of Miley Cyrus' last concert, the moon phase and the number of times my buddy Bob has struck out with the ladies (a rapidly increasing #, this factor helps adjust for bourbon inflation).  It's a good system."
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,mikeczyz,4,Sun Jul 5 23:48:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, I did some swaps of my WLWeller 2014 that were horrendous in terms of ""value.""  I'm more focused on finding interesting stuff to drink.    edit:  I'm also kinda weird.  I really, really value community building and relationships, even if it means I'm taking it up the ass."
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,mountaindram,2,Sun Jul 5 22:58:37 2015 UTC,Well your  edit is one way to build relationships!  ;)  I think the samples you offered up recently do a good job of setting the tone of focusing on sharing and experiencing together.  I am hoping to pick up some bottles this year that allow me to do that as well so don't second guess your approach.
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,devilsadvocate23,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"Seeing the ISO and FT threads, I fear this place is becoming more about trading bottles of hard to find bourbon/rye than a community that values sharing the experience of different whiskies through sample swaps.  That said, my first few swaps have been with people that really do value the community and sharing experiences so hopefully that aspect will still remain here."
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,devilsadvocate23,2,Mon Jul 6 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"It depends on what it is,  how badly I want it and whether it is a sample or bottle swap. Generally I stay closer to msrp than secondary but I haven't been involved in any swaps where I was seeking anything with a huge secondary Market value."
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,tequilajunction,2,Sun Jul 5 18:26:42 2015 UTC,"I try to focus more on my value/interest than price, but secondary value makes a pretty good reference point."
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,bigmoneysalsa,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:30:27 2015 UTC,Generally secondary market value. People are less exacting about values matching up when it comes to samples than when it comes to full bottles though.
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,nonmagnetic,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:30:11 2015 UTC,I read on this sub somewhere that 10% of the Secondary value is a good measure of a 2oz. sample. For non-rare stuff value is approx. MSRP. I think this works pretty well and I've used this for trying to figure out fair multi-sample swaps...
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,mikeczyz,2,Sun Jul 5 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"Boy, if I applied that math to some of my previous swaps, I got absolutely destroyed by the other side."
ScotchSwap,3c7ets,Brent_in_Aurora,0,Sun Jul 5 23:08:43 2015 UTC,"At the same time, if you got something for msrp, you're only out an imaginary value as opening up a bottle destroys the value. Trading samples is about getting things that are hard to find."

ScotchSwap,3c4lep,WhiskeyMasterRace,2,Sat Jul 4 18:54:11 2015 UTC,Tictacs and other things that make noise to keep nosy people from hearing the booze inside.

ScotchSwap,3c4lep,XenonBloom,2,Sat Jul 4 19:54:04 2015 UTC,"The tictacs add structural integrity to the box and will break before the bottles do. The noise hides the sound of liquid sloshing in the bottles.   Also, 4 boston rounds in a small flat rate box is my current record."
