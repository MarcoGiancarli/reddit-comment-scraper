fossworldproblems,3dydwc,r0ck0,7,Mon Jul 20 18:45:07 2015 UTC,"This is due to the (extremely common) switch on the ""cp"" command -- ""preserve modification dates, mode and time"" -- so they had to do something.  I understand your frustration, but totally understand why they had to do this.

It started around 2009, back then it was a minority of themers that appealed to the flat audience. So nobody followed Windows 8 or OSX.  The flat-appeal was present in the design community many years back. You have these trends in the design community for many years before major products (like Windows, OSX or Android) adopt them. But when they get adopted every little web shop and app dev tries to use the new style and fail in spectacular ways. Remember all the XP theme web interfaces?"
fossworldproblems,3ba6tm,TimGuoRen,2,Sat Jun 27 11:13:13 2015 UTC,"Flat themes of course existed for years, but they didn't take over until Win 8 came around."
fossworldproblems,3ba6tm,TimGuoRen,2,Sat Jun 27 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"I would say that Win7 was the turning point.  Win 98 was grey. Win XP was colorful. Win Vista was colorful, shiny and glossy. Win 7 went a step back to a more minimalist design.  Thing is: In the early 2000s people assumed that a shiny OS means that it is modern and powerful. Designers did everything that could be done with modern hardware. ""The hardware can handle those shadow effects, so we will do it."" But later people realized that a clean OS is easier to use. So designers focused on functionality.  Look at iOS for another example: https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ios-1-81.jpg  Complexity peaked at iOS4-6. iOS 7/8 is more minimalist.  Today people know that hardware could handle the most shiny 3D effects, but users do not want them because it does not actually help using the system.  However, I agree that the current flat themes are just another extreme. I love simple looks. But if a shadow or non-flat buttons help me to see faster where I have to click, I want them. I feel the current trend to flat themes is an overreaction to users who are annoyed by shiny themes. In the long run developers will find a middle ground."
fossworldproblems,3ba6tm,flying-sheep,3,Mon Jun 29 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"The Windows 7 default themes had clear buttons and outlines around objects. It's the farthest thing from flat. It's little different than the default blue theme in XP, besides the colors.  And I'm not counting mobile OS. You could say those need to be flat due to size. But flat on a desktop monitor is ridiculous, esp. when you don't have touchscreen. That's why Windows 8.x failed so hard.  And I'm not talking about extremes in the other direction of flat. I don't like that, either. I'm talking about flat, borderless designs with the total lack of any detail in the widgets, on top of flat icons. It's not ""easier to use"" for me. And it makes no sense to say that various icon shapes are easier to tell apart than well-defined image icons. I see it as a trend, and nothing more."

And I, for one, want more awesome developers like Sarah Sharp to work on Linux and associated projects, and if we all acted like Linus does when people break userspace, I don't know how we can expect them to want to be here.

So far Linus' style has been very effective, but I still haven't seen that changing that style would result in better results.

You have obviously never worked in a software company before. So far Linux has been successful in spite of Linus' and others' horrible people skills. Everyone involved works around that. Some people are fucking tired of it, and you know what? Those people write the code.  Open source is primarily about getting lots of volunteers all over the world to work together on something. Having people skill is important and making Linux a place where minorities to the tech world can contribute is very important. And even more than that, linux is about learning about CS and having the leader tell people they should be aborted is not conducive to learning.  If Linus treated his employees like he has treated some volunteers (that is to say, told them they should be dead for breaking userspace) he would likely have been fired unless he changed his way of doing things. It's actually not legal to treat people like that in the workplace in a lot of areas. Why do you think he doesn't work in the corporate world?

Weirdly, ""python"" seems to work on both, and ""rust"" gives me more results for the game than the programming language.  ""systemd"" gives used to give surprisingly bad results since search engines seem to like correcting the input to ""system"", but ""pulseaudio"" is unmistakeable.  Edit: I just went through my installed packages and the things that strike me as particularly googleable are named just like you said: One word, either made up or joined from multiple.

You can quit a session with Q, or Shift+Q to quit and save your spot for the next time the file is launched!!  It automatically selects the highest quality of stream that your computer can handle (no more selecting it from the menu), you have one key shortcuts for brightness, contrast, speed, subtitles, seeking, volume, playback, frame-by-frame (forward and backwards!!!), and much, much more.

fossworldproblems,34rfzu,jeandem,1 point,Mon May 4 02:16:15 2015 UTC,"While I can sympathize, there's a point to these arbitrary assignment rules, and that's teaching students how to follow instructions. In e.g. software engineering, it's not uncommon to find yourself thrown into an existing team using a particular development strategy using specific platform(s) and tools. To integrate your work into what others have already built, sometimes you need to suck it up and work on a Windows workstation though you prefer Debian, code your stuff in Eclipse rather than Emacs, use SVN even though you prefer GIT, and write C# even though you're into Java. Oh, and obviously you have to actually write code that does what your project manager says it should do, even if you can think of a better/simpler interface.  Seen this one before? Software development can be kind of like that."
fossworldproblems,34rfzu,alwaysgetdownvoted,8,Mon May 4 08:31:03 2015 UTC,"While I can sympathize, there's a point to these arbitrary assignment rules, and that's teaching students how to follow instructions.   What a great excuse for practically anything. ""These rules aren't random, or arbitrary - they're supposed to teach you how to follow instructions!"".  Using SVN rather than git could be motivated by the fact that they only use/host SVN repositories. Writing Java rather than C# can be motivated by the fact that it's easier to grade if everyone uses the same language, and the graders know Java. And so on. But if your actual reason or argument for having seemingly arbitrary rules are that they are arbitrary, and that they are ""supposed to teach you to follow instructions"", you're rationalizing your own laziness and/or poor routines."

If, say, a bunch of women would demand that all women in SuperTuxKart should be fully clothed, but all men should only wear underwear, and the discussion would mostly revolve about wheter or not to give in to those demands, rather than everyone ignoring them because most women don't agree with that either, that would be a vocal minority.  But if you happend to be part of a minority, and also happen to be part of an open source project, you're not automatically a vocal minoroty because you disagree with the majority opinion on a subject. That would make everybody who disagrees with the majority on any subject a ""vocal minority"". Beeing part of a (so called) minority (ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, etc), the minority (different opinion on a specific subject than the majority), or a vocal minority (an opinion being regarded as representative for a group, when it's actually a minority opinion within that group), are all very different things.  Edit: All that said, you're of course right that white dudes are the overwhelming majority in software development, and everybody else can find themselfs at an extreme disadvantage when it comes to certain things. But that's ""just"" the problem of beeing part of a/the minority.

fossworldproblems,31rauj,5bits,15,Tue Apr 7 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"Time to get a new boss.  :)  100%, swear on a stack of bibles, this happened to me in 2002, working at an enterprise in the midwest.  At that time, Enterprise Linux was a thing, but it was a hard road for some entrenched companies.  The organization was an interesting situation -- they had an out-of-control security department that essentially shot all kinds of stuff down at meetings.  Their security people could show up at any meeting (should you be so lucky) and essentially shut down your project with vague sentenses like ""this product does not have the appropriate level of security"" -- and not give any substance to the accusation.     And into this mess I step.   Step 1: make a friend in security.  In my case, head of vulnerability management.  I do this during my first foreay into a pre-roll-out audit, where you discuss with the security people each aspect of the products security that has to be mitigated by a process.   It's all mindless stuff like each web server will have a unique admin password, who has that password, how often it changes -- what settings will be applied at roll-out, what encyrption will be supported.  You get the picture.  I make friends there, because we roll through a painful process like this in about 1-2 hours, and it usually takes weeks of idiocy (often on both sides).  During the actual product roll-out I use some simple scripting to ""audit"" the web server deployment -- it saves everyone a boat-load of time, and beats slogging through documentation, which was the prior approach.  Then over the course of time, I get identified as someone who can solve problems.   My friend in security becomes an ally.  To my boss though, I'm a newbie who's got to be kept in line.   One day, whilst overhearing a co-workers delemma about how to get IHS log files out of a DMZ, I suggest a FOSS solution -- just get a copy of CURL and pull the log files through a special web URL that's listening on HTTPS, but facing the management portion of the DMZ (people outside of the company would not see this port, so it's safe).  Great solution.  He sets it up, uses the access log data to decide what log files to blow away -- it's all great.  Until my boss hears about it, and goes all crazy on us both at a team meeting.  ""You can get fired for using open source software at this organization.  We don't use any Open Source products here.""    I shrug,  my friend shrugs.   OKAY, I think, somethings not quite right here, but I can't totally put my finger on it.    A few hours pass after the above meeting.  Boss walks into cubicle: ""I hear you know something about Perl?"".   WTF, I think.  Haven't touched any Perl since I stepped into this organization.  ""Yeah?"" , I answer cautiously.  Boss: ""We have this module written in Perl that monitors our web sites to see if they're up.""  And sure as sh1t, they do!  It's part of their proprietary monitoring solution -- there it is, plain as day -- and my Boss has no idea it's FOSS.   So I happily accept the challenge (port from AIX to Solaris, some recompiles and stuff, pretty minor -- it mainly needed an updated SSL library to work) and get a kudos from my Boss and some others.  The Curl solution stands though, because it's good.  The security department decides they're OK with it as well at a later time.  The organization, partially due to my enthusiasm, finally adopts Linux and Apache to replace their proprietary OS/Webserver choices.    More to the story -- but I should also share, I did replace my Boss (swapped departments) within a few months of the above situation.   Another department head had decided he wanted me working for him and basically stole me away -- between us, the major push for Linux/Apache happened.    TL,DR; Hang in there, the world is not completely full of people like your Boss :)"

In any situation where it was feasible, I would use a modern GUI editor (e.g. Kate) or IDE (e.g. IntelliJ), and not anything related to Emacs or vi.  Why? Because, other than vi workalikes and GNU projects, that's what pretty much everything uses and understands, and I appreciate the simple purity of one set of key bindings for everything. Ctrl+A is always “select all”, Ctrl+V is always “paste”, Shift+End is always “select to end of line”, and so on.  Also, my keyboard has dedicated keys for moving the cursor and such. I'm not on a VT100. I don't need to work around the lack of an End key with Ctrl+E, because I don't lack an End key. It's there, and I don't know of any (non-Mac) software that does anything astonishing when that key is pressed. May as well use it.

Oftentimes it is. :S  A lot of my Debian questions come down to ""which package do I need to install?"", and nine times out of ten the Ubuntu answer I find applies to me as well.  For me, the Debian/Ubuntu problem mostly stems from packaging issues. For example, the media center Kodi (previously XBMC) used to bundle their own embedded ffmpeg, something Debian disliked. At the time, the Debian maintainers opted to use the system default libav instead, which caused graphical artifacts for me. Meanwhile, the Ubuntu PPA was basically vanilla XBMC, tried and tested by the developers.

Before, Linux desktops were a mix of every feature people cared to implement. It was left as an exercise for the user to pick the way he wanted to interact with the environment. Gnome is now more ""opinionated"". They're going to make some wrong choices and some right ones. More relevantly, they're going to take away some features you use all the time and offer you a different way to do it. Luckily for you, there are more WMs now than ever before. Certainly there are a few that still do window shading and offer all the tweakibility you can handle.

That would be fine. The real world isn't that one, so we need copyleft if we are to protect software freedom and community commons.   Copypasted from one of the comments in the thread op linked (written by /u/wolftune). Basically, even if you prefer to guide others into doing the right thing, rather than forcing them, there will always be those which will use the permissively licensed code to make a proprietary derived work.  Of course, you may as well not care about that, but for those who do, copyleft is useful to prevent that from happening. It's definitely better for the non-developers, and therefore it is 'more free' overall.  You said ""developer-wise"" though, but imo that doesn't mean much when the developer is 'evil', in the proprietary software sense of 'evil' that is.  One point I don't see mentioned much is for the developer that cares about freedom a lot, copyleft provides much more incentive to contribute, because they know in the future that their work will not become something that puts users under handcuffs."

To the users it wouldn't matter as much as to the developers, they might not give much use to the source code.  (if when you say ""developer"" you are talking about the owner of the code, then MIT makes little difference for him.... as long as he retains copyright he can still make proprietary versions even if he licenses under GPL, because he's the owner, licenses only apply to everyone else... he can also accept only contributions that retain his copyright)"

But I think it make sense to expect better downgradability from Arch than Debian according to their philosophies.   Debian's primary focus is stability, and they don't think you should ever upgrade anything until their package managers have thoroughly tested it and ensured beyond a reasonable doubt that it will not break something else. The downside is that you end up with very old versions of the software that may be missing important features.  Arch is at the opposite end of the spectrum. Most of the time the package version is in line with upstream, but of course that can mean it hasn't had a lot of testing ""in the wild"" with other software. In that case you have to design your package management around the potential for stuff to break other stuff, and downgrading is a critical feature."

So, they're stuck on Windows, specifically Windows XP. ReactOS would get them onto an OS getting security updates and whatnot.  I'd of course rather see those systems running Linux, but when Wine doesn't do it, the options are somewhat limited.  And, as confusing as it may be to us, there are people who prefer Windows. When it's fully mature, ReactOS could be an free, open source alternative to proprietary Windows while still having the same look, feel, operation, and compatibility."

fossworldproblems,2t622x,azephrahel,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"Well.. No.  That's not an error message. That's some printer control language.   When dealing with network printers, windows will happily spew garbage, ignore features of they printer, or hang silently, because it's waiting for a different paper type (A4 paper was a common setting to fix).  The best way I ever found to deal with windows & network printers, was to run a CUPS server on Linux.  Linux has been printing very consistently for me.  Well over 15 years.  Seriously, go into the CUPS web page, check your driver. That looks like a laser printer output (on my phone), and most will happily print with a PCL driver. If in doubt, try a generic PCL driver."

As for the error messages, those weren't shown in this pic, but I have seen plenty of that in the past. No idea if that still happens, I don't print often enough to know.  Anyway, this is really just a pointless rant from my side. Printing is just one of those things that never worked properly for me. Even if everything works as designed, there is for sure some DPI setting or an Eco Mode that will make the results look like garbage an require a reprint. I am waiting for the day when the computer can provide a print preview of what actually comes out of the printer, not some happy version of what should be. But at this point, the final arrival of the completely paperless office seems more likely."

A big part of the point is it's not just about associating enough money with a particular bug or feature request.  Why do you think silxx said ""I think that bounties just don't work as a concept""?  One reason is because software involves complex interactions between many parts, so not everything can be done by working your way through a list of bugs or feature requests.

fossworldproblems,2rs1yo,tamas7,1 point,Thu Jan 22 14:18:17 2015 UTC,"Sliding window protocol:       A sliding window protocol is a feature of packet-based data transmission protocols. Sliding window protocols are used where reliable in-order delivery of packets is required, such as in the Data Link Layer (OSI model) as well as in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  Conceptually, each portion of the transmission (packets in most data link layers, but bytes in TCP) is assigned a unique consecutive sequence number, and the receiver uses the numbers to place received packets in the correct order, discarding duplicate packets and identifying missing ones. The problem with this is that there is no limit on the size of the sequence number that can be required.  By placing limits on the number of packets that can be transmitted or received at any given time, a sliding window protocol allows an unlimited number of packets to be communicated using fixed-size sequence numbers. The term ""window"" on the transmitter side represents the logical boundary of the total number of packets yet to be acknowledged by the receiver. The receiver informs the transmitter in each acknowledgment packet the current maximum receiver buffer size (window boundary). The TCP header uses a 16 bit field to report the receive window size to the sender. Therefore, the largest window that can be used is 216 = 64 kilobytes. In slow-start mode, the transmitter starts with low packet count and increases the number of packets in each transmission after receiving acknowledgment packets from receiver. For every ack packet received, the window slides by one packet (logically) to transmit one new packet. When the window threshold is reached, the transmitter sends one packet for one ack packet received. If the window limit is 10 packets then in slow start mode the transmitter may start transmitting one packet followed by two packets (before transmitting two packets, one packet ack has to be received), followed by three packets and so on until 10 packets. But after reaching 10 packets, further transmissions are restricted to one packet transmitted for one ack packet received. In a simulation this appears as if the window is moving by one packet distance for every ack packet received. On the receiver side also the window moves one packet for every packet received. The sliding window method ensures that traffic congestion on the network is avoided. The application layer will still be offering data for transmission to TCP without worrying about the network traffic congestion issues as the TCP on sender and receiver side implement sliding windows of packet buffer. The window size may vary dynamically depending on network traffic.    Image i     Interesting: WXMODEM | Automatic repeat request | Chuck Forsberg   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Your slow hard disk has 70MiB/s which is 560MBit/s.  So in fact, you could have 12 4k porn monitors at the same time if the material is compressed well.

Especially for large programs. ;)  Example: Linux cloned with git takes 2.3G when having a fresh clone (the .git dir only 1.3G thereof, so the raw linux sources checked out on disk are 1G). 'make oldconfig && make deb-pkg' yields not only all the objects but also fine deb files for the kernel, the header, -debug symbols firmware. After compiling the linux directory is blown up to 16G. And linux as a kernel is just a medium sized project if compared to desktop suites such as KDE, Gnome or unity. So if you want to fill your harddisk with fossstuff, there is no problem.

Yes, osx has a shitty-ass window manager, but it also has excellent hibernation support, excellent multi-touch, and generally requires a lot less fiddling to get things working. Besides, most of what I do is either in chrome, on a remote machine via ssh, or on a vm via vagrant, and osx makes a significantly better driver for those things than arch.

They are probably afraid someone will use a dual boot to try messing with the files while the logger is disabled (not sure if it would still notice disk access times or not).  As far as VMs, there was a bug in the software that let you switch to a running VM while the test was open. Normally all non-system processes are killed as soon as you start a test, but for some reason a VM could slip past it. Not sure if they actually fixed it, but we're still not allowed to use VMs for the time being."

That is, instead of serving everything under the same domain you'd be redirected to www2 etc as you first enter a website.

If a website is load balanced, hide it behind the same umbrella IP/domain. With a proper setup internal logging would make it easy to find which webserver served which request. It might remind you of NAT in some way.   It's a rare sight to see something like www135, but in my experience it often comes with needlessly complex urls aswell.

Also, workspaces don't make it easy to have, e.g., one window on the left half of the screen and a set of tabbed/stacked windows on the right half. I often have one window where I'm typing and multiple windows I'm referencing but not simultaneously, and it's nice to be able to flip through the references without switching workspaces and losing the window where I'm typing.

Perhaps it's more difficult to pick up a new language the older you get not solely because of some fundamental neurological change, but also because people don't generally seem to like getting back to basics. (There's too much of a risk of realizing that some fundamental part of your personality has been based on a terrible misconception, y'know.)

The regime of bank secrecy that Swiss banks are famous for came under pressure in the wake of the UBS tax evasion scandal, and the 1934 banking law was amended in 2009 to limit tax evasion by non-Swiss bank clients.

As /u/crowseldon said, needing a CS degree and a bunch of certs to prove your knowledge is necessary if you apply in a traditional manner. I'm in an incredibly similar spot to you knowledge-wise and paper-wise (I'm probably a bit less knowledgeable, never wrote a kernel module. Did the rest though).  I got my current programmer/sysadmin/developer/SQL wrangler/anything else they need job through a friend of my parents getting me an interview, and impressing them in person. Submitting CVs to HR staff who have no clue what they're reading except for the certifications they know are applicable to the job will not work unless you either get an amazing HR person, or the company is small enough to have the IT staff doing the recruiting directly.  The other interviews I got (which generally went pretty well, just wasn't a good fit for me or them for one reason or another) were through friends of friends, acquaintances from various hobbies, and a rare few companies that are so IT-focused that their HR team actually knows what it is they're reading (and thus are worth applying at)."
fossworldproblems,2kvxh6,Spivak,1 point,Sat Nov 1 08:28:18 2014 UTC,"I now have the cred but IMHO another approach is to go through a technical recruiter ... said recruiter will pad your resume appropriately for each job individually. When you walk in the door tell the actual sysadmins interviewing you which sections to redact and lay all the inflation on the recruiter.   Recruiter will still get paid You are not guilty of lying    Warning: choose a good recruiter or you'll be getting bullshit spam for years. Avoid Robert Half Technologies like the plague, they are the ITT Tech of recruiting. A good way to find a good recruiter is to ask software organizations you want to work with who they work with. Referral is also a good system.  The job of the recruiter is to get you to the interview chair (and then to make you accept the job offer). A good one will not bother putting you in an interview for a job in an organization that doesn't likely have a role for you. They may put you in the wrong job interview seat but so what ... once you meet the people hiring they will shift you to the correct interview queue. So a recruiter may jam you in for Sr Sysadmin when you are in fact a Jr Sysadmin, for example, especially if they know the organization has the roles and is hiring for both. They are very persistent about getting you to sign the offer but at the same time know the true salary ranges and know how much the company is willing to flex upwards on your behalf, and also know the people truly responsible for hiring (typically a rung or two above the people interviewing you). Remember the recruiter is not 100% on your side so def fight the pressure if you don't want the job or don't like the terms.  Remember employers need you as much as you need them so it's just about getting past the HR filter."

If this fastsocket network replacement won't be integrated into the kernel, I won't profit from it. But maybe some people are jumping from the joy of discovering this and itching to rip out the beating heart of their server to replace it with this.  I couldn't care less about that iOS thing, but maybe it comes in handy for some.  I'm happy about the material design icons and bootstrap theme because I really dig that style, and always found all those free icon fonts a bit limited.  And finally I finished my master's thesis earlier this year and will soon start my PhD. A part of this PhD well consist in me moving my master's thesis project to ember, react, or angular, because my home-grown solution has no proper dependency graph of data changed leading to component updates.

Some bays are 7mm deep, others 9.5mm; you can fit a 7mm drive in a 9.5mm bay but not the other way around. Most new SSDs are 7mm thick because of this, and some of those (Crucial, Intel) come with a removable plastic bracket to make the SSD 9.5mm thick so it fits better in larger brackets."

fossworldproblems,2i7tvs,l4than-d3vers,10,Fri Oct 3 19:51:02 2014 UTC,"Git and Mercurial are very, very similar nowadays. You can access a Git repository from Mercurial and vice-versa without losing information. Git is faster and everyone's using it.   Mercurial is a bit slower, but much easier to extend as it's modular and written in Python. Facebook switched from Git to Mercurial because they needed caching, partial checkouts and some other performance optimizations (their repository is massive), and they decided that it would be easier to implement using Mercurial: https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/  Mercurial also has a very nice GUI, support for storing large files outside of the repository and an easier to use command line. It works better on Windows too. For  programmers, this doesn't matter as much, but for engineers or designers who've only used SVN before usability is important."

It's like you guys enjoy pain.   /u/smog_alado is incorrect. Mercurial comes with a rebase extension, and there is a (built-in, not an extension) cherry-pick equivalent called graft.  Edit: By the way, I'm not sure if Git also has this, but current Mercurial versions will track whether a changeset has been pushed anywhere, and error out if you try to do a history-editing operation that involves already-pushed changesets (unless forced, of course). The same facility also lets you mark changesets as not to be pushed (“secret”), so you don't accidentally push them before you're ready. It's pretty slick."

But maybe you could try it too, since it has good compatibility between word equations and LaTeX style equations?  pandoc file.docx -o file.docx.pdf   Although I have not checked if that works. I would probably only think of it as suitable for lecture material maybe, not for assignments where you must be able to see the exact same instructions."

Anyone can duplicate what Netflix does - in fact, many companies do - but Netflix still has a thriving business because they innovate, have the service model, and have the relationships to get the content. They could release the source and make as much money (if they don't have any glaring ""get movies for free"" bugs).  There are dozens of office productivity suites, including open source ones - Microsoft still dominates exclusively for business reasons. (Terrible, anticompetitive business reasons, but not because their source is closed.)  If your application is novel and scratches the itch a lot of us have, and no one else is doing it, you can make a lot of money being the first out the gate. But once you're out of the gate, there's nothing stopping anyone else from duplicating the functionality... then it's all business. (Note that there's no reason to release source before you release binaries - or hell, even releasing the source online! Make us send a self-addressed stamped envelope with CD-Rs - still complies with GPL!)  Or, if you've built something truly monumental, then you should really share that with the world for the benefit of all humanity.  TL;DR - share the source. There's no good reason not to."

Simple applications could be duplicated easily, and they surely will if enough eyes are on his application, or the problem it is solving.  But for most custom business software, in-house code is highly specific, marginally documented, and unlikeley to be used outside the business or even useful to practically anyone else.  In contrast, open source software is useful because it solves common problems that lots of people face.  But if your problem is highly domain-specific or totally unique, you are adding little or no value to the commons by releasing the source."

fossworldproblems,2gczpz,KisslessVirginLoser,1 point,Sun Sep 14 17:02:53 2014 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for that. Will definitely keep those points in mind.  For what it's worth, I decided to use Pentadactyl over Vimperator because of these two entries in the Pentadactyl FAQ.   Why did Pentadactyl split from Vimperator?  The reasons for the fork were mostly political, but mostly boil down to the fact that the current maintainer, while making no substantial contributions to the project for several years, continues to exercise full editorial control while actively soliciting donations with no transparency whatever. We considered the latter especially a slight on both our developers and our users, and after a considerable escalation of the degree of offense felt compelled to leave the project.   However, though we could no longer justify supporting the Vimperator project, we've invested considerable time and energy into the code over these past several years and still use and care about it. For that reason, we've decided to publicly release our personal changes and continue to develop the extension under a different name.   What differentiates Pentadactyl from Vimperator? The main difference is that Vimperator's most active developers have moved on to Pentadactyl. More qualitative changes may be found in the change log, but essentially add up to what we consider more active and thoughtful development. Among the most visible differences, as of Pentadactyl 1.0, are more extensive Firefox 4 support, significantly better startup time and completion performance, considerably better :sanitize and private mode support, a greatly improved incremental find implementation, major improvements in Ex command parsing (including the ability to separate commands with | and split long commands across lines), conditionals (:if/:else) in configuration files, greatly updated documentation, and a number of bug fixes."
fossworldproblems,2gczpz,valgrid,1 point,Sun Sep 14 18:34:19 2014 UTC,"So, i don't know how true all of that is anymore, but i haven't had vimperator fail in two years of leaving pentadactyl, and I keep hearing people complain that pentadactyl fails it isn't tested against the unstable releases of firefox before they are officially released.  I also did not like the way that pentadactyl just changes the whole look of firefox by default.  Vimperator is just a layer on top of firefox, and by default doesn't change thing like removing the toolbar by default.  You can choose to do that if you want, but it becomes a pain in pentadactyl sometimes."

fossworldproblems,2fuuob,ThatLinuxIT,11,Mon Sep 8 23:43:04 2014 UTC,"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as a gun, is in fact, GNU/gun, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus gun. A gun is not a weapon unto itself, but rather another component of a fully functioning GNU weapon made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell casings and vital system components comprising a full weapon as defined by POSIX.  Many gun users wield a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""gun"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.  There really are guns, and these people are using them, but they are just a part of the system they use. Gun is the kernel: the pomel in the hand that allocates the machine's ammunition to the other components that allow you to fire.

fossworldproblems,2fuuob,ke7ofi,2,Tue Sep 9 12:34:13 2014 UTC,"Got it:  I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as a foo, is in fact, GNU/foo, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus foo. A foo is not a foo itself, but rather another component of a fully functioning GNU foo made useful by the GNU foos, foos and foos comprising a full foo as defined by POSIX.  Many foo users wield a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""foo"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.  There really are foos, and these people are using them, but they are just a part of the system they use. Foo is the kernel: the foo in the hand that allocates the machine's foo to the other components that allow you to foo. The kernel is an essential part of an operating foo, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete foo. Foos are normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with foo added, or GNU/foo. All the so-called ""foo"" varieties are really distributions of GNU/foo."

fossworldproblems,2eel3e,argv_minus_one,4,Sun Aug 24 07:45:23 2014 UTC,Yep. PulseAudio was using ALSA features which most applications didn't touch before. So it revealed a lot of bugs.

I guess my other beef is with the audio networking thing that it does.  Brought our wifi network to its knees and took a while to figure out that PA was trying to route audio to everyone on the network or something insane like that.    I think PA fulfills a needed function, but overall linux audio feels like a big kludge.  Truthfully I've had much more trouble from jack, not to mention FFADO.

fossworldproblems,2dynyc,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Aug 19 19:29:42 2014 UTC,"QED (text editor):       QED is a line-oriented computer text editor that was developed by Butler Lampson and L. Peter Deutsch for the Berkeley Timesharing System running on the SDS 940. It was implemented by L. Peter Deutsch and Dana Angluin between 1965 and 1966.    QED (for ""quick editor"" ) addressed teleprinter usage, but systems ""for CRT displays [were] not considered, since many of their design considerations [were] quite different.""  Ken Thompson later wrote a version for CTSS; this version was notable for introducing regular expressions. Thompson rewrote QED in BCPL for Multics. The Multics version was ported to the GE-600 system used at Bell Labs in the late 1960s under GECOS and later GCOS after Honeywell took over GE's computer business. The GECOS-GCOS port used I/O routines written by A. W. Winklehoff. Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson and Brian Kernighan wrote the QED manuals used at Bell Labs.    Given that the authors were the primary developers of the Unix operating system, it is natural that QED had a strong influence on the classic UNIX text editors ed, sed and their descendants such as ex and sam,  and more distantly AWK and Perl.  A version of QED named FRED (Friendly Editor) was written at the University of Waterloo for Honeywell systems by Peter Fraser. A University of Toronto team consisting of Tom Duff, Rob Pike, Hugh Redelmeier, and David Tilbrook implemented a version of QED that runs on UNIX; David Tilbrook later included QED as part of his QEF tool set.
