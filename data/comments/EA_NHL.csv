EA_NHL,3e2mlv,andrewc1117,13,Tue Jul 21 15:41:08 2015 UTC,"Both would be good. I've played a lot of games with people in versus where they'd be a sore loser and complain about everything... I'd love to have the opportunity to make them put up or shut up. On the other end of the pendulum, I've played lots of great games against great opponents who I wish I could do a quick rematch with because it was such a good experience. Otherwise, it'd be nice to just be able to do a general rematch with the current team you have selected as well."

EA_NHL,3e4sqo,shane_solo,2,Tue Jul 21 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"I stop thinking of it as a ""game"" and more of a really stupid scrimmage mode. If I'm a defender and they are doing everything they can to give the other team the puck or score on our net -- I go into hardcore defensive mode and just focus on stopping it. If they are trolling as a goalie, and I'm a forward -- I'll just ignore the  score and focus on deking out the lazy forwards on the other team and try to score.   You just have to let go and play it for what it is. The best is when you get one on your team and you are defensive and then everyone on your team quits. Then I have fun trying to at least score one with my AI teammates before the game is over."

EA_NHL,3e1nft,sinapiet,9,Tue Jul 21 14:31:02 2015 UTC,It's easy but eats a lot of time. Basically you trade for future first round picks and once you acquire a few you can start trading down come draft time. (You trade your first round for there next year 1st 2nd and 3rd etc) I've only done this in madden but I'm sure you can abuse it the same. Evenentually if you dont like the first pick you can trade it for rediculous amounts.

A lot of people complain (myself included) about the repetitive dialogue and awkward contextual commentary in past iterations of the franchise, but the amount of work that goes into doing the recording is absurd... and it's not like normal, flowing dialogue, so it would be a hell of a lot more of a slog than simply commenting on a real game."

You’re just using your imagination,"" Emrick explains.   I've never really comprehended this logic. I understand that the process of splicing these snippets together prevents the VO from using specifics...but would it be that hard to maybe play the game on a big screen in front of them and have them narrate events that happen?  Would that not be much more organic and fine-tuned to intricacies about gameplay and visuals? That is, after all, what users want. Doc to narrate the game they are seeing, why can't he be seeing it too?   No wonder he seems so unenthused when the clock is at :40, because he cant see it!"
EA_NHL,3dyg2e,JohnnyForeskin,10,Mon Jul 20 15:41:30 2015 UTC,Thanks to Yewybear and B-bunny for answering all of our questions. Here is a link to a picture of the control scheme based on Yewybear's post on the forums:  PS4  Xbone

EA_NHL,3dyg2e,thugonice,4,Mon Jul 20 19:08:58 2015 UTC,I'm so excited to try goalie!
EA_NHL,3dyg2e,KidShowtime,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:55 2015 UTC,These controls look really polished compared to previous games. I like that.
EA_NHL,3dyg2e,wordlifetn97,4,Mon Jul 20 20:11:45 2015 UTC,"Here is a breakdown from Ben Ross regarding some of the changes to goalie controls.   Great to see discussion going around the controls already. Thought I would add a few comments to help explain a few things around controls and the intention behind them so that you can take them into consideration when interpreting the hands on impressions that have been posted and imagining how it may work for you.   The main reason we have hug post away from butterfly is because there aren't many people that play with two fingers up on their shoulder buttons and we need people to be able to get into VH while in Hug Post. If they were on the same side, you would be forced to use two fingers or go into regular hug post first and then back down into VH rather than straight from butterfly. This also allows for precision in butterfly using opposite hands since we didn't feel you needed precision in hug post.   Overall, we put Core Movement/Positioning on your Left hand and Saves on your Right hand.   You can press the left stick and drop to butterfly to get a traditional butterfly slide keeping that momentum or you can use the Right Stick to stretch out more towards the post on the side you are pressing to. The Right Stick move is more committed but takes away more of the bottom of the net to that side. You won't usually want to move left and right when tracking using the right stick as much as you would use it to make a final committed slide/save attempt but you may use it to quickly get to one side before standing up and squaring back up.   As a note on precision movement vs the t-pushes: Precision is different than it was in the past. In the past, you basically had side steps/strafes and smaller side steps. Now you have more squared up movement, used to track a single player with the puck and t-push movement (non-precision) to move quicker when the puck is moved a greater distance on a pass (it is more committed but gets you there quicker than strafing across). We wanted to give people full control over when they did both as opposed to assuming what movement you wanted based on puck distance in an effort to give more control to the Player.   Goalies should use Precision movement like Defenders use Vision Control. You are squared up tracking a single player until you know you need to pivot and commit using a t-push (which is like pivoting to forward skating on defense to get to the new spot before re-facing up).   The last thing I will add is that when flicking the right stick, it understands the angle of your deflection so it will push at the angle you press (except for straight up and down which are set for paddle down and pokecheck)    Ben"
EA_NHL,3dyg2e,Garism,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:02 2015 UTC,Upvote for visibility.  This is quality info^
EA_NHL,3dyg2e,Garism,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:14 2015 UTC,"I like the idea he mentioned where LB and RB would respectively hug the left post or the right post, also makes sense considering RB currently has no action mapped.   I remember in past years, the hug post button would sometimes send your goalie to the wrong side you were trying to cover, the LB/RB setup seems like it would resolve that issue."

The AI is certainly better (although of course there's plenty of room for improvement) and overall, it seems more realistic than the old gen of games. I can say for sure I set up more cycle forechecks in one year on Xbox One than I ever did in 8 years on X360.  But IDK, man. I try to enjoy games for what they are these days and not get totally wrapped up in missing features or gameplay imperfections. There are plenty of things to complain about but I don't get on the net and rage and spew hate and that sort of thing if there's something I don't like about a game. Just not worth it.  NHL 15 was undeniably a disappointment but I love the Arena / classic E-Sports approach they've taken to EASHL 16. I can't wait to see how the community engages with this mode and the sorts of games and high-level play we get to witness this year... I think we're in for a great year."

EA_NHL,3dz7wl,northman28,2,Mon Jul 20 20:37:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly your best bet is to either have one guy lock in at a position and let the other play the multiple positions OR to agree to how you do things.  When I play with my friend we agree that he won't switch players on the back check so that I can have control of the defensemen, and on the breakout or zone entry you make no passes to yourself.  You pass the puck and keep skating and let the other player switch to the recipient. After he receives the puck you switch to the next closest guy on the forecheck and open up or drive the net."
EA_NHL,3dz7wl,baultista,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:23 2015 UTC,"Or the third option, you now have the puck and it registers that last R2 to pass the puck to nobody in the offensive zone, ending the breakaway chance before it really started."

There's been times I want it to switch to a player close enough to either stick lift, poke or check the carrier off the puck, but instead it switches to a defenseman in the neutral zone. It's not that I'm holding the trigger down so it automatically drops to the player farthest back. So that's not the issue.

He noticed that his scout was scouting where he told him to go, but when he returned, the text saying where he went was wrong. Come the draft, however, everywhere he told the scout to go was completely scouted for. So it was just incorrect text from the scout.

EA_NHL,3dwt5a,MaxStreudler,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:17 2015 UTC,It was hardly touched on NHL 16.
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,B-Bunny_,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:30 2015 UTC,It was hardly touched for NHL15 either heh
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,TheFantasticFinn,4,Mon Jul 20 21:28:19 2015 UTC,So people are just circlejerking about HUT only getting the upgrades. Seems about right.
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,B-Bunny_,3,Mon Jul 20 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, nothing new here. This subreddit really loves circlejerking about anything that could potentially be even slightly negative against EA."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,TheFantasticFinn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:54 2015 UTC,All they added was play a friend and offline season. Barely any dev time went into hut for 16
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,ScottyK9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. The drop in quality of Be a GM mode is probably the most noticeable for me, as its my favourite in the series. It was a travesty in NHL 15 in fluidity and execution."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"Care to explain how people are vehemently disagreeing with him?   There are a few comments pointing out that he contradicted himself a few times, then 2 comments saying that they disagree with his points and the rest of the comments either agree with the video or say that they don't like 2BC as a youtuber.  You may not like HUT, and that's fine, but saying that it ruins the game is just not true. HUT was hardly touched at all in NHL16. Also, the gameplay on current gen took a huge step forward from last -> current gen.  E: I love this subreddit haha. Misleading bullshit is the highest upvoted comment and a comment calling that out gets downvoted. Fantastic subreddit."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,TheFantasticFinn,20,Mon Jul 20 21:35:08 2015 UTC,"he's so fucking right & I've been saying it for years. NHL 10 was my first online hockey game and it was the start of something great, or at least it was what I believed to be the start of something good at least. It hasn't been the same for me since NHL 12...they just keep taking huge steps back. Been following 2bc for years because he's an NHL you tuber who speaks the truth and doesn't bullshit like others do. This is awesome to hear. This subreddit is going to hate this truthful post."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,DynoMike25,17,Mon Jul 20 06:53:00 2015 UTC,This subreddit is going to hate this truthful post.   This subreddit is going to love a video that focuses on the negative sides of NHL games.

EA_NHL,3dwt5a,XxMiKeNjD17xX,9,Mon Jul 20 05:53:14 2015 UTC,This appears to be an NHL 15 rant. Not 16
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,BleedBlue_,5,Mon Jul 20 08:10:19 2015 UTC,he does discuss both though
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,DynoMike25,3,Mon Jul 20 12:31:21 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything, and he has some great ideas. Sad thing is that we all know they need to leave things out so they can have something to promote for the next years game. I have been playing NHL religiously since I can remember, and i've never played less than I did this year. It makes me mad, this game is garbage. I want 16 to be good, but I don't feel like it will be that much different. Atleast there will be EASHL, so I will buy it, looks like their EASHL RETURNS marketing is working.. which is good enough for them."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,CorsiGod,7,Tue Jul 21 03:05:25 2015 UTC,Also his point about mini games and fun is spot on...they focus so much on the simulation that they forget about the fun factor.
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,DynoMike25,12,Mon Jul 20 07:27:44 2015 UTC,The game is not even close to being a good hockey simulation.
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,TSands,7,Mon Jul 20 08:58:39 2015 UTC,"It's not perfect, but you can't honestly say it's not even close man."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,svodka,5,Mon Jul 20 14:34:18 2015 UTC,"I would argue that NHL 14 was closer, gameplay-wise.  Obviously 15 has the visuals, but there was a net loss of quality in the gameplay between the two."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,ilessthan3math,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:03 2015 UTC,I'd say the gameplay overall is better for current gen in NHL 15. Mainly the way goals can look so different from each other. But as far as features go it's one of the worst.
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,tonybateman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"Have you played it? The gameplay is atrocious. Hopefully NHL 16 proves otherwise. Even besides the gameplay they still have a ton of things to fix for it to be considered a ""good hockey simulation""."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,TSands,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have it for PS4, I agree that the gameplay is not great but my point was it's not completely horrible, there are some things they did right and hopefully 16 is better."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,svodka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:06:34 2015 UTC,Any game where the Toronto Maple Leafs consistently finish top 5 in the league in simulations while simultaneously tanking IRL isn't very realistic.
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,sixtycoffees,7,Mon Jul 20 20:26:52 2015 UTC,This is an NHL 15 rant.
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,marleau_12,3,Mon Jul 20 06:58:11 2015 UTC,I agree with some of his points.   EDIT: Someone posted it on the HUT subreddit. People don't seem too happy but that's probably because 2bc hates HUT and complained a lot about it in the video.
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,Captain_019,3,Mon Jul 20 17:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'll get down voted for this, and I'm not saying he's wrong about everything because he's absolutely right about a lot of things, mainly HUT. But wow, he just sounds bitter to me. The closest thing to in depth sports gaming is NBA 2K, that's the bar right now. 2K doesn't have a money making system post-release, EA does.   A lot of things being mentioned are incredibly over-specific and wouldn't be able to be put in the game anyways. I share a lot of his opinions. I've ranted a lot about 15 on here and with friends, but I'm not expecting them to change their business model.   Like he said, the dumb fans are the ones who are going to buy it regardless. We're just a spoke on the wheel, the wheel is going to keep turning and I understand that.   Want to do something good for hockey gaming? Start an online petition directed towards 2K to get their NHL series back...that's all I can think that would help us. Because this, the NHL 15 game, is going to be a never-ending cycle until we help ourselves."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,peroxwhyLUSH,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"He's probably played most of the NHL games, so it's frustrating to see how some of these issues come up year after year and the newest game loses features for no reason.  I'd love it if some company just creates a hockey game like this but better. They don't even need the real teams or players. They could make all those up but just have one game that they constantly update and add features. That's my dream game anyway."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,tonybateman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:58:39 2015 UTC,It's very frustrating.
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,peroxwhyLUSH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:17 2015 UTC,"2K doesn't have a money making system post-release, EA does.   Uhhh, have you played an NBA game lately? They are no different than EA - they sell in-game currency (VC) that you use to purchase clothing, attribute points for your player, etc. It's literally the same concept - you can earn those points by playing games (just like you can earn coins in NHL by playing games) but it takes ages longer than just spending $20 on some VC or $20 on a pack of players.   Also, NBA's version of ultimate team is no different either. Contracts cost a ton, you can buy packs, etc.  This place is just circlejerking this topic. It's turned into ""let's complain about a game that none of us have even played yet! Just to complain! Because we know everything!"" Not to mention, Superbman has always been critical of HUT. Always. He's just doing this to get people going and stir the pot."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,RemoteSenses,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"Alright, fair point.   However, it's not 2K's main focus. They don't update MyTeam every day, adding new players and new cards etc.  VC is up for purchase, but it doesn't seem like it's pushed as much as EA pushes HUT.   You're right in your comment, I don't disagree with you. I just feel like EA sinks their time and effort into the game mode where they have purchases and their virtual currency to get their money back. Whereas, 2K seemingly gives you this whole game, a complete game and allows you to purchase VC. MyTeam doesn't feel favoured over MyGM, MyCareer, and MyLeague.   And I agree with you that this is becoming a circle jerk. Everybody seemingly hates the game without having tested it. I don't see how 16 will have any less features than 14 did. I disliked 15, because of its lack of features. And I've still sunk 600+ hours into it too, because I love the gameplay."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,peroxwhyLUSH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:09 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that all of us are diehard NHL fans - that's why we browse this subreddit and others like it, so we find it easier to pick out things like you mention. If NBA2k had a subreddit (maybe it does, idk) I'm sure people would be complaining about similar things.  They are fair complaints - I will agree with you there, but honestly can you blame them for pushing a gamemode that makes them more money? From a marketing standpoint it makes complete sense to promote HUT like they do - they have no reason to promote GM Mode or Be a Pro because there's nothing to sell you there. You play the mode and that's it - there's no reason to promote it.  With HUT, they're constantly adding players which means pack sales, which means promoting those players and packs, which means more money in their pockets. With that said, they're not forcing anyone to buy those packs and their advertising of it is justifiable because HUT makes them extra money whereas Be a Pro and EASHL do not - and those modes don't need exposure.   I also don't believe that their advertising and promotion has anything to do with how much attention a game mode gets. I don't think they're sitting there saying ""we're going to fuck up EASHL so more people play HUT!"" I truly don't believe that is their idea but sadly there are a ton of people around here that believe that."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,RemoteSenses,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:29 2015 UTC,"No I don't believe they're intentionally doing that either, not enough manpower to create what the diehards wanted, and here we are.  If I'm not mistaken, in my original comment I talked about their business model, and you mirrored my comments perfectly. I don't expect them to change it, and frankly I don't care if they do or don't. I'll still play and enjoy the game. Would I like more emphasis on the other modes I enjoy a lot more than HUT? Of course. But I'm not as unrealistic as some in this sub to suggest all they care about is HUT and THAT's why the other game modes lacked.   If the alleged story of having less of a dev team because of the UFC launch is accurate, I would believe more of a story along the lines of them having to go all out for just one game mode...and why wouldn't it be HUT?   There's too much complaining, we agree on that point. I've complained, but I've begun to accept this may be the way it's going to be. And on that point, if they're improving the game on top of 15, and I've played 600+ hours...why wouldn't I like 16?   Some of the diehards are cynical, and that's okay. The first two months of the 16 launch will be very reminiscent to what we see hear, but I think it'll calm down."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,peroxwhyLUSH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's like this with a lot of games that get released yearly. Battlefield and COD instantly come to mind. People complain that they're just reskinned versions of the previous year with a few new guns and new maps (not really true but not really entirely wrong either) but since the games literally barely change, we use that as a complaint.   I'm just not really sure what people want out of a sports game. There's only so much you can possibly do to make a sports game better. Madden has felt like the same game for the past decade and besides graphics and movement improvements, I don't see any major changes in the past decade...it's a football game.  Are there things we could definitely use in NHL? Of course there are, and I feel like most of them we'll get this year aside from a few things, yet people will still find a reason to complain."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,RemoteSenses,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:05 2015 UTC,"Wholeheartedly agree with you. Madden 15 was honestly not that good. Cool presentation, but they've churned out the same terrible game over and over again. I mean, they even removed the cool career mode that existed in Madden 06 and 07.  And there is only so far you can go before it plateau's and we're probably getting to that point."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,peroxwhyLUSH,5,Tue Jul 21 20:42:48 2015 UTC,"I've been preaching the same things that Johnny talked about in this video over in r/hut for nearly two years now; of which I always got a ton of flak for. As he said in his video... ""young, impressionable, naive kids."" Couldn't be closer to the truth."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,JerBear81,-2,Mon Jul 20 07:24:14 2015 UTC,"Right. Everyone on /r/NHLHUT is a young, naive, impressionable kid, because someone didn't agree with a rant of yours? Generalizing much?  Hardly anyone, anywhere is happy with what EA is doing with NHL, but it's all very understandable from a business standpoint. Why bother too much with a game where they have no competition, when they could use the money more elsewhere?  E: My record for downvotes is around -10. Let's see if we can beat that!

I'm actually one of it's original members (probably first 30) of that sub, and have been around quite a bit .

EA_NHL,3dwt5a,eDgEIN708,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:34:57 2015 UTC,"Agree with just about everything Johnny said. 15 is just bad in so many ways, which was such a huge disappointment, because there was no other game I wanted to play more than NHL 15 at this time last year.   The dev team is trying to come off as more forthcoming and transparent this year, but I have a hard time buying it. I want to believe that the team is doing everything they possibly can to make a great hockey game, but I don't know, there is still something that feels disingenuous about it all. They announced the feature set right away and recently detailed some of the gameplay improvements for 16, but it still looks like the franchise is just playing catch up to where we were with 14.  I understand that the Vancouver team is small and it makes development problems that much harder to solve because of it. However, I'm pretty sure EA's CEO said the Ignite engine was built so games like 15 and the Xbox 360 version of Madden 06 wouldn't happen if I remember correctly.   Sorry for posting a rant of my own here, but I'm just really worried about where the NHL franchise is heading, and I think Johnny's video does a really good job of explaining why.  Also, I've played HUT a lot this year. I like the mode, but yeah, the microtransactions in it are just evil.   And last thing, the soccer game with cars Johnny was talking about early into the video is called Rocket League. It's free for PS Plus members if you have a PS4. Highly recommend it."
EA_NHL,3dwt5a,itssnick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"Poke checks were better in 14 because they weren't broken. That, and you didn't need to rely on it as a crutch since you could actually hit and block shots.   Edit: I love Superbman. One of the few guys who aren't indoctrinated by free HUT packs from EA and tells it mostly how it is."
EA_NHL,3e186r,LiveHigh,5,Tue Jul 21 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"When you become a high level player, you are playing against other high level players. (No shit, right) The problem is to become that high level you need to win a lot, and cheesing and playing the game as opposed to playing hockey is the more common way to do that. It's just like any other game, in fps higher level players can be good, but they can also be using modded controllers or other exploits.   Perhaps there could be some player feedback option, but that would just be abused anyway."
EA_NHL,3e186r,andrewc1117,5,Tue Jul 21 15:47:13 2015 UTC,"I played the #5 overall guy in a tournament and he did exactly this.  Take Chicago, tie up every faceoff.  Pass the puck to a forward and basically just figure skate endlessly until a glitch shot opens up.  If I have to choose between being average and playing hockey or being a leaderboard guy and playing like they do, I'll take being average. I love the sport far too much to see it played the way some guys do, and don't think I'll ever be able to ignore my hockey instincts on favour of that.  Even defense... I like to stay chest to chest and wait for one well-timed pokecheck, sticklift, or hit.  It doesn't make sense to me to endlessly smash the pokecheck/sticklift button to create a puck loss forcefield around the D-man, but sadly that's what is most effective in this game.   I mean you don't become successful at COD or Battlefield by playing them like you're really in a live warzone, so it doesn't surprise me that you can't be at the top of the leaderboard by trying to play like EA NHL like a pure hockey simulation."

EA_NHL,3e186r,Headup31,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:08 2015 UTC,Honestly it just really sucks I wish there was some sort of community of high level players that don't look for the games easiest ways to score because I could do that all day too it's just not fun. I rather set up a perfect passing play and use elements like dump and chase more instead of just scoring in the slot with a toe drag wrist shot left analog to the left shot to the right goal with  datsyk like your sooooo good buddy...

EA_NHL,3dvhud,Cynepkokc,13,Mon Jul 20 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"I've done this before, the whole time you just break into the zone off the face off and wrist or slap it from the slot.  It is so. Fucking. Boring. But fun for some reason, who doesn't love winning by a metric fuckton?"
EA_NHL,3dvhud,kratrz,-3,Sun Jul 19 22:58:39 2015 UTC,So boring. You could've spent all that time doing something productive. Even sitting there and scratching your balls for an hour would've been better.

EA_NHL,3dvhud,DasMuse,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:46 2015 UTC,because the time on attack combined adds up to almost 20 minutes
EA_NHL,3dvhud,Eraxon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:32 2015 UTC,But I don't think the RB button in the top left of the screen is there during the intermission is it? It is just for switching to the three stars IIRC.
EA_NHL,3dvhud,DasMuse,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"Sure, he may have only played a 20 minute game, but it's still only one period worth of hockey."
EA_NHL,3dvhud,Pretty_Fly_For_A_,5,Tue Jul 21 17:19:05 2015 UTC,I'm more surprised your goalie stopped 23 shots!
EA_NHL,3dvhud,jas0660,3,Mon Jul 20 01:20:21 2015 UTC,"You had over a 50% shooting percentage...Jesus  Now if only we could do that in the FIFA world cup, that'd be great"

EA_NHL,3dvxnv,LiamMcFearson,3,Sun Jul 19 23:52:30 2015 UTC,I've actually already done this for a twitch broadcast a few weeks ago. I actually still have an hour's worth of footage. Not trying to promote myself but thought you'd be interested to see how I did it.  Skip to about the 3-minute mark. This was mostly a test of my computer and twitch.  http://youtu.be/95qjfonBNCc

EA_NHL,3dtrtj,TheKandyCinema,15,Sun Jul 19 11:28:09 2015 UTC,A worthy contract for The Lord and Savior John Klingberg
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,evnted,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:57:18 2015 UTC,If only he was like that on my team. His best season was 21 points and a +/- of -3
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,r35h93,11,Tue Jul 21 12:35:36 2015 UTC,Still a better contract then Andrew MacDonald
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,YouBatRastard,3,Sun Jul 19 18:17:37 2015 UTC,Haha you're telling me. Add Lecavilier into that.
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,ManWithAPIan,2,Sun Jul 19 21:15:50 2015 UTC,You're welcome
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,jonnyvice,8,Tue Jul 21 19:15:44 2015 UTC,He deserves more
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,Lawlzstomp,4,Sun Jul 19 16:01:19 2015 UTC,He had this contract at the beginning of the year and I dealt with it for 3 years before I bought him out.
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,wtfwjondo,3,Sun Jul 19 11:29:06 2015 UTC,How did he get 9M a year?
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,yosoo,2,Sun Jul 19 12:29:52 2015 UTC,I could be wrong but I've noticed if you're below the minimum cap sometimes players get a nice bonus to make sure you meet the minimum
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,callzor,3,Sun Jul 19 17:09:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that's what happened. I did a challenge where I can have no players over 80 overall and my cap was 39 million. I've also had a file where Michael Raffl was playing for free.
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,thehaze01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"Just sign a terrible player to a 1 year, 10 million dollar contract or something"
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,baultista,2,Mon Jul 20 00:20:53 2015 UTC,i liked the other glitch more.   when the game was newly released you could offer your players who were already under contract an entry level deal.  Even tho Parise was making 7.5 for 10 years he would accept a 3 year deal for 0.925 mil
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:19 2015 UTC,I had this too. Took them quite a while to patch it up.
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:30:56 2015 UTC,The team probably needed to hit the cap floor so the SIM engine made them sign a player to a stupid contract.
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,dvanha,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:05:04 2015 UTC,Potential: Low   This is one of the reasons I feel that NHL 15 is sort of a joke.

EA_NHL,3dtrtj,Cadian,-6,Wed Jul 22 00:47:15 2015 UTC,Is it really a glitch considering he was last year's best rookie d-man?
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,ManWithAPIan,6,Sun Jul 19 18:17:06 2015 UTC,So a defenseman coming off a good rookie season deserves 9 million a year?
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,Cadian,5,Sun Jul 19 21:18:14 2015 UTC,Ekblad was way better
EA_NHL,3dtrtj,ManWithAPIan,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:06:28 2015 UTC,"LOL Ekblad is younger but look at the actual stats and factor games played and say way better again with a straight face, I dare you.  Klingberg > Ekblad across the board.  Time will tell but it's pretty fucking ignorant to say he was way better when the stats indicate Klingberg as the better player."
EA_NHL,3dtpxl,DianMa,23,Sun Jul 19 10:53:21 2015 UTC,Technically it is still accurate...
EA_NHL,3dtpxl,Netminder70,-2,Sun Jul 19 15:38:52 2015 UTC,Well I started a new Be A Pro and in my first game doc said this.

EA_NHL,3dvqm3,Graaaaape,3,Sun Jul 19 22:51:49 2015 UTC,I believe you accidentally clicked in the Left Stick while in the menu screen. It locks on to a position player and is very tiny to see. Once you get into the game you cannot change this.
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,B-Bunny_,10,Sat Jul 18 23:18:29 2015 UTC,"Not a very important question but:   Are they using actual music in the menus or are they using the ""epic Symphony"" like 15 and Madden?"
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Zigs44,4,Sat Jul 18 23:52:40 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they can use all the authentic goal songs in the menus.
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,luger33,7,Sun Jul 19 01:33:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm hoping they stick with the symphony music.  I find that it gets on my nerves for its repetition a lot less than their usual soundtracks do. It's lower key and just falls into the background for me, whereas cycling through the same half-dozen rock songs becomes a much more obvious repetitive cycle."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,infidelappel,2,Sun Jul 19 13:11:58 2015 UTC,Yea after the first month of NHL14/13/12 I would mute all the music. The NHL15 warbling never really got on my nerves though. Hope they stick with the atmospheric.
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,jmkep,2,Sun Jul 19 14:23:21 2015 UTC,To be honest I had my TV muted since we had like 12 TV's in the same room going at the same time. I kind of tuned any background noise out with actual conversation going on most of the time.
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,jacksonvstheworld,10,Sun Jul 19 17:57:26 2015 UTC,Does GM Mode have a fantasy draft?

EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Iknowwhereyoualllive,8,Sun Jul 19 01:11:12 2015 UTC,THANK GOD! And thank you for your quick answer!
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Iknowwhereyoualllive,4,Sun Jul 19 01:13:35 2015 UTC,Are there NTCs in Be A GM? It would be a cool feature to see.
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,MD_BOOMSDAY,4,Sun Jul 19 00:13:24 2015 UTC,"Nope, not this year."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,MD_BOOMSDAY,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:15:18 2015 UTC,Was the goalie interference issue fixed? Like when the player would manual goalie out of the net to hit the player and draw a penalty?
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,ArtyThePoopie,5,Sun Jul 19 01:50:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't see any of those issues during the event this time around.
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,MD_BOOMSDAY,6,Sun Jul 19 02:00:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for doing this!  1) When you draft players are there animations/sequences of the actual draft stage area or putting on a jersey?  2) Did you see what the Stanley Cup celebration is? Can you skate with the cup?  3) In GM mode when you trade players is it just a text screen?  4) How awesome out of 16 would you rate the game? Yes...16.
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,TheRieminster,6,Sun Jul 19 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"No I didn't see it, but I'm sure it's the exact same. Yeah, same as 15 but with an added trade value bar at the bottom so you can see visually how close it is. Kind of like how MLB The Show has it. Probably an 8"
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Eraxon,2,Sun Jul 19 01:16:40 2015 UTC,Thank you for sharing your answers to my questions!  Wow...I'm pretty disappointed so far in what to expect.  Your 8 out of 16 doesn't exactly inspire a tremendous amount of confidence.
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Eraxon,2,Sun Jul 19 09:10:12 2015 UTC,But why would you expect any of that stuff though
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,BleedBlue_,3,Sun Jul 19 13:10:33 2015 UTC,"Oh I read that last question wrong, thought you meant out of 10. 7 or an 8 out of 10 for sure."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,mavLP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:47:44 2015 UTC,Oh my that's much better.  Thank you!
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,mavLP,3,Sun Jul 19 20:14:09 2015 UTC,Thoughts on GM mode? Have the menus improved?
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,dez04,9,Sat Jul 18 23:20:05 2015 UTC,"The menus all around are 100% faster. Im not a hardcore Be a GM guy but the morale system does help get you entwined into the mode if you really want to be. Trading logic was supposedly changed around a bit and fixed, made more realistic so you couldnt just stock up on 1st rounders. Tampa isnt just going to give away Stammer unless they feel they are getting someone of close to equal value in return right away. Stuff like that."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Quacksnooze,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:29:54 2015 UTC,When saying 100% faster - do you mean they are twice as fast or just that they are definitely faster? Also is simulating a few days in Be A GM/Pro faster as well?
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,dez04,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't sit there and time the differences, it's a lot faster. It's how a normal game should be at. And yes simming is just as quick."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,BleedBlue_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, sounds great!"
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,BleedBlue_,3,Tue Jul 21 16:31:11 2015 UTC,"Please. Anything about EASHL goalie or goalie in general?  EDIT: to elaborate. Did they use the new goalie builds with you? Did you notice the t-push? Are butterfly, hybrid, and stand ups the same size? Can you comment on the attribute difference? My inclination is everyone will use hybrid which I hope isn't the case. I also hope given you can tell what build the other team is using it isn't easily exploitable (butterfly? Shoot high) that sort of thing. Thanks in advance"
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,BleedBlue_,5,Sat Jul 18 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"The new goalies were in, theyre all the same height - 6'2 i think it was. Now im not a goalie and I dont play goalie, but a lot of people were playing it and talking about them the entire trip so I can relay what I know. The T-push is there and works well. The new goalie has a pretty steep learning curve - youre probably going to get frustrated early on because of how foreign it works and feels, but youll get the hang of it with more games obviously. Ive also kind of came to the conclusion that they arent perfected yet either, they are definitely still doing some funky things here and there which is unfortunate.   Not once did I notice anybody trying to exploit specific goalie class picks, probably moreso because every human goalie was still getting used to the new G style."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,zade831,2,Sat Jul 18 23:45:48 2015 UTC,"Huge two question regarding goalies. Is the reverse-VH in, or do the goalies still default to the VH on the post?  Second question: is there still an invisible wall around the goal line and posts? If there still isn't a way to go into the reverse-VH, being able to push the skate to the post will provide a similar way to seal the post, albeit not perfect."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,FlawlessAlles,2,Sun Jul 19 01:55:25 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm not the best person to answer this question but I really don't recall seeing either of those animations in when the goalie hugged the post.
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,zade831,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:00:27 2015 UTC,The VH is the one in with the old set of animations. Thanks anyway though. Do you know if there's still the invisible wall on the goal line? Also do you know someone that would be better to ask?
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,beaverskeet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:49:54 2015 UTC,... Did they fix the trapper position?    http://imgur.com/HaMzEOu  From that to ...  http://imgur.com/NgEDWcD  This!

EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Gollyy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:15:34 2015 UTC,So if you played G in previous gens you think there will still be a difficult transition?
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Garism,2,Sun Jul 19 00:02:40 2015 UTC,"I think if you've played G you have an advantage over anyone who hasn't played G before - but from what I've seen and heard from the other guys it's going to do two things:  Make a lot of goalies mad/frustrated because of how different and hard it is off the bat and that there are still issues with it so that's further frustration.  It's not all bad though there's definitely improvements, something cool I noticed is when you go to do a manual dive save, you can keep your G laying on the ice instead of him doing an auto animation to stand back up right away and the other team gets a cheap goal due to it. There's other things but that's one I can recall off the top of my head."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Garism,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:19:03 2015 UTC,I'll take the good with the bad. Personally I'm stoked to get ANYTHING new for the goalie position. I just hope they make it a priority to continue to improve it upon release
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,OmarV,2,Sun Jul 19 00:25:44 2015 UTC,"I wanna say it probably should've been a 2 year project that they tried doing in 1 year and they didn't want to keep you guys untouched for an entire year again so I feel like you'll be in an inbetween year if that makes sense. They definitely want to keep working on goalie, it's a really difficult position to make work well in a videogame."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Guardian05,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:51:00 2015 UTC,I can understand that. No one wants to play a video game you can't score in. Its gotta be really difficult to balance that out though.
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,Garism,3,Sun Jul 19 00:59:53 2015 UTC,"Will it be possible to customize how much ice time each line gets in the future? For example, Line 4 gets more ice time that Line 3 and so forth. At the moment, auto line change gives the most ice time to the line with the higher average rating. I want to be able to decide which line gets more ice without having to manually change lines. Thanks"
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,KillerPanda24,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"Ummm, i think that's called make your 4th line your 3rd line..."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,jonvon-deblenre,2,Sun Jul 19 16:13:05 2015 UTC,that does not work. Auto line change still gives more ice time to the line with a higher average rating
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,KillerPanda24,5,Mon Jul 20 06:05:52 2015 UTC,How much improved is gameplay?
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,KillerPanda24,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:48:48 2015 UTC,The overplay gameplay video that was posted here a few days ago covered that question quite well.  E: Does this please the downvoters?
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,DBacon1052,2,Sun Jul 19 06:50:48 2015 UTC,Do you have any news on Be-A-Pro? Is it like NHL 13 or is there more to it than playing a game and continuing to the next?
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,DengarRoth,3,Sun Jul 19 00:44:25 2015 UTC,I believe it just got a small facelift on stuff like coach feedback and sim to shift.

As in, where will we be able to scout for people on our teams? Because imo drop in allows 2 things, test our which skill build suits your playstyle and scouting. I know OTP and EASHL-drop in are often mixed, but OTP is NHL teams, drop in is EASHL builds. Do you know anything about it or is EASHL just club only where OTP is the drop in/scout?"

EA_NHL,3ds7qe,OmarV,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:23:18 2015 UTC,"My god, having this issue again in 16 would reflect an embarrassing lack of QA testing."
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,TheFlappyGiraffe,2,Mon Jul 20 19:11:13 2015 UTC,"I have three concerning EASHL:  First, I don't suppose you could list what the 16 skater classes are? Or at least recall as many as you can?  Second, around what level of skill were they at? By that I mean, are we all hovering around 60 overall or 80?  Third, if an EASHL team isn't playing 6v6, how are the classes of the AI controlled players determined? Is it a team setting? Captain's choice each game at the selection screen? Is it predetermined by the classes of the players? Is it *shudder* random?  Thanks in advance for any info!"
EA_NHL,3ds7qe,infidelappel,4,Sun Jul 19 00:06:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Game Changer, but I do have some answers to your questions based off of what I am reading from the Game Changers themselves on different websites.  1. The classes from what I have heard are the exact same as they were on NHL 14 and 15 on last gen.   Forwards have: Sniper, Playmaker, Grinder, 2-Way Fwd, Power Fwd, Enforcer.  Defense has: Offensive D-man, Defensive D-man, 2-Way D-man, and Enforcer.  Goalie has: Hybrid, Butterfly, Stand-up  2. They have said that the pre-set classes have the skill set/attributes of a 2nd liner. So mid 80's everywhere except for a few 90's and those are probably going to be what that class specializes in. So a Sniper will have 90 wrist shot power, but a 2-way fwd will have 85 for example.  3. Now this wasn't totally clear to me either when I read the answer to this same question someone else asked, but I believe they said that EA was going to do something like all the AI would be 2-way builds so they aren't great at any specific thing and are all around decent. So I'd imagine with AI forwards they would be a 2-way forward, AI defense would be 2-way d-men, and AI goalies would be hybrids."

Don't recall seeing an actual overall (the stats screen isn't like the old eashl stats screen in the pause menu - it's cluttered and you have to go to box score and home/away stats which I don't believe shows the overall...if it does I don't remember)  It's not decided by us, and it's not totally random either.

EA_NHL,3ds7qe,McMLeProphetz,4,Sat Jul 18 23:21:39 2015 UTC,"Kind of subjective of a question. And are we talking VS? Eashl? Maybe elaborate a little more.  The passes actually go where you want them to go in VS now, which was a huge issue for me in 15. Id be aiming to the slot and itd pass to the dman or vice versa.  Eashl its become more difficult to make the stick to stick passes on a whim, which is a good thing."

EA_NHL,3dqe1l,Brotherauron,3,Sat Jul 18 12:58:36 2015 UTC,This is a great question to ask the Gamechangers or Ask EA NHL. Would be interesting to see how that works if you can't select it for your team.  EDIT: Just submitted it to Ask EA NHL. Personally I will have lost what remaining respect I had for EA if the answer is that it's random. How can they say they want the focus to be on balance when they leave it up to random chance whether your extra guy is an Enforcer or a Sniper?
EA_NHL,3dqe1l,eDgEIN708,5,Sat Jul 18 14:06:54 2015 UTC,I just asked @theflopfish on Twitter. Definitely an important aspect of EASHL that I hope wasn't overlooked.
EA_NHL,3dqe1l,SilverStick,2,Sat Jul 18 15:53:01 2015 UTC,Wicked! Thanks!  Definitely hope it's either selectable by the Captain each game or at the very least a default setting for the team in the options.  I'd hate to see it being something silly like it being random or even the game deciding based on the player types of the other users. The second is almost as bad as it being random because you're forced to play with that team mate type when maybe you'd want to try something else.

EA_NHL,3dqe1l,B-Bunny_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"It seemed like every time I played whether it was drop ins, or 2v2, 3v3 eashl, the AI would never be the same.  Sometimes they'd have a great shot, terrible at passing, or amazing at passing.  Why leave it at the ""safe"" choice of a 2 way forward, when I can have a more specialized option? Maybe I want to be the defensive minded forward, and play with an AI sniper and playmaker, a grinder and a sniper, or some other combo.  The AI packages have to already exist for sniper/playmaker/grinder etc, so why not let us choose what AI we can play with?"
EA_NHL,3dqe1l,Walbeb24,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"Just taking a stab but id guess because a system like that has never existed in NHL before and even if they wanted to go with that route, time wouldnt permit it to be an option for 16."

EA_NHL,3dp8hx,TheKandyCinema,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:46:35 2015 UTC,In my first year I couldn't get anyone to trade so I sent the majority of the players to the AHL so they could get dumped in waivers. I then signed all the best free agents available in overall  and age/overall at the beginning of the season. Team still sucked but the cap issue was fixed. I got McJesus in the draft and signed Kane in FA. So this team is starting to come together.

EA_NHL,3dmgqq,UnhingedSalmon,5,Fri Jul 17 13:43:56 2015 UTC,It's annoying playing the computer but to once you learn it's tricks it's not hard to win. In GM I can put up 10-12. Goals in 5 minute periods on the original difficulty. I do agree though the computer hardly ever gets a slashing penalty for using stick lift.

EA_NHL,3dmgqq,xStaabOnMyKnobx,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:48 2015 UTC,"The block pass button must be so useless I've never even heard of it. I used to strictly use poke check on defense and nothing more. It's a lot to ask for, your player cutting out a pass, even if you are in perfect position and know where it's going. Some people just spam cross-crease and it's impossible to cut out all the passes"

There's another guy called Mikey (? i think) that has gotten good feedback on his sliders for next gen.  A great website to look through would be operationsports.com  There's a lot of good material there and you can probably find the slider that works perfectly for you.  NOTE: You may need to use different sliders for different game modes. It's just the way the game was tailored to be played (ie I use different sliders for Live the Life than GM mode because Live the Life is centered around you carrying the team, and to make it more realistic, I had to up all my teammates so I wasn't constantly carrying the team as a third line grinding center)"

EA_NHL,3djw51,OutcastFalcon,0,Fri Jul 17 16:37:38 2015 UTC,The only thing fifa does wrong imo is put a relatively low ceiling on your player. I don't want to be capped at 88 ovr. I want the ability to increase ALL my stats to become a superstar and with the accomplishment system in My Player that's just not possible.
EA_NHL,3djw51,xStaabOnMyKnobx,5,Fri Jul 17 14:45:43 2015 UTC,I have never played Fifa can you explain their system.
EA_NHL,3djw51,MDVYN,3,Fri Jul 17 12:00:23 2015 UTC,"Basically it's called the accomplishment system. You don't earn xp after every game or anything but the game tracks everything you do. Short passing, long passing, crosses, goals, goals outside the box, dribbling past players, tackles, slide tackles, and many other things as well as season achievements like winning the league.  The only problem with it in my opinion is you are limited by what you can accomplish depending on your position and playstyle. For example my last my player was a Forward, who's role was a finisher and I maxed out at 87 ovr. I want a system where I can get my player to Messi level or Ronaldo level which isn't possible for all positions in fifa."
EA_NHL,3djw51,xStaabOnMyKnobx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:49:11 2015 UTC,I'm on the same boat. I guess I should go play via EA Access to see why people keep bringing this up.
EA_NHL,3djw51,OmarV,7,Fri Jul 17 14:46:10 2015 UTC,The NBA 2k15 system is sort of like that. They also have the skill progression but aside from that you gain coins from playing in MyCareer (Be a Pro) and online MyPark (EASHL) and you can purchase anything from a hat to wear during the game to fancy passes to execute during a game to dance moves after you win. I actually really like the system and think it would be sweet for NHL too.
EA_NHL,3djw51,Fer6y,7,Thu Jul 16 21:55:39 2015 UTC,The game changers have constantly been telling us there's something for EASHL progression that they haven't told us yet.  My guess is that it's exactly this. They added a ton of aesthetics customization this year; I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of that stuff is rank-related.
EA_NHL,3djw51,infidelappel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:42:50 2015 UTC,That might be the thing that they're going to tell us later this week for the people that have opted in to receive email updates from them.

EA_NHL,3djw51,OmarV,5,Fri Jul 17 13:39:52 2015 UTC,"As soon as you said, player progression is player aesthetic, I thought that works; as long as there are no gold or silver sticks or helmets.

EA_NHL,3djw51,OmarV,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:08:16 2015 UTC,"Well you would need something as a ""high cost"" prize. Something that would take people a while to save up for, and show tenure in the game.

Now, people would just quit if they see the other team has a bunch of golden sticks.  If we work towards anything, it something like a special celebration. Maybe, more jerseys to select from for the team."
EA_NHL,3djw51,baultista,2,Fri Jul 17 13:51:29 2015 UTC,I like this. It gives you something to work for while not actually changing the gameplay.
EA_NHL,3djw51,bazbierk,2,Thu Jul 16 22:14:29 2015 UTC,"I honestly think they're just going to settle on this.  I feel like maybe they have another nice feature to announce for EASHL that we'll get next week, but my thought is that they're hoping the ability to play as a team is enough.  While I loved customizing and felt a desire to play lots of games to grind to Legend 3, I'll admit that I hated every minute of it.  Playing with my friends is what made EASHL fun.   They had two major issues they wanted to solve:   Accessibility for new players Balance across the board   They had come up with solutions in the past that didn't work.  Boost packs were designed to give new players accessibility to EASHL, but of course they were just a temporary patch until you got up to a certain point.  A boost pack player would get trounced by a Legend 3.  They tried to balance things out with maximum attributes to spend and attribute caps by player type, and while that smoothed things out as compared to NHL 09 where guys had killer shots (to be fair, many were using the 99 glitch) it left you with a lot of ""template builds"" that people would use. In a 2v2 matchup your opponents were always 5'7 grinders because that build type had the most speed.  The speed advantage negated once you got to 4s and up, but again that's an accessibility barrier.  I'll admit that I will miss making a player uniquely my own in terms of attributes to suit my playstyle, but in the end it may be for the best."
EA_NHL,3djw51,_0o0_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"In any game you play, whether its a sports game or a MMO, it's fun to see your character strengthen and get stronger/better as you progress. It just never felt like the right way to go about in EASHL. The skill imbalance was too dominating, sometimes I felt that I couldnt play ranked until I hit Legend 2 or 3 just because my character was so far behind.    This is the better system, in terms of character statistics."
EA_NHL,3djw51,Whiiteyman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:14:05 2015 UTC,"If it truly was about accessibility and balance, then EA may as well let us select any NHL player, change the name and equipment to our likes, and let er rip."

If I had to guess I'd think they would do something similar to FIFA where they add ""goals"" to reach to level up a stat. It works well with FIFA and fits with their ""styles"" of play idea."
EA_NHL,3djw51,bazbierk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:11:54 2015 UTC,"In other words, you're saying they borrowed a page from FIFAs book, right?  Honestly, that's not a terrible idea because FIFA, 15 at least, has a double system in place for kit options. Basically you have: * Accomplishments: Doing stuff in-game to unlock various options -hair, long-sleeves, gloves, tapes, and more boots to choose from. * Store: Everything you do in game rewards you game currency...that can be used for FUT, or you can buy more customization options such as various footy/soccer balls and boots, and even vintage/optional jerseys for various teams. But these are progressed by leveling, so if you're level 8, you can't buy that level 10 item you want...you'd have to play a few more games to get there in order to purchase it first.  Going with that idea, that's be cool to unlock additional sticks, skates, visor tints/tape colors, random kit (ear/skate protectors)...maybe even long hair options that aren't limited to the slick back look.  Yeah, I think I'd be cool with this setup... I play EASHL/Drop-in/OTP 98% of the time anyways...barring that Drop-In/OTP are different this year, I'd focus on EASHL as there's more potential for reward to be had there...unless EA let's the actions from our Drop-In/OTP play count towards unlocks, or specific unlocks."
EA_NHL,3djw51,luger33,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:59:56 2015 UTC,I'd be all for this so long as there's an option for players to turn that off on their end so we don't have to break immersion when we see the guy with a top hat and monocle instead of a helmet and visor.
EA_NHL,3djw51,OneBar,6,Thu Jul 16 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't want to see clown items such as top hats, monocles.    Hockey has so much gear connected to a player: helmet. Visor. Stick. Skates. Shoulder pads. Socks. Stick tape. Where they don't really need to expand and throw in random items to fill space."
EA_NHL,3djoqw,andrewc1117,5,Thu Jul 16 20:35:16 2015 UTC,My guess is that they're sending out codes for an invitation-only EASHL beta running the first few weeks in August so that they can test out the new EASHL on a larger scale before launch.

EA_NHL,3djoqw,infidelappel,7,Thu Jul 16 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but this is totally different. After all of the ill will for dropping EASHL, and all of their attempts at getting back in the fans' good graces, do you really think even they're dumb enough to try to charge a subscription for it?  Not to mention, there's no way they'll ever try to institute a monthly subscription for a yearly release game. They already microtransact things, but the second the game goes even partly subscription-based, the whole series might as well go."
EA_NHL,3djoqw,radapex,3,Thu Jul 16 23:15:44 2015 UTC,"Plus, as I mentioned above, Sony and Microsoft would lose their shit.

EA_NHL,3djoqw,radapex,3,Fri Jul 17 01:22:26 2015 UTC,That wouldn't even come close to flying.

EA seems far more interested in EASHL and other DLC-powered modes, and why wouldn't they? Live the Life in NHL 14 is identical to Be a Pro with a couple added algorithms. They don't care unless you're online, it seems. Unfortunate, but that's the common retort I've gotten. Even relocating teams in Be a GM is completely off the table."

EA_NHL,3df44v,CanesHockey89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I'd rather see them fix the broken franchise mode before adding new features.   There's broken player development which cripples the mode.  They only recently started fixing the draft so that you could actually trade up/down based on who goes where.  There aren't NTC/NMCs.  Players agents are all fucking morons when it comes to negotiating contracts.  Aside from the salary they ask for, there's no real distinguished difference between UFAs/RFAs. You are never at risk of losing a UFA......yet all the CPU teams put their 1st line/top 2 D UFAs on the block at the deadline because they are afraid of losing them....come on.  CPUs randomly sign guys to stupid contracts and put them on the trade block right away. IE Colorado just signed 35 year old Francois Beauchemin in real life, in the EA Universe they'd throw him on their trade block in a few days.  The player development system is garbage.  EDITING LINES DOESN'T EVEN WORK. Try playing with injuries on and simming a season. You have to stop every game to re-edit your AHL/NHL lines when someone gets injured. Bring in a depth chart or something so that you can still have your ideal lines, but they can be automatically edited after injuries.  Waivers are broken. Teams don't have to waive players who don't make their team during the pre-season. During the season teams will make stupid trades without thinking about the consequences ""Pittsburgh has put Sidney Crosby on waivers, would you like to claim him?"" Best of all, when you claim a guy on waivers.....YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO PUT HIM ON YOUR NHL TEAM YOU GET TO BURY HIM IN THE MINORS....what? That defeats the entire point of waivers.  Did I mention teams make stupid trades? Hey I'll give you my first next year, Matt Cooke, and two 2nd round picks for your first overall pick. Thanks for the generational prospect BTW enjoy Cooke."

In both games they had the same potential rating. There is behind the scenes stuff at work which randomizes ceilings even among players that are already drafted.  As others have said, especially goalies. In game 1 Mackenzie Blackwood went 2nd overall behind McDavid. In game 2 he didn't get drafted and I picked him up in the 2016 draft in the 4th round."

Now that I'm thinking of it, there hasn't been much stability with prospects. Some guys, like Gauthier, are home runs and then other times don't get anywhere near where they were in the previous GM.   I have this happen with Tobias Lindberg on Ottawa, sometimes he'll skyrocket to an 85, other times he can't get past 76."

I have done some studies where i call up a prospect for 10-15 games while their 75ovr or greater. I play with injuries on so i normally have room to get prospects into some games.

Del Zotto is probably capable of being a second pairing guy. Then you have Luke Schenn & Andrew MacDonald -- they both are third pairing at best. Nick Shultz and a fleet of AHLers fill out the rest of the motley crew.   Problem (for you) is they have a lot of talent in the system, especially after drafting Provorov this year. Sanheim, Morin, Gostisbehere, and Hagg are all supposed to be blue chip prospects. Would still be fun to develop them in Be A GM though."

As you said though the prospect D pool is phenomenal. For me, Hagg got as high as a 92, same with Morin, Gostisbehere reached an 87. As for Sanhiem he isn't great in the game just yet... don't think they know how to handle him as he only got to an 83, tops. Provorov on the other hand is in the draft now and every time I get him he's never better than a 77 by age 25. Weird."

EA_NHL,3d9upd,chickenKsadilla,45,Tue Jul 14 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"I think the precision strafing looks really good. That clip of Kane handling the puck and crosby behind the net really shows that this small change will be able to add a different element to the game.    I think for EASHL this will be a good addition to playmakers. People who like to stop with the puck, look at available options, then make the play. This strafing allows you to control the puck, move in increments for fine-tuning angles, and allows you to be in a position to accelerate or deke from a stopping position.    I like."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,Hungry_Ducks,14,Tue Jul 14 17:17:14 2015 UTC,"You can really see the strides they've made with goalie skating. That Tarasenko goal shows Crawford biting, making a minor adjustment with his power leg, not getting far enough, and then loading up more for a big push.  The Carey Price clip shows the butterfly slide!  Also, fingers up for the gloves at last!"
EA_NHL,3d9upd,LDEMedia,5,Tue Jul 14 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"I just wish they would include the current pads with the game.  CCM released their new pads today, EA should have plenty of time to get them in the game before release."

EA_NHL,3d9upd,MrBilboBaggins,10,Tue Jul 14 22:25:35 2015 UTC,"The new skating addition looks really good and is a step in the right direction for sure.  I am looking forward to this!  However, one thing I noticed that really bugged me was during the Crosby segment when he puts the puck to the slot and Polak is just looking at the ice like a pilon (I know he is in real life).  But I think he should either have gotten that puck or been able to tie up the shooter in that prime location.  I still really thing they need to bring back the tie up ability for defence."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,uncle_dust,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:20:11 2015 UTC,You realize they optimized the gameplay to perfectly show off these features right? Probably put it on amateur or something.
EA_NHL,3d9upd,thet1m,6,Tue Jul 14 20:21:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah but during an ""Ask EA"" question they softly eluded to the fact that the ability to tie up in front of the net is still gone.  Its hard to imagine hockey without net front battles."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,uncle_dust,3,Tue Jul 14 20:54:31 2015 UTC,"I personally hated that net front tie up nonsense, you got sucked into it, and it was hard to get out of it, even if the play was long gone"
EA_NHL,3d9upd,Brotherauron,2,Wed Jul 15 12:03:34 2015 UTC,"Not that I don't trust strangers on the internet, but would you happen to have a link to that?"
EA_NHL,3d9upd,BleedBlue_,3,Tue Jul 14 21:10:30 2015 UTC,"Question: Chris, PA. Is there a better way of controlling the defender in NHL 16? As apposed to just standing in the way of a player ? (Like tying an offensive player up in the zone for example) Tags: Gameplay8 days ago  Answer: We are still tuning balance so not everything is complete yet but there has been a big focus on giving defenders control over their positioning and ensuring that defenders will be successful when in the correct position. They should do a much better job on average of both deflecting and intercepting passes. We have also fixed some issues in the past where stick lifts weren't breaking up one timers and sometimes players would still get shots off when defenders had done a good job bumping them off the puck. This is working much better now. Ben Ross Associate Producer  link: https://www.easports.com/nhl/ask?q=205    They don't answer the question directly but they kind of elude towards it still being removed.  Here is a great example from /u/benjgott on the problem of not having some form defensive tie-up ability (http://xboxclips.com/bg186/3b00cce5-410e-4a45-ad4d-74b297b3d0cc).  I agree, the old tie up system was not perfect but it was an option, especially in EASHL, to tie up players in the slot looking for onetimers."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,uncle_dust,2,Tue Jul 14 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"""Allude,"" not ""elude."" Eluding something is trying to avoid or escape it, not making implicit references to it.   Sorry, not being a dick, just trying to help.  Moving on: I read somewhere in the forums where they pretty explicitly stated that net-front tie-ups, as they existed previously, were definitely out. The stated reason was that most players didn't like how they worked because you got ""sucked"" into them, and the devs themselves weren't really happy with it either, so they figured it was just best to remove it until they could find a net battle system that actually worked.  In the mean time, they're trying to make it so that just by having proper defensive position on a guy (which is what net front battles are about trying to establish anyway), you'll be able to cut down those net-front scoring opportunities even without the old tie-ups."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,infidelappel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:36:04 2015 UTC,"This is what really annoys me about this whole Ask NHL thing. They don't give you a straight answer. Do you have this in the game? ""We are still working things but we do have this which we have already told you about several times and is not related.""...Thanks EA."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,jackattack615,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:56:49 2015 UTC,But didn't they also say that you are allow to nudge and hit them in front of the net again?
EA_NHL,3d9upd,Conscript85,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:56:34 2015 UTC,"I asked Ben about this on the EA forum and he answered me: http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/210/10341715.page#35027497    Battles in Front - We haven't brought back the old net battle system because we didn't think the pros outweighed the cons. People complained about getting sucked in and we want something more organic. With the focus on the defensive aspects of the game, defenders should have enough tools this year to defend against players in front of the net. Small nudges can bump you off of receiving passes and connecting with one timers. Also if a shooters stick makes contact with a defenders stick when shooting it ca effect the shot quite a bit for both power and accuracy. We have also done a much better job making positioning matter so that players with good defensive skills will get sticks on pucks and do a better job getting flat out interceptions as well. We even fixed a couple bugs where if a player successfully stick lifted a player going for a one-timer that it would still solve despite the stick not being able to make contact. I am not calling that out as something we are most proud of but to give you an idea of how deep we looked into that area to make sure that defending was more predictable to play and that you get rewarded for strong positioning and smart play. It was just as much about fixing current frustrations as it was about adding new pieces to the puzzle."

EA_NHL,3d9upd,SirPimpington,3,Tue Jul 14 18:42:13 2015 UTC,As a flyers fan most of the flyers players have always looked cheesy. Coots and voracek look good the rest look like shit
EA_NHL,3d9upd,SplendaMan,2,Wed Jul 15 12:22:45 2015 UTC,For some reason Voracek is like a 1 to 1 recreation of his real life self. He looks exactly like him. Then you have Giroux who really isn't that close... at all.
EA_NHL,3d9upd,luger33,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:41:48 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's not like he should be a higher priority for getting his face on the cover, he's only top 10 in points, previous cover winner, etc."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,Brotherauron,20,Wed Jul 15 12:01:50 2015 UTC,Absolutely love the precision skating. This solves one of the biggest issues with '15 - having complete control over your player.
EA_NHL,3d9upd,KidShowtime,14,Tue Jul 14 17:19:30 2015 UTC,"That is exactly what made 2k so much more fun to play defense than EA since forever. Crosby behind the net is exactly the type of movement EA has always been missing and I'm really pumped for it. It should make defense so much better, I hope."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,bflosabre91,5,Tue Jul 14 18:46:24 2015 UTC,are you able to reveal anything (if you know) about how the control of the strafing works? is there a modifier button or something?
EA_NHL,3d9upd,honestbleeps,9,Tue Jul 14 17:22:51 2015 UTC,Last build it was holding VC and a flick to the left/right on the left analog.
EA_NHL,3d9upd,B-Bunny_,4,Tue Jul 14 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"I really wish I knew, as this is one of my most anticipated features to start messing with.  I can only assume, from what I've seen regarding changes made to the 'vision control' button - that it may include utilizing that button to some degree.  I hope any 'automation' of these animations is minimized and we truly do have full control."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,KidShowtime,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:24:43 2015 UTC,"I hope it just turns into, basically, FPS-type controls. Hold down vision control and you'll face the direction of the play or the puck, and then your left stick just moves in exactly that direction without forcing you to turn. If you have the puck, you can use the right stick to rotate it around you (thus changing the angle you're facing), while the left stick remains locked to the exact movements...  That's how I'd design it, anyway."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,infidelappel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:10:15 2015 UTC,And how would you shoot?
EA_NHL,3d9upd,OmarV,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"You'd use the 3/4 turns up and to either side to turn in that direction, and straight up or the wind up and push would still be reserved for wrist/slap shots."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,infidelappel,2,Wed Jul 15 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"It's heartening to know that it's something they were paying attention to, but it isn't ""solved"" until you actually feel it happening through a controller."
EA_NHL,3d9upd,callmesnake13,6,Tue Jul 14 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"I like the new strafing/side stepping update. Should cut down on the awkwardly slow and large radius transition from backward-to-forward skating. Also, I hope the picking off passes in the defensive zone don't end up in a ton of own-goals - because we've all seen that happen a lot in past releases."

EA_NHL,3d9upd,SublaciniateCarboloy,2,Tue Jul 14 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"Finally something I can really get excited about, that strafing looks great and really will be huge if they implement it like they show it in the trailer.

EA_NHL,3dd2oa,turbosexophonicdlite,3,Wed Jul 15 09:47:45 2015 UTC,"That's why it'll be better in 16 imo. Because you'll get stat upgrades based on how you do in game. So if you put up hundreds of points, you'll actually get a high overall, and maybe be worth something."

EA_NHL,3d9gxa,jas0660,3,Tue Jul 14 21:25:14 2015 UTC,Hold L2 (assuming left trigger on xbox) and it keeps the player facing the puck. I can't remember if I usually keep holding it when I go for the hit. Just takes a little practice.
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,KidShowtime,24,Tue Jul 14 16:29:54 2015 UTC,10 seconds in the defender doesn't completely turn around when he starts skating in a different direction. That seems really low key awesome

EA_NHL,3d9q1v,StatGAF,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:39:33 2015 UTC,I like it. I think it only looks bigger because it's closer to the player but I definitely like how easy it is to tell if someone has possession of the puck or not.

One thing I would really like to see is more ""head movement"" on the players. There are certain times the players are skating after the puck or with the puck and they're just staring straight forward, dead eyed with their reflection in the glass.  With the new bottom half animation it really helps the players transition game look realistic and we no longer had the sideways gliding without them actually creating momentum of moving their skates.   Also, Brent Burns finally gets some beard love! :D"

EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Goopsie,5,Fri Jul 17 22:37:03 2015 UTC,Just noticed the new player indicator above the players head. Here's a 15 and 16 comparison
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Ass_Stephens,3,Tue Jul 14 20:19:44 2015 UTC,I love this more than I should care about it.
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,ilessthan3math,6,Tue Jul 14 21:47:47 2015 UTC,Good to see the ai wingers still can't seem to stick to their boards on the breakout
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Ass_Stephens,4,Tue Jul 14 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"Do you mean their refusal to skate up the ice when they have possession?  It drives me crazy, and it still appears to be an issue in 16 such as after Tampa gains puck possession at 0:32 of the video.  There is already another defender back, yet neither of the two players in front of puck carrier head up ice.  They both dick around right in front of the defenseman and get in his way."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,the_method,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'm talking more about at 0:11 the dman skates around the corner, the winger for some reason skated into the middle of the the ice. Then the dman passes it up along the boards (we're the winger should be) and it ends up being a give away.   Then again at 0:16 the dman skates out from the left and what a surprise! The left winger has decided to abandon his boards and slate into the middle of the ice for no reason.   With no smart pass to make the dman is forced to carry the puck himself the entire way."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,HalfMan-HalfDog,3,Tue Jul 14 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"Isn't ""Criss-Cross"" an option for Breakout strategy? Maybe that's enabled? Can't get on right now to check but it's a possibility."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Bruser23,2,Tue Jul 14 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"At 0:11 the winger was skating toward the boards and got tripped up.   Also, the other case at 0:16 I thought was a good play. I'm sure this isn't what's programmed but to me it looks like the winger recognized the dman has more speed so he stepped towards the middle of the ice to block any potential defenders from the other team and allowing the the d to skate up the boards. Just my opinion though."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,JohnnyForeskin,2,Tue Jul 14 23:02:08 2015 UTC,That winger @~:11 was definitely interfered with.

EA_NHL,3d9q1v,wheelzr,4,Tue Jul 14 17:26:36 2015 UTC,Also the VH is still the primary save selection along the posts...
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,mavLP,2,Tue Jul 14 18:03:00 2015 UTC,Just noticed this. If that bullshit animation makes it into its 8th year of existence.....
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,luger33,3,Tue Jul 14 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"It's a valid save selection when the player is charging the net from below the faceoff circle, as it allows the goalie to load the post and push across with the skater. However, using it as the primary save selection for post play leaves the goalie unnecessarily compact, small and causes tons of gaps to open up when transferring to/from the VH. Not a single goalie will pick his leg up to go into a VH when they are doing a backside push to the post."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,cyanwinters,3,Tue Jul 14 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"I thought the whole video pretty much looked great except the goalies. Look at Bishop at 0:06... watch him slide / warp across the goal line w/ no animation, no plant and push w/ his blade, ugh I really hate that.   They did so much mo-cap for goalies this year and the new stance looks great but I think they need to totally redo or at least overhaul the physics and stuff underlying how goalies move in their net."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,tonybateman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:18:17 2015 UTC,"They did fix the position the goalie holds the glove in at least, was glad to see that."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Old_Runescape,3,Wed Jul 15 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is already in the game, but I would really like them to go back to having the indicator for who you're controlling be the circle or star around the skates of the player rather than a little arrow thing on top. Sometimes when I'm playing with friends it can be hard to see who is controlling the D man after a faceoff depending on the side it's on."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,infidelappel,4,Tue Jul 14 20:00:50 2015 UTC,The Doc announcing hasn't been improved to me.....
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,KillerPanda24,2,Tue Jul 14 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe that update isn't running in this build? Because I hear barely any new lines, and absolutely no change whatsoever in his late-game enthusiasm here. I know people like to paint the NHL team as villains, but they have yet to say an entire feature exists that doesn't at all."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Anto181,5,Wed Jul 15 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"From the forums as well:   Hey Everyone,   Within the next hour we will be releasing our first NHL 16 dev diary that focuses on gameplay balance on our wider social channels. This video will showcase Precision Skating and Seamless Puck Pickups and how they help make NHL 16 more balanced and competitive from every position on the ice.  We know that overhead gameplay is something this community is always looking for, so we wanted to also give everyone here an early look at a gameplay clip.  This in-game capture was taken last night and we think it does a good job at showing some of the more subtle improvements made to gameplay, specifically on the defensive side of the puck. This particular game was played under the Hardcore Game Style and All-Star difficulty level.   Things to look out for:   1:50 – Silfverberg shoves Sustr from behind who loses control of the puck in a subtle stumble.   1:25 – Silfverberg’s stick makes contact with the defenders legs which causes him to lose control of the puck.   1:19 – Stick on stick contact from backside pressure, which causes Silfverberg to fan on the shot. Sustr picks up the puck but loses control after running into traffic.   0:57 – AI defender Vatanen makes a smart pinch after holding the blueline and picks up the puck in stride.  0:55 – AI defender Sustr shows strong facing when he parks in front of his net early. His good position helps him pick off a cross-crease pass and is able to quickly transition out of the zone.   0:46 – AI defender doesn’t have enough time to react and just misses defensive deflection on the pass from behind the net. Boyle takes an unsettled one-timer and the shot goes wide.   0:42 – The relative speed of the pass is too hard for the Anaheim player to handle in close proximity so he bobbles the pass before picking it up with control.   0:38 – AI defender Coburn is in good position and cuts off the passing lane from the streaking offensive winger.   0:33 – AI defender is able to get a stick into the passing lane, but the puck still deflects to Kucherov who is able to corral the puck. This slight break-up in timing forces Filppula to drag his foot to stay onside.   0:30 – Kucherov turns the puck over as he gets rubbed out into the boards. The strong backcheck and defensive support from Thompson leads to a quick breakout for Anaheim."

EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Cheeny,5,Tue Jul 14 16:53:23 2015 UTC,Oh okay thanks guys i'm dumb
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,TheFantasticFinn,2,Tue Jul 14 16:54:12 2015 UTC,Was it just me or did goalies seem crazy aggressive?  And I don't mean when there was only 1 skater on the entry.  I mean when multiple people were in the zone as well as a 5 on 5 set-up.  Cross Crease for days....
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,ilessthan3math,6,Tue Jul 14 17:58:01 2015 UTC,Cross crease for days? Only if they removed the constant whiffing on one-timers and every-game superhuman desperation saves.
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,baultista,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:42:51 2015 UTC,A lot of things in the gameplay that pissed me off in NHL15 seem to be fixed or at least a lot better. I like what I'm seeing so far.
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,wheelzr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:04:05 2015 UTC,"Overall it looks pretty goods.  Some good maneuverability improvements.  However, there are a few things that bother me:  1) The crap AI at 0:32 into the video.  #18 picks up the loose puck, the nearby defenseman skates RIGHT AT HIM, almost colliding with him. Luckily the other defenseman is smart enough to step up on the breakout and get ready to accept a pass. Unfortunately he doesn't skate up and instead just stays 5 feet in front of the puck carrier before he too decides to skate right at the guy with the puck.    Lastly, The left winger who just came off the bench also decides to skate at the puck carrier after possession is made and doesn't head up-ice until after her pirouettes by himself and gets within 3 feet of the puck-carrier.    This happens all the time in NHL 15 and it still appears to be problematic in 16.  No one skates on the breakout.  2) Don't like the overhead marker.  It's too big, non-transparent, 2D, and distracting.  Why change one thing that no one ever complained about?  The only thing they could do differently would be to make the colors more differentiable and visible in EASHL and OTP (particularly the yellow one and the ones for the opposing team)."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,iJeax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"I can't help but notice that there are several good hit opportunities that are passed up on.  Puck protecting along the boards also looks a little strange.   I'm afraid that we're going to get stuck in another situation where hits don't register and completely glide off the puck carrier, and forwards can deke face-first into the boards at full speed with zero repercussion."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,iJeax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"Yes,  so much truth. I add that most goalies don't sit down and lock in to the post with gear inside the net, it's an aggressive position made to be agile as seen here http://668d3eaa831be4d52f0d515f.ingoalmagazine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DeadArmOKDinsideJPEG.jpg"
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Anto181,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:22:42 2015 UTC,All I want is the AI defenceman to step up and make it hard for me to gain the zone. They should be poke checking or even attempting a body check to get me to either force a dump-in or abort the carry in to the zone.
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,themagicalpanda,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:26:11 2015 UTC,This looks almost identical to NHL 15 wtf? They better have brought the skill stick back. I'm so sick of getting a breakaway and not being able to deke back and forth quickly without doing the juke and jive move. So annoying.
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Anto181,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:14:44 2015 UTC,The skill stick is in NHL 15.

EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Anto181,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:47:45 2015 UTC,I doubt it'll be overhead gameplay. More like them showing off some little 'fixes' with camera magic  edit: I was right
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,mandatory6,5,Tue Jul 14 16:52:47 2015 UTC,"You were right, because they never said it would be overhead gameplay. They said it would be a dev diary, which it was."

Especially when they're trying to showcase how 'open' they're being with the community?  Instead we get less than a minute of overhead gameplay, played by bad players, and a video that showcases exactly what they want us to see.  It's a bunch of smoke and mirrors that I'm tired of looking through."

EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Ajrob2128,5,Tue Jul 14 17:56:52 2015 UTC,That's just typical for EA games though. They tease the very best parts without showing extended gameplay so more people bite and think it's going to be a good game.
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Hroslansky,-7,Tue Jul 14 18:30:54 2015 UTC,"it looks the absolute same....EA needs to figure it out sooner rather than later, the last games have been incomplete with no changes aside from subtractions from be a gm mode offline. I bought the last 8 nhl games. Im done."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,TheFantasticFinn,2,Tue Jul 14 17:15:05 2015 UTC,No motivation for them to revolutionize with no competition. Its the comcast problem.

If you watch the video and pay attention to details such as those that /u/KidShowtime pointed out above, you'll notice the differences in the gameplay."
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,eDgEIN708,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:48:50 2015 UTC,This gets said every game that comes out for nhl...There will still be huge bugs as always.....there will once again be imbalanced gameplay regardless of what they say the features are. It happens everygame and its clear that EA for some reason is not competent enough to put out a game that cant for some reason be a complete game. RAMA is an idiot and has no idea how to do his own job.
EA_NHL,3d9q1v,Hroslansky,3,Tue Jul 14 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"You're making these assumptions based on a 60 second clip of an unfinished game? Fuck you. I'm not saying you're wrong, but Jesus Christ, you act like EA fucking owes you something equivalent to Fallout 4. It's a game that gets released every year. Of course it looks the same. They're not gonna start over from scratch. They're gonna build on what they have. In the end, it's still a fucking video game. So yeah. There will be bugs. There will be balance issues. BECAUSE ITS A FUCKING VIDEO GAME."

EA_NHL,3d9zog,TheFlappyGiraffe,2,Tue Jul 14 18:59:42 2015 UTC,He is most likely in the chl. When you are in the trading screen you can see the symbols of where each of your players are. If they are in the CHL I do not think you can bring them up yet.
EA_NHL,3d9zog,DrunkKaner88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:57:46 2015 UTC,"If you are in 2015 he's probably in juniors. You can only bring him up (roster moves) before the season starts. (oct 2-7). He's 20 now so I don't know if that's accurate. But he's either in the system within roster moves, or in chl. Go to trade screen and see if he has a little junior logo next to his name, or if it's NHL or AHL."
EA_NHL,3d6650,Garism,9,Mon Jul 13 20:52:04 2015 UTC,"Seamless puck pickup is music to my ears. I was just playing a game earlier today and I was getting so frustrated with skating to a corner to pick up a puck with an opponent in pursuit, only to skate right past it and have the opponent pick it up instead.  I really hope that they also add the ability for your AI players to reach out for a pass. It's infuriating when you try to pass it to a teammate and all they have to do is stretch out an inch, but instead they just look at it as it goes careening past them."
EA_NHL,3d6650,54321Blast0ff,3,Mon Jul 13 23:46:48 2015 UTC,Hopefully NHL 16 has that on-ice polish and attention to detail that 15 was lacking.
EA_NHL,3d6650,baultista,2,Tue Jul 14 03:00:56 2015 UTC,And not everything was fucking automatic
EA_NHL,3d6650,AtticusLynch,3,Tue Jul 14 14:40:56 2015 UTC,Same goes for your AI or even your controlled players when the opposing team has the puck. Just tonight several times I watched as the CPU defender tossed the puck from their defensive zone up until the neutral zone. It just flies past my AI wingers' sticks and skates. But then when I try to make a 15 foot pass it usually gets picked off.
EA_NHL,3d6650,dlchristians,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:49:04 2015 UTC,I know exactly what you mean. The AI definitely plays by their own rules. Try to pass the puck out as the goalie and there's more than one opponent in the defensive zone? That's going straight to their stick. AI goalie does the same thing and it can go through 3 of your players' sticks and make it onto the tape of the forward moving through the neutral zone.
EA_NHL,3d6650,54321Blast0ff,7,Tue Jul 14 23:51:19 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Thanks for posting this.  I know we all tend to get antsy around this time of year and get disappointed in the lack of ""actual"" gameplay videos - but let's keep in mind that the team wants to really get things captured on video that are going to be a fair representation of the final product.  That can take quite a while, but the closer we get to the ""testing"" phase of this year's title - I'm sure we will get more raw video of the things we want to see, especially with their new approach to being more interactive in the community.

EA_NHL,3dbaba,YouBatRastard,2,Wed Jul 15 00:48:10 2015 UTC,Reebok owns ccm and they are going for a more athletic branding for the Reebok name and ccm is taking over the hockey branding I think
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,DerpHerpMapleSerp,19,Mon Jul 13 17:45:37 2015 UTC,Still could have used a better picture.
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,hullkogan,13,Mon Jul 13 20:26:13 2015 UTC,"Considering the backlash they've already received about the cover, I imagine they'll be forced to reconsider come the next game. I don't have a problem with the Hawks, but I'll repeat what I've been saying for some time: no player really needs to be on the cover of an EA NHL game twice. I understand they're stressing the concept of teamwork and want to feature a winning NHL team's most successful players, but they're also robbing fans of other teams of the opportunity to see their favorites represented. I would gladly take a member of one of my least-favorite teams over a repeat appearance of one of my favorites; the NHL has quite a few players that are worthy of the cover appearance."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,John-Winchester,2,Mon Jul 13 21:51:45 2015 UTC,"this makes sense and really i agree with you--i'd rather see a variety of cover athletes--but EA has put leo messi on their FIFA cover four years running now after also having ronaldinho as a 4-time cover guy. i'm pretty sure they've put some thought into this and will go with whatever they think sells best, nevermind whether some of us think recycling players makes it stale."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,NattyB,26,Tue Jul 14 13:39:53 2015 UTC,"His response is good and all, I like where they were going with it but the picture is terrible. They just photoshopped them together instead of getting an actual duo photo - can't be that difficult."

EA_NHL,3d5f7e,foggybottom,3,Mon Jul 13 23:16:58 2015 UTC,Exactly. I watched that post-game and Toews and Kane never held the Cup together like that at the same time. That's actually been bugging me for a while.
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,dlchristians,4,Mon Jul 13 23:26:10 2015 UTC,"They most definitely did. It's not the same picture obviously, but they held the cup just like that in the post game celebration."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,Jake0oo0,-1,Tue Jul 14 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"Right - individually, but then EA put them together. The cover isn't a deal breaker for me at all, it's just kind of funny."

EA_NHL,3d5f7e,eDgEIN708,-3,Tue Jul 14 12:36:37 2015 UTC,"It's not about it being difficult. Photoshopping that photo costs them maybe an hour's pay for one of their art guys. Having the players out for an actual photo shoot costs money.  EA likes to cut corners so that they can pocket as much money as they can. Like how they didn't want to pay someone to implement custom jerseys for EASHL.  Remember, you can't spell ""steal"" without EA."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,eDgEIN708,7,Mon Jul 13 19:13:27 2015 UTC,They could have at least used a picture from them celebrating after the win. It was just lazy and if something that simple has to have corners cut on it then I'm sure plenty in game items are absolute trash.
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,foggybottom,-2,Mon Jul 13 19:23:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they seem to have put exactly the same amount of effort into EASHL, so..."

E: In my eyes EASHL would be perfect if there was some attribute customization (e.g. give each player style a certain amount of point for each category in a way that can't be abused), but overall this is a good step in the right direction, and I'm satisfied for now."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,TheFantasticFinn,0,Mon Jul 13 20:22:29 2015 UTC,You keep saying most people like this change. We must run in very different circles.

The people spoke, and while I think /u/thefantasticfinn has a better system, this is better than it was. Must be butthurt because you can't buy your boostpacks now. :("
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,mrzoops,0,Mon Jul 13 23:22:25 2015 UTC,"You apparently don't run in the circles of all the people who submitted countless EA surveys over the past year when they were emailed out.   Funny, I don't remember ""get rid of all customization"" as an answer on those surveys. Where are the results of those surveys, anyway? Did you see them? Or are you just believing what EA tells you because they would never lie about anything ever?   while I think /u/thefantasticfinn has a better system   So what you're saying is that you'd prefer something different than what they're doing currently?  But I thought the people had spoken?!  Why do you think they opted for getting rid of all attribute customization instead of something like that system you just said you'd prefer? Don't you think a lot of other people would have preferred the same thing? Because that's exactly the general sentiment I've seen - people saying ""we thought the old system was broken, but we didn't want all the customization gone...""  It's because it's much simpler to just limit everyone to stock classes, and EA didn't want to pay for extra staff to implement it. EA chose to save money and deliver something that isn't what you wanted, it's just the cheapest and laziest way out of a problem.  And because hockey fans don't have any other options, EA can get away with putting out something cheap and lazy because people will buy it anyway.  ""It's better than it was"".. you sound like an abused housewife... ""he doesn't hit me half as much as he used to.. he's getting better I swear..""... Even if it's better than it was, that doesn't mean this is EA's best effort. This is as half-assed an effort as all those broken game modes last year."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,eDgEIN708,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:03:02 2015 UTC,"People did probably not say that ""Please, get rid of all customization"", but I wouldn't be surprised to hear that people said ""Make EASHL better suited for competitive gameplay"" or ""Make it an even field"".  It's funny how you keep making your argument around what people did or didn't say in the surveys since you haven't seen the survey results either.  EA made all these decisions based on the survey feedback in combination with the gamechangers that were voted in by various NHL gaming communities.  Your abused wife analogy is not really relevant here since EASHL wasn't bad previously, it was good, and it's even better now. The wife had a bad situation previously, and a less bad situation now.  EDIT: Unless you have any fun insults to throw at me, bye for now."

Exactly. At which point EA decided to take the cheapest and laziest route available and then market it by saying ""we listened to the fans"" as if everyone said customization was the devil."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,eDgEIN708,0,Tue Jul 14 13:36:41 2015 UTC,So you won't be caught playing it then huh? LOL. You will. You and I both know you will.

EA_NHL,3d5f7e,mrzoops,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:06:50 2015 UTC,"I never once said I wouldn't buy it if it's worth the money. Believe me, I bought every hockey game this company has released up until last year, and I definitely do hope that this game isn't a flaming bag of shit like last year was.  But if it's trash, then no, I'll gladly spend my money on something better like I did last year. I'm not addicted to fellating EA like some people are."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,eDgEIN708,0,Tue Jul 14 14:10:46 2015 UTC,"Apparently.  Could you perhaps point me in the direction of the circle where people don't like the direction that EASHL is going (competitiveness)?  E: The fact that you thought that the ""EASHL is an improved gamemode by making it better suited for competitive gameplay"" is something EA started spreading pretty much confirms that most people in your circle actually do like the change."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,TheFantasticFinn,0,Tue Jul 14 06:12:14 2015 UTC,"How does that follow? Most people I know personally who play dislike the change. I've seen plenty of negative feedback online. Look through the comments on their Facebook posts or in most gaming forums when this was announced.  I don't see your logic in stating that barely anyone liking this change, and no one I know personally liking it, confirms that those people like it."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,eDgEIN708,0,Tue Jul 14 10:19:01 2015 UTC,"Welp. Did you really just use facebook comments as a reference. Damn.  The ""EASHL is being improved"" stuff is clearly an opinion that's common enough for you to think it's somekind of EA propaganda. That should tell you something about how many actually do like the change. It's obiously not any kind of solidifying proof (hence the ""pretty much"" that you seem to have missed), as such proof doesn't exist in this matter of opinion and/or biasy.  Anyway, this is a pretty pointless discussion."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,TheFantasticFinn,0,Tue Jul 14 11:34:13 2015 UTC,"Did you really just use facebook comments as a reference.   Convenient how when I point out a group with a pretty negative opinion about the change, all of a sudden those people's opinions mean less. Get off your high horse.   The ""EASHL is being improved"" stuff is clearly an opinion that's common enough for you to think it's somekind of EA propaganda.   The only people I hear that from are EA, and a handful of people who claim to hold the majority opinion because EA said so. Don't believe I said it was common, though I might have said it was funny. And a little sad.  EA is trying their hardest to sell people an unfinished game mode (again), and some people are falling for it. So far I've seen a hell of a lot more negative opinion about this than positive, and the positive always happens to come from the same handful of people.   Anyway, this is a pretty pointless discussion.   I disagree. Pointless for you, maybe, but I enjoy the extra chance to talk about how EA only cares about taking money from hard-working hockey fans, and not at all about the quality of their product."

EA_NHL,3d5f7e,KidShowtime,-1,Mon Jul 13 23:40:07 2015 UTC,It's because they couldn't monetize the voting.
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,eDgEIN708,0,Mon Jul 13 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"Considering that the cover vote generates huge amounts of advertisement, it is essentially monetized.  The real reason is that they wanted a duo from the Stanley Cup winning team, which makes sense."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,TheFantasticFinn,0,Mon Jul 13 18:48:44 2015 UTC,It costs them money to advertise it. It doesn't make them money unless more people are persuaded to make a purchase than the amount of money they spent on the ad campaign.
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,eDgEIN708,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:56:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know how that stuff works, everyone does actually. The point is that they probably did make money on the cover vote, since it generated a lot of attention while costing essentially only server space which is peanuts.  If I recall correctly the vote was hosted on a NHL.com subdomain, so the hosting was probably really cheap actually."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,TheFantasticFinn,-3,Mon Jul 13 19:00:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but now they get to keep those peanuts. If they spent those peanuts on things like having someone implement custom jerseys, I'd probably be a little more understanding.  With EA it's all about how many corners they can cut so that they can put more peanuts into their pockets."
EA_NHL,3d5f7e,eDgEIN708,0,Mon Jul 13 19:09:22 2015 UTC,With EA it's all about how many corners they can cut so that they can put more peanuts into their pockets.   You just explained 90% of the businesses in the world. Business is always about money and it's not always fair for the customers.

Otherwise, it would be nice if you could personalize the start-up icon and load screens with your favorite team's player(s), sort of like what they did with the NHL 14 menus. I always thought it would be a really cool idea to make multiple covers featuring players from each team and sell them only in those markets...but EA would probably have to pay 60 different cover athletes, so scratch that."

Not for wanting to do relocations in GM mode but your tone and views. ""Shithole"" teams, really? And the fact you think Tampa, NJ, and Dallas will ever relocate is laughable. The other teams will most likely not relocate either. You say you want to move teams to hockey markets, but you mention Seattle like it has a rich hockey history.

The best thing you can do is wait two weeks from release, read some pro reviews such as OS, and read the forums and see what the unwashed masses are griping about the most.  This is 2015 and you also have tools like Twitch.tv available to you to watch other people play the game for hours on end.  In other words there is no reason to make an uninformed purchase decision in this day and age."

After last year when they tried to deceive as many people as they could into buying garbage, I'm sure they're going to throw money at review sites to polish their turd if they think it means more sales.

EA_NHL,3cwtoa,TheFantasticFinn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"When you look at things like Jeff Gerstman being fired after Sony threatened to pull ads on GameSpot because of a bad review he wrote for one of their games, it's easy to see how this kind of thing happens, albeit indirectly.  There are conflicts of interest all over the place when gaming sites, who live off of ad money mostly put forth by gaming companies, are writing reviews for those very games being advertised.  You even need to be careful when dealing with YouTube channels that do reviews - some companies will pass out free advance review copies of games to prominent channels, but if you say on your channel that the game's a piece of shit, the chances of you getting a review copy of their next big release is slim, which means you'll be missing out on those views next time unless you say good things.  There isn't a briefcase of money changing hands in a back alley or anything, but if a gaming site doesn't play ball, the companies who pay a large portion of their bills with ads aren't happy."

EA_NHL,3cvtj7,baultista,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:58:22 2015 UTC,"What dictates if a pass will make it through is the passing attributes and the offensive awareness of the passer vs the defensive awareness of the player who can intercept.  If it's Sidney Crosby throwing a pass and Alex Semin trying to intercept it, don't expect the pass to be intercepted even if it's a painfully easily interceptable pass. This is why many players will poke as passes rather than try to let their players pick it up, since it is more physics-based.  If John Scott is throwing a pass and Brent Seabrook is in the way, the exact same pass never gets through."

Went through the season, had Andre Burakovksy lead all rookies in scoring only to jump two points in overall (went from a 65 to a 67) which I was really pissed about. When to go unload him when, lo and behold, Soumelidis appeared.  Soumelidis was now a 4 1/2 star green potential, 68 overall. I signed him immediately and put him on my AHL roster as the second line center. By the end of the second week of the regular season, he was on a line with Drew Leblanc and Jeremy Langlois, and they were decimating the competition. Soumelidis was averaging over a point per game.  Since then I've always tried to draft him in the last round and he always takes a huge jump of almost 10-15 points with an increase in potential, but never before had he turned into franchise potential like with that one franchise."

Or does simply putting a high potential player in your top 6 help them move along nicely? For instance, I have a Galchenyuk (playmaker)/Pacioretty (power fwd)/Yakupov (sniper) first line in a GM and Yaks/Chucky made the jump to 90 after the first two seasons and climbed a bit after that."
EA_NHL,3csbp0,droche22,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:00:25 2015 UTC,"Dal Colle in my GM mode. I'm around the 2020-2021 season and every season he's been getting better for NYI. He's not on my team, but his name keeps popping up over the past couple seasons because he's become such a points leader, even winning the Art Ross at least once. Most notably he was 97 overall last season but this season he is now 99 overall. He had become the highest overall player in my mode and his trade value has maxed out. His stats are pretty much 99 across the board with the exception of physical stats. It's crazy, if anybody is interested I can try and take a picture later."

EA_NHL,3csbp0,gobinladengo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:08:10 2015 UTC,"I have two stories, one in NHL 14 and one in NHL 15 Next Gen.  In NHL 14, I was in year 2022-2023 and we had won the Stanley Cup but there was this goalie at the top of the draft that had high league interest and was a 5 White star with scouting. My best goalie was an 86 (my lowest defense was an 87 so I never bothered to get a better goalie) so I figured why not get this guy. His name was Tommi Paakkolanvaara. I traded away my 3rd line center and our 1st to get this guy. It was a mouthful to say everytime but when I drafted him, he was an 81 overall with 5 green star potential. He went 3rd overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs. The players that went above him were 82 4.5 yellow and 76 4.5 green. This guy after 3 years was at a 97 overall and stayed like that. When he hit 89 overall after 1 year, we won a Stanley Cup 7 years straight.   In NHL 15, I was in year 2025-2026 and I traded away most of my team to get the first top ten picks in the draft because I scouted it and lots of these guys were Franchise, Elite with high potential. My second overall pick ended up being the best and his name was Mike Michaels. He was a center and when I drafted him, his potential was Franchise, High and he was already a 76 overall. 3 years later, he's a 97 center.   However, after a year he dropped to 86 and kept going down.   I wish I could supply photos but I sold NHL 14 and I deleted the NHL 15 file."
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,John-Winchester,4,Fri Jul 10 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"Not positive but I doubt it, the 360 game coming out next year is just NHL 15 with updated rosters so I think it would hurt sales if they did further updates"
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,axe154,3,Fri Jul 10 23:59:11 2015 UTC,I don't think there's a 360 version of nhl 16  EDIT: apologies. There's a legacy edition top be released September 15th
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,jas0660,2,Sat Jul 11 00:04:19 2015 UTC,I mean it's not a full game but at least I can play some updated be a gm!
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,axe154,0,Sat Jul 11 00:44:15 2015 UTC,"True! I'm glad EA is at least considering the fans without Next Gen consoles. So many big game companies (I'm looking at you, Bethesda Softworks) don't give a damn about anyone who doesn't own a PS4 or Xbox One. I'm fine with missing out on some of the NHL 16 features as long as I get my current rosters and regular Play mode..."
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,Travy93,8,Sat Jul 11 01:36:39 2015 UTC,It's not that they don't give a damn... Old gen consoles can hold back the development of games on current gen/PC. Bethesda wanted to go all out and make an awesome game. They couldn't have done what they have with fallout 4 on 360/PS3.
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,jas0660,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:42:09 2015 UTC,"No I do agree. I just think it would've been nice if EA have old gen a payable dlc with updated rosters and an option to change the starting year for gm mode and live the life. But I'm more than pleased with legacy edition.  I understand the focus is on next gen and nobody wants to muck it up because it's the big money grabber. To be honest, I'm surprised we are even getting anything for old gen.  If EA is reading this, thank you!!"
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,eDgEIN708,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:53:19 2015 UTC,"While that is a very valid point, it seems as though they are choosing to release a roster update as a standalone game with its own standalone game price tag.  So it's not so much that they don't give a damn, so much as it is an opportunity for them to take more money from people.  I'm sure they'll make this edition incompatible with 15 to try to force people to pay for the roster update too.  They most certainly give a damn... about taking people's money"
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,Travy93,2,Sun Jul 12 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I agree. I wouldn't buy the legacy edition if I only had an old gen console. I'd update the rosters myself on NHL 15 and continue to play that. I was defending Bethesda not making an old gen fallout 4."

EA_NHL,3cuvx0,jas0660,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:05:50 2015 UTC,I guess you're right. Fallout 4 is going to be big and they need all their resources aimed at one goal. I'm just pissed because I'm a 360 user haha
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,baultista,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:21:03 2015 UTC,Didn't know about that. Thanks! That makes me feel better about not having a Next Gen console haha
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,eDgEIN708,4,Sat Jul 11 01:33:37 2015 UTC,"99.9999% chance that there will NOT be a roster update before nhl 16. It's done top help promote and generate revenue for nhl 16 because it gets people to buy the game for the new rosters.  I'm personally part of the old gen race that will probably never get their hands on a next gen, so I'm crossing my fingers that EA will give us a proper send off and give us a dlc with the new rosters, and an option to start all the modes for the 15-16 season, but I highly highly doubt that will happen  I'm still allowed to hope though"
EA_NHL,3cuvx0,TheWhiteWolfe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:03:28 2015 UTC,"No.  In previous years they had the post-playoff ""best lines"" update but not now.  Usually by June 30th you can assume there are no more updates coming."

EA_NHL,3cqmxs,first_shift,2,Fri Jul 10 06:14:52 2015 UTC,The hype is getting real!
EA_NHL,3cqmxs,andrewc1117,2,Sat Jul 11 13:07:29 2015 UTC,Need to have NHL 15?   I guess that means they are adding EASHL to NHL 15 so they can try and make it solid for the NHL16 launch. I mean we are two months away so I'm sure the mode is done already.
EA_NHL,3cqmxs,BleedBlue_,3,Fri Jul 10 01:25:22 2015 UTC,Doubtful. It says an exciting announcement about NHL 16 EASHL. The avenue they're sending that announcement is through your email you have linked to EA. That's why its for NHL 15 owners. I'll just wait for someone to post it on this sub for my up votes instead of risking getting spammed by EA lol
EA_NHL,3cqmxs,DBacon1052,2,Fri Jul 10 05:57:06 2015 UTC,"They could be doing a beta run and this email will contain a code to download the beta. It's highly unlikely, but one can dream can't he."
EA_NHL,3cqmxs,Travy93,2,Fri Jul 10 17:52:14 2015 UTC,I don't think it's unlikely. What else could it be? If it's just normal news why would they have to tell us to make sure we receive emails from them? They could just announce it on their website/twitter/facebook.
EA_NHL,3cqmxs,DBacon1052,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:12:02 2015 UTC,"It's highly unlikely because A. I don't recall them ever doing a beta for a previous NHL game and B. The release date is only two months away. Between the time they send this email and when they have to be done developing the game is a pretty small window for having a beta and addressing any issues found in the beta.  I really do hope it is a beta, but I still feel it's highly unlikely giving the history and the timetable."
EA_NHL,3cqmxs,jmkep,3,Fri Jul 10 20:10:58 2015 UTC,Maybe it's not about 'testing' so much as apologizing for NHL15 -- note the target market is people who bought 15. Maybe this is a closed beta to convince people who feel burned by 15 that they've 'got it right' in 16.  It's actually a brilliant move to help boost pre-orders because I'm SURE after last year's debacle pre-sales are probably wwaaaaayy down as people wait to see what the game looks like before buying.
EA_NHL,3cqmxs,DBacon1052,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:05:39 2015 UTC,I could see that. I really hope your right.
EA_NHL,3cqmxs,jmkep,2,Mon Jul 13 01:27:24 2015 UTC,Me too internet bro :( me too
EA_NHL,3cqmxs,Travy93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:02:12 2015 UTC,Release date being two months away doesn't mean much. There's always day one patches. Other games have definitely had betas only a month before release. I don't know I could just be being too hopeful.  What else do you think it could be though?
EA_NHL,3cqmxs,eDgEIN708,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"No custom jerseys = mode is done?  Heh. Between that and their stock class system, the mode is far from finished. For some reason people still buy EA's sales pitch that this is what the fans wanted.  There are rumors that they're working on attribute customization in some form. Stock classes and ""every sniper is Ovechkin""-style handcuffs on people isn't what anyone wanted. They know it. But they have to market and sell you what they did finish, so they just say ""yep! Look at this! This is totally finished, guys! That's $80 please.""  They might be adding it to 15 for testing purposes, but they can't even put in custom jerseys because they don't have the staff to do it. This is as much of a skeleton of a game mode as GM Mode was last year at launch. ""Done"" is definitely not the word for what EA is going to charge you money for."

EA_NHL,3cqqtx,umbraviscus,15,Fri Jul 10 00:42:35 2015 UTC,"You're likely playing with an unrealistic slider set, I've never had this problem."
EA_NHL,3cqqtx,Venerwut,3,Fri Jul 10 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"I agree.   It sounds like your playing AI in this situation. I have found that with NHL 15 you NEED to adjust the Advanced Settings Sliders to fit your playing capabilities, especially when it comes to the Goaltender. I usually make them see the puck better (screens) and increase their quickness. Also I increase Poke Check/Stick lift Effectiveness. These are just two examples but I work every slider and tailor it to me. By the way, both of these are adjusted equally for both me and AI. I feel like it drastically reduced those ridiculous high top circle shots from floating in and just makes for a better all around physical game."
EA_NHL,3cqqtx,root_bear,2,Fri Jul 10 02:37:55 2015 UTC,"Its definitely a regular problem, I play woth all slider neutral EXCEPT for Goalie sliders, where screen is set to 2 from minimum and reactions are set to max. For both teams, yet somehow my goalie still gets lit up occasionally allowing 3-4 goals on 10 and under shots  Edit: Mostly its because my defenders dont know how to get pucks or stay in position."
EA_NHL,3cqqtx,Cynepkokc,-16,Fri Jul 10 15:33:14 2015 UTC,"You're very confused, I asked if anybody knew anything about it getting fixed in nhl16. Do you know the answer?"
EA_NHL,3cqqtx,Venerwut,12,Fri Jul 10 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"My contribution to the topic was that you're likely playing with bad sliders because this wouldn't be an issue for you once you've re-adjusted them to a more realistic slider set. It's more of a you problem than a game problem  I'll edit and make it a little clearer, it's only an issue for you because you're not adjusting the settings properly.. once you've put the sliders in the right spots this doesn't happen."
EA_NHL,3cqqtx,mp4872,3,Fri Jul 10 01:46:02 2015 UTC,What would you suggest changing the sliders to? I've had this problem too and tried a few different settings with no success.
EA_NHL,3cqqtx,dlchristians,-3,Fri Jul 10 16:14:43 2015 UTC,I'm playing on default settings.
EA_NHL,3cqqtx,TruffWork,2,Fri Jul 10 12:31:50 2015 UTC,The default sliders are set for a more arcade game experience. Imagine if you were new to the EA NHL franchise and couldn't score at all? The defaults make scoring a bit easier as people got used to the game engine change from NHL 14 to 15.
EA_NHL,3cqqtx,upthepunx194,2,Fri Jul 10 22:36:12 2015 UTC,"Update: did what the comments suggested. Adjusted the sliders in a testing manner. Adjusted it so my goalie could be the absolute best possible, and also decided to allow more shots to see if it would 'warm the goalie up' or whatever. The 2nd period just ended, and they have 3 goals on 8 shots. All shots from the outside point, without tips, with screening off. So now that I've done what the comments said, with absolutely no change, can somebody please answer my original question?   edit: I'm also not miles ahead. Its 3-3, while I have to take twice as many shots as the opponent. Its not realistic. I want a realistic experience. I guess my question can be rephrased to 'will goalies be unrealistic still in the new game' because seriously I'm starting to care less and less about the fact that there's no fantasy draft because the gameplay itself is unrealistic."
EA_NHL,3cozft,KidShowtime,4,Thu Jul 9 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"This guy just needs to be the ""voice"" of NHL 16. I am still not sure if I'm buying the game, but its nice to hear someone speak like a goddamn human being instead of a bunch of scripted PR-speak. Seriously, make this guy the voice of the team because he clearly doesn't treat the potential buyers of the game like idiots, and doesn't try to answer things for someone on a 3rd grade reading level."
EA_NHL,3cozft,ryanghappy,4,Thu Jul 9 19:45:05 2015 UTC,Agreed completely. Ben seems like he's actually sincere about proving to us how much of an improvement NHL 16 is. He's not just going off of generic responses.

EA_NHL,3cozft,eDgEIN708,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:17:02 2015 UTC,It's a shame that he's avoiding the questions about goaltending. I posted over there after lightly skimming his responses. Lo and behold the questions I had about the reverse-VH and the invisible wall by the posts were asked by several others previously with no response.

EA_NHL,3cmiij,jas0660,7,Thu Jul 9 01:43:53 2015 UTC,"All your points are dead on.  One thing I always thought would be an easy thing to do for big games.. just up the decibel level on the crowd and goal horns for playoffs and rival games.   I want to say, 'wow.. the crowd is LOUD for this game'"
EA_NHL,3cmiij,KidShowtime,4,Thu Jul 9 17:15:01 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'm trying to figure out is how/what system would be used to rate big games.  Like playoff games would be high, obviously, but it'd be hard to determine rivalry games. I don't know how well a game would track storylines and then it would have to rate them based on importance.  Almost like a point based system in rpg games to determine your characters morality, based on your decisions"
EA_NHL,3cmiij,Plan2Exist18,3,Thu Jul 9 17:19:00 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this would be relatively straight forward to code, it is all about giving the certain tenants of ""big games"" a value.  Metrics to be considered are obvious:   Is it a rival game? (how many times do these two teams play each other this year + all time W/L ratio + previous game result + avg goal differential over all games played vs)  Is the game important? (is it a division/conference game + days until playoffs begin + individual team standings + team W/L streak + playoff scenario + close out game)  Basically each one of these metrics gets a value and they are all compiled into one formula (developed by somebody with more intelligence in that area than I) and out spits a number, perhaps between +50 and -50 - where a Stanley Cup Game 7 is an obvious +50 and a Tuesday night game in Phoenix in October might be -40.   Then you code crowd decibel, chant repetition, paired commentary phrases, crowd stand/sit ratio, player intensity for each value on that scale.  I'm not sure to what level EA is even engaging in this kind of thinking, but this is where you would start: codify ""game importance"" down to one, workable number."
EA_NHL,3cmiij,ClintEastwood41,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:35:09 2015 UTC,That's genius! I like how you even included conference standings relative to days till playoffs (though I would switch that to regular season games remaining). It would put HUGE importance on division titles and eighth place fights.  It would also be cool if they applied that to every game happening that night and gave us in game updates on the big games happening throughout the league. It would make what the other teams are doing feel way more important than just being a simulated roll of the die (I'm simplifying the game simulation coding for reasons)
EA_NHL,3cmiij,ClintEastwood41,3,Fri Jul 10 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"BUT I would just make the crowd a lot more rauckus for the playoffs.  Get the sound of the boards being beat on by fans, get we want the cup chants going really loudly, and after that try to make in between action hyped with arena music that fits the mood of the moment."
EA_NHL,3cmiij,UncleTrapspringer,4,Thu Jul 9 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, I like the idea of the crowd being louder. I know it'd be hard to do, but if they could somehow have Doc yelling over the crowd to be heard. That would be a great way to simulated the frenzy of the game.  And being back the goalie chants from 14.  It'd also be cool if the crowd actually reacted to a big hit for more than half a second. I'd love to hear them constantly buzzing. It would make silencing the crowd on the road so much more meaningful"
EA_NHL,3cmiij,Cynepkokc,2,Thu Jul 9 17:02:33 2015 UTC,Another cool thing would be for big games (ie: rivalry games or standings important games) the broadcast was more in depth and detailed than a regular season game. Like a lot more analysis from Eddie and Ray
