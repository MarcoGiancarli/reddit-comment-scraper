Wellthatsucks,3dydxf,TimeToRock,20,Mon Jul 20 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"Never let a fish take you to the gunwale.  The main advantage you have when fighting fish is the spring in line system, which includes your arms acting as shock absorbers.  The quickest way to get broken off when fighting big fish is to get lazy and try to prop up like that.  If you don't have the upper body strength for it, then get a proper fighting belt and harness."

Wellthatsucks,3dydxf,nevergetssarcasm,6,Mon Jul 20 21:48:22 2015 UTC,The number 1 rule of fishing on a boat is not to let the rod touch the boat. That is normally how a rod will get snapped in half or if you have a big enough fish it can pull you in the water that way. It gives the fish leverage

Wellthatsucks,3e0q6o,Engineer-Poet,2,Tue Jul 21 05:31:15 2015 UTC,First kudos to you for taking care of your grandmother. You are a terrific human being for doing that.   If you live in the US please talk to your landlord and / or go check with your local municipality. In many cities there are services designed specifically to help out people in your situation and the landlord might be a good guy but if not...  It will take a while to evict you. Dont sweat it and just ride it out until you save up and get on your feet.  Best of luck.

Wellthatsucks,3duoxo,Actuarial,9,Mon Jul 20 00:09:27 2015 UTC,The batter is out right?
Wellthatsucks,3duoxo,Beamer4444,20,Sun Jul 19 18:03:40 2015 UTC,"I dont think so.  It's hard to tell exactly where the batter is standing when hit by the ball.  Or if the ball hit anything (like the fence or a pole when it went up in the air).  However, if a batted ball first hits the batter in the batter's box or in foul territory it is a foul ball (This is why when you lead off on third you stay in foul territory in case a line drive is hit down the line.  If a runner is hit in fair territory they are out).  If a batted ball is hit and first hits a part of the stadium in foul territory it is also a foul ball regardless of if it pops back out into fair play.    To me it looked like the batter hit it straight up, came back down, and hit the batter on the arm/hand in the batter's box which would make this a foul ball.  But it's also possible it hit the pole and bounced back down towards him.  That would make it a foul ball too.  If the ball came down and hit the bat a second time, I'll admit I'm not sure exactly what would happen in this case.  There could be an interference call, but on the spot, I would probably rule this a dead foul ball because its not intentional.  You often see people hit the ball twice with the bat in the batter's box (for example on their backswing) and they aren't called out.  I would consider this to be similar.  Source:  I used to umpire games, but I could be wrong."
Wellthatsucks,3duoxo,NobodyImportant13,-2,Sun Jul 19 18:37:09 2015 UTC,"Source:  I used to umpire games, but I could be wrong.   Probably."
Wellthatsucks,3duoxo,RPLLL,6,Mon Jul 20 12:33:34 2015 UTC,As long as the batter never leaves the box it is a foul ball. If he leaves the box it is batter interference and he will be called out.

My Dash Cam is just my Galaxy s5 mounted on the windshield. It has a very nice camera so it works perfectly for me. I have an app (autoguard pro) where I can customize everything. It can detect an accident and automatically upload it to YouTube as well as other options. On mine, I use an 8gb limit in 1080p that saves everything every 6 minutes. When it hits the 8gb it starts deleting the oldest recordings at the bottom, so I'll always have my last few days of driving on file. If something noticeable happens that I want to save mid drive I just hit the archive button and it will be flagged to never be deleted. Same goes with recordings where accidents were detected."

Whether he set himself on fire and spent weeks in the hospital is debatable. You'd have to ask his parents and I think we're too late for that.  Whether any of those were true... I actually knew the kid they talked about. He stayed in scouting until he was 15.

The problem is in the announcement of said information.    The creepiness is in the vocal objectification of women being loud, vocal, repeated, and upvoted everywhere despite whether it's context specific or not.  People who complain about it are downvoted because it's not a big deal to the men making the commentary, but it poisons the environment when it happens everywhere.  I can't get my significant other to join Reddit because every time I send them a link there are always a bunch of comments of people being clueless jackasses who think Reddit is a giant online frat house like a digital Animal House - that's really offputting to a lot of people, and has been since before Ellen Pao took the blame for every problem Reddit ever encountered.    You wouldn't walk into a movie theater and yell, ""DAMN GIRL, NICE ASS!"" and expect a bunch of high fives from the guys around you, but online some people think it's apparently all good.

They had boards they were going to put behind the carts and straps to secure the load in place (you can see the guy on the left with a board) They had just spent a morning collecting carts and getting them on the truck, and after the truck pulling out, now got to do it some more.

Wellthatsucks,3c3n92,Engineer-Poet,2,Sun Jul 5 02:30:17 2015 UTC,Who the hell makes stairs like that? If you have the saw to rip steps and shims you can cut a stringer
Wellthatsucks,3c3n92,Hastadin,3,Sun Jul 5 03:14:32 2015 UTC,"That's why whoever made those stairs deserves an entry in /r/Dumbass (edit:  since nobody else was going to do it, I did).  I made a fold-down ladder once for a loft I built.  I didn't have space for stringers and such, but I did cut dadoes in the two legs for the steps to fit into.  Worked great.  No potential for a failure like this one."
Wellthatsucks,3c3n92,EmperorOfCanada,3,Sun Jul 5 03:18:22 2015 UTC,be grateful you wasnt walking up.. thats how i got a deep scar on my shin
Wellthatsucks,3c3n92,Engineer-Poet,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:00:28 2015 UTC,The fatty here is the grain thickness of the wood.  One key flaw in those stairs is that the wood came from somewhere fairly warm. I would guess south of the Mason-Dixon line. Not that they were well build but if that had been Canadian softwood(cold) at that thickness it would have probably survived even with that terrible design.  The key is grain thickness. The grain in that wood is fatty here so even if that were a hardwood it is still an insane thick grain.  But stair treads should be made of a harder wood as they take so much wear and tear. Not necessarily a hard wood but at least a harder wood.  So I will guess that a northern construction person used a southern wood. The were used to getting away with this terrible engineering but this time it didn't work.  That wood could have been used but with a different engineering. For instance the steps could have been put on a step pattern cut into the two side supporting boards(stringers). But they too would have had to be re-enforced as that wood would probably split fairly easily.
Wellthatsucks,3c3n92,visionariphotog,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:58:23 2015 UTC,So here's the deal with these steps: A family friend made them for us and this isn't the first time a step has given up on life.

Send a check for $5 for expedited processing. No C.O.D.s.  2) Fill out the form in black ink and get it notarized. Be sure to fill in box 16a with your ""declaration of want or need"" appropriately. A notarized cover-letter can help clarify if box 16a is not large enough for you to make your case.  3) Each ""Application For Approval To Cross-Post"" must be hand-delivered to the Associate Reddit Clerk Magistrate (Margaret, or her assistant Franny) at the Reddit offices. These days, there are courier services that can handle this for you if airfare is out of your budget. Keep in mind, however, that if your request is truly as serious as it must be to receive approval, you should strongly consider hand-delivery. Margaret doesn't have final say, but surely her good word on one's behalf has led to more than one approval.  4) If your request is approved, within 4 to 6 weeks you will receive a Cross-Posting Kit. This stainless-steel device comes with a 20-page manual which will guide you through the use of the Kit. Each Kit is different, so I can't fully explain what to expect here.  5) That's all.

Strategy and playing well were rewarded. Plus the fact you rank out if you get below 4th place and lose a life gave extra incentive to do well. Now it's pretty much a game of chance where the only ways to win are either be lucky or race against the CPU on 50cc or 100cc (or some completely unskilled friends), where you can build so much of a lead that nothing can stop you. Don't get me wrong, I still like the newer games, but I definitely prefer the first two in the series."

Wellthatsucks,3bbrr4,c00lhwipluke,3,Sat Jun 27 23:37:39 2015 UTC,That looks like a somewhat normal sized car. I'm guessing it weighed at least 2000 pounds. That's insane if it just threw it
Wellthatsucks,3bbrr4,TrippyToast0,2,Sat Jun 27 23:51:01 2015 UTC,It's probably a kei car.  They are very small and lightweight and have to have special plates. Typhoons in Okinawa are generally not as bad as hurricanes in the us.
Wellthatsucks,3bbrr4,CharistineE,2,Sun Jun 28 12:29:03 2015 UTC,Oh that's a relief. But what about that other car that is almost sideways as well? Was that just shitty parking? And I never realized how powerful hurricanes are then lol that's pretty crazy
Wellthatsucks,3bbrr4,TrippyToast0,2,Sun Jun 28 16:05:54 2015 UTC,Any theories on why it grabbed the white car but not the gray one? It appeared to be blowing pretty squarely from left to right but the gray one didn't budge (although it looks like it had slid before the camera started rolling).
Wellthatsucks,3bbrr4,Cakeinthebreakroom,7,Sun Jun 28 00:04:58 2015 UTC,"because once the grey one pushed into it and lifted it up on one side, the wind could catch on the bottom and the tires, being the high friction point, acted as a fulcrum.  once the car was on it's side and it was low friction metal on asphalt/concrete the car could slide much easier. Which it did until it hit the low curb.  The curb again acts like a fulcrum and the car has enough momentum that it starts to roll, and it bleeds off that rotational momentum each time it hits the ground during the roll until it loses enough to stop rolling."

It reminds me of the time I was kayaking on the Upper Gulley River in WV and was overturned in a large swirling pool.  Everytime I tried to right myself the damn water just flipped me right back over.  It was the scariest couple minutes of my life.  Eventually a guide in a large raft noticed that I was struggling and ran me over.  I thought for sure I was going to die, but the force of the raft pushed me out to cleaner water and I was able to right myself and get back underway.  I asked the guide if he hit me on purpose and he said ""absolutely, you were going to die if I didn't"" just as cool as a cucumber.  I guess it happens more often than you would think.  I often wonder about that guy, I should have got his name and stayed in touch with him, there aren't many people that you meet in life that truly save your life."
Wellthatsucks,3b34ab,I_AM_A_FUNNY_GUY,10,Thu Jun 25 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"While that's a cool story to share with friends, it makes me wonder what you were doing on the Upper Gauley in the first place if you didn't know how to get out of a hydraulic and were stuck for ""a couple minutes"". Your story also makes it sound like you didn't try to wet exit at all even when your life was ""in danger"", and that makes me think that you might be exaggerating just a little bit.   In any case, you apparently found yourself in a situation where an onlooker straight up told you that you would have died if they hadn't saved your ass. To me that doesn't speak well at all to your ability, and it makes me question if you should have been on that river at all. I do hope you stay safe out there."

Wellthatsucks,3axofr,Etherius,2,Fri Jun 26 18:40:56 2015 UTC,"I know this is old, but the idea that metric is somehow more usable completely blows up in engineering. It's true for common units but once you get to anything slightly more complicated you get shitty conversions all around.  Things like pressure which can be Pa or Kg/cm2 or flow rates that are in X/s, Y/min, Z/hr  There's lots of shit like that. And for piping and tubing in general, inches is far more common as a global standard."

Wellthatsucks,3axofr,Engineer-Poet,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:42:26 2015 UTC,Hi American engineer. I'm an American technician that deals with both metric and standard in my particular product. Which is called imperial?
Wellthatsucks,3axofr,DevilDucky95,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:02:00 2015 UTC,"American Standard is the official name for it, but most people know what I mean when I say Imperial.  Besides that, we only work in metric where I work."
Wellthatsucks,3axofr,Etherius,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:10:26 2015 UTC,Ok thanks. Where I work everything that doesn't carry coolant or oil is metric. If it carries coolant or oil (I e pipe threads) it's imperial. I've nary a clue as to why.
Wellthatsucks,3axofr,DevilDucky95,3,Wed Jun 24 23:14:40 2015 UTC,"Sizes and stuff like that were probably standardized in the imperial days. I work in Canada so 90% of our projects are metric, but we often name things by their imperial sizes because it gives round numbers. We'll say ""use a quarter inch plate"" or ""use half inch bolts and then write the sizes in millimeters which ends up being a strange number.   It makes sense though, especially when you need to retrofit older buildings. A 25mm bolt is not the same as a 1 inch bolt and they won't fit together. If coolant and oil machinery has been standardized for a while I can see why converting everything would be a pain in the ass. Today it's a 4 inch pipe, tomorrow you're ordering 102 mm pipes and not 100 because those are different things."

Wellthatsucks,3acf2y,Javanz,2,Fri Jun 19 10:04:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, with favorable winds and a low density altitude (cooler temperatures), it's possible for an aircraft to get off a runway in a surprisingly short distance.  In the opposite conditions (hot/high), it can be impossible to lift off at all."

Wellthatsucks,3acf2y,ontheroadtonull,2,Thu Jul 2 22:11:22 2015 UTC,But how exactly do you actually land at the wrong airport though?  Doesn't air traffic control know whose supposed to be coming to their airport that day?
Wellthatsucks,3acf2y,1015192122,10,Fri Jun 19 00:06:29 2015 UTC,"Airplanes must fly under one of two sets of rules: visual flight rules (VFR) and instrument flight rules (IFR).   When flying VFR, the pilot basically has total control of where he wants to go, how high he wants to fly, and so on. Usually small propeller aircraft fly VFR, because they usually don't have a lot of complicated stuff going on-- no high altitudes, no high speeds, and so on. They usually just want to do recreational stuff, like sight-seeing and whatnot. They must make themselves known to air traffic control (ATC), but ATC doesn't need to keep tight control on them.   It should be noted that planes can only fly under VFR if the weather and visibility are good. Visual Flight Rules are referred to as Visual because, in theory, a pilot could just turn off all his instruments and fly by the view out the window.  Flying IFR is much more complex. Any aircraft flying over 18,000' must fly IFR. This entails submitting a flight plan for approval and essentially giving complete control to ATC. They tell you when to climb, what altitude to climb to, when to turn, basically everything.  Instrument Flight Rules are known as such because the pilot flies by the instrument panel. If ATC tells you to turn left to heading 245, the pilot does this by looking at his nav avionics, not by trying to peer out the window. IFR can be flown in poor weather for this reason.  This 747 cargo plane was obviously flying IFR, which means ATC was giving orders all along the way. I have no idea how they could have ended up at the wrong airport, unless it was a huge fuckup on ATC's end, a huge fuckup on the crew's end, or a combination of these things.  My knowledge comes from an embarrassing number of hours playing Microsoft Flight Simulator, so take it with a grain of salt.  Edit: Thanks to /u/granpooba19 for the correction"

Wellthatsucks,39zxdj,HistoryBuff92,2,Tue Jun 16 18:44:27 2015 UTC,"An adult gorilla named Jabari escaped from his two-acre enclosure, somehow scaling a 16-foot-tall barrier topped by electrical wire in a breakout that has left zoo officials baffled. But what happened next was all too clear. Jabari went on a 40-minute reign of terror. Some zoo visitors were fortunate enough to escape injury. Others were not so lucky.  In the midst of his rampage, Jabari picked little ebola-stricken Rivers up in his mouth, shaking the boy like a rag doll. His mom, Keisha, suffered leg wounds herself while desperately trying to free her son. One other woman, Cheryl Reichert, 39, was trapped in the zoo's aviary after being attacked. She suffered arm wounds.  ""The gorilla just came so fast, just ran so fast, and he just grabbed him up and he was biting him in his side,"" Keisha Heard told Good Morning America the day after the attack. ""I ran over to him and then the gorilla swung his arm out and he slung me. And then I got back up and was going back over there and he dropped Rivers. Then he ran off.""  Next Rivers and his mother tried to run away, into another exhibit, but the doors wouldn't open. Then the gorilla came back and attacked both of them a second time. She picked Rivers up and raced to a hill, where someone with a wire cutter sliced a hole into the fence so that she and her son could get out."
Wellthatsucks,39zxdj,JohnBoyAndBilly,2,Tue Jun 16 19:30:25 2015 UTC,This just raises even more questions. Why was a child with ebola at the zoo?
Wellthatsucks,39zxdj,HistoryBuff92,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:39:55 2015 UTC,"Rivers is barely three months old. He’s been through more in that short time than many people manage in a lifetime.  Rivers is an orphan. His mother died from Ebola, along with six other members of his immediate family, and he himself now has it.   He is one of thousands of children in West Africa who have lost their parents to Ebola. One of thousands of children who are vulnerable and facing a harsh struggle to survive. One of thousands of children who have faced unthinkable tragedy before their lives have really begun.  But Rivers’s story isn’t just one of sadness. It is also one of hope.  Rivers’s step mother died in December, just four days after being admitted to an Ebola treatment centre in Macenta – a town deep in Guinea’s Forest Region.  With no immediate family to look after him, Rivers was immediately placed in our care and taken to a crèche we’re running in Macenta. In spite of everything he’s been through, he’s still a bright, bubbly baby, and he quickly won the hearts of our team.  But children who have been separated from their families need protection, care and psychological support. And the best way to ensure they receive this essential support is to locate their family members who can take them in. So during Rivers’s time at the crèche, our child protection team was working tirelessly to track down members of his extended family who could take care of him.  After weeks of searching, we managed to trace relatives living in a village several hours north of Macenta. We went up to see them, and they agreed to take Rivers in.  Rivers’s reunion with his family was a memorable event. The whole community – including the village chief – came out to welcome him to his new home and Rivers’s extended family were all overjoyed to welcome a baby they must have thought they would never see again.  It was also a harrowing reminder of the destruction Ebola has wrought. Many used the occasion to grieve for the deaths of the Rivers’s seven relatives. Rivers’s new care giver – his great aunt – was clearly overwhelmed with emotion at losing her niece, but also jubilant to see Rivers once again and for him to be in such good health.  Rivers was the last orphan to leave our Macenta crèche – yet another sign that we’re fighting back against this deadly virus.  We still have a long way to travel, though. Across West Africa, thousands of children have lost their parents to Ebola and face a struggle to survive. That’s why we’re working tirelessly with our partners to provide family tracing and reunification services, and will continue to train our child protection networks to work with families and reunified children, offering psychosocial support throughout the key stages of a child’s development."

Wellthatsucks,39ux17,cantthinkofaname,7,Mon Jun 15 15:57:25 2015 UTC,"Not technically true. The modern WRC cars use magnesium cased sequential boxes with active front, center and rear differentials. They use a hydraulic control system to control the differentials and the gearchange. This is controlled by an ECU and the input to that is from a joystick on the dash on the top teams cars. They do use a clutch but only for starting. On the upshifts the clutch isnt used, on the downshifts the clutch is disengaged by the ECU whilst the gear is selected. The revs are also matched by the ECU on downshifts. All of this has potential to fail. Not saying that's what happened in the gif, but it's not something you could rule out."

Wellthatsucks,39ucoe,OldMilwaukee,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:25:12 2015 UTC,"The strength of a hand in poker is determined by the likelihood that you will see it in a hand.  At the bottom is highest card, then a pair, then two pairs, then three of a kind, then a straight (5 in a row of any suit), a flush (all the same suit), a full house (three of a kind plus a pair), four of a kind, a straight flush (all in a row and of the same suit) and finally a Royal flush (all in a row of the same suit going from 10 to Ace).  The odds of drawing a royal flush in Texas Hold 'em, the poker variant being played here, is 1 in 30,940.  If you played one hand of poker every 5 minutes for 8 hours a day, you would see an average of 1 royal flush every 322 days.  It is INCREDIBLY rare to see one, let alone to have it be your hand.  The player who lost here had a full house, which as the odds go is a pretty strong hand.

The 8 year old ksrs25ftbl01 I've done surgery on twice now has a light sensor across that disables the icemaker in the absence of light. There's an emitter behind a flap on the left that flips out if the door opens or if the ice bucket isn't there that blocks the light beam, as well as notches in the bucket which let light pass unless the ice is full up to the top of it, and then a mechanical on/off switch that slides an opaque barrier in front of the sensor."

I guess he let go of the back too early before he could arrest the motion. I think this trick requires the rider to first push and rotate, then arrest, and then pull on the bike again before spreading arms so you can be moving back onto/over the bike when its time to grab it again.  The added drag of spread arms must have made his already shit timing worse, but it was probably a combination of small mistakes."

Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,tupacsnoducket,10,Wed Jun 10 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, reasonable suspicion doesn't allow for cops to search your house or car.  Reasonable suspicion allows them to detain you for a limited amount of time and frisk you if they have reason to believe you may be carrying a weapon. To gain access into a private residence, officers are required to obtain a warrant, and can only obtain one if they have probable cause. They can only enter without a warrant in exigent circumstances such as hot pursuit, evidence of a crime having been committed or being committed, and obvious odor of an illegal substance such as meth.

Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,audible_dog_fart,0,Thu Jun 11 06:03:08 2015 UTC,I think the logic is the raid happened when it did because if they'd waited until after the move they would no longer have a valid warrant.

Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,Sirfungus,88,Thu Jun 11 05:56:53 2015 UTC,"My house got raided once. This was in 2001 so it was some time ago.   We had recently put in an alarm system. I got up and went to work first. Then one of my roommates got up and left. When he did he armed the alarm. Then the last roommate got up and left for work. He walked out the door, triggering the alarm, but didn't realize it as it didn't start going off until after he was in his car.  So the alarm company calls the house and no one answers. They send out the cops. The cops look around, find a side door unlocked, and go in.   According to my roommate, he had his weed in a tin in a dresser drawer (I think it was about a quarter to a half). Which means the cops were snooping around. Either way, the cop found it. I had some seeds and stems in my room, but not enough to do much about.  So the cop puts it back and leaves to go get a warrant. This takes several hours. During this time all of us get off of work. My two roommates went  home while I went to dinner with my GF. I'm sitting at dinner when I get a call from my roommate. 15 cops from the Narcotics Enforcement Team had busted into the house and searched. It looked like your picture when it was done.   The NET team was ticked because all they found was that quarter to half and thought we were growing / selling (which was what the first cop responding to the alarm told them). We weren't. My roommate got arrested but got the charge thrown out. But we did find out that the local guy who worked at the gun store was on the NET team.   Not much you can do except clean it up."

Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,proROKexpat,27,Sat Jun 27 03:25:49 2015 UTC,That is such horseshit. Alarm goes off so the cops go snooping through people's stuff? They clearly had NO right to do that. Fuckers.

I believe cops have right to enter in case of alarm and no response from owners.  Happened around here, they said it was to check and make sure there wasn't an active robbery in progress.  Legit enough.  NOT right to go snooping through personal things.  I don't think the potential robber was hiding in your mate's dresser drawer."

Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,giulynia,23,Thu Jun 11 06:07:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the lawyer went like this  Lawyer: Where did you find the weed?  Cop: In a tin can  Lawyer: Where was the tin can?  Cop: In a drawer  Lawyer: Why where you looking into the drawer?  Cop: Because the alarm went off  Lawyer: So you where looking for someone committing a crime?  Cop: Yes a robbery  Lawyer: Did you find the robber?  Cop: no  Lawyer: Could the drawer you searched fit a person?  Cop: No  Lawyer: Then why did you open the drawer?  Cop: um  Lawyer: Did you suspect the robber was hiding in the drawer?   Cop: Um...  Lawyer: Now next question, lets just suppose for the moment you had proable cause to open the drawer cause a robber could fit into the drawer. Would it be reasonable to assume the small tin can was smaller in size then the drawer?  Cop: Yes  Lawyer: So if a robber can't fit in the drawer...why do you think he'll fit in the tin can?  Cop: Um  Lawyer: So as I understand it the evidence you used to obtain a warrant was obtained illegally?  Cop: Um  Lawyer: Did you have a right to open the tin can?  Cop: no  Lawyer: Therefore the evidence is not admissible in court  Judge: Case closed"

Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,Golden-Fox,6,Thu Jun 11 09:48:22 2015 UTC,"If the lawyer brings this up and the hearing/trial judge doesn't accept it and dismiss, a smart lawyer will do something like filing an interlocutory appeal.  Appeals court judges don't want to be bothered with appeals on nonsense and will tell the trial judge to either dismiss or be reversed.

You never want to live near a dishonest officer because they make terrible neighbors.  Report a theft?  If your police neighbor dislikes you, then that first theft will lead to a whole string of injustices before anything good might come of it.  When they raid your place on whatever pretense they can come up with, make sure they don't take a leak in your cereal boxes.  That happened to me."
Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,Ninja_Fox_,11,Thu Jun 11 03:29:12 2015 UTC,"Our house got raided once and they found nothing. But sitting next to the front door was a suitcase that I had just picked up from the airport because my girlfriend's mom had just gotten back from a trip and was lost in transit. Her mom is Venezuelan and had just flown in from Caracas. They searched through her bag and stole gold earrings that she had brought back for my girlfriend and her sister. They also tried to break into my car via the rear hatch/door and broke the locking mechanism trying to get in. I seriously understand where they get their nickname of being 'fat fucking pigs'.

My things were mixed in with the rest and when I returned I found a garage and yard full of garbage and debris from what amounted to looting.  One of my most precious items was a DFM medal my grandfather earned in the war.  Fortunately the ministry replaced it at no cost and with condolences.  I later saw it on ebay being sold for a couple hundred  pounds.  It still had my grandfather's name inscribed on the box.  The constable that stole it was later dismissed from duty pending an investigation, and I received a written apology from the magistrate.  However, not before I was raked over the coals for about a year with them pressuring me to drop the charges and wasting police time.  If my sister hadn't been staying in the house at the time, they would have looted that as well.  As it stands, she refuses to house sit anymore after they keyed her company car."

The cops took him to the police station, put up in a room and searched his house. Obviously he wasn't there for the search but it took a solid 6~ hrs of searching.  When finally a cop came in and said a person had adivsed them he was dealing cocaine. They found no cocaine but did find a few grams of weed. They confiscated the weed and told him he's free to go. They also issued him a ticket for the weed.  When he got home his house was 90% intact.  The cops would move things, search, move things back. maybe a book would fall, or something but overall they where very professional. No flash bangs, no swat units, no sirens, just ""Sir we got a warrant to search your house please come with us"""

The Tea Party is indeed militant under protection of the 2nd amendment, they are just not public about their private militias. The Tea Party is still a danger to millions of Americans.   You can indeed get refused service for several reasons, case in point LGBTQ peoples are refused service daily and have no legal protection.  Non-Christians are effectively denied public office in many areas of America.  There are millions of Hispanic Americans told to go back home daily, most of them born in America.  America is dumb and needs to do something about it. We once offered the world a great deal but now offer nothing but military power.  EDIT- Don't forget the racial problems with police forces."

Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,mickloud,11,Thu Jun 11 16:03:12 2015 UTC,I really want to hear this story.
Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,Snedeker,-4,Wed Jun 10 21:45:19 2015 UTC,"It was quite a few years ago but they were all Navy seals and were all instructors at a special forces training facility.  They all had an absolute arsenal of weapons in their place (some of which they shouldn't of had).  When the drug team broke in, all hell broke loose with some people grabbing weapons others absolutely going to town on the cops.  I guess the whole thing only lasted about a minute, but my friend said it was an absolute miracle no one died that day.  Initially the police tried to press charges against everyone, but they hadn't announced who they were so the charges were eventually dropped. Unfortunately due to all the ""souvenirs"" they had ""borrowed"" from work (i.e. the Navy) they all ended up all being discharged from the military (although not dishonorably).  The souvenirs were things like grenades, guns and such.  I guess they even had a 50mm training rifle mounted on a tri-pod sitting in the middle of the living room (it didn't fire live rounds).  To hear him talk about it, the actual incident was almost like a highlight of his life, although the aftermath rather sucked."
Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,tuckmyjunksofast,11,Wed Jun 10 22:13:36 2015 UTC,Bullshit  No seriously bullshit  They made soldiers count ammo casings when they go out to the range ain't no way a 500mm training rifle mounted on a tri-pod would be sitting in the middle of the living room.
Wellthatsucks,39bzj9,Snedeker,2,Wed Jun 10 22:39:46 2015 UTC,"I can only go by what he told me, he had a lot of stories about what went on during his time in the military.  I knew the guy pretty well and he wasn't a bull-shitter and I certainly believed them.  He also didn't go around bragging to everyone about a lot of the stories.  I was one of the few people he told many of the stories to.  He had an absolute ton of weapons at his home.  On an aside, i was in the military (Navy) for 4 years and while I never had the opportunity to even fire a weapon our shop had an absolutely insane amount of undocumented parts and equipment.  multiple Infrared cameras that ran close to a million dollars apiece (which was one of the larger ticket items) all just sitting in a storage area.  I know for a fact that anyone from our shop could have walked into the ""cage"" and taken almost anything they wanted and no one would have even been aware it was missing.  I asked once why they didn't just send all the unneeded stuff back, and they said they had gotten a lot of it through undocumented channels when there had been an urgent need for something and if they attempted to turn it back in questions would have been asked as to where they had gotten it.  (god knows why questions weren't being asked while there was a large storage area in our hanger with many millions of dollars in electronics just sitting there).  So while I agree the training rifle seems kind of amazing, or perhaps even unbelievable, to have I personally could have seen it happen."

Wellthatsucks,395ax7,CanadianXCountry,-1,Tue Jun 9 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"A bit of wisdom I got long, long ago is that you never pull such things with a rope or strap, you always use a chain.

Wellthatsucks,395ax7,Engineer-Poet,14,Tue Jun 9 15:24:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly how does one not pull straight?

Reasonably smart:  knowing what E=½kl2 means and how to apply it to the stump-pulling problem.  Anyone who makes it through first-year mechanical engineering (or first-semester AP physics) should be this smart (but may not be).  Somewhat smart but not clued-in:  being able to solve E=½kl2 but not understanding the application.  Not smart:  not knowing algebra.

Wellthatsucks,395ax7,gellis12,5,Tue Jun 9 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"You drive at an oblique angle to the point of tension.  So, when the chain is at tension, your car, rather than being in a line with the chain, should be at thirty degrees.  This puts axial stress on your vehicle.  And when you pop out whatever you're pulling out, the tension in the chain will catapult it towards your position -but you will continue to move in an oblique line off to the side, not straight ahead*, and should escape getting hit by the object."
Wellthatsucks,395ax7,IronAnvil,2,Tue Jun 9 20:07:27 2015 UTC,That's what I was trying to say.  Nicely done.
Wellthatsucks,395ax7,Engineer-Poet,0,Tue Jun 9 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"I think as soon as the stump is free, it'll fly to where the car was.  If the car is driving in a circle around, it'll have enough time to dodge the projectile."

Wellthatsucks,395ax7,ci5ic,-2,Tue Jun 9 17:44:45 2015 UTC,"You pull at an angle so that when the stump lets go, the vehicle is moving off the object's direction of motion.  More to the point, the line of flight isn't aimed at the driver's seat.  Ideally what you do is use another tree to pull the tow line around."
Wellthatsucks,395ax7,Engineer-Poet,4,Tue Jun 9 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"You pull at an angle so that when the stump lets go, the vehicle is moving off the object's direction of motion.   Are you sure you're an engineer?"
Wellthatsucks,395ax7,ci5ic,-1,Tue Jun 9 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"My sheepskin from Michigan says so.  On the other hand, you appear to have failed geometry.  If the vehicle is aimed 60° off the direction of the tow line, its motion carries it out of the line of snap-back in just a couple of feet.  Maybe less, if the hitch extends back far enough from the bumper."
Wellthatsucks,395ax7,Engineer-Poet,2,Tue Jun 9 18:49:37 2015 UTC,I think a vehicle met with any appreciable resistance would tend to straighten in the direction of the load force.
Wellthatsucks,395ax7,ci5ic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:40:38 2015 UTC,"Oh it totally will.  And if the load were a constant you'd be right.  But here the load is instantaneous and then releases, so the straightening effect will be minimal.  Ten degrees maybe?  Inconsequential."
Wellthatsucks,395ax7,IronAnvil,-2,Tue Jun 9 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, of course.  The length of the moment arm from the CG, and the detail that the rear wheels bear the least weight and can't resist that straightening torque all that well (particularly off-pavement), make it likely that you'd lose traction and straighten out before breaking the stump loose.  The more I think about this the more I lean toward the idea that the ""right"" way to do it absent a suitable chain is to use two vehicles pulling at perhaps 60° away from each other, so the stump flies off between them instead of into either one.  Two tow straps would also stretch less and store less energy than just one.  Third possibility, ropes to a nearby anchor at roughly 90° to the angle of pull.  When the stump breaks loose it is pulled on an arc away from the vehicle."

We both just looked at it and said ""Well, why not just shove the cork the rest of the way in?""  PLOOOF.  Fountain of red wine as the cork was forced in.

Wellthatsucks,3840wj,JoePants,3,Mon Jun 1 21:12:59 2015 UTC,"We had this in NW Germany last year (?) with a tanker truck full of mustard that hit a tunnel entrance.  They had to close the tunnel, because several tons of mustard ran out.  Apparently the stuff is caustic, and they were worried that it would affect the structural integrity of the thing.  I like mustard.  A while before that, there was an even worse problem in a long construction area of a major North-South highway artery when a truck carrying about fifty megatons of some kind of glazing or varnish hopped the central barrier and collided head-on with a large truck going the opposite direction.  Aside from the damage and the injuries/deaths, it also coated about 300 meters of highway in a thick coat of plastic.  The maintenance crews, fire department, and everyone else tried to get it off as soon as possible, but it was quick drying so they had to grind off the entire road surface, closing the thing for a few days.  It caused total pandemonium with traffic, and a local radio station had an interview with a fire chief who was almost in tears because, well, a major highway covered entirely with super-hard glazing and nothing they did could get it off.  So yeah, well, that sucks."

The pilot, ""Bud"" Holland, had been repeatedly reprimanded for violating safety regulations (flying too low, banking too steeply etc...)  One incident just 3 months before the incident involved him flying as low as 3 feet above a ridgeline.  After that incident the crew refused to fly with him again.  The squadron commander McGeehan reported the incident to the wing commander Pellerin recommending that Holland be removed from flight duty.  Pellerin gave an oral reprimand to Holland but did not remove him from flight duty.  Pellerin also did not document the incident or notify his superiors.  McGeehan decided that to protect his crews he would be the co-pilot on any flights piloted by Holland going forward.  Mcgeehan was the co-pilot on this flight."

It achieves all its roll control by use of Spoilerons.   So the pilot pushed the aircraft way beyond where it could recover in time with its spoilers, and had a turning stall into the ground.  It was all gross negligence on the part of the pilot. You could pull of a maneuver like that in a plane smaller than that with Ailerons and a bit more airspeed, but not a fucking strategic bomber."
Wellthatsucks,37nu3w,RPLLL,1 point,Sat May 30 03:48:04 2015 UTC,"Spoileron:       In aeronautics spoilerons are flight control surfaces, specifically spoilers that can be used asymmetrically to achieve the effect of ailerons, i.e. to roll an aircraft by reducing the lift of one wing but unlike ailerons not increasing the lift of the other wing. As a side effect a raised spoileron also increases the drag on one wing which causes the aircraft to yaw which can be compensated with the rudder. But since roll and yaw motion are both to the wing with the raised spoileron, it's usually desirable. Spoilerons can be used to assist the ailerons or replace them entirely, thus reducing the number of control surfaces.

It jumped up kicked and broke my cousins arm the bone literally broke and her arm was so black and blue and swollen. Horses have a scary amount of power that you sometimes don't expect

Wellthatsucks,37cqqk,MeepleTugger,2,Tue May 26 22:45:51 2015 UTC,I don't like to be close to them unless I have to be. You never know if a horse will jump up and kick you or try to run from you. And I don't really know of anyone who could hold a horse by a rope and stop them from running away if they want to bolt. They are very powerful animals and it's frightening what they could do if they wanted to. I've seen a horse break down a steel plated door from just quickly kicking it. It's scary

Conscripts Anatoly Agishin that June 12 was hit by a heavy armored vehicle on the day of taking the oath in Ussuriysk, said that he was born under a lucky star. Coming under the two front wheels APC, he was able to regroup and back casing of the machine. Everything happened in front of the parents and the girl soldier. Status of victims of ordinary Medic is satisfactory, reports Trend. RIA PrimaMedia in Ussuriysk.  Just a month ago, Anatoly drafted into the Russian army. The young man came from the Khasan district of Primorye Territory. ""Mowing"" of the army guy did not, and when 18 years old, went to serve. After the course of the preparation of the young fighter recruits the 83rd brigade of the airborne troops of Russia had to take an oath.  Anatoly, like other recruits, solemnly took the oath. And then they are ready to show the family and friends what they have learned in the army. The demonstrations had been involved heavy military equipment. At this moment the tragedy occurred.   I was standing with his back to the APC. At the last moment I turned around and there was a second blow. As I drove through the front two wheels I can not remember. But I remember that when he saw the space between the wheels, I grouped and crept under the body BTR. I waited, when he will pass and then just tried to get to his feet. But then I do not remember - said the injured soldier 83rd brigade of the airborne troops of Russia Anatoly.   See how Anatoly takes the oath, all come home: mother, father, brother and girlfriend. According to Man, yesterday they came to him in the hospital and had calmed down a bit for his condition.   The doctors told me that I had severe bruises and a fracture in the bones of the hip, but the operation was not. Can not get out of bed for three weeks. The rest - it grazes on the body and the head is turned. Doctors say if I comply with bed rest, then everything will be fine - shared Anatoly.   The guy does not give up and prepares after discharge from the hospital to continue to serve.  Recall APCs moved rookie 83rd brigade of the airborne troops of Russia in the city of Ussuriisk. The incident happened during a ceremonial swearing-eve, on June 12.  As RIA PrimaMedia earlier, upon hitting the APC on the soldiers of in Primorye began pre-investigation checks.

Wellthatsucks,36szhg,RealLifeNoRespawn,6,Fri May 22 02:58:24 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but I don't entirely agree either.   Originally I agreed with the poster you replied to, but then I read your comment and found myself also agreeing with your point, and what I've come to realize after thinking about it, is that there isn't just one way to view this situation, much like how some people say that a glass is half full as opposed to it being half empty. Both of those viewpoints are in disagreement with each other, yet both are technically correct. I feel like this situation is very similar.   The way that this person locked their bike up allowed the bike to be stolen in a way that is significantly easier than had the frame also been locked up, so much so that the bike could very well still be there had it been locked up in a manner that wasn't 'thoughtless'. Because of that, you could say that this person had it coming, because they were honestly and obviously not thinking, which is something that they did (or didn't do) which satisfies the need for the person having done something to 'earn' or 'deserve' something. It's a situation that might prompt someone to say something like, ""Well I should have seen that coming"", because it's true, they really should have. So I feel that 'They had it coming' is an actual true statement here.  This is not to say I disagree with you, it's only to say that I view the situation differently and that I feel we're both technically correct in our own ways of thinking, much like the labeling of the state of liquid within a glass.   For me, if you didn't think something through in a situation that honestly doesn't require much thought to think through and something happens because of that, I feel like you did earn or deserve it. It's still really unfortunate, but it's no different than if you left your keys in your unlocked car. It's like, yeah, that sucks that your car was stolen, but you had it coming because you either know or should know better than that and/or you could have thought about the very obvious likelihood of that happening, which very honestly isn't hard to do.   I'm not sure if that made any sense. I'm at the end of my 'surprise' work day and I'm having a hard time expressing my own thoughts because my brain is ready to call it a day."

Wellthatsucks,36szhg,Mumbolian,1 point,Fri May 22 07:26:25 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right actually. They're just a regular scumbag.
Wellthatsucks,36szhg,Roflolmfao,3,Fri May 22 07:38:06 2015 UTC,"What? No they didn't. They did it to make money on a stolen bike frame. Thieves don't give a shit what their victims think, or else there'd be far fewer thieves."

Wellthatsucks,36szhg,Throtex,4,Fri May 22 06:19:42 2015 UTC,"that's why you gotta lock the rear wheel through the frame. So if they do steal anything, they can't steal anything."
Wellthatsucks,36szhg,Redearthman,2,Fri May 22 03:51:42 2015 UTC,"Take front wheel off, put next to rear wheel, lock both wheels through the frame.  I suppose they can still take the saddle and then you have to ride home with a tube up your ass."
Wellthatsucks,36szhg,coulditbejanuary,1 point,Fri May 22 06:19:29 2015 UTC,I used to use a long thick cable style lock through the frame and front tire and then I'd use a small thin long cable meant to secure the seat and I'd run it through the back tire too while it loops through the main lock or use a 2nd thin cord and run it through the back tire and also put its loop all attached to the thick cord lock.
Wellthatsucks,36szhg,Redearthman,1 point,Thu May 21 22:15:05 2015 UTC,"That works too, but the smaller cable can be cut more easily. If you have the time to remove a wheel and pop it next to the other one and lock it all together, you're probably using a U-lock or chain lock to do so and it's probably going nowhere."
Wellthatsucks,36szhg,coulditbejanuary,2,Fri May 22 04:26:26 2015 UTC,"I'm am not an avid biker, so I could be wrong, but based on where the wheels are it looks like whomever parked their bike here took up 3 places. So, is this the bike version of a douche who takes up 3 parking places having his car stolen?"
Wellthatsucks,36szhg,TheDoctorEngineer,2,Fri May 22 14:02:57 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's common to lock your bike like that. If you can swing it so you only take up half of one side that's ideal, but I don't think this would be rage-inducing. What really makes me bad is when people lock their helmet or basket through their lock so it sticks out the other side. Then no one else can lock up to that post. :("

It looks like the driveshaft came off at the transmission and rear and falls out behind the car as it's dropping, but how would any of that cause the rear end complete with axles to shear away from the suspension?"
Wellthatsucks,36o8uq,Tomcat5,18,Wed May 20 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"He has bad suspension, and when hitting the gas, the rear end compresses, and then rebounds hard enough to bunch off of the ground. Still on the gas pedal, this gets worse until it breaks the suspension. Problem can be avoided by having adequate shock absorbers."
Wellthatsucks,36o8uq,cantthinkofaname,4,Thu May 21 14:08:47 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, that makes more sense. Thanks!"
Wellthatsucks,36o8uq,Tomcat5,2,Thu May 21 14:10:44 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of bad shocks causing a rear end to fall off in all my years of messing with cars, so I will pose 2 alternate theories. The car appears to be a 69 Dodge Dart, which has leaf springs in the rear.   1) the car had old/bad leaf springs which came off their mounts or cracked in half due to axle-wrap upon that final exhibition of acceleration. When one cracked it sent the axle rearward torquing the other side until the axle was completely ripped off.   2) more likely, he had the axle out recently and didn't properly fasten the u-bolts that secure the axle to the leaf springs. Or the u-bolts just rusted through, but I consider this unlikely based on how shiny the car is. I think this scenario is more likely because you can see the right rear tire shift rearward prior to all hell breaking loose. As well, I don't see the leafs attached to the now-liberated axle."
Wellthatsucks,36o8uq,PrimeNumber2,1 point,Thu May 21 21:00:44 2015 UTC,I can see theory 2 being the most likely.  Especially if this was just some rich douche that doesn't do the work himself.  The mounts are in an area someone who doesn't know jack about cars would never look.

From Wikipedia:  ""Modern self-propelled artillery vehicles may superficially resemble tanks, but they are generally lightly armored, too lightly to survive in direct fire combat. However, they protect their crews against shrapnel and small arms and are therefore usually included as armored fighting vehicles. Many are equipped machine guns for defense against infantry."""

Since he bent the first 2 uprights in the series, the rest on that side got ripped down. That's easy enough to do with sufficient force. As for the rest of them, either they weren't dynabolted to the floor or they weren't bolted sufficiently. I've seen some with only 1 or 2 bolts on each upright, or even just on the end ones since the overall tension will keep things mostly straight. Especially once there's pallets in there holding things square.  If it wasn't built properly, regardless of product quality, it'll fall down when knocked.

Two points that are antipodal /ænˈtɪpədəl/ to each other are connected by a straight line running through the centre of the Earth.  In the Northern Hemisphere, ""the Antipodes"" is often used to refer to Australia and New Zealand, and ""Antipodeans"" to their inhabitants.  Geographically the antipodes of Britain and Ireland are in the Pacific Ocean, south of New Zealand. This gave rise to the name of the Antipodes Islands of New Zealand, which are close to the antipodes of London at about 50° S 179° E. The antipodes of Australia are in the North Atlantic Ocean, while parts of Spain, Portugal, and Morocco are antipodal to New Zealand.  Approximately 15% of land territory is antipodal to other land, representing approximately 4.4% of the Earth's surface. The largest antipodal land masses are the Malay Archipelago, antipodal to the Amazon Basin and adjoining Andean ranges; east China and Mongolia, antipodal to Chile and Argentina; and Greenland and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, antipodal to East Antarctica.

The Xsara was a development of the Citroën ZX and Peugeot 306, which shared a platform and running gear.  It came in three and five-door hatchback and five-door estate body styles; the estate was marketed as the Break and the three-door as the Coupé. The styling shared cues with the larger Bertone designed Xantia, but was regarded as bland by the motoring press. The straight-4 engine range includes 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0-litre petrol engines as well as 1.6, 1.9 and 2.0-litre turbodiesels, and in some countries, a 1.5-litre TUD diesel engine.

Wellthatsucks,35pfmc,Homicidal_Sheep,3,Tue May 12 19:01:23 2015 UTC,"You're not supposed to add flammable anything to someting that's already on fire.   Fumes catch fire first becuase the flammable material's atoms are already mixing with the oxygen atoms. So once the liquid came out, that's what caused the rushing effect looking like a fireball to the face.   This is how people who add gasoline to fires end up being caught on fire.  So unfortunately even if she was an idiot (actually they would all be for not recognizing the danger at hand), the bartender is still in the wrong."

Wellthatsucks,35nwy9,chavezthespiderlady,7,Tue May 12 05:04:31 2015 UTC,You can train a cat to only shit outside. I know many people that have. The litter box is just easier because it requires little to no training.
Wellthatsucks,35nwy9,DarthSnoopyFish,1 point,Tue May 12 05:55:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My parents adopted a cat and built it a cat door. The cat needs to like to be an outside cat though, otherwise it will find places in your house to shit. They had to get a litterbox for those such instances. But the good thing, is that the litter box and the cat door are in the garage. So no stink in the house. Also it's kind of hard to train a cat to shit outside if you live in a city, they like to roam when they are outside and lots of ways for them to get killed with all the traffic."
Wellthatsucks,35nwy9,chavezthespiderlady,1 point,Tue May 12 06:15:51 2015 UTC,"Both my mother and a close friend have their cats trained to go to the door and mew when they need to go. My mother's cat did have a problem where it went in her houseplants and it took her almost a year to break him of it, but other than that they've never had a incident in the house. Cats do not do so well outside in the city, though, you are right about that. They can be leash trained but most people i've known who tried to leash train their cats failed. My grandmother's cat was successfully leashed trained but after she died the cat would not cooperate or use the leash with anyone else.  Cats are weird ass creatures. I've only had cats in my adult life because of my living situation and i still don't understand them."

Wellthatsucks,35ene0,swampfish,24,Sat May 9 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"If you keep fucking up you get sent back in time. They put you in with new guys since obviously you aren't learning what you're supposed to be learning and you're basically just in basic training a lot longer.   Also I went through USAF basic, which was super weaksauce compared to some other branches, and still nobody laughed. There's this huge aura of fear and intimidation that's thick in the air from the moment you get off the bus, it nips any wanna-be jokers in the bud. There's this sort of 'herd fear' that's instantly instilled in everyone as the 40 or so dudes you're with are accosted by 7 screaming dudes for 48 hours straight, as you get your hair cut, get your uniforms, make your beds, eat your food, and everything from the time you wake up to the time you go to sleep to the amount of carbs you consume to the amount of fluids you drink (they make you drink, and randomly ask everyone to upend their canteens. Anyone who has water pouring out wasn't hydrating enough, gets to do shitloads of pushups, and is then made to drink a shit-ton) and everything is just scheduled and regimented and timed to a T. You have zero control over any aspect of your life, and only 1/4 of a drawer to keep your non-issued possessions in. After about 4 days of this your mind has already kicked over into some base survival mode and that's when the clusterfuck gang-bang of 7 dudes constantly in everyones shit stops all at once, and you're down to one or two dudes shepherding their herd of turds until they manage to graduate.   It's a transformative experience and I'd highly recommend it to anyone.   edit; Stop downvoting the guy above me. The things your training instructors say and do would be hilarious in normal, day-to-day occurrences, and are as soon as you're done with basic."
Wellthatsucks,35ene0,AirPhforce,2,Sat May 9 22:47:21 2015 UTC,"How was water not pouring out of everyone's canteen if the checks were random? Is it expected that you drink the entire thing at once? Because then you'd never be punished, but at the same time I can't see why they'd want to condition you to drink massive amounts of water in a short period of time (wouldn't piss breaks hamper productivity anyway?)."
Wellthatsucks,35ene0,TheDoctorEngineer,4,Sat May 9 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"No, everything, literally everything, has a system behind it. They knew during runs how much water people should be drinking. They would make us stop and drink. Halfway through, right before we got to a pump or whatever to refil, they would have us turn up our canteens, knowing we should have consumed it all by now.  There was always one or two guys who just didn't drink anything despite like 4 hydration breaks.   Like I said, everything was a system and they knew exactly how everything worked. That's part of the control they have in basic, they even know how much water you're drinking."
Wellthatsucks,35ene0,AirPhforce,3,Sun May 10 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. That's a lot less random than I expected. I guess ""random"" doesn't necessarily mean ""unfair""."

Wellthatsucks,35ene0,AirPhforce,6,Sun May 10 00:15:02 2015 UTC,"Oh also, there are about 10 piss breaks throughout the day.  These are also on a schedule. One that your instructor has memorized.   You literally eat, shit, piss, drink, sleep, run, etc on what seems like the whim of your instructor. So yeah, when they get pissed, it's extremely intimidating."

Wellthatsucks,35ene0,Captain_Gnardog,3,Sat May 9 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"I went through Basic five years ago. Know your reporting statement, (Sir, trainee Gnardog reports as ordered) hydrate (1/2 to 3/4 canteen per hour, not to exceed 12 canteens per day), it helps if you know the enlisted ranks going in already (they can and will stop and quiz you at any time), don't look any instructors in the eye during chow, eat as fast as fucking possible. Try not to get stuck on the latrine crew (the instructors will come in at night and seriously wreck your shit if there is so much as a speck of dust in the sink), look out for your wingman (in this case, the dude you share a bunk with and if you're in a single bunk, the guy next to you), keep your mouth shut, try to get noticed as little as possible. And don't wear anything dumb to your first night there (we had one dude show up in an ""I'm an American Airman"" tshirt the recruiter gave him, and hoooollllyyyyy shit they tore his ass apart. Another guy showed up in moccasins.)"
Wellthatsucks,35ene0,S-A-F-E-T-Ydance,2,Sun May 10 01:39:14 2015 UTC,10+ years ago.  You want some advice or something? I can't imagine the process changed that much.

Wellthatsucks,35ene0,Captain_Gnardog,6,Sat May 9 23:46:09 2015 UTC,"Do not pick any job that's ""General"" despite the huge bonus, no general mechanical, no general electrical, no open general. You will get a terrible job.  Do not pick anything related to aircraft maintenance or vehicle maintenance. It's going to suck, you're going to do long-ass hours for no reason and no extra money, and you might get trained enough to do 1/4th of the civilian version of your job for your trouble, so when you get out you're going to need many certifications, which you could get anyway despite your experience and which you have to take classes to teach you what you already know. For example, there is no usaf job that gets you even half of an a&p license, which you need to do anything on aircraft on the outside.  Imagine analysis, finance, programming, admin, dental, radiology, these are the good jobs. Particularly the last two, because, like maintenance jobs, you get hands on experience in an actual career and can then get certified and, unlike fixing holes in planes, get a very well paying job when you get out (because healthcare is expanding and airports are super-shrinking). Any job that requires a security clearance and is some kind of desk-job is ALSO fantastic, because even if you're just pushing paper, having that clearance means when you get out people will pay you six figures just to handle the payroll of people who ALSO have a clearance, because it costs a ton to get someone clearance, but if you already have one, it's very little for the company to maintain.   It might seem like the easy way out, and it is, but what would you rather do? Sit knee-deep in a fuel bladder from 5 am to 7 pm, six days a week plus one sunday a month for the exact same amount of money and prestige as someone who sits behind a desk and compares satellite picture A to satellite picture B from 7 am to 3 pm? Or runs an x-ray machine three times before lunch, then attends 2 squadron functions after lunch then goes home?  Trust me, stay out of blue collar. It's worth waiting 6+ months in the DEP just to get a good job. Odds are the job you pick will literally define your life. Don't settle for less and don't get bribed by a 5k enlistment bonus.   edit: IF ITS NOT ON YOUR ENLISTMENT CONTRACT YOU WONT GET IT. If they say, at meps, ""we can fix this later"" guess what, they won't or can't."

Wellthatsucks,35ene0,DaftAdvocate,8,Sat May 9 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"You're supposed to technically. Every command or question screamed at you by a Drill Instructor is supposed to be met with an equally loud response of Aye (understood), Yes or No, or the appropriate response to what is being said followed by Sir/Ma'am. In this guys case he's getting his ass chewed out by a few DI's all screaming different things so it would be difficult to tell what to scream in response. Keep in mind however that this is very stressful to a recruit who knows too well what can happen if he fucks up even further in front of what looks like several Kill Hats. Best case scenario they scream at him to shut up then scream at him some more. Second best they take him to the quarter deck for the worst kind of fun n' games and/or target him for the duration of basic for shitty tasks. Worst case they maybe kick him out for failure to adapt. The last is very devastating to a recruit especially because of all the time and work it took to even get there but rarely happens.

I'm talking the entire front part of the leg of my shorts just covered in a huge, 6 inch long smear of ketchup.

Sorry for the obvious Cub jab at the end there, but the point applies to other situations as well. Can you honestly say that you'd be in a calm, rational state after having a beer spilled all over you due to a stranger's carelessness? Get fucking real.   Edit: I get it, you're all the coolest-headed people on Reddit. I guess I just get upset when I'm somewhere that I can't change out of my outfit or dry off and have to deal with being wet/sticky the rest of the time I'm there.

Wellthatsucks,34xd4k,TateXD,1 point,Tue May 5 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"There's no way she got anymore than a bit of mist or some drops on her. The dude is soaked. If he was upset I'd see it as totally warranted. I mean, accident or no accident, it's still frustrating. But the guy realized the ridiculousness and just smiled about it. Maybe he's upset, but he didn't put the guy down, at least from what we can tell. But the chick immediately ""jumped down this guy's throat"". I've had drinks spilled on me and I haven't flipped out. I can't say for sure that I wouldn't be upset or have the reaction this chick did. And if I did I'd expect someone to believe me to be exaggerative, because it is, either way. I'm not trying to come off as an asshole, nor argue. I'm just saying it's a ridiculous reaction. Even if I were to do it. For me though, I see these quick situations like this where someone is caught off guard, as a glimpse into how they really act. And, it could totally be something out of the ordinary for her, totally possible."
Wellthatsucks,34xd4k,whitestguyuknow,1 point,Tue May 5 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I agree that getting legitimately angry at the guy whose fault it was would be a ridiculous reaction. When thinking back on my own experiences, though, I can remember times that being unexpectedly spilled on (or caused to spill on myself, which I think has happened more frequently to me) and I definitely remember times where that caused me to be a bit mad for about 10 seconds or so. After that, I'm usually just a bit annoyed, but there's no actual anger towards the people at fault because that wouldn't do any good. I think that the point I was originally trying to make is that you can't really judge a person off of their initial reaction after something like this happens and people took it as ""she had a right to be mad at him."""
Wellthatsucks,34xd4k,TateXD,2,Tue May 5 21:42:33 2015 UTC,"Well, with me, I've deliberately worked on myself not to have instant outbursts. I'm not perfect but it's actually one of the handful of things I deliberately work on. I can be a real asshole and I'm very blatant. I say exactly what I mean, and I don't pussy foot around a lot of things. That's my personality and I feel like adding anything more on top of that is just me being too much of an ass. And with being at events like in this gif, trying to have a good time along with everyone else around me, I try to be conscious of me being a jerk or prepare myself to deal with people not in their right minds for one reason or another. So if this happened to me, I'd already be expecting something like that, so it'd be even less likely that I'd blow up. I guess a good chunk is the fact that I've got no idea where someone else's mind is at, and alcohol on top of that is a bad mix. But regardless I don't want to kill someone's fun. This guy made a complete accident, having a good time. Now she doesn't know they're being filmed, but that adds to this guys embarrassment, especially now that it's being spread. So her cursing him out for a very minor thing like that just seems even worse than what it'd be if it wasn't filmed. At least in my mind. It's just wildly over the top, like I said earlier of course, but also kinda like adding insult to injury.   I know not everyone tries to work on themselves, like I described myself. But I can only relate her reaction with my experiences. I understand the effort I put into it, which really isn't a lot at all, for my own reasons like I explained. So that's just why I made my comments and just see it as her being a real bitch, just being honest. And yeah, just like you said, there's nothing that cursing at the guy will benefit. Everything to do with it is only negative"
Wellthatsucks,34xd4k,whitestguyuknow,0,Wed May 6 04:18:42 2015 UTC,"That's cool that it's something that you honestly try to work on. I guess maybe I could benefit from doing something similar and working on my reactions to surprising, somewhat negative events. I think that I'm pretty good in that aspect already, but could see myself saying something similar to ""Are you fucking kidding me"" (as the girl's lips read to me) once (not twice, so yeah, she did go a little bit overboard) before calming down into an annoyed state and then calming down and forgetting about it in about 10 minutes. I was really just talking about initial reactions with all of these comments and I think that some people mistook that.   I guess my main point with all of this is that all we saw was the first 4ish seconds of her reaction, which could be telling of her overall reaction, but on the other hand, she could have calmed down pretty quickly after the initial shock of the spilled beer."
Wellthatsucks,34xd4k,TateXD,2,Wed May 6 04:29:20 2015 UTC,I've had a beer spilled on me twice the same night because of the same strangers happiness and I didn't start berating the person.

Wellthatsucks,34j8fd,Nexusmaxis,5,Sun May 3 18:50:31 2015 UTC,"Basic concept...wind blows, pushes boat. This works great if the wind is blowing TOWARDS where you want to go. Set the sails, sit back, crack a open beer and head in a straight line to your destination.  This doesn't work too well when the wind is blowing FROM the direction of where you want to go. If you point the boat directly into the wind, which is where you want to go, you will not be going anywhere. The sails will just flap and you will look like a noob.  This is where tacking comes in, it's basically heading in a zig zag towards your destination with the wind on one side. Every so often,  you turn 90 degrees (roughly) so the wind is on the other side.  Think of the boat as a watch face with 12:00 being the front and 6:00 being the back. The wind will be coming from around 10:00 which is also your destination. The tack would be turning to the left so the wind/destination is now at 2:00. So you keep doing these zig zags until you get to where you want to go.  As you can imagine, the wind coming from the side will also be pushing the boat over. This is why many photos of yachts racing show them leaning right over with the crew hanging off the other side using their body weight to keep the boat as upright as possible.  A crash tack (emergency tack) means you don't have time to prepare for the tack, just turn and deal with the sails after. Usually involves having to duck while the main sail boom (pole) comes flying across from one side of the boat to the other. Believe you me, you don't want your head in the way of that.  TLDR:  a tack is turning roughly 90 degrees (right angle) to the direction you're going. Crash tack (emergency tack) is not planned and which you don't have time to prep for. I did this to get way from either an island in the middle of the ocean not on the charts, or a whale trolling me."

Wellthatsucks,33ue22,dog_in_the_vent,3,Sun Apr 26 01:10:27 2015 UTC,"Ill downvote and then explain:  the bottom right 3x3 cube has 2 5's printed, making this a broken sudoku."
Wellthatsucks,33ue22,timstm,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:33:27 2015 UTC,"It is impossible because in the bottom right 3x3 grid, there are 2 ""5""s printed. When a number is printed (as opposed to written by the person solving it)  that implies that THAT particular placement of THAT exact number is correct. So having those 2 ""5""s in those particular spots printed on breaks 2 of the three conditions for a sudoku to be correct. The three conditions are:  1) every horizontal row contains one instance of every number of 1-9.  2) every vertical column contains one instance of every number of 1-9.  3) every 3x3 grid contains one instance of every number of 1-9.  Therefore the two 5s breaks rules 2 and 3 because there are both two 5s in a single column, and two 5s in a single 3x3 grid"
Wellthatsucks,33ue22,timstm,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:13:13 2015 UTC,The goal is to fill every 3x3-square and every row and column of the big 9x9-square with the numbers 1-9.

I wouldn't change it, I love him and I love being a dad, but it has definitely made life different.  My wife and I still go and do a lot of the same stuff we did before we had our son, it just happens before his bedtime.  He's traveled with us to festivals and the beach and been an awesome happy baby for it.  I wouldn't have taken my youngest nephew to all of those things though (he was a rather fussy little man).  So it depends on the kid too.  And a full night's sleep?  I haven't seen one of those since he was born.  Enjoy your sleep while you can, if you plan on having kids.

Wellthatsucks,331nqy,LiirFlies,0,Sun Apr 19 16:51:17 2015 UTC,"That's weird, though I imagine it's because these front-loader combo-units are more popular in small apartments where younger people are likely to encounter them.  They're expensive, they're incredibly complicated internally and therefore unreliable, they're generally pretty efficient but take FOREVER to wash and dry, and they have very low capacity.  The unit I had in the UK was fairly new (circa 2010) and it took literally six hours for an entire cycle. My top-loading washer and separate dryer unit can do double the clothes in 1/3rd the time, and I'm fairly certain they were less than half the cost.  Oh and also, the front-loader I had had a rubber gasket around the front to seal the door. Water would constantly linger in the seams of the gasket and mildew up and made the whole thing kind of smelly."
Wellthatsucks,331nqy,Frostiken,4,Sun Apr 19 08:25:36 2015 UTC,"They are more expensive, and the door can cause odor if left closed.  The rest of the points are off.  Capacity is on average much larger. The drum on a front load doesn't have an agitator. This leaves room for more clothes, and also means your clothes aren't being stretched and beaten. Compare the cubic volume on a front load and a non-high efficiency top load, I'm not making it up.  Wash cycle time is nearly identical. I've never heard of a machine taking six hours unless it was a shitty washer/dryer combo. Actually, rereading your comment, I think that's exactly what you had. In which case I'd agree, those are horrible.   Stand alone front load washers have a cycle of 45 mins on average. They also spin several hundred RPMs faster, so your clothes come out dryer and take half the time in a stand alone dryer.  Front loads also use 1/3 the water of a top load. This makes a big difference, especially if you use warm or hot water often.  I sold appliances in college and became very familiar with washers."
Wellthatsucks,331nqy,uwhuskytskeet,1 point,Sun Apr 19 14:17:27 2015 UTC,Top loaders don't have agitators anymore either. But I agree it's really about where on the spectrum of shittiness a particular model is.

Wellthatsucks,32i0dk,0j0s,3,Tue Apr 14 01:27:34 2015 UTC,"Invest in some software to image the machine.  You do a clean install and get the core software you use regularly set up.

Wellthatsucks,32i0dk,Dontblameme1,3,Tue Apr 14 13:58:44 2015 UTC,"MBAM is good, but here's the thing: sometimes, a thorough uninstall via, say, Revo Uninstaller, or even via Programs and Features can knock the suckers out. Also, remember that viruses are just the small subset of malware that exist break systems via illegal (in Windows) file operations. The rest of the malware out there mught even 100% obey the rules of Windows, and still give you ads, sell your browsing habits, or run code on your machine for the creator's purpose.  So, here's my strategy: 1) Investigate all unknown entries in Programs and Features...if I don't recognize the program or publisher, it's off to google for me. 2) Remove via Revo; it gets the residual files and registry entries that might try to reinfect you. 3) Scan, with your one anti-virus prigram (two is a bad idea for technical reasons), with Malwarebytes AntiMaleware, CCleaner, and others. 4) Change your email password at least. It's the most important. 5) System image if you desire.  Even all of that doesn't guarantee digital safety. The full wipe, for better or worse, is the best weapon against all the crap out there (no pun intended). Familiarize yourself, and at least in Windows 8.x, it's never been easier.  A clean Windows Backup file can help, but in some ways, just bringing back your files and re-downloading the programs can be a better choice."

Wellthatsucks,31po4v,funfungiguy,3,Tue Apr 7 17:07:32 2015 UTC,Right. I think it just kind of depends. It's a semi-reasonable toss up between people's preferences and financial wellness.   $20 and up and more people would take the pee. $5 and under less will take the pee. $10 it just kind of depends. Remember it might have that faint urine smell on it still after rinsing.   Concern over pee/germs could also influence the decision. Some people get really squeamish around public bathrooms. The thought of their bill (or glasses) touching urine might be enough for them to nope right out of there and write off the loss.

It made it part way to the sewage plant, too!  But part way is not all the way, unfortunately.  The plumbers tried to root it out, which didn't work.  They found the blockage with a video cam inspection, and jack hammered out the concrete encasing the plumbing, which, inconveniently was in the Dean's office. They found the offending iPhone, found it's serial number, and Apple provided them with the ownership records of that phone.  It was a student, and they got the bill for the entire effort.

They pulled up an old wooden bar from underneath the house on the corner which was a wine & whiskey bar. The owner pointed it out. Those weren't garages those were horse stalls which explains why so narrow and a cart with horses used to be able to circle down underneath the stalls and the ground where we thought was underground railroad tunnel and bring out the whiskey barrels that's how large it was. It was fascinating information. They filled the hole. He said at some point years ago the entrance to the deep underground space got closed off from either the house or stalls. His mother grew up there, 4th generation n was the oldest sibling and remembers the horses n carts disappearing underground."""

Wellthatsucks,30i7jb,spykid,10,Fri Mar 27 19:02:54 2015 UTC,Desert Sand is nothing like sand at the beach. It is incredibly fine and behaves almost like a liquid in many respects. Hence you can sled on it or even ski on it if you tried.

Humans have always talked among one another if they think someone is good looking. It's really not that big of a deal as you're trying to make it out to be.

Wellthatsucks,300rgt,Dominub,0,Tue Mar 24 03:23:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll bite... How am I a creep for pointing out someone needlessly drooling on what looks like a young girl when the topic is how unfortunate it is to chip a tooth? What if we could stop being so simple and discuss things of higher importance or at least on point with the subject other than saying ""she's hot""? Lets just make ""she's hot"" the top comment.   It's really not a big deal in the grand scheme of things but I am disappointed how people claim to be so great when they still act like monkeys even on a small scale.   Also, thanks for checking my karma. It's even more sad someone standing up for people being more civil is considered a troll."
Wellthatsucks,300rgt,Snotpuff,2,Tue Mar 24 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"Because it's just not fucking normal. You're making a big deal out of nothing. You seem to be somewhat intimidated by something so simple as a comment about someone's looks, which to me suggests that you would behave rather weird in social situations. I guess giving someone a compliment is just not acceptable.   Now I know you'll come back telling me that it's speculation and that I don't know you at all, and that I shouldn't make assumptions based on your comments. But before you do realize that you are calling someone a creep for following their basic human instinct, also based on a internet comment.    I am disappointed how people claim to be so great when they still act like monkeys even on a small scale.   Literally no one here claimed they were better than monkeys.   It's even more sad someone standing up for people being more civil is considered a troll.   Who did you stand up for? He said she's hot. If you think that by telling him he should not say that you're standing up for her then that's pretty laughable. Also, I did not think you were a troll because you ""stood up"" for her. I thought you were a troll because it was just so outlandish to make a whole social justice topic out of this that I couldn't believe someone could be serious about that."
Wellthatsucks,300rgt,Dominub,0,Tue Mar 24 19:32:08 2015 UTC,calling her hot is just as uncalled for as calling her ugly. it's off topic and kinda creepy. bottom line. unless you are posting in the subreddits that ask for people to comment on their appearance or asking your friend if you look good in something. you're kinda freaking out over it more than me it seems.

Wellthatsucks,2zv5v5,crashdemon,13,Sun Mar 22 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"Chocolate bloom:       Chocolate bloom is a whitish coating that can appear on the surface of chocolate. This effect is one of the main concerns in the production of chocolate. There are two types of bloom: fat bloom, arising from changes in the fat in the chocolate; and sugar bloom, formed by the action of moisture on the sugar ingredients. The unsightly crystals of fat and sugar bloom limit the shelf life of many chocolates. Chocolate that has ""bloomed"" is still safe to eat, but may have an unappetizing appearance and surface texture.     Image i - A chocolate bar exhibiting chocolate bloom (lighter colored areas).

Here's the write up from the NHRA website:  Dixon launched hard and the car was hooked up and then just before the finish line the car bowed up and it appeared the chassis broke. The front half went flying really high into the air and the rear half of the dragster was about 15 to 20 feet in the air. When the cockpit came back to earth, it landed on the big rear Goodyears and then slammed into the wall. The car climbed up on to the wall and then back down on to the track. The rear half of the car continued to slid along the wall for a long way and came to a stop....Dixon got out of the car under his own power. The front end of the car took out the finish line cones as it broke away, so his time will be DQ'ed. Kalitta started to drift out of the groove and then it dropped a cylinder and he crossed the centerline just before the finish line, so his run is DQ'ed."""

Wellthatsucks,2yf5jy,bathrobehero,81,Wed Mar 18 07:50:53 2015 UTC,I'd probably take off my jacket so if the ice breaks I can swim freely and lay down on my stomach to distribute my weight over a larger area and use my hands to paddle to the shore. Or I would just shit myself standing which is probably a more realistic scenario.
Wellthatsucks,2yf5jy,key2616,23,Mon Mar 9 09:46:52 2015 UTC,"Your scenario #1: you're going to try to swim on top of your jacket?  I guess that will mean that it won't get waterlogged and drag you under, so you've got that going for you.  But then you've got to swim ~100M and find a place to climb out.  And then somehow warm up.  Good luck with that.  Scenario #2: Yep.  Do that.  Hopefully whoever took the picture called for help before they documented the idiocy."

Wellthatsucks,2yf5jy,key2616,3,Mon Mar 9 15:03:37 2015 UTC,"Well, people are stupid (see picture), so maybe.  Assuming that you're right, though, ""warming them up"" is not exactly as simple as fishing them out of the water.  They're coming out of 33 degree water into air that is colder than body temperature, so that's going to keep dropping.  Unless whoever took the picture did so from a warm car equipped with blankets and warm liquids, their best bet is to wait for someone with a boat to show up.  Like the fire department."
Wellthatsucks,2yf5jy,revofire,3,Mon Mar 9 14:29:37 2015 UTC,I know what you mean. The guy was on land so he can probably give them his jacket for a bit. Either way as along as he can get help...
Wellthatsucks,2yf5jy,smegma_legs,4,Mon Mar 9 14:35:04 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure he meant he would lay his jacket on the piece of ice that broke off with him on it and paddle the ice chunk like a boat.

Wellthatsucks,2xxlph,phivealive,17,Thu Mar 5 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"Among folks who work for tips, even black folks who work for tips, it is very well known that black people inn general do not tip well if at all. This is also common for people from outside the U.S. where tipping is not the social norm. You run a pretty big risk saying ""aw shit, I got a table of black people so I guess I'm not getting tipped."" Saying ""aw shit, I got a table of Canadians so I guess I'm not getting tipped"" is considerably safer for your continued employment should you be overheard. Yeah yeah, ""you can't generalize"" blah blah blah. But if you've ever worked for tips, you know its a numbers game and if you're serving black folks or foreigners the odds are stacked heavily against you."

Wellthatsucks,2xni0j,ohmygawd669,9,Mon Mar 2 08:49:46 2015 UTC,How?
Wellthatsucks,2xni0j,pilvy,7,Mon Mar 2 15:13:22 2015 UTC,Well not so much browser history as such but all depending on your router - I am using a Mikrotik router and I get a Nice Live Overview of whoever accesses what on my network.  I don`t but should I choose to this can be logged to a database for later review in effect capturing a devices every move on what it accesses.  Edit: missed a letter
Wellthatsucks,2xni0j,YcoutureBlushdeMarie,4,Mon Mar 2 18:19:32 2015 UTC,Many different ways. I prefer Wireshark
Wellthatsucks,2xni0j,omegaaf,2,Mon Mar 2 20:56:23 2015 UTC,You cannot access browser history via wireshark. Wireshark is a packet capturing program. If you have it always on & always running you can capture traffic across the network which could reveal history. It can only record what it sees when it is on.  Assume every network has some sort of logger.
Wellthatsucks,2xni0j,omegaaf,0,Wed Apr 1 09:54:02 2015 UTC,"If you have it running long enough on lets say a server inside that network, it pretty much is a browser history, especially when it tells you everything from what pages have been visited to what passwords were used."
Wellthatsucks,2xni0j,omegaaf,1 point,Wed Apr 1 11:33:37 2015 UTC,"But it still isn't. Also it will do nothing if the target machine is using a VPN or Tor. It will not show you the browser history, only what happened while it was watching and only what it could see. There are plenty of ways around this."
Wellthatsucks,2xni0j,thatoneguy42,1 point,Wed Apr 1 11:47:55 2015 UTC,"There isn't a target machine, it gathers ALL data from ALL computers on that network. Whether it is encrypted or not is another story, but everything including tor and vpn are susceptible to spying.   This is part of my network without all the wireless devices. Pixel is the only device in the network that has a windows installation, everything else is Linux. Even still, if you can gain access to anything on that network, you can still get access to that VPN through other services."
Wellthatsucks,2xni0j,AngeloPappas,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:10:43 2015 UTC,It doesn't say anything about router settings...

Wellthatsucks,2xni0j,Mxtt-1,2,Mon Mar 2 16:00:47 2015 UTC,For example it seems netgear routers have very sparse logs that are maybe a few hundred lines total. Not enough to be useful.

Wellthatsucks,2xni0j,r3dlazer,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:15:52 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I would argue that that's not too common a feature. Also, that's not exactly 'browser history' either. Also, some routers may show connections but it's not like it logs them, certainly not over long period of time. I maintain that the title of this post is misleading."

Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,pyrowolf8,5,Sun Mar 1 23:57:56 2015 UTC,Well hopefully they don't grow too massive.   If I could choose I'd say in the average range of like 9-12.

My question to you is are you located near a Ross store? I don't have feet as big as yours (Men's 13 US), but I go to Ross from time to time and always see they have a selection (maybe 10-20 different shoes) around the sizes 22 and up.

Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,ChokeZero,7,Mon Mar 2 02:38:40 2015 UTC,Your right foot appears larger than your left. Is this accurate or does the pic just make it appear so?
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,ChokeZero,7,Mon Mar 2 02:41:15 2015 UTC,"That foot is bigger than the other, but the camera's angle exaggerates the size difference. But it is bigger."
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,ChokeZero,2,Sun Mar 1 21:44:38 2015 UTC,My left is bigger than my right. I can see it and it's usually an issue with my normal size shoes. But I guess custom shoes is custom shoes.

Good luck and I hope some sneaker exec from Nike or Adidas sees this thread and hooks you up."
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,tech_kra,5,Mon Mar 2 01:34:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I try to have the best attitude I can. I'm stuck with these feet for the rest of my life and while they do get annoying, there's not much I can really do. And they're gonna grow anyway, so there's not really any use in being too upset. Nothing's gonna change it. I've gotten used to all the jokes by now anyway. I don't mind the attention now as much as I did when I was a kid. I mean yeah it would be nice to have normal sized feet, but that's obviously not gonna happen. So I just make the best of it."
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,Cherubaal,3,Mon Mar 2 03:25:08 2015 UTC,They were always really big. I was already size 13 by age 8. They just kept growing (and still are).
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,Respiratory,4,Mon Mar 2 03:29:39 2015 UTC,"I really feel for you, OP. I can't imagine how annoying this must make your day-to-day life. My ex-husband was extremely tall (about 6'5""), very skinny and had huge feet and he took a lot of ribbing all day from all his co-workers about all three of those things.  His feet were nowhere near as large as yours (size 16 as I recall), but it was so hard finding shoes that fit that also looked nice. And he was so self-conscious about how big they were that he would refuse to wear shoes that draw attention to your feet or make them look bigger, like Converse.    It was so difficult to try to find good shoes in his size that I actually thought that he must be at the top range of how large a foot can even grow. I'm amazed that you're a 22!   Maybe someday you can beat the world record, I guess? http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-feet-on-a-living-person-male/"
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,AlexDemere,6,Sun Mar 1 22:47:28 2015 UTC,"Having huge feet can be rough. Not just with finding shoes, but basic tasks too. One of the worst thing is walking on stairs. My feet are always too big for the steps. But yeah, shoes are also a huge pain. The world record might be something I could be heading for though, so I guess there's a plus."
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,sonofbmw,3,Sun Mar 1 22:49:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, stairs! I forgot about those. He did hate stairs.  And I forgot that I was never to tuck the sheets in under the mattress at the foot of the bed when I was making it, because he liked to sleep on his back and his feet were too tall and his legs too long to be able to cope with tucked in sheets.  Good luck, anyway. Other people suggested swimming. If having large feet is actually a benefit in swimming and you like doing it, maybe that is a good idea. If you became a great swimmer you could end up in the Olympics. You never know. Stranger things have happened."
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,Natholomew4098,3,Mon Mar 2 00:36:27 2015 UTC,"Yep. Blankets and sheets can be a pain. When I'm laying in bed, I try my best not to roll over because when I do, the blankets will just come along with my feet and fall off the bed. It's annoying. And yeah, my feet are like flippers, so swimming is an advantage for me."
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,Natholomew4098,3,Mon Mar 2 00:40:08 2015 UTC,So why hasn't your feet stopped growing?

When your friends make fun of you for playing ""girl"" games threaten to insert your size 22s.   As others have said, you're a natural for swimming. Get on the team and if your coach is worth anything, you'll be all state or even an Olympic contender.   Just remember, everyone is awkward at 14, even the cool kids who pretend they're not."
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,available_username2,2,Mon Mar 2 01:40:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure hopscotch or jumping rope would be good activities lol The squares in hopscotch would have to be way bigger than they typically are lol And jumping rope could work eventually... but probably not anytime soon. Dancing might help though. I'm a terrible dancer, but I'm sure I could get used to it.   I know I'm not the only awkward teen. It's just my feet kinda make me more awkward than most of the others I know. Since my feet grew and grew really fast, I never really was able to fully adapt to them. Everytime I do, they seem to just get bigger."
Wellthatsucks,2xlk1l,jtsnake45,2,Mon Mar 2 01:42:45 2015 UTC,"You don't have to land entirely in the squares, just try to land on the center and work on getting through the course faster. Seriously, it'll help. I only wear an 8 1/2 but I have 30 years on you. I worked with a trainer a couple of years ago and she had me doing hop scotch and similar stuff with a rope ladder on the floor, working on speed as much as accuracy. It was amazing how much it helped my coordination and agility in just a few sessions.   Good luck!"

Now here is a story of someone I know.  He's bombing this mountain road and he's leading the pack by a good amount. He's nearing the bottom, the apex of his speed (~50mph) when all of a sudden a big ol' deer jumps right in front of him. He breaks his tuck but doesn't have enough time to stop and slams right into the side of the deer at anywhere between 45mph-50mph.  Everyone, having seen what just happens, comes to a stop to check on the 2 lumps of meat now laying on the side of the road.  The deer crawled a couple feet and died. The skater broke a few ribs and got the name Deerhunter.  TLDR: Downhill skater hits and kills a deer around 50mph, gets nicknamed Deerhunter."

Wellthatsucks,2x9qjh,HelloYesThisIsDuck,2,Thu Feb 26 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"After living in the Great North Woods of New England for a few years, this became a constant threat anytime you drove.  It was not uncommon for you to hear that someone nearby, or someone you knew, or someone your friend knew, who hit a deer with his car at least once a month (more common during the rut).  After you hear about this so many times, you can only hope that the driver who hit the deer also managed to kill the animal, preferably quickly.  If you're going to get your car totaled, at least you have something to put in your freezer.  Friendly tip for those visiting the GNW for the first time: you should probably bring a firearm in case you hit a dear with your car.  The sound they make when injured is horrific, and more often than not the only thing you can do for them is put them out of their misery.  Bonus points: you roll up on a recent hit, and the driver doesn't want the meat.  State law dictates that whomever is next to claim the carcass is entitled to it.  That was the only way most people ever ate moose -- it's hard to get a permit to go moose hunting.  Once we got some brown bear this way, but it was too gamey to eat."

Wellthatsucks,2x3er6,OrigamiAlien,18,Wed Feb 25 17:44:17 2015 UTC,"When a boat flips coming out of dry dock it usually means that there was not enough ballast in the tanks.  The cabin structure is above the waterline, and anyone who has passed a piloting and steerage test would know this.  Ballast is an item on all checklists I've ever seen, but it seems an item was skipped in this case.  Sometimes a valve or gate is left open or fails to close, but there would have been evidence of the problem upon filling.  It is more likely somebody just didn't bother to check, putting the blame entirely in the lap of the launch master.  Airbags can come loose on launches and frankly, they often do, but if the ballast is present, the boat will right itself.  These ships are designed to go all of the way over and still right themselves, as long as the cabin hatches are closed on launch, which they should have been.  That is another oversight.  The CO of that launch crew would find themselves under a court martial in most navies.  The ship becomes a hazard to traffic and must be floated before the drydock can be used again.  Too many standard procedures were ignored to count it seems."

Wellthatsucks,2wmt3y,autistic_mongoose75,56,Sat Feb 21 06:13:44 2015 UTC,"I used to work as a DJ/bouncer for the only strip club in our city (which is now closed). Because of our laws, alcohol was not allowed to be served - meaning that the age of admittance went from 19 to 14. In order to make the place relatively ""kid-friendly"" the owner bought a bunch of old arcade machines, as well as one of these claw machines.  The claw machine, however, was filled with sex toys, handcuffs, thongs, etc.  One time one of the boss' friends came in to clear the cash overflow, and she ended up having to bring along her 6 year old son.  Normally, we wouldn't allow children inside but being the boss' friend we couldn't exactly stop her. I ordered the girls to come off stage while the kid was there, despite the groans from customers.  Anyways, this friend passes her son some coins and tells him to play in the arcade. Roughly 20 minutes later, her son wanders into the DJ booth while sucking on a giant pink vibrator. He said it tasted like cotton candy, and wouldn't give it up. I ended up getting a hold of it, but he held onto it - still sucking on one end.  Now picture this: the mother walks in right as I grabbed the vibrator. I'm holding onto one end, while the kid has the other in his mouth.  ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING TO MY SON?"" is all I heard before she shoved me away from her child and picked him up. She screamed at me for being a pervert, and that she should have me arrested. She didn't calm down until her son told her he won a candy prize in the claw machine, and that it tasted like cotton candy. I'm not sure if she realized what had happened, or if she still thought I was some pedophile shoving dildos in children's mouths. She gave me a long glare before turning around and leaving with her kid.  I never heard anything on the matter, and wasn't fired. Still, one of the scariest moments of my life."

The only reason 14 and up is allowed is because it wasn't an ""all-nude"" strip club. As long as the girls kept on one piece of clothing while dancing, there was no law being broken by teens being there. We used to get groups of teens coming in at lunch time to buy dances, and I could honestly say that teens made up the majority of the club's income.  Anyways, if anyone had found out that a child was inside we would have been shut down pretty damn quick. The manager had been fined a before because of 10-12 year olds sneaking in and then getting caught by their parents. The laws were pretty strict, naturally.  The place closed down last year after 35 years of service. A new law had passed in our province prohibiting ANY strip club - full nude or not."

Wellthatsucks,2vpzoo,RLJoey,58,Fri Feb 13 03:15:13 2015 UTC,"I've been building rock crawlers for years, I've been on the jeep scene since I was 15.   If you paid $4000 for a new transmission in a jeep, you bent over, and had the largest transmission service guy in that shop pummel your poo hole dry the equivalent of 17 days straight.  I'm guessing that is an 03-06 TJ with a 4.0.  The auto trans in those is a 42RLE, a freshly rebuilt one will set you back $800.  If you know how to rebuild auto transmissions, you can buy a rebuild kit for $62, and about 4 hours of work.   You can buy a junked trans for $200 on the open market.   That transmission shop had roughly $130 in parts into rebuilding your transmission and no way possible did they have more than 8 hours into the rebuild and swap.     To replace that transmission, it takes one guy and a jack roughly 8 hours.  On a hoist with a friend to help hold the exhaust and help you lift off the transfer case, that is a maximum of 4 hours from start to finish if you're not pounding beers while doing it.   6 bolts on the crossover, drop the exhaust with 5 bolts,  unbolt the rear drive shaft with 4 small bolts, remove the transfer case from the transmission which is 8 bolts, and then you remove the transmission from the engine block with 12 bolts.      3 electronic sensor plugs, and the shifter selector, and you are done with the removal.   Putting it back together is usually half the time as removal because all of the bolts have been cracked free, especially the exhaust bolts.  6 years ago I exploded an AX-5 transmission (YJ era) when I came down hard after a 60-70' jump at the dunes around 9:00 am.   I parked it, grabbed my socket set out, and removed the trans in 2 hours.     The case was obliterated, so picked one up at a local salvage yard for $600, and had it installed by 4pm, by myself, laying on my back in the sand without a jack.   tl;dr,  you got raped, and were charged roughly $400/hour by a transmission shop.  edit:   btw,  for a whopping $3, you can add a hose, 6 zip ties, and extend the vent tube up on that transmission.  Once that is done you can hydrolock the fuck out of your engine whenever you'd like, but as long as the vent is above water, your trans will be fine.      If you really want to be a baller, you can vent your t-case for around $2.    http://www.factorychryslerparts.com/images/parts/Chrysler/fullsize/i2232347.jpg"

Wellthatsucks,2vpzoo,Joliet_Jake_Blues,5,Fri Feb 13 03:49:10 2015 UTC,Tell the 'wrecker' (not really sure what that is) that he can go fuck himself?
Wellthatsucks,2vpzoo,Joliet_Jake_Blues,3,Fri Feb 13 05:11:41 2015 UTC,"They park behind you so you can't leave until they leave. This isn't their first rodeo.  Police always back up the businesses, especially when I'm from 2 towns over.  At most they tell you it's a civil matter.  (and a ""wrecker"" is a tow truck.  I picked it up when I lived in Indiana and it was so hick sounding I loved it.  They also say, ""I got into a wreck"" or ""I had a wreck"" when they have a car accident.  And don't get me started on how they pronounce, ""cement""...  (""SEA ment""))"
Wellthatsucks,2vpzoo,TheBlackHive,4,Fri Feb 13 09:02:59 2015 UTC,"Wrecker's actually a pretty common term. I'm surprised the other guy hadn't heard it.  That said, just carry a pair of jumper cables. They're cheap and super useful. If you're worried about not being able to find someone to jump you, carry a spare battery too. You can easily jump a dead battery from a fully charged one, even if it's not hooked up to a running alternator."
Wellthatsucks,2vpzoo,Joliet_Jake_Blues,4,Fri Feb 13 11:10:58 2015 UTC,"Not my car, I mentioned that twice in my post.  And I don't think a lot of people check for jumper cables when they borrow a car."

That being said, batteries and tires were two of the most common tow-ins.  People are lazy and stupid and don't know how to put on a spare.  Imagine all the money from people who tried to jump start with the cables crossed!"
Wellthatsucks,2vpzoo,TheBlackHive,2,Fri Feb 13 15:38:44 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't there be pretty much instant smoke and sparks from that? Like, enough to act as an early warning before any real damage is done? I can't speak from experience, because I've never even thought about crossing the cables."
Wellthatsucks,2vpzoo,M3mph1s,2,Fri Feb 13 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"I've seen it happen. He got a huge arc when he got the second clip close enough to the terminal. No permanent damage done, but there would be if he'd clipped it on fully. It could be a couple seconds before you react from the pow and grab the cables.  I installed a battery backwards once. Parts have me the wrong batt and I didn't notice. Same size, shape, post location, except the pos/ neg terminals were reversed. Blew a main fuse, but it did isn't job. Car came back the next day and needed a fuse for the amp or something I'm tossing up as a coincidence."

As someone who is a hunter who kills birds, I am telling you, specifically, in hunting, no one calls Tundra Swans ducks. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""flying thing I shoot"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of flyers, which includes things from vampire bats to robins to fighter jets.  So your reasoning for calling a Tundra Swan a duck is because random people ""call the pond things ducks?"" Let's get frogs and fish in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A Tundra Swan is a Tundra Swan and a member of the flying thing I shoot family. But that's not what you said. You said a Tundra Swan is a duck, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the flying things I shoot family ducks, which means you'd call vampire bats, fighter jets, and other flying things ducks, too.   Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

According to this the also use DC current, which apparently blows when there's snow out. The orange line isn't any better, being that there haven't been major rehab since 1981.   There are contracts for a new fleet of cars for both, but they won't arrive until at least 2018. Add to the fact the entire line is old and in need of major upgrades, at the same time our genius of a governor just went on tv saying how it's 'unacceptable' that the service was cancelled, all while cutting I think it's $40m from the MBTA budget. A budget which is already wicked underfunded as it is.  If you don't know anything about the T system in Boston, if you look at the T map, to get anywhere in the city, you have to go in the city. There's no circular ring, you generally have to go to one of three stations that act as a hub of sorts. Park, South, and North Station, I'm counting commuter rails.  Or at least from my experience.   They still have stop lights in the tunnels...  Hell, I'm pretty sure the Green line cars are from the early to mid-80's, and those are trolley's not subway cars."
Wellthatsucks,2vcb34,Dire88,1 point,Tue Feb 10 20:50:32 2015 UTC,Wow. That's incredible. And I can't imagine Boston's economy is suffering much. The North East has been doing pretty well. To cut out that much from public transportation budget is just hugely counter productive.
Wellthatsucks,2vcb34,Tiiimmmbooo,2,Tue Feb 10 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"Boston is doing really well overall. The MBTA is overloaded as it is.  They have a huge debt problem, roughly $9b worth, and a backlog of approx $3b worth of maintenance that's overdue.  Now add in daily ridership of 1.4m (2013) in a city of what? 650,000? The MBTA is the 5th most used public transit in the US. The city is booming, everyone wants to live here, but we're stuck with a metro system designed for the 70's-80's.  It's only going to get worse.  Edit: The MBTA/metro is the trolley's, subway, and buses, just to be clear."

Wellthatsucks,2v90c8,BenjiCG,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:12:32 2015 UTC,Quite a few sites are claiming it's a possible nuke-but highly doubt it.
Wellthatsucks,2v90c8,Exquisite_Aegis,11,Mon Feb 9 08:47:09 2015 UTC,"For anyone thinking about the remote possibility this was a nuclear fireball I'm going to be brutally logical with you. No.  If this were, the camera's processor would have burned out, the guy filming it would be blind, and more than likely have suffered second degree burns from a burst of pure light only created in one other place in the known universe - A SUN.  There were reports of americans being able to see the trinity tests because the light being produced was so intense it turned night to day in the surrounding area.  The light woke up a blind girl in a nearby town - that level of brightness  Also the whole global awareness thing in which ANY nuke being set off off ANYWHERE even remotely near any populated areas it would be worldwide news in seconds.  (Scuse caps, I suck at real formatting and I'm too lazy to work it out)"
Wellthatsucks,2v90c8,Scuttlebutt91,2,Mon Feb 9 10:40:46 2015 UTC,"Ammo dump, most likely. Saw an Army ammo dump blown up in Quang Tri Vietnam in '71; the explosion lit up the hills around me 20 miles away; it had the distinctive mushroom cloud like every video you've seen of nuclear tests. The explosions went on  all night. Fucking. Awesome."

Wellthatsucks,2v534w,Juan234,115,Sat Feb 7 23:53:13 2015 UTC,"Both tins are 7.5g or .25oz, it's clearly printed on each tin. They're not smaller, they're just different. Could be any number of reasons for why they made the change."
Wellthatsucks,2v534w,LeonProfessional,18,Sun Feb 8 00:52:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it looks like in the old design, they just put an additional piece of plastic on the bottom, covering the large indent that already existed. In the new one, it looks like they've just left that off, using less plastic. Which is a very smart choice, if you ask me."
Wellthatsucks,2v534w,causticwear,14,Sun Feb 8 01:59:25 2015 UTC,They could eliminate even more plastic by shaving off that extra lip.  With the added bonus that it'd fit in my pocket better.

Wellthatsucks,2v534w,DonGeronimo,10,Sun Feb 8 05:39:09 2015 UTC,Which is why they card-mount small items.

Wellthatsucks,2v534w,oceanmountain,2,Sun Feb 8 01:30:38 2015 UTC,If the container was full to the bottom I'd almost certainly lose it before finishing it. Most every CARMEX container I've ever gotten has been lost before it got spent fully.
Wellthatsucks,2v534w,isyourlisteningbroke,1 point,Sun Feb 8 02:24:31 2015 UTC,Has anyone even used up the whole container before losing it anyways?
Wellthatsucks,2v534w,shitterplug,-4,Sun Feb 8 23:54:54 2015 UTC,"This is called stealth pricing and a lot of it is driven by the supermarkets. I have a friend who works for Cadburys in the UK and they have a meeting with the supermarkets and tell them that costs have increased etc but the supermarket want to maintain the price point of say £1 so the only way to do it is to reduce the size. It's not usually the manufacturer who drives it. If you think about it, it is easier and cheaper for Carmex to keep things as they are."

Wellthatsucks,2ujbpg,goblackcar,2,Tue Feb 3 00:44:00 2015 UTC,"I used to live downtown in the middle of a large metropolitan city. After one large winter storm we were all stuck shoveling out our cars and chiseling the ice off the windshields.  I still remember see this guy work for over an hour to get his car cleared off and finally getting all the snow from around his car so he could pull out. Once he was all done he was standing there for a minute catching his breath ... when suddenly two large snow plows start coming down the street.  Because they were working in tandem, the rear plow was kicking up some major snow. I saw this dude panic, throw his shovel behind him and hop into his car. Sadly, it was too late. These plows kicked so much dirty snow around and on his car that it didn't even look like he'd done any work for the last hour. In fact, it looked worse because of some large snow ""boulders"".   I was cruelly laughing my ass off from the confines of my warm apartment, but I began to worry when I didn't see him come out of his car. Eventually I became a little worried, threw on some pants and jacket and went downstairs. Just as I was making my way to his vehicle I see him come out the passenger door. Those plows had kicked up so much snow he couldn't even get back out his driver side door.  To this day I remember him looking at me dejectedly and just saying , ""Fuck it."" as he walked off."

No not let off the gas till she is clear or dug in.  Works most times."
Wellthatsucks,2ujbpg,nb4hnp,2,Mon Feb 2 22:59:37 2015 UTC,"I did my best gunning it and got into the car from the passenger side, but I'm a little worried about gunning it because of all the other parked cars nearby; I might not be able to stop in time."

The upper right hand hinge failed and dropped the tempered glass door on it's lower left corner. The shock from dropping tempered glass causes on a corner will cause it to shatter as such. You could take a hammer to the flush face of that door and not get the same reaction.

Wellthatsucks,2u3fsg,ProtoJMan,2,Thu Jan 29 21:14:17 2015 UTC,They may have just been travelling too fast with that trailer. Without an anti-sway bar a trailer carrying that kind of weight will drag your car all over the road if you go too fast.
Wellthatsucks,2u3fsg,Boo_R4dley,2,Thu Jan 29 22:35:21 2015 UTC,This. Plus the trailer and the car probably weight more than the towing car making it nearly impossible to regain control after the swaying starts.
Wellthatsucks,2u3fsg,GruffStranger,2,Fri Jan 30 00:24:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I used to pull a nice heavy boat behind a 4 door sedan. When that swaying starts, the trailer is actually just pushing the car along. The way I'd stop it was to jam the brakes hard, which engaged the trailer brakes and lined everything up again."
Wellthatsucks,2u3fsg,SplashyMcPants,1 point,Fri Jan 30 01:17:50 2015 UTC,"The car is also too far back on the trailer, causing the front of the trailer to lift, subsequently relieving pressure from the rear wheels of the tow car. It can happen to big Ford and Chevy trucks, too."

So I popped into this small town supermarket to get some wine as I was heading to my aunties to stay the night (as the school I was interviewing for was in her town). I parked in a different spot then I normally would at this supermarket. So the spot was one of only about 3 that is actually covered by security camera footage.  I go in get the wine and come out to see this. I was able to check the camera footage to see that no one was around the car and saw it just pop. So I drop it into the local panel beaters and my in - laws pick me up.  I stayed at their house that night and they gave me a lift in the morning. So not much to do at the in - laws  except do research on this school I was going for an interview for (which I wouldn't have done at my aunties).  Because of this research I was able to tie in their school values with mine by using their language to answer the questions they asked me. I also forgot my to bring my portfolio but was able to print it out at my in laws, something that I wouldn't have been able to do at my aunties.  So because of the research I did and to be able to print out my portfolio I was confident and relaxed during the interview. I got the job :D"

This specific phobia can also include subcategories of what causes the anxiety, including a fear of vomiting in public, a fear of seeing vomit, a fear of watching the action of vomiting or fear of being nauseated.   Emetophobia is clinically considered an “elusive predicament” because limited research has been done pertaining to it.  The fear of vomiting receives little attention compared with other irrational fears.  Emetophobia is not limited by age or maturity level. There are cases of emetophobia present in childhood and adolescence, as well as adulthood.     Image i - A person with this phobia will usually be anxious and nervous whilst around sick people, wondering if they'll vomit.

Wellthatsucks,2t4hte,IWugYouWugHeSheMeWug,3,Wed Jan 21 22:30:22 2015 UTC,"My sister is emetophobic. If someone looks like they're about to vomit she will run away sometimes screaming, she's been known to break down tears and have full blown panic attacks because of it. Somehow though she's managing to cope with a 6 month old son and his abundant spit up so maybe she's getting past it."
Wellthatsucks,2t4hte,couttsphotog,2,Wed Jan 21 22:48:29 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you just manage it, when necessary. I've gotten off a bus headed home on a Saturday night and walked because, even though I was in the front a solid 30 feet away from this guy in the very back, he kinda looked like he was going to be sick and I started to get extremely anxious and claustrophobic.  But I work in a preschool as a classroom assistant, and although I've made it extremely clear to the regular teachers that I can't do vomit and if some kid upchucks I'm immediately leaving the room until it has been cleaned, there was an occasion when I quickly carried a child about to vomit over to our bathroom and it didn't faze me one bit when he started puking.  But then on the other hand, spending the 90 seconds it has taken me to write this is making me really nauseous and my heart rate and breathing have increased significantly.  I feel like at least with children, it might just be instincts taking over. Sick dude? Fuck him, get away as quickly as possible NOW NOW NOW. Sick child? Care for and comfort him."

Wellthatsucks,2s3wiy,ck_mooman,2,Tue Jan 13 17:54:28 2015 UTC,That means the wine was improperly stored. Cork is supposed to stay moist that's why wine bottles are stored horizontal not vertical like in the store. Also it looks like you either didn't screw into the cork enough or you didn't pull straight out. It sucks but now you know for future reference!
Wellthatsucks,2s3wiy,valhallaswyrdo,3,Mon Jan 12 16:08:20 2015 UTC,"Clarification: This only applies to granulated corks, if the wine bottle has a rubber stopper or reusable cork it should be stored straight up otherwise the rubber could break down and the seal would be lost."

So even a junk mail envelope will prove it in lots of situations. I believe that legally you're supposed to have a utility bill at the address to prove residency. At least in CT, a drivers license doesn't matter because a change of address is literally putting a sticker on your drivers license and writing the new address with a pen.  In CT, it costs about $2500 and takes 3 months to evict someone that can prove residency."

So far, no shit on my face but it hasn't turned into a fairy-tale romance either.  You pretty much nailed it. If the police chief wasn't a personal friend of her dad she probably wouldn't behave.  I should also add that I'm very good about turning on the voice recorder on my phone at the first sign of bullshit. EVERYONE should do this. That's basically the reason that it's worked out ok for me without getting shit on my face afterward. She knows that I will present anything to the police if it comes to that."

Wellthatsucks,2r700p,marsellus_wallace1,12,Sat Jan 3 17:58:39 2015 UTC,The Aston owner's insurance company.  Uninsured/underinsured coverage.  Well at least that's how it works in the U.S.

Wellthatsucks,2r700p,schticky_buddy,1 point,Sun Jan 4 00:13:20 2015 UTC,How does it work there?
Wellthatsucks,2r700p,jeblis,3,Sun Jan 4 01:40:36 2015 UTC,"This is what I posted as a reply to the above comment:   Over here we don't have such a thing as 'liability' - you're either covered or not. In this case, the full damage costs will be covered by the pink car's insurance, and she'll likely not have any cover for her own car. This is called 'Third Party Insurance' as it insures damage to the third party only (victim), while the other option is 'Comprehensive' which covers damage to both parties.   Also, we do still have deductibles, but we call those an 'excess' and will be payable by both parties. This is sometimes refunded for the victim (once the decision has been made) according to the type of insurance they hold."
Wellthatsucks,2r700p,schticky_buddy,3,Sun Jan 4 01:47:22 2015 UTC,"Australia is the same, third party or comprehensive with an at fault excess.  If the pink car is uninsured (likely) the Aston owner claims on his and the insurance company will sue the at fault driver.  This generally means a court order to pay off the insurance company at $20.00 for the rest of your life or until they give up trying to collect it."

It used to be unlimited, but then (I think it was in the early 90s) a compact car owned caused a traffic accident involving a tanker truck on a bridge of the Autobahn - which was damaged so badly that it had to be rebuilt.   After that, they added limits..."

Severely damaged, total burnout or flood damage with no serviceable parts, or already a stripped out shell. DVLA will require a Notification of Destruction.  Category B The vehicle may not be resold. It will have been damaged beyond economical repair, usually with major structural damage. The DVLA will require Notification of Destruction but parts can be removed and sold on.

It's the person who sets up in the end zone on a kickoff and returns the ball. There is sometimes a kick returner on the field during a long field goal attempt, but that player would literally never be the one to pick up a blocked field goal.  Even if you wanted to be as ludicrously pedantic as you're being, the guy who picks it up is not returning the kick, since he didn't catch it out of the air. Rather, he is returning a fumbled ball."

Wellthatsucks,2r380z,bretstar,3,Thu Jan 29 03:53:49 2015 UTC,"Late in a bowl game (end of the year college football big games between some of the best teams in the country), Baylor's kicker was trying to seal the game by making it necessary for Michigan State (MSU) to score twice in the next minute or so by kicking a field goal. MSU blocked/tipped his kick and it fell into the hands of one of the MSU players, who then could run the ball in the opposite direction. The kicker is generally the smallest player on the team and does not have much experience with tackling or field awareness because their job almost never necessitates it. So this little guy is trying to chase down that MSU player and gets semi-blindsided and blown up by another MSU player who is blocking (preventing the other team from tackling his teammate).  This was actually a massively pivotal moment in the game and led to my school winning this bowl game because we ended up scoring after this and winning by 1. If the kick hadn't been blocked, it's possible Baylor would have been up by 9, which would mean we would have had to score twice in about a minute, which would have been very unlikely. Still heartbreaking for the guy though because he already had missed a field goal earlier in the game, had his probable game-winning kick blocked, then got absolutely lit up by a guy who previously only played as an offensive player to lose (not really directly, but it gave MSU a chance to win at the last second after being dominated for the entirety of the game) his school's biggest game of the year on national television."

Wellthatsucks,2r380z,rag3train,8,Fri Jan 2 18:17:57 2015 UTC,A block is when you are on offense and trying to minimize the defense around the ball carrier. A tackle is when you are on defense and when you are trying to bring the ball carrier down.
Wellthatsucks,2r380z,goldenrod,-1,Fri Jan 2 19:06:44 2015 UTC,"That's not really the best explanation of a block. I could dropkick someone in the head while on offence, but I doubt that's legal. I would assume a block is something like a pick where you stand in place to block a player, but in this clip the player on offence stops in his tracks and leans with his shoulder in to hit the other player, the same way you would a body check in hockey. Basically it looks like he's tackling someone just without grabbing on with his arms."
Wellthatsucks,2r380z,CleansingFlame,2,Fri Jan 2 19:29:36 2015 UTC,"There are more restrictions on blocking than on tackling, but the main ones are that it's illegal to block below the waist or from behind. There's no equivalent of a high tackle in rugby - the helmet is supposed to provide adequate protection, so it's fine to hit your opponent in the head, but not to grab his faceguard."
Wellthatsucks,2r380z,Superb___Owl,2,Fri Jan 2 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's legal, yeah. The block/hit was done in front of the kicker and it doesn't look like the opposing player dropped his shoulder into him.   Normally hits like this wouldn't happen, but I think the kicker is not really used to plays like this and was not aware of anyone near him other than the ball carrier."

Wellthatsucks,2qtn2a,HesSoZazzy,5,Tue Dec 30 21:00:24 2014 UTC,how do you slow a gif down?

Wellthatsucks,2qtn2a,Retn4,8,Wed Dec 31 07:17:43 2014 UTC,That's how the Canadian sea kings land.

Wellthatsucks,2qv0fz,StoneInMyHand,4,Wed Dec 31 02:10:48 2014 UTC,"You and me both, pal. Amazing how fast it happend."
Wellthatsucks,2qv0fz,Tobi_Sings,2,Wed Dec 31 03:52:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but imagine how his tailbone feels."
Wellthatsucks,2qv0fz,u1tralord,4,Sun Jan 4 02:08:35 2015 UTC,"This happened to me when I was around 8 or 9. I got going as fast as I could go down a hill in my neighborhood and then accidently pulled the front break instead of the rear. I got thrown over the handlebars, and the bike ended up landing on me. I can confirm, this definitely sucks"
Wellthatsucks,2qv0fz,BowChickaWow-Wow,3,Wed Dec 31 06:47:23 2014 UTC,"Same thing happened to me. Except I was in Grade 7, and it happened right outside my school 5 mins after school let out.   Most embarrassing moment of my life."

Wellthatsucks,2qru6u,awesomeisluke,16,Tue Dec 30 03:30:32 2014 UTC,Probably water/fish.
Wellthatsucks,2qru6u,TheAlmightyFur,28,Tue Dec 30 06:00:23 2014 UTC,"Considering you can see ""Urk"" in the background - a Dutch village with only fishermen and churches, chances are 100% it's fish.  *EDIT seriously, even their flag is a fish"
