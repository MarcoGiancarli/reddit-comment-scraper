css,3dxk4i,Blueberryroid,2,Mon Jul 20 10:44:45 2015 UTC,"It has to do with css specificity and also performance.  Using * means your are applying the styling to ALL child elements indiscriminately.

Basically in 90% of the cases were * is used it is done as a ""lazy"" fix and not because it is the correct selector.   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity"
css,3dxk4i,creesch,2,Mon Jul 20 11:22:01 2015 UTC,"Well, specificity isn't an issue since the wildcard selector is the lowest ranked selector, so any other selector will override it. The issue comes with the cascading part of CSS, which you've somewhat covered in your comment."

Effectively making it impossible to style child elements below it until I figured out that someone had done the above thing.   So my point was mostly that it causes unneeded annoyances with specificity in combination with lazy fixes like the ones above."
css,3dxk4i,creesch,0,Mon Jul 20 13:04:15 2015 UTC,"/u/creesch is correct when using it as the global selector:  * { ... }   I would also avoid using it as a descendant selector  .class * { ... }   This basically forces inheritance of every css rule specified.  You'll find out quickly that there is a reason why some css rules are inherited, and others are not.  It is significantly less bad if you use it with the child selector, as there is no forced inheritance.  .class > * { ... }   This might have application in say, a div that holds some potopuri of elements, or where the type of child div is dynamically rendered and thus is subject to change.  Even then, it's really only saving you a couple bytes and keystrokes while making things harder to maintain but, in those cases I wouldn't question your sanity if you used occasionally.

css,3dxk4i,pelks_ikslop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:25:56 2015 UTC,"Back in the good old days of IE6 the wildcard selector was quite a pain point when it came to rendering speed. The consensus then was to avoid using it. However a lot has changed since and there is really no performance impact at all in modern browsers. As a hangover from those day lot of developers remain uninformed and still consider it detrimental to performance.  That said, it's quite a dangerous selector, considering it selects everything in it's path. The selector itself is fine and is not inherently bad practice to use, but that really hinges on how it's used. There's great power with this selector, and as such comes great responsibility.  For example, a common use case is resetting the box model:  * { box-sizing: border-box; }   Another is the so-called owl selector, which is a CSS2 supported way to select everything but the first element:  .element > * + * { ... }   Again it really depends on the context. It does have other legitimate uses but I'd wager that they're few and far between. As for your friend's position, I'd take his message as a word of warning, but I wouldn't subscribe to the idea that it should never be used. As long as you know what you're doing with it, it can be quite handy for those weird edge cases."

Ridiculous statement."
css,3dxk4i,dhdfdh,2,Mon Jul 20 11:47:30 2015 UTC,"Add in ""perceivable"" there and you'll get what I'm saying. Yes, it's technically slower, but compared to everything else a browser does, it's performance is clearly negligible. The CSS only has to be interpreted once, and any elements that are added to the page just go to the selector hash table and get their styles in a fraction of a second.  Essentially if you're worried about render performance, the wildcard selector is no where near where your bottleneck will be. Your drop shadows and background images have vastly more impact that the wildcard selector, and even they will operate smoothly under most conditions.  Also, I get what you're saying, but the wildcard selector is a part of the CSS spec, so it's not a hack. It's a deliberate feature of the language. You may not like to use it but as I demonstrated there are legitimate uses.  EDIT: I just remembered you were the same guy a few weeks ago spouting hate towards me and others in that Safari thread.

css,3dpvb8,TexasWithADollarsign,6,Sat Jul 18 07:50:05 2015 UTC,"In my team, and what I believe to be a good approach is media queries based on screen width at a size where page elements may break or not be ideal size etc. So using a media query with min-width or max-width but not targeting them to any particular device itself. Within that, making the site flexible (eg images at a max width of 100% of a container or other measurements in percent rather than pixels) means that between your breakpoints the site can adjust to most screen sizes and then you cover all of the phones it might be seen on.  A recommended way is ""mobile first"" , this isn't always possible but if your site is designed first for mobile (eg one column of text, blocks follow down the page), then you adapt the layout as the screen size gets bigger. So, change your browser width and at a size where you feel multiple columns would be more appropriate, you can add a min-width: 640px or something and then change your one column layout to two columns.  When mobile first isn't possible (say you're adapting an existing site for mobile), then try resizing the browser until your site breaks and looks bad (in this way ""breakpoint"" takes on another meaning haha) then you could add a media query for max-width to adjust your layout say, under 640px. Again using percentages wherever possible in your site will allow it to naturally cover all the possible sizes in between breakpoints.  Also, test on devices, or if not possible the mobile emulation in Chrome developer tools is pretty good!  TLDR: Screen width, not devices. Percentages over pixels. Mobile first if possible.  Hope this helps :)"

Inner div is still 100% of your outer div, but then you have 75px + 100 px forcing it down and out from the the blue container. You will need to adjust for any other elements if you use 100% and calc seems like the way to go. Since I'm still not sure what you want, redo it as you like with flex etc. but calculate for you existing nav and header which will push everything down and out from parents"

Then I tried copying your code wholesale into my editor and this came out. Here's a comparison of the computed properties between your example, and my project using your example CSS. As you can see, even pasting in the same code produces a different result.  The mockup I made isn't clear, but I want these blocks butting up against each other hence why there are no margins in my version. I also need to get the aside much skinnier, as it will just host a few icons.   I also want to be able to adjust height, but when I add height to the section it make the aside longer and vice versa, unless I add height to both which reverts them to their original height and puts blank space between the aside/section and the footer. Why is it doing this?  EDIT: Still working on this. Didn't realize you'd adjusted the HTML to put the aside first and the header inside the section. Also found that I can use min/max width/height to enforce the sizes, but this seems kind of clumsy; is there a better way to do it? Thanks again for your help!"

If you remove the flex:1 and flex-basis on the aside it will scale to the content.

What it does is calculate the width of the page (100%), then subtract the width of the ""content"" area from that, leaving you with just the combined width of the outside margin/sides.  Then you divide that whole thing by two using parenthesis, giving you the width of ONE side.  Then subtract the width of the ad from  that to line it up.  I also changed the top: to be 128 as that seems to line it up with the top edge of the content part.  This site is not responsive at all.

This way you can 100% width the input and the placeholder will be inside this, and everything will be neat and tidy.

Even if you delete all your CSS that will be the case.  Also remember "".rollover a"" means that any <a> that's a DESCENDANT of an element with the ""rollover"" class. So that means if you put the ""rollover"" class on the <a> itself, it will not apply.

css,3brbda,zfly9,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"I would avoid using CSS in this use case.   Besides the massive browser support issues, when using CSS animations like this, there are hardware considerations to take into account. When this CSS animation fires, it is dumped off to the GPU & the process starts another thread. This is why CSS animations are sold as ""hardware-accelerated"". Sounds like a great thing right? ""Sometimes"" is the answer.   The problem is that while load is taken off the CPU, when you fire a CSS animation, it creates a separate discreet GPU layer.   So it all comes down to use cases- this is all cool when we are talking about a a user on a robust desktop machine. But try this on a mobile-sized GPU & the device will shit the bed. It can even cause the browser to crash. True story.   I understand the whole ""it's easier to maintain"" kinda thing but ignoring performance is best left to those who photoshop for a living because that's what ends up happening when you ignore performance.  Personally, I would use something like GSAP to do JS animations. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of 10x (!!) times faster than CSS3 animations. But again that's what I would do. Feel free to use this spec if you're all about it, just think about potential impacts.   Cheers!"

H4 is rarely used, unless the page is extremely text extensive. Keep it simple, avoid mixing with classes. The main content must work fine without any attribute, like just <h2>etc</h2>. Learn to master font effects. Don't be limited to font face, size, weight, and style. Learn to master border, shadow and filling. You can get impressive effects with very few CSS3 properties. Here's an example: https://theinternetmoon.com. Depending on your font setting, H3 may be smaller than content font, which is wrong. Don't be afraid of abuse a little in font size for H1 and H2, specially if you want to use H3 and H4. Be consistent. Whatever style you use, use a similar one for H2, H3 and H4. Since H1 contains the title, it's the only allowed to be substantially different from the others."

The anchor has padding which is giving it height/width.  But it's not equal to the height of it's container.  So when your framework provides the effect or whatever, it only effects the region defined by the anchor.  I didn't really look too much into it, just scanned the CSS looking for .right classed things.  But maybe you could try setting the height of the anchor  .right li a {      padding-left: 2.0rem;      padding-right: 2.0rem;      height: 50px; /*or whatever the container height is*/ }   If the container has padding, this can also cause this problem for obvious reasons.

Then set ""position: absolute"" on the bubble. If you want to position it out of the confines of the square box you can say ""top: -20px"" for example and it will be 20px outside the top of the square box.  Position absolute (taking an element and putting it somewhere relative to another element) should be used in moderation as you're taking things out of the document flow, but it's best use can be decorative cases which is what yours sounds like, to create this appearance.

One of the legitimately good things about the current paradigm is that unlike most applications, documents can be used even in a reduced or semi-broken state. A half-loaded page, a script that failed to run, JS turned off... etc., still leaves you with something useful. However, I think that is is possible to achieve the same results even in pure applications. Applications, too, should have levels of support depending on the user's needs, connection quality, and so on. I think we will see a lot of development along those lines in the future."

Web Assembly is the lower-level language you're talking about but it's not setup to just get rid of JS. http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/the-web-is-getting-its-bytecode-webassembly/  The practical answer to disabling JS being disastrous is that is absolutely is if you're using JS to do everything without server side rendering of some kind or at least some static HTML/CSS."

css,3be7bf,BigDaveNz1,2,Sun Jun 28 11:37:49 2015 UTC,"The problem with 4K is that there is no standard density ratio. Unlike Retina / high PPI screens with a 2:1 or higher device pixel ration, 4K monitors operate in a variety of ratios, with most landing between 1:1 and 1.5:1.  Unfortunately, until OS's learn to properly account for the variety of HiDPI monitors, the web will simply be small on these monitors. As such, I don't know of a single framework out there that specifically targets these monitors. Doing so would be a huge headache for very little pay-off. Keep in mind that running s high resolution doesn't automatically mean everything is smaller... It could just mean that you're on a larger screen. Automatically adjusting everything to be larger just in case the user is on a 4K monitor wouldn't be a smart assumption to make. There needs to be a more certain measurement to key off of, which there isn't at this time.   Instead, we have to wait for Windows and OSX to offer proper first-party support for these monitors. Perhaps for HiDPI monitors, they will allow you to select pixel density rather than resolutions, similar to how OSX now lists their default resolution on a Retina display as ""best for display"" rather then the actual dimensions.   On the plus side, much of the web already supports HiDPI. Keep in mind that the Retina MacBooks are running at a 3840 resolution and the web is beautiful and crisp for these users. The difference is that the OS knows to treat this display as a 2:1 device pixel ratio, presenting web devs with the same metric to key off of as they already had with high PPI phones."

css,3be7bf,Have_you_tried_this,0,Sun Jun 28 22:59:45 2015 UTC,Doesn't the MBP just present itself as a reduced-res screen to the web though? It should be fairly trivial to add an extra breakpoint in your CSS to scale higher at a certain width. A few sites have started accounting for 1440p...
css,3be7bf,one800higgins,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:50:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's my point. 4K is great for video and graphics, but for general usage it's often impractical. Having the ability to natively switch pixel density on 4K monitors would be fantastic, just as I can do with my MBP through a third party app.   That being said, I'd be curious to see what 1440 sites you are referring to. I never use the web on my monitor at full width, but I'd be curious to try it out and see exactly what these sites are doing with all that space. Can you link some?"

I mean, responsive designs translate just fine... Apple.com's storefront is okay looking at 2560 width, but still a huge waste of space. At 3840 / 4K width, it's just retarded. I'd love to see a site that utilizes 4K resolution to it's fullest... Hell, I'd love to see one that utilizes a 1440 display resolution to it's fullest.  Side note, I hate that it's called 4K... Trying to talk about it with people leads to confusion. I even find myself getting confused in this chain as we discuss 1080, 1440, and ""4K"" -- which is actually around 1800-2200 depending on the monitor."
css,3be7bf,Have_you_tried_this,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:14:18 2015 UTC,"4K in its current form really just means 2160p. But yes, it is silly.  As to the breakpoints, my overall point is that people are starting to take note of it. It's also worth noting that on 4k and super wide monitors, its the pixel count, not the PPI that decides presentation."
css,3be7bf,one800higgins,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:54:17 2015 UTC,"I'm aware. Hence why I brought up the MBP's handling of a 4Kish display as well as discussing how filling that 4K width would be problematic for most sites. Hell, filling the 2500ish width of a 1440 display is problematic. It's too much space and impacts designs.   The OP seems to be asking about scaling to compensate... Which is what I have been discussing. What he wants is for CSS to provide the scaling, but in reality this is more likely going to be solved by OS's having native support for adjusting pixel density. It doesn't make sense for a website to handle scaling based on resolution, but rather based on resolution and pixel density, as they currently do. Since 4K displays are running a low pixel density in their native state, they will get ""small"" looking sites.  What OP wants is less about the framework's capabilities and more about the design. 3 lines of CSS can introduce support for XL resolutions in any responsive framework... But if you don't have a design plan in place for those resolutions, then it doesn't matter."

css,3b2t68,damaged_but_whole,2,Thu Jun 25 14:44:13 2015 UTC,"I usually set up two main breakpoints. One for tablets and one for mobile. Sometimes i only set up a mobile breakpoint and just have the tablet version get the mobile version (which usually works really nicely).  When I build a site, i try to make as many things as fluid as possible. Mostly everything uses max-width instead of width, and I use percentages when applicable. I still use pixel based media queries.  Usually my main breakpoints force some sort of a layout change. For example, when in a mobile view, all columns change to display: block, width: 100%;  Anything that doesn't immediately work, i try to change around in order to prevent any more media queries. If that fails, or I absolutely am having problems, i will write a few extra media queries at the specific width's i need in order to make it look good.  Here is my site as an example. http://www.justingillespie.com. I don't bother with anything other than   @media screen max/min width.    Stuff like this:  @media only screen and (max-width: 1279px) and (min-width: 768px)   always seemed more trouble than it's worth.  Hope that helps. Basically make sure your layout is as fluid as possible.. set up major breakpoints, set up minor breakpoints only if absolutely needed.  EDIT:   In regards to your Foundation question. I believe visibility classes are simple helper classes you can use to toggle elements hidden or not. What they mean by one breakpoint, is that they only have one true media queriy that changes the layout / flow of the page (which would be mobile -> desktop). The visibility classes require media queries in order to work properly, but they don't alter the page, they just toggle elements on and off for your convenience."

For images i usually just do the trick of uploading a large image at low compression rate and let the browser resize it down, looks nice on every device, allows for fluid images and keeps file size down.  I wouldn't call it a bad habit. I've been working at large agencies for 10+ years and maybe twice has anyone ever requested a tablet version specifically. By treating a tablet like mobile, you still get all the things from a UX perspective you need (large buttons, etc..), and by keeping it simple, you have less bloat in your project, which will make it easier for you (and other developers) to update.  What happens in the next few years when we get another 40+ devices with different screen sizes? Are we going to create a new media query and layout for each one? I prefer my approach of keeping everything under X a certain layout for this reason.  If your biggest issue is a grid not falling into place correctly.. I would use something like isotope js.

Saying ""IDs should not be used at all"" is pretty silly and will probably end up with even more verbose code than using IDs sparingly and wisely (since you will still need unique classnames for any given element you would otherwise use an ID to select).  IIRC  getElementById() tends to be better performance wise than getElementsByTagName() in most browsers as well.  The main thing to avoid with IDs is using them as CSS selectors in most cases (the golden rule is keep specificity of your selectors as low as you can).  Targeting IDs with JS is perfectly fine.  It is also obviously important only to use IDs for things that you know will always be a unique page element (e.g. header, footer, mobile nav, whatever).  Also you are probably having trouble with addEventListener() because you are trying to apply it on your wickFlame variable.  getElementsByTagName() returns a NodeList of relevant DOM nodes that functions sort of like an array of elements (but technically isn't).

css,3av75b,lemminman,2,Tue Jun 23 21:17:14 2015 UTC,"But in this instance I should do the opposite?   Typically the vendor prefix is used for styles that aren't recognized otherwise.

If you were using a recognized filter (ex. width), the same overwriting would take place, and the more universal style would be used (resultant from using the vendor prefixed items before the non prefixed ones, as you said). It's just an oddity from the syntax.  And actually, you shouldn't even need the filter on transition since the filter style is applying by itself:  .fp-icon-wrapper {     -webkit-filter: grayscale(1);     filter: grayscale(1);     -webkit-transition: 1s ease;     transition: 1s ease; }  .fp-icon-wrapper:hover {     -webkit-filter: grayscale(0);     filter: grayscale(0);     -webkit-transition: 1s ease;     transition: 1s ease; }"

css,3atham,dhdfdh,3,Tue Jun 23 12:30:16 2015 UTC,"This is a complicated issue. What you're asking is similar to saying something like ""Hey, what font do I use?"" What I mean is not that you shouldn't ask the question, but that it's best answered by the universally vague ""It depends""  When building a framework like bootstrap, there's a different frame of mind. You're trying to make something that's internally consistent, so you start smacking a bunch of interface pieces together and seeing what sort of vertical rhythm that they create together. In each case, their decisions are created by what looked good as part of the system.  This is why it can be so helpful to create a design document that you base your HTML off of. Even if you aren't designing each element, having a general look and feel to pursue can help you make decisions like this.  One approach you could take would be to use axiomatic css, which sets a margin on items that have siblings. The benefit of doing this with em is that the margin scales with font size - it becomes a percentage size of the text which means bigger things have more space around them (Which is good usually).  What you're looking for is a consistent vertical rhythm though. Horizontal rhythm is provided by a grid system, but web pages don't have a great way to control vertical rhythm.

This is much more baller.  2) Hopefully someone more experienced than myself can chime in, but if you are in chrome and pull up the dev tools (on mac, its cmd+option+I , i think its ctrl+shift+I on PC), there is a magnifying glass that lets you target elements on the page to see the code associated with those elements.  When i click on the section that contains these two text boxes and the button, it tells me that they in a div (essentially the container that these elements are in) with the class named ""sl-slide-inner"".  You should find the code within the homepage php page(not sure what your theme actually calls that php page, but it should be fairly obvious) in the editor (admin dashboard>appearance>editor) that has the div with that same class name.  You can comment out this code (look up how to comment in PHP if you don't know) to test it out and see if it removes what you are looking for.  This is what the line looks like highlighted within the dev inspector http://imgur.com/yfdVzEq  and when I delete that div, I get this http://imgur.com/EAk1AUV (which I think is what you are aiming for).

So, if you want this to work in things besides Gmail you'll want to declare your width in the html tag itself. As for the border use the shorthand and it should render fine.

Beyond that it sounds like your complaints amount to not understanding CSS, and I'm not sure why you think CSS should be so easy that a child can use it."
css,3at81d,trekman3,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:33:58 2015 UTC,"Well, just to clarify, it's not really Javascript that has the problems. If you mean to say that the person writing Javascript to interact with the browser has problems due to browser incompatibilities, yes, that is correct.  The difference, though, is that Javascript is a powerful, effective technology that makes simple tasks easy to accomplish. CSS (although this is starting to change with the latest versions) makes some simple tasks easy to accomplish, and others very difficult. This because of its very essence, not browser incompatibilities.  If Javascript were like CSS, you'd go online to look up how to write a for-loop, see ten different brittle and hacky ways of accomplishing it, copy-paste them until one sort of works, then still have it break some of the time. Then finally, ten years after the language was developed, they would just give you a simple for-loop."
css,3at81d,headzoo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"This isn't really true at all. In fact every programming language has ten different ways to accomplish the same thing. Using a for-loop is a bad example, because that's language syntax, and there's (mostly) only one way to write it: for ([initialize]; [comparison]; [iterate]) { [expressions...] }. CSS has syntax as well, and there's only one way to write it: [selector] { [properties...] }.  Now if you hopped on google and searched for ""how to get the dimensions of an image in javascript"" you would find ten different brittle and hacky ways of accomplishing that. If you tried to find out how to load a script dynamically you would find ten different hacks, most of which don't work very well, or only work in one browser. Hell, there's four different ways of binding a click event to an element, and four different ways of creating ""classes"" or objects.  Really, Javascript is so bad that using the language for mildly complicated tasks requires some kind of framework. Doing anything before Prototype or jQuery came along was a nightmare. I've been using Javascript for a good ten years now, and I still have to constantly google how to accomplish the most basic of tasks."
css,3at81d,trekman3,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"I think I know where you're coming from. What I meant was that Javascript the language is elegant, but the DOM has issues. I think you're coming from the standpoint of ""Well, almost all the JS I write handles DOM stuff, so to me there's no point thinking of JS and the DOM separately"". I get that. I just wanted to put in my two bits to support Javascript, the language. I agree that there have been major issues with browser incompatibilities in the DOM.  The thing is, though, CSS actually is inextricable from document design. Document design is what it was created for, and that is its only purpose. So my beef with CSS is that I think it does not do a good job of achieving its only purpose. With JS, I can say, well, there's a great language that's hooked to a weird DOM. With CSS, I can't say that.  I guess what we can both agree on is that current web technology sucks. Regarding the syntax issue: since CSS is not a programming language, I don't think that it makes senses to compare [selector] { [properties...] } to for (...). Even if there was no syntax for any sort of iteration, I could still accomplish certain things in a programming language. On the other hand, without [selector] { [properties...] }, I could accomplish nothing at all in CSS. Selector-properties is the fundamental, underlying model of CSS, not just one part of it.  So I think it would make more sense to compare the for loop syntax to the syntax of a particular CSS property, like vertical-align or width."
css,3at81d,headzoo,-2,Fri Jun 26 21:01:58 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the interpreter should abstract the differences already, that's why it's an interpreter language. This is not native code, there is not need for ANY differences."

It shouldn't surprise you that CSS written for Firefox doesn't work exactly the same in Chrome. HTML doesn't even render the same in different browsers.

When it was invented it was there to help style documents, like formatting text and creating tables etc.  CSS is hard. It takes a lot of knowledge to get things right and to understand the relation between properties. Everyone who disagrees has either forgotten how s/he started or is not working intensely with CSS. You can get your way around the ""language"" and it is improving (flex box for example) but still there is a lot to fix.   I don't know your skill level nor how much experience you have with CSS and at what scale. I recommend using a pre or post processor like Sass (http://sass-lang.com) or PostCSS to get over the browser specific prefixes and help maintain the whole thing.   What helped me a lot with CSS is accepting the fact that it is broken and learning how to work with this complex, broken standard.

It's extremely consistent.  selector { property: value; property: value }  Do you just mean you dislike the property names, or something?   How could this happen ?   I'm not convinced it has happened, but if this is a genuine question, look back through the CSSWG mailing list archives.   Why is it fragmented into multiple browser-dependant standards ?   It's not, and hasn't been for quite some time.  That said, as with any standard, there are some bugs in various implementations.   Why are even the most basic layouts impossible to do without either learning every single quirk and aspect of this language by heart or researching the specific case on the web ?   I'm not convinced this is the case.  Are you just essentially saying ""this is hard"" and using a bit of hyperbole?   Shouldn't lay-outing be so intuitive that everybody can pick it up ?   This reminds me of an old boss I had who once said of programming, ""It's just a bunch of if/thens, how hard can it be?"".   Why do I still need javascript to make many layouts actually work ?   Are your layouts changing in response to user interaction?  If so, then it's because javascript is the right tool for the job.  If not, it's either because you're wanting it to work in very old versions of browsers, or because you've been too angry at CSS to take the time to learn it.   Why is it nearly impossible to align anything to the actual view-port of the user, which should be the MOST INTEGRAL PART of a layout language ? Why is there no new standard being developed to fix this ?   <div>I'm aligned to the right side of the user's view-port.</div>  div {   position: fixed;   top: 0;   right: 0;   bottom: 0;   width: 40%;   background-color: #ccc; }"

Yeah, the difference is, CSS is NOT a programming language. You can not write any logic in it, it's purely descriptive. If it is just used to describe layouts, and for NOTHING else, why should that be as cryptic as it is. It is literally the ONLY purpose of the language.  And about your last 2 points. Have you tried making a layout where different objects fill different amounts of the vertical screenspace ? Have you tried mixing relative and absolute size descriptions ? Yeah, I'll give you a hint: It does not work without javascript calculations."

Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're doing and this is way off base, but... If you set your container element to position:relative and then your div inside of that to position:absolute, you can move the one inside the container relative to the container. For example, if the container is 100px tall and you give the div inside the container a position:absolute; top:10%... 10% of 100px is 10px so the div will be moved 10px from the top of the container.

css,3amihf,trekman3,2,Sun Jun 21 22:35:55 2015 UTC,"CSS is perhaps the most fundamentally broken, badly designed computer technology to ever gain widespread popularity.  From what I can tell, it only ever caught on because HTML had no support for any kind of layout at all before other than the tree structure and tables, and because it allowed you to abstract style out of the HTML.  That said, CSS is laughably bad, and has clearly wasted enormous amounts of people's time, productivity, and good-will over the last twenty years.  I'm not the first to say this and I won't be the last: I think that HTML/CSS will eventually be replaced by a lower-level architecture for the web.  All of the good things about the web that have made it revolutionarily popular — the hyperlink structure, the low barrier of entry, the rapid delivery of both text and media content... could exist equally well on top of a different implementation.  I think and hope that the web is moving towards the point where the web browser is simply an extremely well-sandboxed way of running arbitrary executables delivered over networks, with no inherent assumptions made about higher-level things like layout or even content-types.  Common and popular executables could be cached on the client-side so that you would not need to download them from scratch every time you wanted to use them to interpret data coming in over the network, sort of how browser plug-ins behave now.  Everything that the average browser does now will be just a plug-in running on the browser of the future. The browser of the future will be able to emulate today's browsers, if that's what you want it to do, and it will be able to do arbitrary other things besides.  If you're thinking, ""Wait, we already have that. It's called an operating system..."", you're right. The browser of the future will essentially be an effectively-sandboxed part of the operating system.  I think that pretty soon, people will build an effective implementation of such a browser and distribute it with a plug-in that allows it to faithfully emulate current browsers.  Once that is done, the dominance of HTML/CSS will begin to recede.  I think that HTML will still be respected as a fairly clean, elegant design. CSS, on the other hand, will become a historical footnote. It was better than not having anything like it at all, but it was ultimately only a stop-gap."

Plus: Go to the CSS settings in the CodePen editor and use Autoprefixer. May also help preventing prefix issues."
css,3aowl3,dnhdr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:49:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, that's very helpful.  However, I was trying to center while it is in column, does that mean I can't use justify-content in column? Is there any way to do that?"
css,3aowl3,dnhdr,2,Mon Jun 22 09:00:33 2015 UTC,"Well, you can by doing this:  .container {   background: #999;   display: flex;   flex-direction: column;   justify-content: center; }   .items {   border: 2px solid black;   background: grey;   width: 450px;   height: 100px;   align-self: center; }   Note: I removed display: flex; from the child. You only need it on the parent.  Double Note: flex-direction just means where the childs are flowing. In your case you really don't need it. Childs are already flowing from Left-To-Right (LTR). If you would swap them to column-reverse it would make sense. Also I don't really know your use for this, so just a tiny reminder. :)"
css,3aowl3,HeelToeHer0,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:32:53 2015 UTC,"Add to .container {  align-items: center;  }  If you're applying ""flex-direction: column;"" the ""justify-content: center;"" applies to the Y axis, meaning your two divs will stick together in the vertical center. To then have them centered on the X axis, ""align-items: center;"" will achieve just that.   If you remove the flex-direction the default is row, so you will get your divs side by side centered X and Y.   Edit: forgot to specify .container"

Look like those are 12.5% and 62.5% wide (respectively) and the links in the sidebar (""two wide"") are 6em. So at some point, as you size the browser down, 12.5% of the width (""two wide"") is less than 6em, so the ""two wide"" container is more narrow than the icons and the content in the ""ten wide"" column appears to go underneath the icons.  There are a number of ways you can do this layout. If the icons are a fixed width (looks like they're 6em), you could make the container for the icons (""two wide"") 6em width, float it left, and make the content container (""ten wide"") have a margin-left of 6em (or whatever).

css,3aatwf,perskes,3,Thu Jun 18 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is the inline-block display.  It is doing this because both elements (the droppable container and the image) are trying to be displayed inline while nested. The ""line"" in this case is the base of the empty block because there is no content to align inside it. As a test, put some text inside one of the empty droppable containers and you should see that container now out of position. Put text in both, and you will see that it is trying to align the text on a line (inline).  The fix is obviously to not display the content inline, but the cause is really the nesting of the inline-blocks. If you wrap your draggable img in a container with different positioning (absolute), you can continue to use inline block inside in a different context."

Namely, you can traverse laterally, but you cannot select laterally.  That being said,  if your markup is this:  < e.div1 >   < e.div2 /> < /e > < e.div3 />   then you can:  .div1{   pointer-events: none; } .div1:hover + .div3{   stuff: val; }   What is happening here is you're relying entirely on .div1:hover but .div1 ignores the mouse when it's over itself and only fires a hover event if you are hovering on one of it's children who accept pointer events (in this case, .div2).  There's no need to address the children's hover.  If this doesn't answer your question, please provide some markup and we'd be happy to help further."

There is not (and never will be) a way to select ""up"" (parents, grandparents, etc...).  Javascript (particularly jQuery) is very well equipped to perform this task.

Can you explain the design decisions that led you guys to use (the poorly supported) flexbox to behave ostensibly like bootstrap or any other grid system?"
css,39y8vu,WorseThanHipster,0,Mon Jun 15 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"Since we made a similar decision, I hope my answer will suffice.  Yes, the point of flexbox is its flexibility, but it comes at a price. If you have to create a whole bunch of different layouts with the same code, a grid, with or without flexbox, is still the way to go, unless you can code the whole layout module anew every time a new challenge comes up. Using flexbox allows for some neat tricks that aren't doable otherwise, though, for example mixing fixed and non-fixed content within the same grid.  The other part of the price is, like you said, rather poor support. Well, actually it isn't too poor, if you count out the browser bugs that are circumventable, IE<10 and Android<4.3. IE is easy, because you can either use conditional comments or simply not support it if the choice is yours. Android is a bit more difficult, but mobile browsers sans JS is virtually non-existent, and a JS detection code in less than 140bytes is no problem."
css,39y8vu,a-t-k,0,Tue Jun 16 09:25:38 2015 UTC,"Well. That's what a grid system is based on. Column count. If I choose to have 12 columns I must fill them with something or leave them incomplete. Just like you would set up your elements widths, I'm setting column amounts as my width reference. And you don't really need to set a #. If you add a class of small for example and set the row with a class of small-around it will arrange the elements inside around. For example. There are other helper classes that I still have to document but I'm only one guy with 2 days of work done so far. Feel free to help out.  For those of you that don't like the idea of having classes like small-6 medium-4 etc... You can use the SASS files and implement the sizes there.  True, flexbox is still poorly supported. I know that we currently have many issues with crossbrowsers. This project is something to have fun with. Make it evolve with flexbox until the day it will have better support and we are ready for it with an awesome tool.  For now, stick to modernizr for fallbacks."

We feature 12 or 16 columns, depending on whether an xl layout should be supported.  I'll have a more thorough look at your code later; maybe we can share some solutions.   Update: I see you haven't fixed many of the problems. Here's a small flexwrap detection script: https://gist.github.com/atk/c191d9b2e0c37d032182 - set a class to implement a fallback grid.

css,39lwzd,gempir,5,Sat Jun 13 09:07:57 2015 UTC,"Hydro CSS. I spent the last 2 years building this framework in Sass.   Hydro CSS is an extremely light and agnostic framework written in Sass. It’s aim is to not impose on the developer by providing only a small number of components and settings, while still being comprehensive enough to build even the most complex website.   The most important part of this framework is the structural modules. I spent a great deal of time making them absolutely perfect. I've built around 50 websites over the years on this framework so it's very fine tuned. I've yet to run into a situation that the framework can't handle.  Works in IE8 (minus some minor features), and uses latest browser technology like flexbox with fallbacks that work the same in older browsers.  It also splits core modules from the theme, so you have the utmost control over what you want to use. Using everything in the framework, the compiled minified CSS file is around 26kb, which is pretty small for such a big framework.  Includes some really really cool functions that I've spent a lot of time getting right - like the ability to convert between any unit, a nifty summing function that sums any number of values with various units (you can specify the output as a CSS3 calc() or convert the values to a specific unit), intelligent media query mixins and a full testing framework.  Speaking of testing, I've been a little slack on my unit tests, haha. Also, please ignore the current build error, it's just a linting error so don't freak out. I've been moving house the past few days so I haven't had time to fix it.  I'm planning on the first official release to be in the next few weeks, so please star it and give it a try! I'm really excited to finally get this thing out there :)"

There is definitely a thin line to walk when it comes to project timelines and code quality.  The only time I will consider using a framework is when I am building a large scale web application where inheriting a lot of admin interface styles is a good thing.   Most of the time, I am looking to build fairly unique websites for people and choose to not rely on a framework. Here is why:  What I have found is that when I used to use frameworks, I grew out of touch with my code. After I took a break from frameworks, I found myself learning a hell of a lot more and writing much better code.  Most frameworks require entirely too much markup because their task is to solve everyone’s potential use cases. It is quite admirable, but they require tons of source code and class markup in order to make it work. I need to override so many styles that building from scratch would have taken less time, or my HTML has more classes than tags.  Then there’s all the unused code. For example, my grid often has a single breakpoint, container has three, and I don’t need column offsets. This hardly requires any CSS. Here is the Scss to generate it (compiles to <100 lines of expanded CSS):  // number of columns $col-count: 12; // total gutter between cols $col-gutter: 30px; // actual col horizontal padding (15px) $col-space: $col-gutter / 2; // is on either side of a column  // is minimum between container and edge of page  // small breakpoint (min-width) and container width $sm-bp: 768px; $sm-cont: 750px; // medium breakpoint (min-width) and container width $md-bp: 992px; $md-cont: 970px; // large breakpoint (min-width) and container width $lg-bp: 1200px; $lg-cont: 1170px;  // base container .container {   // horizontal padding   padding-right: $col-space; padding-left: $col-space;   // horizontal centering   margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; } // tablet portrait @media screen and (min-width: $sm-bp) {   .container { width: $sm-cont; }   // initiate grid system here   [class*=""col-""] {      float: left; position: relative;      // reorder with pull right     &.pull { float: right; }   }   // calculate: .col-1 { width: 8.333333333% } through .col-12 { width: 100% }   @for $i from 1 through $col-count {      $d: 1 / $col-count * $i;     .col-#{$i} { width: $d * 100%; }    } } // tablet horizontal, small computer @media screen and (min-width: $md-bp){      .container { width: $md-cont; }   } // bigger computer @media screen and (min-width: $lg-bp) {    .container { width: $lg-cont; }  }  // all rows .row {    // negative column spacing   margin-right: -$col-space; margin-left: -$col-space;   // clearfix   &::after { content: "" ""; clear: both; display: table; } } // all cols [class*=""col-""] {   // border box for padding inward   box-sizing: border-box;   // taking up space if empty   min-height: 1px;   // column horizontal spacing   padding-right: $col-space; padding-left: $col-space; }   Then there’s interactivity. Animations are better handled these days by JS toggling a class which triggers a CSS transition, or for more complex things, a custom Javascript solution or plugin. It is always better to research how to go about creating something rather than how to use something. That way you stay on top of your game and aren’t relying on some dude to update his repo. It also doesn’t hurt that all your code is in the same place.  Hope this helps!"

Problem is different things like web crawlers and e-readers and brail web-browsers for the blind use various attributes to perform different tasks so you have to be safe in what you choose.  Data attributes like data-something don't get used, and have special significance in javascript and jQuery, so I tend to store everything I want to be in an attribute, under data-someattribute type names."

If you don't want things to scroll over or under it remove the bottom and left properties so its not anchored to the bottom of the browser. Those make it stay at the bottom of the browser and not scroll with the page. You also probably don't need it to have an absolute position as long as it is at the bottom of your body in your html.

Those stated, I am fascinated by the discussion here and want to learn more so...  I use js to manipulate css pretty often in my little projects. I'm using it less now after learning animation using @keyframes, but I still use js to manipulate style pretty regularly.  I created a little virtual aquarium with a fish that swims around with onclick and ondblclick events. The events trigger style changes in the fish's relative position, giving the effect of him swimming around. And I use Math.random() to throw in unpredictable motion and speeds... I don't know how this would be accomplished without using js to manipulate css.  Also... and this seems to be the big one... maybe I'm missing something... User input affecting style. Contrived example, but let's say a user wants to define the height, width, background color, and border radius of a div element. How would this be possible without using js to manipulate css?   I can think of a few other examples of where using just html and css (even with @keyframes and pseudo selectors) just won't give the functional range that css + jss can deliver.   Last thing, I do admit/realize that I don't know much about performance hits with respect to using js to manipulate css. There are likely issues to consider there."

Bizarre.  Anyway, if you wouldn't mind, two follow-up questions (I'm still learning, forgive me if these are really basic): 1. display:block has to be declared in the .bottBord class (even though it's applied to a div which is by default block) because the div inherits display:inline-block from the css further up, right? 2. What effect does the content:"""" thing create? What does the empty string of content do?  It's code that I've been working on with someone else, that's why I don't quite understand all of it.

Pseudo elements are imaginary element like a <span> tag, and can be inserted before (with :before) or after (with :after). In order to create these elements, you specify the content property whose value is the inner text of the element. In this case, content:"""" means it's an empty element.  Pseudo elements are inline by default so you need to specify display:block; if you want it to behave like a block.  Edit: here is some more information"

css,3972xq,ForScale,0,Tue Jun 9 20:54:25 2015 UTC,"Sort of. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic. The key here being scalable. With an SVG you won't have to worry about the pixelation that that bitmap images have on scale. However, you have to have a way to get it on your website. One of the most common ways is to include it as an icon in a font then call that icon as a class to the <i> element. The element doesn't REALLY matter, though, as the icons become a .css class that can be called on element.   From this you can define the font-size property to scale the icon without losing quality. You can do any sort of css manipulation to the icon as well, including animations.  Alternatively, you could simply add the .svg image to and <img> element and style a class on the <img> and have full css control.  In both instances, however, you can't really change its background or individual elements within the .svg unless you do some tricky styling and have overlaying .svg images / icons. In the case of the font, however, you could define a color element on the class and change the overall display color of the svg. As for the background, I guess you could have a containing element around the .svg and color that accordingly. That's not much different than stacking .svg's onto one another, though. Another thing to note is both instances require the client to download additional files.  Hope this helps. And here's a couple of resources:  Icomoon font creation tool / library  Most popular icon font  A more complex use of svgs and jquery animation"

css,397lg1,hola-senor-throwaway,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"It is the position: absolute;.  Absolute and relative are very similar to one another, both allow you to position the element relative to the nearest 'positioned' parent element (any elements with a position:; value other than the default, which is position: static), which we'll call the 'containing element' from here on out.  But with a few differences:   Absolute, the div is taken out of the flow entirely.  Every other sibling will render as if that elements was not there. Relative positioned elements take up the same space, both in position and size, as if they were always there, regardless of how you position them afterwards.   .   Absolute positioned elements default to top:0; left:0; within the containing element.  Relative elements default to a top:; & left:; value that they would have had given their current position in the containing element.   All this means that just giving it position:absolute; will immediately change the position of the element, and has the potential to change the containing element size (if it was being 'held up' by the element in the first place).  And just giving an element position:relative; will not change anything about the element or it's parents itself.  Not until you start defining top, left, bottom, right attributes.  *What's happening with your pen:  The containing div is rendering as if the <img> tags were not there at all, that is to say, it has a height and width of 0;  You might want to give them position relative, but I don't think that's necessary.  I think what you want is osmehting like this.  What I've done is:   replaced position: absolute; with display: block;  Because <img> tags are by default display: inline;, which means they'll sit next to each other and only take up as much space as they need.  Making them block makes them sit under one another. wrapped the subtitles in a div, not necessary but makes it much more managble.  Made this div text-align: center;.   Finally, I gave every element margin: 0 auto; which makes the top and bottom margin's 0 (can be whatever)  and the left and right margins are auto calculated, which means they will both try to take up as much space as possible, which centers them.  I also shrunk them so it's easier to see what's going on."

css,392rnj,phnglui_mglwnafh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:17:12 2015 UTC,"As a general rule of thumb:  1) check width, padding, margin, and border rules.  2) check displayrule. Is this element inline? Then don't expect it to respect a width. Is it table-cell? Setting a width might have unexpected results.  3) Check box-sizing. You'll want to know whether padding and border are included in the width or not.  4) Check whether the element has min-width or max-width. Those may cause your width rule to be ignored."

css,38y955,blimkat,4,Sun Jun 7 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"This is probably not the best way to achieve whatever you're trying to do. Background is just that - the background of the element. The background will not impact the size of the element the background is applied to. The reason the background is cut off without an explicit height (250) is because the element doesn't care about the background when it comes to the element's size - the element only cares about the content in the element, or the size that you specify the element to be. When you don't specify a height of the element, it will be as high as the content in it (the ""home"" text you have in there currently - remove the content from <header> and the height will be 0), or as high as you specify with a height (250, as you did).  You could make this work in a hacky way by making this change to your <header> CSS:    /* height: 250px; */   height: 0;   padding-top: 26%;   26% is the aspect ratio of the image (300/1152 = .26).   But then you're probably going to run in to issues if you start adding content inside of <header> unless everything in it is absolutely positioned or something. And of course, if you resize that image, you'll need to make sure you resize to the same aspect ratio or adjust the padding to match the new aspect ratio.  Hope that helps.  *edit: here's a pen"

You want to set the margin on both sides of the thing to ""auto"" that way it automatically adjusts into the center (horizontally).  margin: 0 auto;   http://jsfiddle.net/v812j04d/  3.) Seems like you started from a template and tweaked it into what you have.  But I can tell you put a lot of effort so far into designing the site, so why not just learn HTML and CSS from a teaching resource.  W3schools is fine or some other website that offers free simple lessons would work for teaching the basics.  It only takes a few days to cover all the basics of HTML and CSS if you're in a hurry, or you could just leisurely read it and do the examples and finish it in a week or two.  It will allow you do just ""do"" exactly what you want, and not be limited by code on the internet for these sorts of minor design questions."

Think I've just held myself back because this will pretty much be only site I make within foreseeable future. But yup, as the days go on I'm starting to realize I should just take the time out to get a better grasp of how it all works. A lot has changed since my last web sites were built during the geocities days!    Every time I implement new effects I'll usually find myself unsure about one minor problem that stumps me, but proves to be nothing more than a minuscule tweak in the end.

If you have a CSS preprocessor, you can easily create a loop for 100+ colors.  If the color change should be relative to whatever user wrote the comment, you should use a data attribute to select the user-name/id data-user=""..."" and then use the [data-user=""...""] selector in CSS (which also works for IE7+)."

They all lack simplicity, multiple degrees of freedom and a way to provide backwards compatibility. This raises the question why should it be so difficult? The answer may frustrate you: because in this case, multiple parties involved in the standardization process are pulling in different directions. Everyone is interested to get this as close to its own formats. Microsoft's formats are a mess, Adobe's no much better and don't ask me about Apple, because while they are good with usability, interoperability is rather low on their list unless it would be a reason not to buy their overpriced products. Google seems to be waiting where everyone else is heading.  You are right: we need to think outside the box.

Every time you define a z-index for an element, you create a new z-index context within that element. More on this in a bit.  so if you have this:  <a/> <b>   <c/> </b>   and we assume the z-index of them to be a=2 b=1 c=3 Then a will appear above b and all of b's children, regardless of the children's z-index.  If instead we assum z-indices to be a=2 b=2 c=3, because a and b are within the same z-index context (either from a parent or the document) and have the same z-index they will default to normal behavior with respect to each other, that is, b will be on top of a because it appears later in the DOM (DOM's are rendered top down).  The problem is that by giving b a z-index you create a new context where everything inside of b only cares about the z-index of other elements within b's context  To get around this, remove the z-index property from b altogether.  Your z-indices will be a=2 c=3, notice b is out of the equation.  Now a and c share the same z-index context and will be free to battle each other for the top as you would expect."

css,383a0i,robpenn002,15,Mon Jun 1 16:16:04 2015 UTC,"Sure.   For starters, here's some light reading on CSS specificity.  The gist here is that ID selectors in CSS are top shit. If you have something like:  <div id=""red"" class=""big blue box""></div>   and your classes look like...   #red { background: red } .big { height: 400px; width: 400px; } .blue { background: blue } .box { border: 1px solid black; }   That box is going to have a red background. This is because an ID selector is considered much more ""specific"" than a class/attr/element selector. ID's are proper names for elements, in the sense that I am ""Chris"", so I would be <div id=""Chris"" class=""web-developer person""></div>  No one else can be me, but everyone else can be a web developer and a person. :)   In CSS, #Chris { ... } would override any rules inside .web-developer { ... } or .person { ... }, but using [id=Chris] { ... } would actually put those rules on the same specificity level as the classes, so whichever came last would take precedence.  Magic.  Hope that made sense. Feel free to ask questions..."
css,383a0i,robpenn002,7,Mon Jun 1 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"I admit that is a cool little trick to know. Still, while ID's have purpose, styling is not one of them."
css,383a0i,itty53,4,Mon Jun 1 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.   I work in a codebase that is ~6 years old and has probably had 30 or 40 people touch it... there's a lot of stuff I can't just go change without blowing everything up.  This is just a trick that makes managing that legacy junk a little easier :) There are selectors that I have seen that look like #page #content p or whatever, and it's almost impossible to set any rules anywhere else on the site on the paragraph with junk like that going on..."
css,383a0i,itty53,2,Mon Jun 1 18:20:02 2015 UTC,"Ha, yeah that does sound quite painful. Definitely a great band-aid solution until the codebase can be refactored."
css,383a0i,robpenn002,5,Mon Jun 1 18:25:05 2015 UTC,styling is not one of them.   There's a time and place to use IDs to style. It's just not as often or necessary as many people use them.   But the fact that many people use them wrong doesn't mean they shouldn't be used at all.
css,383a0i,codewow,2,Mon Jun 1 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"Someone downvoted you, so I'm upvoting to get you back to even. . .   Can you give an example of when styles scoped to ID's are favorable?"
css,383a0i,i_dunno_what_im_doin,5,Mon Jun 1 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"This article is what started the whole 'Don't use ID selectors in CSS' following. Before that article, you wouldn't have gotten downvoted for suggesting 'there's a time and place'. Read it: Go to the section titled 'On the other hand..'  In that article, the author mentions at the end that yes, there are reasons where you might consider doing it. He cites reasons in this article, as well as a crucially important one: Speed. Using #id { ... } is faster than .class1 .class2 .class3 { ... }. Now you won't be able to use that often but like I said: there's a time and a place, and it's not 'never'. I'm not arguing it's more useful than classes, that's absurd: I'm just arguing that 'never' is wrong.   Further: if the W3C didn't want you to use IDs in your CSS, they would write them out of the specs."
css,383a0i,i_dunno_what_im_doin,2,Mon Jun 1 20:44:22 2015 UTC,Fair enough. If you can style an ID while still following DRY and avoid issues with maintainability I would consider that an acceptable practice. My personal stance is still to avoid doing so to prevent potential future headaches.

That's the gist of it, right? Heh, I guess I'm too inexperienced for this trick to make a lot of sense, but good to learn regardless!  If you have the time, could you come up with a contrived example of when/what situation you would want to use this trick?"
css,383a0i,a-t-k,2,Tue Jun 2 16:43:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Attribute selectors are the same level as a .class =)   So a decent example would be what I'm dealing with now... let's say I'm working on a corporate website that is ~5 years old (pre HTML5) -- when it was created, it might have looked like this:   <body>   <div id=""header""></div>   <div id=""content""></div>   <div id=""footer""></div> </body>   ... while a modern HTML5 compliant version might look like this:  <body>   <header></header>   <main></main>   <footer></footer> </body>   Now, on a site with ~800 pages and a corporate governance per page around the changing of even a bit of text. . . the wheels turn slow. We can't just update our entire site, because the testing effort would last for months. Our code base would be frozen and nothing would get done for months, but people would get paid. It's not a favorable path for executives, updating an entire corporate website in one fell swoop.  So, in the meantime (a couple of years, likely) we end up with something like this:  <body>   <header id=""header""></header>   <main id=""content""></main>   <footer id=""footer""></footer> </body>   -- Now, where all of our new css is much less specific than the legacy stuff, the legacy stuff still exists in our codebase. That means most low-specificity rules are just overwritten by super specific scary stuff from the early years.   So we began to scope our less-than-specific styles to those ID's, making them more specific. They started overriding stand-alone component (accordion, modal, etc) styles -- no good.   I solved it by scoping the new styles to [id=content] and the like and now all of our components (that don't use ID's, of course) work fine in the flow of the document and override whatever they need to :)   Not a very contrived example, but an example nonetheless."

There probably will never be one because it kind of breaks the whole 'cascade' aspect of css.  I would just apply the .hover to the parent div whenever it's children are hovered and replace li.hovered ~ li.default with ul.hovered > li.default.  Optionally, since we're already using jQuery you could just apply a class to .default programmatically using the .siblings() selector: $(this).siblings("".default"").addClass(""sib-hovered"") or something similar."

As far as I know, any cascade nature is inherently downward through the hierarchy, which would preclude parent selectors, but there aren't any (other) core concepts that imply a document-flow hierarchy among equal siblings.   I'm not saying you're practically wrong-- from what I see as well, it's a non-starter, but I don't really see an ""all siblings"" or ""previous siblings"" selector necessarily being counter-cascadey.  I suppose the one problem it'd have would be more practical, in that parsers might have to backtrack to include hierarchically-equal but nonetheless already-processed elements if they encountered an ""any sibling"" selector, whereas a ""subsequent selector"" would allow reliable one-directional processing of a document from top to bottom."

css,37w99b,enociz,1 point,Sun May 31 10:12:04 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Style sheets are, for all intents and purposes, concatenated in the order in which they appear, although <link>s will always be treated as if they come before <style>s, and inlines (<div style="" rule: val;"">) will always be treated as if they are last regardless of what order they actually appear in the html.  With that in mind, whenever a .selector{ rule: val; } is read it overwrites whatever value was living at .selector:rule before it.  Some browsers (Chrome I know for sure) even allow you to dynamically create <style> tags like any other element, and stick them wherever, basically overriding what came before it.  Although, I wouldn't because I don't think this behavior is well defined and at the very least causes all of the css on the page to be re-processed and the page to be re-drawn.  *Add:  For my current project, we have several view components that get re-used in many of the page's, but at different locations depending on the page/user.  Basically nav bar is a view, pagination is a view, our user filtering system is very complex, it's a view, etc... I've managed this, for now, by putting a style tag at the top of every component's view page.  It makes it easy to find and edit the style for each component.  Eventually, I'll have LESS compile them together for production, but for now, it renders just fine and makes things pretty manageable."

I would leave it alone, yes its not optimal but it works.  If you want to replace it I would recommend CommonMark which is working towards becoming the markdown standard for the web. It would take very little work to convert rich text to markdown. There are examples all over the web of converters. I dont know what your backend is but I was able to find rich text to markdown code chunks for .NET, PHP, PYTHON, and javascript in a simple google search.   Besides it's what reddit uses so it must be good :P"

Bad  .wrapper-widget .widget-one .widget-one-header h1.widget-header  Good  .widget h1   But aren't you supposed to rarely, if ever, apply styles to nodes directly? Except for the base styles for nodes of course that would be extended upon later.  For instance, shouldn't the ""good"" example have been:  h1.widget-header   Because browsers parse through CSS from right to left, so if it was   .widget h1   the browser would first have to look through all instances of h1 on a page and then look for instances of .widget.

Measure first, as Ilya Grigorik says.1  Back to your ""real"" question: what is the best alternative to .widget h1 selector?  I'd say the best selector would be:  .widget__header   because:    it prevents any specificity issues (it's single-class selector, you can easily override any declarations inside of it's rule with another rule with single-class selector) it doesn't lock you into a specific markup structure (now you can have h2 or even a regular div as a header instead) once you spend 15 minutes understanding BEM syntax it's clear where this thing belongs (it's a header of the widget) it probably has the same, if not better, performance as h1.widget-header selector   If you are interested in writing maintainable CSS, I'd advise reading Philip Walton's Side Effects in CSS to get a an intuition into what makes a CSS piece modular and reusable.       1  Website Performance Optimization  — Lesson 1 - The Critical Rendering Path, ""Which styles render faster?"""
css,37atp3,Cust0dian,1 point,Tue May 26 21:42:40 2015 UTC,"Good question, I think the answer depends on your approach. First off you are right. The reason I've gone this path is because I'm considering the .widget as a component and everything contained within it will be inherited back to the original .widget class. So it kind of contains the styles within the scope of that component.   The approach of one h1 for all widgets is also valid if that fits your design. I had assumed in my case that it didn't.

css,37d7f4,maelfyn,9,Tue May 26 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"extremely fast compilation times (in my example case, ~800% faster)   Since the comparison is made against Sass, I'll use that as an example. Ditch the Ruby implementation for libsass, a C port of Sass, and you'll get the around the same speed increase. This is becoming more popular with frameworks as it allows them to remove the dependency of Ruby.   source code written in CSS, as defined by current and upcoming specs   I admit this is nice, but you have to be fooling yourself if you think that upcoming specs aren't going to change. Which just leaves you with the same issue that the author has with pre-processors - non-standard syntax. Except this is probably worse since it's a syntax based on a deprecated spec! Whereas Sass has a well defined syntax and is popular enough to not have to worry about portability and future-proofing.   no vendor-specific syntax (unless we write our own — be careful!)   Wait, and PostCSS solves that how? You're still not writing real CSS. You may be basing it on possible future implementations but as I said above this is always subject to change. Look at how many different versions of flexbox we got!   source code that is immediately comprehensible to anyone with a half-decent understanding of CSS   You kidding me? Tell me, what's more comprehensible:  :root {     --mainColor: #ffbbaaff; } @custom-media    --mobile (width <= 640px); @custom-selector --heading h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6;  .post-article --heading {     color: color( var(--mainColor) blackness(+20%) ); } @media (--mobile) {     .post-article --heading {         margin-top: 0;     } }   or  $main-color: #ffbbaa; $media-mobile: '(max-width: 640px)';  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { @extend %heading !optional; }  .post-article %heading {     color: darken($main-color, 20%);      @media #{$media-mobile} {         margin-top: 0;     } }   Not much difference, but I personally think Sass just looks that little bit nicer.   source code that is future-proof, portable, and easier to diagnose and debug   Future-proof? Likely not.  Portable? Hardly, because you still need to run it through a post processor, and since you're writing your code based on plugins for PostCSS, looks like you'll still be needing PostCSS. Also, on that point, so what if you require a certain processor to compile your CSS? I've been using Sass for years and I have never once run into a portability issue, because I've never needed to port it since Sass is available on every platform.  Easier to diagnose and debug? Says who? Sass has wonderful error reporting and works very nicely with Chrome dev tools. If you run into weird issues, it's because of shitty third-party code. PostCSS is designed to be used with a lot of third-party code, hence the focus on plugins. Unfortunately, you're going to have the same issues.  That said, PostCSS is a great tool and I hope to begin using it soon. But the points made in this article are not the reason why. It frustrates me when people turn two technologies into a good vs. evil debate, when they both have a lot of great things to offer. How about instead of trying to demonise a perfectly good tool with flimsy points, make a fair comparison against the two?"

And while my ""it's a poor workman who blames his tools"" rant isn't a pun like it was the last time this came up, it's still true.  Yes, you can use psychopathic messes of FOR loops in your SASS code and end up with insane selector chains. So don't do that. Mixins and variables are still fantastic tools for the work I do, no matter how much you think I'll get confused with what prefix they need. Spoiler: you can Google the answer.  And their solution is ""scrap SASS/LESS, and use PostCSS""? Quite aside from the irony of replacing your proprietary pre-processor with a proprietary pre-processor with Groucho Marx glasses, does anyone else see ""parsed by JS plugins"" and ""uses non-spec CSS"" and start feeling itchy?"
css,37d7f4,Chyld,1 point,Wed May 27 09:11:38 2015 UTC,Well it depends on the scope really. SASS and LESS really shine on large scale projects where as postprocessing CSS looks to be beneficial to everyone. Can't compare apples to oranges but I think his point was in relation to to the fact precompiling is often most beneficial for handling vendor prefixes conveniently and post eliminates it?
css,37d7f4,Synfrag,1 point,Wed May 27 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, pre-processors are a tool that can be used well or misused. If you're mindful of what the output of your compiled CSS will be they can be a great way to save time and especially helpful in situations with robust theming/multiple color schemes. At worst it can bloat the CSS and some people tend to over nest their sass/less files which can make them harder to maintain.  It's important to learn how to use your tools well, and use them until even better tools are available."

css,36sdvq,ProdigySorcerer,2,Fri May 22 06:18:35 2015 UTC,They're both syntaxes for the sass css pre-compiler.  So files that end in .sass use the original syntax think python-like with no parentheses and with significant white-space.  People then wanted a more familiar syntax when they use the sass goodness so .scss files  were introduced where white space is no longer significant and parentheses are back.  Personally I favour the scss syntax because I hate significant white space and because you can very easily convert css files to .scss simply by changing their file type (obviously this wouldn work with .sass) and after this rudimentary conversion is done you can then when you have the time use sass's real power.

With a preprocessor though, I find it much easier to break the css down into multiple partial files and then just use the mixin for inline media queries.    But it all comes down to what you're looking for?  How huge is your stylesheet?  Doing this on a 10k line stylesheet (unminified) will significantly increase your filesize.  My stylesheets run about 3k lines (TOPS, with all the framework stuff, unminified and pre-""uncss'd"") and I don't see a noticeable size increase.  I've spent a little bit of time trying to find out if there's a way to defer writing the media query css into a breakpoint until all of it has been preprocessed for filesize, but I haven't exactly found a way to do that.

I currently like blue and orange. http://codepen.io/ForScale/pen/RPreZW I also think black and green look good together. Yellow and purple is interesting. Can't go wrong with black and white!  Look at other sites or go to an art museum for inspiration. Maybe watch a movie or show and just pay really close attention to the colors they use.   I like to take both a top-down and bottom-up approach to it. Top-down, just look at the whole thing and get a feel for how it makes you... feel. How it plays with your eyes. Bottom-up, look at each of the individual pieces and see how they kind of relate and play with one another.  Here's a clock meter I made that I chose some weird blue green black gray white and pinkish colors on (nothing fancy): http://codepen.io/ForScale/pen/vOGraE  Blues blacks and whites here: http://codepen.io/ForScale/pen/OVMBGj  Just experiment, get feedback, and don't try to put too many rules on your creativity!"
css,3645s3,dsharps,0,Fri May 15 23:56:45 2015 UTC,"Finding a color palette is usually pretty easy, there are a number of online tools for creating and browsing palettes, like the ones posted elsewhere in these comments. Using them correctly is generally a little harder, but will come with practice.  While browsing around the web, take note of how colors are used on the page. Look for places where really similar colors are used, maybe a shade darker here, a shade lighter there. Look for the colors used for emphasis, to show that something is important. Well designed websites set rules for how they use their colors, and sometimes a specific color will always mean something (""this is clickable"" or ""save"").  Usually a color palette will have a main color, an accent color, then a variety of shades of a background color, and maybe a couple extra shades of the main color. The important point is to use your options here to have sharp contrast when you need to prioritize something, and use subtle shades to keep your visual hierarchy going quietly in other places.   Google published their design guidelines for their new style, Material Design, and they're very very good. Here's a link to the section about color. They're going with a very bright, modern selection of colors, but ignore that for now. Look at how they talk about the colors, and how they suggest you use them.  http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#"

css,3624s6,biscuitcrumbs,3,Fri May 15 14:10:14 2015 UTC,If you don't control the CSS files you may be able to temporarily add your own overrides at the bottom of the page you do control.  This is of course spiraling down into a very messy situation but if you keep things well documented and get access to your CSS you can basically do whatever you need.

css,35xycg,hazybluez,-1,Thu May 14 14:11:05 2015 UTC,"well i know most of the css, i just have specific questions like, well what thr display: inline-block , i thought display can either be set as inline or block , or am lost on this, . and for the code for the form, would margin:auto mean just no margin, or the default margin ? . the ""."" AND THE ""#""  differentiates between a class selector and an id selector right . am more stuck on figuring out pricisely which element .box2 , and the form element apply to , ..... i presume the code creates a box model , with .box2 style attributes,,  there would also be  a form with , relative positioning to the rest of the browser page. with respective width and height of set pixels, and a solid red border. a button would also appear which is pink by default , and purple when hovered over. would i be somewhat right, am sorry have a few prog exams and want to make sure am at least answering these sample questions right"
css,35xycg,hazybluez,2,Thu May 14 15:41:42 2015 UTC,"The display property actually has quite a few values that you can choose from, see here, it also gives an explanation of how each value will behave.     For future reference, the developer.mozilla site is way better than w3schools.     margin: auto would be the same as setting all the margins (top, right, bottom, left) to auto. Using auto on the left+right margins is a popular way to center things in their container as it works out the margins for you.     Yep, you're bang on with the ID and Class selector.     .box2 would apply to any/all elements (there can be more than 1 element) with class=""box2"".     When there is no ""."" or ""#"" in the selector then it will target the element with that name, so form {} would target <form>, img {} would target <img /> etc. If you had form.myClass {} it would target the form elements but only if it had the myClass as well class, so <form class=""myClass"">.     Regarding the hover. Hover is a state, and so if you wanted to target the hover state you would use something:hover {}, the key part there being a colon."
css,35xycg,Meto5000,2,Thu May 14 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"A super complete, extremely verbose, and hopefully helpful answer:  A)   .box2 - the following styles be applied to elements with the class ""box2"" display:inline-block - the element will flow within the context of the parent (like inline elements) but you will be able to assign vertical padding/margins as well as define a height width: 200px - the element will be 200px high height:100px - the element will be 100px high (note: if this element was display:inline the height property would have no affect) margin: 1em - an em is equal to the current font-size of the element as inherited or defined. The default value for this is 16px. Setting margin:1em is equivalent to margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em, which is shortcut for margin-top:1em, margin-bottom:1em, margin-left: 1em, margin-right: 1em. This adds 1em's worth of spacing to all 4 sides of the element. background-colour: blue - this does nothing because background-colour is not the correct syntax for background-color. If background-color: blue was instead used, it would turn the background color of the element blue color:yellow - all text inside  the element and its children  will be colored yellow unless overwritten by another style border-style: solid - this makes the border style of the element a solid line vs other options (dotted, dashed, etc) border-colour: red - colour is again mispelled (sorry brits) and will do nothing. Border-color:red, however, will make the elements border color red. Note: border-style and border-color will have no effect if A) the element does not have a default border or B) a border-width: is defined. However, if a border-width WAS defined OR the element has a default border-width then the element would have red solid border around it and then 1em of spacing after the border between other elements [margin][border][element][border][margin]   B)   form - all form elements will have the following styles applied margin: auto - is a weird style. margin-top/bottom: auto compute as zero so what this essentially says is margin:0 auto or margin-top:0, margin-bottom:0, margin-left:auto, margin-right:auto. Using margin left /right: auto centers an element horizontally relative to its parent as long as a width is defined (which it is lower in the style declaration) position:relative - the element is similar to position:static in that the element is laid out in its current position in the document flow however there are a few differences. A relatively positioned element can have styles like top/bottom/left/right applied to the element is pushed one way or another. Also, an element that had position absolute would be positioned relative to the first position:absolute OR position: relative div in its ancestry. width:550px - the element has a width of 550px height: 450px - the element has a height of 450px color: navy - all text inside  the element and its children  will be colored navy unless overwritten by another style padding:10px - there will be  10px spacing in each direction around the element border:1px solid red - short for border-width:1px, border-style:solid, border-color:red , eg., a 1px wide solid red border around the element Note:  the padding is inside the element and the border will be added after the padding [border][padding][element][padding][border]   C)    input.button.hover - all input elements that have both the ""button"" AND ""hover"" class will have the following styles. Note: .hover and :hover mean different things. If instead the element declaration was: input.button:hover it would mean all inputs with a class of ""button"" and the element (or one of its descendants) is being hovered over. background: pink - by using the shortcut background instead of background-color you are effectively removing any inherited properties for background (background-image, background-size, background-position, etc) and setting them to null except for the property you defined (background-color: pink). So this element has a background color of pink and all other background properties set to default values. color: purple - all text inside  the element and its children  will be colored purple unless overwritten by another style   D)   #menuPane - all elements with the ID of ""menuPane"". Note: your document should only have a single element with a specific ID, however, if there are multiple ""#menuPane""s in your document, this style declaration will affect all of them. position:absolute - this element will have it's  positioned defined relative to its first ancestor with either the position:absolute or position:relative property set. The default positioning has some variation from browser to browser left:25px - the element will begin 25px from the left of the first ancestor with position:absolute/relative top:25px - the element will begin 25px from the top of the first ancestor with position:absolute/relative width: 25% - the element will have a width equal to 25% of the first ancestor with position:absolute/relative"

Again, boring, but I'd just write your CSS in the same manner as the framework for consistency and readability. If you wanted to do the mixin/include idea for CSS-available grids, it wouldn't hurt your payload too much and may be worth the leaner markup. If you have some junior devs, having the classes/styles match with Bootstrap's documentation would be fantastic."

By default text containers can’t expand their width arbitrarily because they’re limited by the edge of the viewport. I’m curious as to how you would solve this problem. Obviously the page would still need to be useable without any CSS as this fundamental to the web platform; browsers will never implement a rendering change that breaks that default experience.  One potential solution would be for developers to opt certain elements into different text wrapping behavior. This exists today with the CSS property white-space. Setting 'nowrap' or 'pre' causes the layout engine not wrap the text when it usually would, for example when the container has run out of space, which also has the effect of causing the container itself to expand arbitrarily beyond the viewport.  Modified version of your example: http://jsbin.com/ketanemehi/2/edit?html,css,output  (Hope you don’t mind if I cleaned up your code a bit. You were setting html, body, and div to have the initial values for max-width and width. And you were setting each of those initial values 3 times…)"

css,35k0nd,citizenzaqx,2,Thu May 14 16:40:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I missed that part.  I don't think we need another CSS property. It would probably be sufficient to amend the specification to state that the root element has a default max-width of 100% (so that it cannot expand beyond the initial C.B., which is the viewport). This could be done for the :root pseudo-element, which is very recent (and essentially never used) and has higher specificity than html.

Compare 'inline-block' to 'block'.   The hope would be to set the height and have it adjust the width to the minimum required to fit the content.   That’s exactly what it’s doing. The container’s width is the minimum required to fit the content but there’s no constraints on the text so it pushes against the container making it wider and wider until the container hits the edge and imposes a constraint or the text runs out. You could reason that a browser could impose a reasonable minimum text measure but I doubt it’ll ever happen because just using CSS to set a min-width on the container does everything you need.

Keep in mind that background-size: cover does not work in IE8 and under. So have a fallback, or look for a polyfill for it.

Or you may as well use tables for your layout, font tags, b tags, etc.  The point of css is to keep your content separated from your presentation. Having a proper separation of concerns will allow for your presentation to be easily changed later on.  For example, if I use your w490 class and come back later and need to change the width of something to 600 I have to 1.) figure out which file(s) that class is in, 2.) change that class name in all the files and 3.) manually refresh the page(s) to see the changes (or god forbid someone changes your class to .w490 { width: 600px } )  Now let's say you have a class on all of the things you would have put w490 on called ""content"". Now I can just inspect that element and it will tell me which css file the style is in and I can change it in one place and be done.  From there you can use a bookrmarklet to refresh the css on the page without refreshing the page itself. If you're using emmet livestyle you don't even need to refresh the page to see your changes. Hell, nowadays you can even use chrome to make the changes without even going to your editor. None of those things you can do if you're keeping your css tightly coupled to your html.  Trust me when I say that w490-like classes are one of the worst mistakes you could make using css."

Before I learned about outline I had to use all kinds of tricks for that, since the userscript is supposed to be run on any theme where you don't know whether there's a border around image to change its color or there's none by design. Outline was a very nice solution, because it allows you to draw an ""inner"" border by setting its offset property to negative value, thus avoiding having to change image dimensions by a border.  Outline-color: invert made sure that regardless of background or existing border around the image it will always be noticeable (in fact it even inverts the pixels of image the outline covers).  As for code, I dunno, I'm just applying the style via jQuery like   img.css('outline','3px solid invert').css('outline-offset','-3px');   Here color gets set to 'invert'. If I set it to 'black', for example, it works like this. Setting it to 'invert', however, makes outline invisible in Chrome without raising an error."

If you want to create your own Nav-bar styles you can simply comment out the Nav-bar import... you could even rename the existing Bootstrap Nav classes to something the you prefer.... You really do have a huge amount of flexibility.   Personally, I like to include a CSS framework in with my sass files, maybe font awesome and some animations/transitions, I generally leave these untouched, but hey, I'm lazy and really can't be fucked with the hard yards, I'll use the styles that Bootstrap has created just to make my page responsive, from there I create my own scss files give each ""section"" of the page a class name that explains what it's for (I.E <div class=""blog-article"">) and nest all my styles under that one class using regular old tags...

I'd be interested in what you come up with... I'm actually somewhat tempted to go and change up bootstrap myself.  <div class=""chuck-in-a-nav-cuz the-normal-nav-bro make-the-nav-stick-to-the-top-bro"">  watch this space............  I know I'm harping on, so bear with me... I just want to mention frameworks like Angular (well just Angular as far as I care about), where you can create your own element tags: IE (another poor example):  heres: my shitty angular app:  <myapp>     <dumb-thing-one></dumb-thing-one>     <thing-that-moves-when-clicked></thing-that-moves-when-clicked>     <pictures-of-puppies></pictures-of-puppies>     <blah></blah> </myapp>      Think of how easy this will be to style in scss:  myapp{      dumb-thing-one{       h1{          } // end h1       button{       } //end button      } //end dumb-thing-one  } // end myapp         and so on and so forth..........   Aaaaaaaaaaaaaanyway, moral of the story is: either fuck with the framework: make it your own -or- just compile everyone elses hard work in to what looks like your own stylesheet and add your custom sass on the end -or- break some shit and develop your own little system with working with scss... The power is yours! Go Planet!"

As wefwef said the zoom:1 rule is a hack for older IE browsers. you can always change the zoom:1 rule to a WebKit transform filter if you wish.   I will be updating the file this evening as I didn't realise it still had 2140px in the media query. This was only there for testing and I forgot to change it back.

Your selector doesn't even have the content property.  It's just doing padding, margin, etc.  I'm just curious what that is doing specifically.  Thanks."
css,351vz2,armornick,1 point,Wed May 6 16:46:22 2015 UTC,Sorry i didn't read the article myself as i was traveling home from work and didn't have time to reply with a full answer so gave you the link.  Its basically part of the CSS * reset which is clearing all the default margins and paddings for every object. You could also include border: 0; but i think its a bit pointless really.  Some might argue thats is bad practice as it causes a longer render load time but this will only be of any effect if it was on a big site and have many other rules added to the style sheet.  Also i have included the content property on line 5 for people if they wish to set any rules for both the grid and rows.  Thanks Josh

css,354lma,PROJECT_XIII,2,Thu May 7 01:38:12 2015 UTC,"First I plan out how I want the website to look. Either through a mockup, some kind of sketch, or just a general idea in my head. I use this overview to plan the most semantic way to mark up the elements. Whether this or that should be a header or a div, where to put the nav, basic stuff like that. Once the basic elements are set up, I'll do the css for general layout stuffs, then move on to more cosmetic styles like colours, images, and smaller tweaks. NOTE: This is how I used to do websites. I'll be honest, I've pretty much exclusively adapted webflow as of late. However that doesn't mean I recommend not writing CSS. An intimate relationship with CSS is paramount to being efficient with tools like webflow. As a beginner, you should definitely be testing in multiple browsers throughout your development. It will not only help you avoid mistakes that will be harder and more complicated to fix later, but it will also help you learn to avoid these discrepancies between browsers in the future. When you know how different browsers interpret your code, you'll have an easier time speaking their language. I don't know of any resources that document the differences between browsers rendering engines. Honestly it's nowhere near as bad as it was even 5 years ago. Firstly, use a css normalizer thingy, which will get you most of the way towards a consistent presentation. Don't just plug it in and forget it though. I recommend grabbing HTML5 Boilerplate and picking apart the CSS they have there. There's plenty of great documentation that helps you understand exactly what everything is doing. Second: experimentation is the best way to learn how your code will behave. A healthy dose of curiosity will go a long way. Learn on the job.  CSS Tricks is a pretty cool site to follow. Aside from that, just start making websites and experimenting with things. Google more blogs or developers and bookmark the ones you find interesting. Frequent them. Read as much as you can, but mostly just make websites. The more you code, the better you'll be. Never say you don't have ideas for projects. Just find a website that looks cool and copy it. There's no wrong way to learn. Except maybe w3schools.com. One-page sites are no harder to code than anything else. The html file will obviously be longer because, hey, more content, but it's all just markup. On second thought, I take back what I said earlier. Give webflow a try after all. Do the free trial they have. Take a look at their templates, and make some sites for yourself. Then download them and pick apart how they work. This might be the simplest way to make / experiment with different layout types. I'm thinking that may be a great learning tool.  Just try to be as semantic as possible. Ask yourself what this code reads like without the context of CSS. Every div, nav, header, etc., and classes should accurately and succinctly describe what it contains. Just remember to keep appearance out of your class names. Never call your classes ""red-text"" or ""borderless-thing"". HTML5 Doctor is an excellent resource if you have ANY questions about what elements you should use where. Amazing site that helped me learn a lot."

css,34zpwt,wefewfewfewsfgvdsfds,1 point,Wed May 6 13:25:56 2015 UTC,"That example with fixed position is kinda pointless, since overflowing content is cut off. The general technique is probably just to floatto the left next to each other. This used to cause some compounding rounding errors in older browsers, so that sometimes the last float wouldn't fit into the container and wrap. To avoid this you can also use container relative floats but they are a bit weird to use. Float with negative margin is often used for seo-purpose, so that the content order doesn't necessary have to follow the order in the dom. The downside of negative margins is probably that you have to remember the impact on them on floats (in direction of the float vs opposite directions), normal elements, tables etc."

A lot of your logic could be encapsulated in mixins such as @include standard-height();, making it much easier to extend to other elements.  (or even better, height($standard);) Similarly, extract those long lists of selectors (particularly standard width and standard height) into a variable users can override.  Then you can @each over it and apply the styles.   It's considerably smaller than Foundation's form module, but at the cost of quite a bit of flexibility.  A couple dozen more lines of code could narrow that gap :)"

css,34nnug,wefwefwefewfewfew,1 point,Sun May 3 13:45:13 2015 UTC,"It looks really nice, but I'd personally prefer a more mixin-heavy approach.  It seems like you're encouraging semantic HTML, which is great, but at the same time are encouraging classes like button-large-round-full-width-disabled-brand-3 in the docs.  The *= matching allows flexible class chaining like that, but isn't it screaming to be a mixin with size, brand, corners, and enabled/disabled parameters?  For that example, I'd rather see:  <a href=""#"" class=""submit-button""></a>  .submit-button {     @include button($size: $button-large, $brand: $brand-3, $full-width: true, $corners: $button-round, $disabled: true);     @extend .full-width; }   Currently, to keep things semantic I'd have to do:  .submit-button {     @extend .button-large, .button-round, full-width, button-disabled, button-brand3     // a lot of overrides }   It's possible I'm misunderstanding though--I'm far from a sass master."
css,34nnug,Liam_Annis,1 point,Sun May 3 04:12:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're misunderstanding anything, sounds like you have it spot on! Really great feedback, thanks.   I agree that using classes such as ""button-large-round-full-width-disabled-brand-3"" is a bit ridiculous, but the point of One Nexus is to build your own styles into the framework. In the buttons SCSS partial (https://github.com/esr360/One-Nexus/blob/One-Nexus-v2.0/assets/styles/scss/elements/_buttons.scss), under the ""Styles"" section, I would maybe encourage the creation of a new style called ""submit"" and do something like this (actually similar to your second code snippet, but there's no overrides):  &[class*=""-submit""] {     @extend [class*=""-large""];      @extend [class*=""-brand-3""];      @extend [class*=""-block""];      @extend [class*=""-round""];      @extend [class*=""-border""];     @extend [class*=""-disabled""]; }       You can then use the ""button-submit"" class. Creating a mixin would tie the default styles to the mixin and vice versa, so removing/adding styles would become complex, and I'm not sure how I'd feel about using a mixin with so many parameters every time. My experience with mixins isn't great though, so I could be missing something. The reason I like this approach, is because it's very DRY - it doesn't repeat all the different styles for the different types of buttons, it only uses the styles needed, so your CSS output is smaller. Another reason I like this approach, is because it allows you to create elements with just the ""button"" class on its own, and also you can do ""button-large"" instead of ""button button-large"" (or ""btn btn-large"").  Would love to hear your thoughts on this approach."

You're overriding the style you declared, since the ""p"" element is still within the ""color-blue"" class.  Now, if you're wanting the results you expect, try using ""color-blue>p"" and ""color-red>p"". This will call the direct ""p"" element after the color-n class you've assigned."

Switch the order in the stylesheet and observe the effects.  The right answer is to embrace inheritance and avoid specificity. By default, most elements will inherit their color from the parent block. If not, you're likely not using a reset stylesheet, and you should.  I know that you understand that removing the P will make this work, but why would you not want to do that? It's the best method (low specificity)?

Like this.  https://jsfiddle.net/beg0m33d/4/  The blue one is the correct behaviour I'm looking for, I'm trying to make the red one work.  Basically, I work for an organization that has multiple departments, each with their own colour scheme. Some of the departments have the right to use the colour schemes for other departments. A good example might be the HR website. They have a colour scheme where all the expandable headers are green (the default ones are blue in our theme). But when they post the org charts for specific departments, they want the expandable headers to be done in the colour for that department (say it's ""Sales"" which is a red).   I want to give them configuration options to choose the colour scheme for specific blocks of content on the site that will change the colour of certain elements within that block to match the scheme definition (we have to do a bunch of accessibility work, changing link colours, switching out black icons for white icons, and other things so just changing the colour of the element itself isn't good enough - we need a class that changes a few different things at once).   This all works fine with just one layer. My problem is with nesting them. I was hoping to control the colour scheme for the whole site through a class on <body> and then override it in specific sections (and then perhaps override it further in those sections, but less worried about that). I was under the impression that the cascading rules, when two rules conflicted, might go with the closer parent tag in the hierarchy, but I think that is crazy me thinking. Was therefore wondering if there was something else I could do to make this kind of thing work or if there was another recommended approach to recolouring icons in a nested fashion.  EDIT: I should also mention that our CMS is a pain-in-the-ass, which prevents me from punching down into the ""element--overlay"" to apply the class directly, or this would be easy :)."

Compiling Bootstrap with the things you don't want taken out is the hard way and is brittle (re-compile every time you want to add something). This way you just write your page, and any unused rules get removed."

That said, what you say should happen (different image sizes depending on browser size) does work; however, looking at the CSS it looks like you're attempting to have the CSS override the smaller image (the one defined in the img tag's src attribute) so that a larger version of the image is used when the image is displayed at a larger size. For me, this did not happen and instead the smaller 256px-wide image is simply being scaled up to 768px resulting in a blurry image.   That said, I also tried it in Chrome 42.0.2311.135 and it appeared to work as expected."

Edit// forgot to mention but Css positioning lesson on w3schools was super useful.

css,33t0f4,albus_z,2,Sat Apr 25 14:51:05 2015 UTC,I don't think border widths can be in percentages. Try it with px or em instead and I think it should work.
css,33t0f4,wallace_wells,1 point,Sat Apr 25 09:45:14 2015 UTC,That worked but I just finished a CSS course on lynda.com where I was taught that you can and should do borders in percentages to make good flexible designs because what if I want as an easy example make the h1 width 100% but if I do for example border 0.3em then the border on right side will be displayed outside the body.   edit: I figured it out.. I can't do % for top and bottom border only.. so I need to set all the border sides individually.. em for top and bot and % for the sides :) edit 2: actuallyI didn't figure it out.. I just wrote that before I tried it lol.. didn't work.  edit: you know what... doing it with pixels should be fine I guess ;P

css,33qlql,one800higgins,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:58:46 2015 UTC,"Divs are block elements, images are inline. Unless you manually set these to not be their native types, there's no reason why they would be side by side."
css,33qlql,one800higgins,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:47:19 2015 UTC,THanks for a quick answer :) I do want them to be side by side that's why I set the div to be an inline-block because if it's just a block then it will have it's own row.   But the thing is that the height of the img is bigger than the div so I want the div to be positioned next to the img like it already is but I also want it to be positioned centered so that the empty space between the div and the img and the div and edge of the header element willbe equal because now the empty space is much larger from the top to the div than it is from the bottom to the div and same with the from right side is more empty space than the space on the left side between the div and the img.

css,33jm5d,theglassman32,2,Thu Apr 23 01:20:08 2015 UTC,"The problem is that when you put the padding, it makes the width of the element wider, so now it doesn't fit where you want it to fit, and jumps down (as a float should).  2 options.  1.) Make the container wider by an amount equal to your padding times 2 (for both sides)  2.) Use box-sizing: border-box;    This makes the padding, border and margin and all that COUNT towards the size of the element.    As an example:  These two .child divs fit inside the container, because there is no border, padding, or margin  Now, I will give one a 10px padding and see what happens.  You can see that the 10px padding adds 20px to the objects size, AND since it no longer fits inside the 100px width container div, it jumps down below.  So now, I have 3 options.  The first is to just reduce the size of that child div by 20 px (10px for each side) so it fits.  Like this  The next option is to just make the container 20px bigger to accomodate the width of the larger child div, like this  Finally, I can apply box-sizing: border-box to the div to make margin/padding/border all count towards the size  (This makes it behave like you probably assumed it would anyway).  Like this (In fact, I applied it to ALL divs in this example, because you probably want them all to act the same way.  Sometimes people use the universal selector to assign this property to every element, and other times it's included in a ""CSS reset"".  You can look both of these ways up.)"

Then move over to margins and padding. Then to positioning (which is the hardest part in my opinion).  CSS has its own set of ""rules"" that you will learn eventually. There are many tutorials on specific problems in CSS, and also make sure that you check W3Schools constantly (that's what I used at least) as a reference. Also CSSTricks is an amazing website that you should check out.  Also, try using CSS Reset in your code (it will return all the values to their defaults) and it will make your life a bit easier.   Learning web design / development is a hard thing, but don't give up.   If you hit a wall take a break, reexamine the situation, try different solution, check the web for similar problems, read the documentation. If you fail, repeat the process, and don't give up.  Sometimes you'll have to do some research, check tutorials, forums, experiment until you find a solution, that's the hard part of being a self-thought web designer / developer. On the bright side, internet is full with tutorials and communities, so in most cases you'll find what you need."

Tables are an HTML element and shouldn't be used for none-tabular information for semantic reasons.   Display: table-cell; is CSS, so can, and should be used when table properties are required for an element which isn't actually a table.  By the same reasoning, adding ""display: bock;"" to a table also doesn't affect the HTML semantics."

css,33788d,ellenbrook,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the ""centered"" child can easily overflow the parent both to the top and the bottom. This is of course easily fixed with media queries, but it can still be a bitch when dealing with dynamic content and all the different screen-sizes we have become used to by now.  The issue comes because of the calculation of the trick. Essentially you are positioning the child to begin at the vertical halfline of the parent, and then moving it up half it's own height. Since the child is position:absolute it will not expand the parent and therefore it can easily overflow the parent, both to the top and bottom at the same time."

css,32sba1,theywouldnotstand,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:28:21 2015 UTC,"Zoom changes several css properties at once for the page and border size is likely one of them.  I'm guessing that the codecademy code checks the properties of the element, and doesn't actually parse your code for this particular thing, thus, it saw a border that was thicker (or thinner?) than 1px. Since you're supposed to create a 1px thick border, it saw this as being incorrect, despite your code being fine.  If a bug report for that particular section/lesson doesn't already exist, then you might consider creating one in their Q&A Forum (bottom left of the lesson interface)"

css,32nmgr,ManicComputer,2,Wed Apr 15 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"This is actually a pretty easy fix for your situation. Since you define the height of the element, just add the following to your .right figcaption:  line-height: 300px;   Line-height specifies the height of the line. Aka, you set your font-size to the size of the font, and line-height to the size of the line...think elementary school where you had a specific top and bottom line to fit your letters into.   Typically this is used similarly to using ""line spacing"" in Word.  Hope this helps!  *EDIT: For clarity, I'm assuming you don't need the ""<br>(this should be vertically centered)"" in your code and that was just for instructional purposes.

In this case, !important is probably easier, but this other option isn't a bad thing to remember just in case.

The scroll problem is also because of the fixed header.  It's trying to scroll so the correct part is at the top of the window.  You are using some sort of js/jquery script to smooth scroll, you just need to add another 80px onto that script to offset the result after scrolling.  Or, an easier way to make it functional-ish.

css,31qa0o,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:06:47 2015 UTC,"Data URI scheme:       The data URI scheme is a URI scheme (Uniform Resource Identifier scheme) that provides a way to include data in-line in web pages as if they were external resources. It is a form of file literal or here document. This technique allows normally separate elements such as images and style sheets to be fetched in a single HTTP request rather than multiple HTTP requests, which can be more efficient.  Data URIs tends to be simpler than other inclusion methods, such as MIME with cid or mid URIs. Data URIs are sometimes called Uniform Resource Locators, although they do not actually locate anything remote. The data URI scheme is defined in RFC 2397 of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  In browsers that fully support Data URIs for ""navigation"", JavaScript-generated content can be provided as file ""download"" to the user, simply by setting window.location.href to a Data URI. One example is the conversion of HTML tables to downloadable CSV using a Data URI like this: 'data:text/csv;charset=UTF-8,' + encodeURIComponent(csv), where ""csv"" has been generated by JavaScript.

If I only include the files mentioned above, I can use them in the template and it would only need to be downloaded once, would be cached and then used on each subsequent page. Is that right?  Also when I was reading about sprites it seemed they just combine all the separate images into one image. Couldn't I just simple combine my images into one file into photoshop and do it that way?

css,31p7ya,tylerr82,2,Tue Apr 7 01:53:59 2015 UTC,"1) The simplest solution is to set a height on the <li>s.  The problem is that some of the <li>s are taller than others (the ones with the heading with two lines).  The unequal heights prevents some elements from ""sliding"" into the position you would expect them to be in.  2) To fix this you can use this:  .archive.et_right_sidebar.woocommerce ul.products li.first {   margin-left: 60px!important; }  To be honest the CSS on this is pretty ugly and it is hard to tell exactly what is going on.  So many !important and duplicate styles, many of which are way over complicated.  There are much more simple and effective ways of doing this."

It looks like you are trying to get all the elements on the left side with 60px margin left.  The first element gets its margin from this:  .post-type-archive.post-type-archive-product ul.products li.product:nth-child(3n+1) {   margin-left: 60px !important; }  The the problem is that this will add the 60px margin left to every 3rd element, not every 4th.  To do that you need (4n +1), but that ends up breaking up other elements.  You also have a .first on all the elements on the left side, I was assuming that was to set their margin left but no styles were written for it. Also the last elements on a line have .last added to them.  I think some things might not have been setup correctly at first then other styles were added to try to correct for it.  Now that we are trying to fix the original styles the added styles are causing problems.  At this point the easiest thing would be to just add 30px margin on all 4 sides of each <li> and use .first to add 60px margin left and .last to add 60px margin right."

Trying to do something and then realising you don't know how to is the best way to improve your knowledge.  You don't need to add any interactivity or dynamic features ( yet! ) but take a simple design and make it into a working webpage will really fill you with confidence.  I actually think you'll learn better by looking at other peoples designs, seeing what looks good and building them rather than trying to learn how to be a designer first.  To get you started head on over to somewhere like dribbble ( or even just google ) and search for web page PSD.  Net Tuts has some start to finish free tutorials with PSD's available so grab one from there and try to build it.  If even that seems daunting just try and make a small part of one - sidebar, nav, header for example."

css,31fp67,codewow,2,Tue Apr 7 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"There's knowing how to use a style sheet, and then there is learning design. CSS isn't difficult in itself so much as time consuming- things like Sass exist so you don't have to waste time considering which border radius your button should have. There are many options available for those who just need a front-end that looks acceptable.  Arguably, you already have the requisite tools and knowledge to create an aesthetically pleasing website. Recreating a website is a good idea, although honestly, it's a bit intimidating for a beginner. If you have something in mind that you would like to create, I encourage you to do so. However, I wouldn't even think about typing anything until you've sketched out the layout first. I recommend reading about design principles, UX/UI stuff, etc. Check out /r/web_design or other design websites.   I think there is certainly value in ensuring you understand the strengths and limitations of HTML/CSS. It's very satisfying having something 'tangible' that you can show to others, and if it weren't important, we wouldn't need front-end specialists. However, the problem is you won't ever be able to say ""Okay, I've mastered web design!"", meaning it's hard to know when to progress.   Once you're confident in being able to manipulate style as you see fit (e.g. you want the navigation on the left, so you know you have to float nav left), I definitely recommend exploring JavaScript- infinitely useful, and satisfying to learn/use in an entirely different way.  Your design ability is much harder to keep track of, so I encourage you to look back on past projects regularly (even if it's just looking at the ugly codeacademy exercises)."

A class is an attribute that you want to apply to more than one thing. Now let's say that you have 5 buttons and they all need to look the same way. You want to be able to use your CSS that you created for the button on all of them at the same time, right? This is where you'd use a class because it can be shared between elements.

It's nice to have a widget with all of the internals relatively sized with em units, such that you only have to adjust the font-size of the widget container element in order to resize the whole thing.

However, setting it to 100% respects their ability to view the page as they need to."
css,317ayl,kuriusOne,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"But I think that by defining font-size for every thing you will run into situations where, if you changed your font size to 90% or 110% for example, your nested elements will have their font sizes going all over the damn place.   That's because ""100%"" is special-- it's ""no size increase or decrease from the container"". The rule is not meant to impose any size on elements, it's meant to prevent the browser from imposing a size.  That said, you'd primarily be getting into cascading problems because you're setting that ""110%"" on normal container elements. You're safer with proportional increases on elements like headers, because it's highly unlikely you'll be nesting them, and it quickly gains a consistent relative-size scale no matter the surrounding elements' size changes."

At 100%, it's perfectly effective at what it does. IMHO, I do find reset CSSs a bit counterproductive and annoying in their breadth of clobbering everything-- I prefer a ""Normalize"" CSS that sets elements to sane but explicit values.  As far as 1em vs 100%, I don't think there's a difference, as both mean ""100% of the enclosing scope's text size"", at least in regards to font-size.  The JSFiddle example is just overly broad, in that it's putting percentages on things that would naturally be nested within each other. That said, you'd probably want to style all your h-somethings with different percent values anyway, and if you're just trying to make the whole page have bigger text, that'd be one rule on the body."
css,317ayl,Fli-c,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:18:29 2015 UTC,"font-size: 100%; in your CSS reset is a workaround for the ""quirks mode"", when font size is not inherited in some cases; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode#Mode_differences_and_examples  First of all - you are not supposed to touch anything in CSS reset file, especially hacks and workarounds. If you need to change font size of some element - do it as usual in your CSS, ignoring the reset. If you change it to 90% or 110% for one element then nested elements will inherit this value as a base size, just like how it works without the reset in standards mode.  And if it's your site and you know that quirks mode is not used there, then maybe all you need for the font size reset is this (normalize) and this (html5bp)."

css,3178jl,tinfrog,3,Thu Apr 2 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"Two things could be causing problems.    1 - Ordering of the elements is important, as they specify the parent child relationship of the DOM elements.  CSS identifies parent child relationships from left to right.  So start your identifier with the highest level parent element that may be relevant (more on that in a minute)  In the case above the only proper order for the elements is as follows   div div div h1 a {color:#FF0000;}   If you're using class selectors this is the only possible order     .container .navbar-header .navbar-brand h1 a{ color:#FF0000}   See how the DOM order is preserved in the selector?  That's important.  Now, on to CSS specificity.  2 - You need to realise that certain types of selectors carry different weighting when they are evaluated.  Since there isn't supposed to be duplication of ID's on DOM elements they get the most weight. Classes are next, and individual elements come last.    What does this mean?  It means that although this seems really specific:  .container .navbar-header .navbar-brand h1 a{ color:#FF0000}    It will actually lose to something much less specific due to the weighting of selectors. The following is actually more powerful than the above.  #site-title a{color:#0000FF;}   See what I mean about using the highest level parent element that may be relevant? If the above is already specified you're going to have a hard time overwriting it using a different selector.    To understand specificity more thoroughly, read the following. http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/27/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/  One more thing, inline styling will trump everything.  If you duplicate a selector in css the second iteration of the selector will be the one used.   Hope that helps :)"

css,312mes,dangoodspeed,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"Well, you can do pretty much anything in terms of layout with just HTML5 and CSS. Interactivity of the site past using :hover and the like is where you need the other stuff (e.g. if you want a toolbar that becomes position: fixed; after the user has scrolled down then AFAIK you need JS). That is to say, knowing how to use the tool isn't your issue.  I think what you just said    I'm just interested in seeing designs/layouts   is the more precise question.  I recommend looking at some graphic design books, namely those on grids and layout. Everything in layout comes down to grids. Here is a starting place. The book I used for starting HTML/CSS also has a chapter on layout, as well as various end-of-chapter sections where the author discusses how the skill learned (e.g. CSS with tables/lists) can be applied to layout and making a site come together.  As a fellow learner building a first-time website and server, I can say from recent experience that only learning the basics of HTML/CSS was necessary. From there, the layout/grid design book I linked has been very helpful. Unfortunately, it isn't explicit in its lessons so it won't feel very helpful when you're reading it (if anything you'll feel, ""why am I reading this again?"") but after reading it and then going about my business, viewing sites and writing some CSS for a subreddit, I found that I started using what I'd gleaned from the book to adjust my own work and look at other sites with a critical eye. Guess it comes down to, keep in mind that layout books (and a lot of graphic design books, as I've come to find) are heavy on showing, rather than telling (which what I'm personally used to from a science background). It leaves it up to you as the reader to decide if you like what you're seeing, or if you think they're full of shit.  So yeah, look up some books on the subject, see some of the Amazon reviews to see if the readers got what you hope to get out of the book, find the ebook/pdf somewhere (then ideally buy it if you use it), decide what you like, and then look up the HTML/CSS on the way.   TL;DR: You're better off reading up on design and layout, which usually have lots of layout examples (even more than websites, so you know how/why a certain layout is used) because it's easy to Google ""how to do X with HTML5/CSS"" along the way."

css,3122hs,ChiperSoft,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:30:35 2015 UTC,"Well, it's just that they are two entirely different things. Bootstrap is a continually updated and massively distributed css framework.  This post is just describing Zumba's best practices for organizing their own large scale css codebase, bootstrap could even be included within this. They are going over their build process, linting, SASS guidelines, etc. Has nothing to do with reinventing bootstrap."
css,3122hs,fuckstick,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:13:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think you understood MY point. I wasn't suggesting that they're trying to promote something new.  The structure that they've created is 90% identical to bootstrap's (looks like they left out the grid system and heavy responsive bits). The file separation is the same, the mixins and class structure is the same, even the variable naming is the same.  The system that they've constructed is essentially Bootstrap SCSS, just done their way.  Their linting is pretty close to csshint's defaults.  There's nothing wrong with that, it's just not all that interesting when compared to, for example, Medium's style guide, which is extremely informative and loaded with tons of awesome protips.  Zumba's methods are so typical that I don't see why they felt it worth publicly documenting.  I thought they were gonna describe something pretty cool when they got into the whole sandwich analogy, but then it didn't go anywhere."

css,2zuoqh,fredrivett,2,Sun Mar 22 12:35:20 2015 UTC,To say you should always use a grid system is like saying you should always use base64 for favicons or icon fonts rather than sprites. Such decisions are never that simple and should be based on the requirements of the use case rather than acting as if one is always preferable.  It's the same reason WYSIWYG site builders are years away from being comparable to a real coder: there are too many decisions to be made and too many factors for each decision to be automated.

There's always situations where the layout you're looking for doesn't fit into the grid, but I'd have thought most websites have a base grid and then have sections that diverge from that. I certainly don't claim to be a CSS guru, only speaking of what's been useful to me & thought this little mixin might be useful to someone."

The only thing I don’t use is the grid system. Your design (and content) should dictate the breakpoints. I also like to use one useful class-name for each section. It really grinds my gears when I see things like class=""features-col col-sm-12 col-md-3 col-lg-2"". I would never employ a developer who thinks this is good practise."

Instead, certain elements are designated as having no end tag, for example <br>. These are collectively called void elements. The slash is just syntactic sugar for people who are addicted to XML.

Self-closing tags are indeed specified in the HTML5 spec as optional for void elements, and required for foreign elements. I opt for consistency wherever it is available (such as between void and foreign elements), and thus I always include the self-closing slash. The way I see it, omission of the closer that is otherwise required for other elements, is optional for void elements.  Some people are of the XML train of thought that it's confusing to have open-ended tags laying around, where only your memorization of the void element list can save you. There's no harm in keeping your HTML5 syntactically compatible with XML, and more understandable to people who haven't memorized the void element list (for those folks, a start tag without an end tag looks like an error).  What if somebody needed to update your code by Friday, and they haven't memorized the entire void element list, but they were snowed into their winter cabin all week, and their internet connection has gone down? They'd have no way of knowing that you don't need to close <meta> tags like we do external <script src=""s.js""></script> tags, and they'd be liable to actually create bugs in an attempt to fix them!

I can't find a source for it anywhere. I can't imagine then embedding a 40kb CSS file change the speed much, then you can do away with that second server request. And given the nature of TCP slow start, a second round trip (which seems to be happening anyway) would have a much higher window.  Someone please tell me why I'm wrong."

I inlined this critical style into the page and my results (in terms of load times) were:  Before:  421ms  (average over 20 test)  After:  314ms (average over 20 test)  That's pretty good I think.  1/10th of a second is decent enough.  But the trade off was annoying CSS shoved into the HTML.    I then inlined an absolute minimum framework for above the fold content, which lacked minor details like non-branding colors, shadows, borders, header/title fonts, psuedo elements. blah blah.  Basically anything I could shave off to make the site appear visually similar.  This however did not change my times basically at all.

Also if you use background images remember these will not print (show as blank).  Print styles can be the bane on many developers lives. ultimately people that are printing these want the content not the structure. So focus on the main body content and get that to print. Think about items that are pointless printing (promo pods etc) and you may find you needing to hide the 'dynamic' elements which dont print nice and under @media print{ //show jpg image of cool timeline && hide the real one}  not sure if this helps..

css,2z6rff,BenjaminPoulain,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"""Pseudo-selectors"" is a bit confusing. These are pseudo-classes (the other kind is pseudo-elements, with vasty different properties). You can have as many pseudo classes as you want (for example, this is completely fine: ""div:lang(en):read-only:not(:empty):not(:last-child)"").  With CSS3, you can only have a single simple selector inside :not() (e.g.: :not(div), :not(.navitem), :not(:first-child), etc). Obviously you can have multiple :not() on a single element. With the next version of CSS Selectors, :not() becomes a lot more powerful. If you have a Mac, you can already try that with WebKit Nightly.  Regarding repaint, selectors are only related indirectly to painting. Selectors affect style->style recalculation happens when DOM properties change->some types of style recalculation cause reflow and/or repaint. That's really an implementation details, you should not think about that, just use the best selector for the job."

The truth is it still changes a lot, any documentation would get outdated very quickly. Over the last year alone, both WebKit and Blink have dramatically changed how selectors affect style recalculation.  If you have specific questions, I can try to answer them. I know that part of WebKit pretty well and I am familiar with the equivalent feature from Blink and Gecko."

I have no problem keeping up-to-date with the how part; I just need to start somewhere.   I'm hoping this simple example might work for an explanation...  Let's assume I have only one style on my site, and there aren't other factors that would require a reflow. If I have ten <p> tags on my site, and I add the style :  p:not(:last-of-type) { color: red; }   Will the browser paint once? Or maybe twice (once for all <p> and once more for the first 8 <p>)? Or maybe 9 times (once for all <p>, then 8 more times for the first 8 <p>)?   I'm about to start this course by Google: https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884.

css,2z6rff,BenjaminPoulain,2,Mon Mar 16 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"Again: selectors have nothing to do with painting.  The selector will be evaluated on every <p> element of your document.

Maybe it would be easier if you explain how you think things work?"
css,2z6rff,BenjaminPoulain,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:32:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I am (obviously) confused about painting and reflows, and how they affect one another. So after your last reply, I went back to some of the ""old"" articles I found, like stubbornella's reflow post.     From reading, it sounds like painting only occurs when changes are made to an element's skin that changes visibility (e.g., outline and background color), but do NOT affect its layout. Reflows occur when changes are made to the layout, and there are a ton of things that affect the layout in CSS alone.     So I'm thinking... The initial reflow lays out the entire page, like this. Basically, a reflow takes the first pass through my css and renders it all on the page (this is what you were talking about when you mentioned my <p> elements will be ""evaluated."" I think this is when the first ""paint"" occurs.      One of the examples of a reflow was ""activation of CSS pseudo-classes."" I think this is referring specifically to pseudo-classes like :hover, where an event is triggered. My guess is that things like :not and :first-of-type are evaluated BEFORE the first reflow.     But that still doesn't explain to me how using something like :not(:first-of-type) would affect performance. I've had a few developers tell me using it creates ""performance issues,"" but no one can explain to me how that is so. Perhaps it has to do with the ""evaluating"" bit you mentioned?      Am I close??"

I just feel it's not taking advantage of an already-existing declaration and the Cascading aspect of CSS.  (By the way, I am not in any way disagreeing with you, I just think it's interesting how many approaches there are to accomplish the same thing)"
css,2z1jzb,castironpuppet,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:41:50 2015 UTC,"I love finding all of the different ways to do something too :)     I think this may be one of those situations where you're used to using something a certain way, so you prefer it more. Because both :last-of-tpe and :not are ""already-existing declarations."" I'm pretty sure both came with CSS3.       I don't understand what you mean by taking advantage of the ""cascading aspect of CSS."""
css,2z1jzb,stupidheadhat,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:07:10 2015 UTC,"By cascading I mean the broad -> specific prioritization of properties.   Pseudo-selectors are fine (apart from a reduction of compatibility, and possibly performance?), but by ""already-existing declarations"" I am simply referring to the selector { property: value; } blocks  for selectors a, a:last-of-type, and the additional a:not(:last-of-type). The stylesheet would simply be cleaner (possibly more maintainable?) if you let CSS prioritize specific over broad declarations (at the cost of properties being rewritten).  You don't need a:not(:last-of-type) because the a declaration already affects those, and a:last-of-type leaves properties from a that it doesn't redefine. You are then adding an extra declaration (a:not(:last-of-type){}) for specificity -- simply so ONE element's (a:last-of-type) style doesn't get written twice, which is optional in my opinion. It is more efficient in how it doesn't overwrite properties, at the cost of adding an entirely new declaration set and stacking pseudo-selectors.  Personally, I opt for simpler code at the cost of some colors and margins being written twice."

Adding a class to it is redundant and frankly ugly.  While I'd much rather prefer doing  .navitem { color: red; } .navitem:last-of-type { color: #000; }   , thereby overwriting styles for the last item, not everything else (for the sake of not using too many pseudo-selectors), this should be handled in CSS, not HTML."
css,2z1jzb,stupidheadhat,1 point,Sun Mar 15 11:13:26 2015 UTC,"Or, you could take it one step further and not overwrite anything:  .navitem:not(:last-of-type) { color: red; } .navitem:last-of-type { color: #000; }   There really aren't any performance issues using pseudo-classes (like above) these days, so you don't need to worry about that bit."

It might be tempting to mimic the structure of the dom in css to have a clean html-markup but it just isn't robust enough and doesn't scale well."
css,2z1jzb,a-t-k,2,Sun Mar 15 12:44:41 2015 UTC,"Same problem exists if you add a last-child class to the last element. The pseudo-class :last-of-type (or :last-child if that's your thing) acts as any other selector when it comes to specificity.  /* .last-child has higher specificity */ li.last-child { color: blue } .important-button { color: yellow }   /* .important-button has priority */ .last-child { color: blue } .important-button { color: yellow }  /* .important-button has priority */ li:last-of-type { color: blue } li.important-button { color: blue }   Basically, you can't really plan for a future coworker who doesn't know CSS wanting to change stuff. You write your selectors for a specific purpose; if you want to differentiate li.last-child from span.last-child, you're going to have higher specificity than someone who doesn't.  I stand by my original argument. HTML is for structuring, not for styling. If you want to style the last item, you style the last item - you don't use HTML to tell the CSS which item is the last item."

Combine media queries: Combines all your media queries into one and inserts them at the bottom of your css file.   Uncss : Checks your html file and removes all unused css.   Cssmin : minifies the css file.   With scss/libsass you can create placeholders that do what you're asking. You have to bake them into your project to begin with though.   Example : ‰my-placeholder { color:red; }   .mydiv {    @extend %my-placeholder;    padding: 2em; }   mydiv2 {    @extend %my-placeholder;    padding: 4em; }   That will create 2 desperate classes with the 2 and 4em.

Personally I'm a fan of locking a max-width on the page, but it really depends on the content of the website, I don't think there is a catch all for everything. It would be nice to take extra wide browser windows into account, but it also depends on how many people viewing the site would use a monitor like that. A site about hardcore PC gaming is much more likely to have people viewing the site on huge monitor resolutions for example. Anyway that's my $0.02."

I'm with you on this boat.    But with more and more wider screens being used, it feels strange to just leave a big wasteland of nothing on either side too.

As I see it, one of the huge difficulties for UIs in the future, will be the transition from classic ""photoshop to page""-designs, to a unique Corporate-Design, with flexible layouts, optimised for different screen and input devices.

You'll be amazed that a lot of stuff is automated nowadays. Make sure you know build tools as well such as Gulp and Grunt, make your choice.   To build your skills go straight to MDN. This is a really useful reference for elements/css/javascript as well as a guide to boost your skills.  I should advise to build your native JavaScript knowledge as far as you can, and solve problems in Vanilla JavaScript. When you know the language well, then you can go forward to know a framework I think such as AngularJS/Backbone/Ember whatever.

Remember that JavaScript is not c#, don't be mad at JavaScript for not being c# (at first look it may look similar to c# but its not). Accept that this is a different language.  Then go to css3, learn it using some videos tutorials and web design blogs online and maybe read a book. CSS is a bottomless pit of hacks and voodoo, don't get yourself sucked into it, learn the basics concepts like positioning, media queries, animations typography etc, again, don't go too deep, after you understand the basics most answers are a google search away (when you search, don't use the w3school site, its often wrong, the MDN or stack overflow sites are better.  Then build a site, but don't use any frameworks yet, this will teach you way you should use a framework or a library.  Then select a CSS and Js framework, and  pick one of the popular frameworks (like bootstrap/foundation for CSS and angular/react for JS) the big communities around them will be helpful for beginners.  Then go learn pre processors and build tools (Typescript/coffiescript for js, sass/less for CSS and gulp/grunt for ease of development flow).  Don't be worried about how fast the frontend world is moving, since I start writing this comment 37 new JS frameworks had been released, celebrated for their genius ways and then declared as the worst thing ever.

Anyway, with that in mind I suggest that, if you decide to start over, you start on a very small viewport, like 320px wide. Make sure you have a mobile phone at hand that you can test on, or an emulator would probably be fine as well. Once you're happy with how everything looks on a small screen, start dragging your browser window wider until you feel like it starts to look bad. Figure out how wide the viewport is and start 'improving' things in a media query. Repeat this process until you feel like you're supporting enough screen sizes."

In reality they are 640px wide but if you specify a width of 160px in css for example, it will take up half the screen on an iPhone.

If browsers would all just implement the property without a prefix you would have multiple version of one property and no way of knowing which vendor will support what version.

Or, if you don't want it to take up the whole window just leave it how you have it.  There may still be white space,  this can be due to padding on the body.  What I like to do, is have the first line of my CSS be something like this:  *{box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px}   The * selects ""EVERYTHING"".  So from this point on, every element has no padding or margin by default.  (padding is like a ""margin"" inside the element's borders, and margin is just space between the element and surrounding elements.  The box-sizing set to border-box makes it so that all measurements INCLUDE padding and margin and border (if you have one).  If you look at my example i made on codepen, you will notice the header, body and footer all have different widths.  This is because the padding is not included in the measurements.  But if I add that special *{} line before anything else, I can set all their widths to the same thing and it will line up."

I want the image to stretch or shrink to fit the width of the page. On my standard widescreen monitor, when I load the page (because of the high res) only about 2/3 of the image is visible. When I expand a certain amount to my second monitor I get the full image. If I go any further, it starts to duplicate the image. I only want it to show up once you know?

I think this part specifically is what should hit home for most front end web devs:   So many methodologies try to sell you on niceties and false comforts like minimal markup or readable class naming systems. While patterns like class=""full height"" or class=""four wide column"" sound nice when you read them out loud, the architectural concessions required to achieve this “feature” are simply not worth it.   This sort of stuff might work for awhile, but it will hurt you in the end.

GoodUI has a well written theory why undo is a better experience.   Imagine that you just pressed an action button or link. Undos respect the initial human intent by allowing the action to happen smoothly first and foremost. Prompts on the other hand suggest to the user that he or she does not know what they are doing by questioning their intent at all times. I would assume that most of the time human actions are intended and only in small situations are they accidental. The inefficiency and ugliness of prompts is visible when users have to perform actions repeatedly and are prompted numerously over and over - a dehumanizing experience. Consider making your users feel more in control by enabling the ability to undo actions and not asking for confirmation where possible."

The carousel works by toggling a class on specific divs.  You have the #mycarousel div.  Then there is a ""carousel-inner"" div inside that, and finally, within that you have 2 ""item"" divs.  Each one is a slide.  The carousel works by adding or removing a class.  So the slide to be shown is ""item active"" for example.  Inside each item div, there is an image, then a ""container"" div, then inside that a ""carousel-caption"" div.  Now, I don't know or really care about the workings of this carousel, but by looking at the structure, it seems that the slide you want to change has an id #stock on the carousel-caption classed div.  The CSS:  .carousel-caption { background-color: transparent; position: static; max-width: 550px; padding: 0 20px; margin-top: 120px; color:#FFF; }   is what is doing the aligning.

It's a light grayscale image you overlayed with slight opacity (30% opaque.) This has an additive effect, making the colors brighter than they are without it. Additionally, The grit in the original image is a blend of darker and lighter shades in the purple zones, and in the orange zones, is probably the dark purple or slight variations from that color, as opposed to being a darker orange.

The browser will automatically use the right protocol for the links.

css,2y1d6w,jminuscula,2,Thu Mar 5 16:58:43 2015 UTC,"The purpose of max-width is to say ""No matter what, don't get any wider than this.""  So it looks like max-width is doing it's job.    What I'm not exactly sure of is exactly what you want the longer content to do.  If you remove the max-width css entry, does that look more like what you want?"
css,2y1d6w,prudan_work,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"exactly, max-width should only put an upper bound to the block width. However, if you measure the block is exactly 120px (+2px border) as max-width says, even when the space needed for the wrapped text is shorter.  It looks as if the text needs more than the available width, so the block is rendered with the maximum allowed. However once the text is wrapped the space is no longer needed, so the width could be reduced further."
css,2y1d6w,David_Crockett,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"max-width is not calculated from the space needed for the wrapped text, it's calculated from the text as a whole. So if the text is long enough to need wrapping it will always be at max-width."

css,2y1d6w,David_Crockett,2,Thu Mar 5 18:48:55 2015 UTC,So you want it to wrap and then use the minimum width necessary with the wrap?  So instead of this:  ------------------   Max width Really long text  text   You want it to be:  ------------------   Max width Really long text text   Is that right?  You want it to be equally proportioned?
css,2y1d6w,David_Crockett,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"quite the opposite, I'm looking to shrink the container to the minimum width after the required wraps happens.  --------------------------- | Max width Really something wordnotfitting   I want this:  ----------------         | Max width Really something wordnotfitting   See how the second container is only as wide as the first line (the longer line) needs, since the rest of the text has wrapped because couldn't fit within the max-width.  This way, if I'm aligning the blocks using space-between with flexbox, the blank space will trully be evenly distributed"
css,2y1d6w,Fli-c,2,Thu Mar 5 20:08:57 2015 UTC,"You can't do that with CSS per my explanation above.  First, the rendering engine decides to expand to max-width due to the width of the text. After that, the word wrapping is applied and the text wraps based on what fits in the width. There is no CSS property that I know of to change the width after this, though it would be useful if there were.  You might be able to narrow the element with JS. Try this (jQuery): (Kludge warning!)  function reduceElementWidth(element) {     var $el = $(element),         width = $el.width(),         height = $el.height(),         testHeight;     while(width >= 0) {         --width;         $el.width(width);         testHeight = $el.outerHeight();         if (testHeight > height) {             // found the narrowest width possible without             // reflowing the text.             $el.width(width + 1);             return;         }     } }   If you actually wanted to use something like this, there are probably more efficient ways to calculate the best width of the text in the element. But you get the idea.  The disadvantage here is that the element would flash at the wider size, then be reduced. You could get around that by hiding (or setting visibility:hidden) the element and showing it after applying the new width.  EDIT: Just saw /u/prudan_work's post and I think I like my kludge better than the one posted on SO."

Then I used a trick for making triangles in CSS, and psuedo elements to make triangles on the two rectangles, so they have one 45 degree side, and together it looks like a cutout arrow.  There are notes in my CSS.  I think set the transparency to different values so you can see what piece is what.  and I put notes for how to figure out more info on the triangles using google (in the CSS).  Alternatively, you could make a square, then rotate it using transform.  But then it might cover up content below the div, and it only works if the background and cutout are the same color."

css,2xudqb,thatbaseballguy,2,Tue Mar 3 23:17:28 2015 UTC,"So,  I used psuedo elements to simulate the borders on your block quotes.  This gets the border to become the correct size (it must be fixed though).  Then the problem is getting them properly aligned whether the block quote is right or left.  I used the nth child selector to make every ""odd"" blockquote's psuedo element have a margin.  Of course, if the whole container isn't of fixed width, this falls apart. (as seen in my example here, re-size the window width and you will see.).  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ByPwXQ  You could do this with JS easy enough, but this was the best I can do with just CSS.  Maybe someone else has a better idea?  The psuedo elements seem to be taken out of the flow, so they don't conform around the floated images... :/"

css,2xudqb,CookiesAndDreams,2,Wed Mar 4 20:47:15 2015 UTC,"http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JoBeKq  Basically, since your images are floated, you can make the text you want to wrap (so the blockquote and the p elements) set to display:block and then set overflow:hidden, which results in it filling the remaining width when there is a floated element.  Not a perfect solution as you are making a normally inline element a block element when it might not be needed, and occasionally the overflow:hidden will come bite you in the ass (for example custom dropdowns and such), but it doesn't require a fixed width image (but works with one) or a fixed width page  Enjoy :)"
css,2xr6gc,KozureOkami,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:47:48 2015 UTC,Great post. I recently started using SMACSS and this is incredibly similar. The hardest part for me was differentiating between layout and modules (or what you call components). This really helped clear up some information that was mixed up in my brain. I'm really look forward to using some of your methods. Awesome post.  Edit: Can you (or anyone) clarify why .expertise-item { margin-top: 80px; } is not as good as .expertise { .expertise-item :  margin-top: 80px; } }? I don't quite understand how one is better than the other.  Edit 2: I think I get it. Is it so the layout is only contained inside of the container and not inside of the module/component?

If you do .expertise-item { margin-top: 80px; }, then no matter where you put that element, it'll always have a margin top of 80px, unless you explicitly override that style.  But if you have .expertise { .expertise-item : margin-top: 80px; } }, that margin is only specific to the .expertise container.  Meaning if we want to re-use the .expertise-item on a different page or in a different container, that margin-top doesn't move with it."

css,2xrf28,spin81,2,Tue Mar 3 07:55:20 2015 UTC,"No. <Strong> is, in effect a named span and is not a style in itself. You can change the style of strong in your css, although it will normally default to bold in browsers if you do not set it.  You should always separate out your styles into separate css for a few reasons. First it is generally considered best practice to separate HTML from CSS. Secondly, if someone else ever takes over a project then trying to sort through inline styles are a nightmare and can create all manner of inconsistency. It also leads to better consistency across the site and less code repetition."
css,2xrf28,fracturedworlds,1 point,Tue Mar 3 09:32:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'm reading this correctly but using inline styles should only be used for 'loading content above the fold'.   But in terms of your example, it is completely contextual to the meaning of your content, or semantics.   You should really use <strong> or <b> for weighted text... If your looking to add ""importance"" to your text you would use <strong> but if it is just to look stylistically different then you would just use <b>.

css,2xpuh5,Citizen_Gamer,2,Mon Mar 2 22:16:38 2015 UTC,"Eh, theoretically you could do something like this:  Have your poll be links to # (won't change the page), e.g.:  What's your favorite color?   Red Green Blue   After each link you have another placeholder link, so your markup looks like:  - [Red](#red ""poll-answer"")[](#a) - [Green](#green ""poll-answer"")[](#a) - [Blue](#blue ""poll-answer"")[](#a)   You hide the extra links with css:  a[title=""poll-answer""] > a { display: none; }   You then add the following CSS that shows an image where the placeholder links are when clicked:  a[title=""poll-answer""]:active > a{     display: block;     width: 200px;     height: 300px; }   and set the image url:  a[title=""poll-answer""][href=""red""]:active > a {      background: url( '//yourdomain.com/pollresults/poll_id/red' ); }   Now for the hard part -- You need a server-side script that creates a poll-result image for //yourdomain.com/pollresults/poll_id/red (or whatever you want the URL to be).  It should ignore duplicate votes from the same IP (yes there are issues here like multiple users with the same IP, but whatever).  The only issue with this (other than implementation) that I can think of is that the poll results disappear as soon as the user clicks on anything else.  Not quite sure how to get around that, anyone?  Oh, and you can make the results always show up above/below the answers, but the CSS is a bit more complicated and I don't feel like writing / testing it right now ;)  There are SO questions on the issue."

Then in the item on the bottom have a non-repeating background image positioned top-right that sudo acts like the extra border you need on that element.  edit: No need to overlap the elements.

Google could perceive it as keyword stuffing or a screen reader may flip out altogether.  Then there's the issue of size; you're essentially doubling the 'weight' of the page. This isn't an issue for broadband but a user on a mobile with a 2g connection or someone on dialup is going to feel it.  Maintainability is also taking a big hit. You're making a mess for yourself that will confuse anyone that touches it later.  Finally, what you're describing only accounts for two tiers of screen resolutions. A good responsive site will flex and mutate as needed; often accounting for at least 3 different resolutions but as many as 5 or 6.   My suggestion is to give a CSS framework with a grid system like Bootstrap or Foundation a shot. Their grids provide 'notches' that you can use to adapt sections based on resolution."

Most will display <nav> as 'block,' but you may have to specify.   Either way, you logically can't have something start after something if you don't define at what point that ""something"" ends. Why can't you have a set height for your nav? I'm trying to understand what is variable here that is causing you problems. Sorry for the many questions.    I'm fairly certain your solution lies in setting some max-heights. Things don't generally overlap anything unless you've set something to be absolutely positioned."

css,2x0bnb,chmod777,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:20:36 2015 UTC,"I was mainly interested because of the ability to use the poster.  More specifically, I was hoping that nothing from youtube would load until the video is played.  Right now, I have an iframe embed with a blank source, and I set the background of the player area to a poster image.  Then I use JS to add a source to the iframe that loads youtube or youku(the chinese equivalent) depending on a button on the poster image.  The purpose is so nothing from youtube tries to load when the page is initially loaded, and if the user selects the youku version of the video, youtube won't ever be called.  (Which is good, since attempting to load anything from google behind the Chinese firewall KILLS page-load times, or simply never loads)  This was just my way of solving the problem, and I think it might be a little hackish.

To improve it, I'd look in to better off-canvas menu implementations (ie. http://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/uIemr/ or http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/15/off-canvas-navigation-for-responsive-website/ etc.) and try your hand at cutting down the Bootstrap files you use so it's as lean as possible."

Or you can just make JS loop through every div of class=""isAgridThing"" and then assign one of 2 properties to it.  For example. EVERY block will have border top and left, as well as some other default properties.  But there's only 2 additional states they can possibly have. A right border, and a lower border.  So you have JS loop through every element with that specific class, and store them in an array, then you check the container/screen width with JS and do some basic division to find out how many blocks are going to be in one row.  You iterate through the divs assigning properties based on that.    Then if you want it to be responsive, you just re-calculate whenever the container size is changed.  Also you only need to iterate through n-1 elements, because the last element in the group is ALWAYS going to have all 4 borders (all 3 properties)."

All I did was remove that line breaks and indents between your <div> elements. It is the simplest work-around, but, unfortunately, it results in messy code.

The browser interprets that a single space is meant to be there, and adds the appropriate white-space according to your font settings. Similarly, it only accounts for a single space, so things like double spacing, tab indents, etc have to be added as HTML entities.   On that note, when you start taking &lt;li> elements and splitting them onto new lines in your HTML, but turning them into display: inline; elements, the browser interprets it as text, as it should. It takes those line-breaks and does what it knows to do... Turn them into single spaces.   There's hacky ways around it... Negative margins, defaulting font-size to 0 on the wrapper but increasing on the text within the nav items, breaking up your HTML in ways that aren't as legible but cause there to be no space, not entering the closing tags, adding comment blocks into your HTML...

It's simply a clear, which is required when using floats. Clearing is standard practice when using a float, and ""clearfix"" as described above is nothing more than a manner of using pseudo classes to not have to know what the next element in the flow is. Again, not a ""fix""... Just a simplified way of adding the necessary clears.   Originally, floats were intended for images, yes. However, the language has evolved. There are many CSS styles that were intended for one document related purpose originally but have grown sense them. HTML as a language is still intended for a document style layout, yet we, being the modern developers we are, have pushed the boundaries of what it can do and turned it into a method of relaying robust applications.   If you are against floats simply because of the ""clearfix"" hack of IE7 and below, then you need to just get over it and move on.

css,2w28s8,one800higgins,1 point,Tue Feb 17 01:41:39 2015 UTC,Glad you have it sorted out. Side note:  I've been writing a lot of React front-end apps lately. A nice side effect of JS rendering all of your HTML is that no whitespace is introduced. I don't have to trade off good-looking/readable code in favor of my display:inline-block; elements rendering without gaps. The whitespace issue inherent with using inline-block is just completely non-existent.  Another reasonable solution might be to minify your HTML as part of your build process.  I wish this bug could be handled reliably with CSS. It's totally stupid that this is the best solution for a seemingly stylistic problem.

For reference:   We use Ruby/JS for most of our projects They are developed locally on our laptops, with Sprockets doing runtime compilation for fast changes We use Github flow, so develop branch is automatically deployed to Staging and master is automatically pushed to Production. As part of that deploy step, we have a hook to run the assets:precompile task that Sprockets provides, which does a static compile to CSS and serves those files. This also handles concatenating files together, minifying, and any other post processor tasks (we do raw JS, but CoffeeScript/TypeScript/Traceur/whatever can be transcompiled at this point, for instance)   If you're using Ruby, I highly recommend Sprockets. It's the tool that drives the Rails Asset Pipeline, but it's an independent project that you can easily install and configure for any Rack-compatible project. You could also use it for its Rake tasks, if you so desired, I guess."

css,2veiyd,thorbs,3,Tue Feb 10 09:44:06 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're talking about layout, you'll want to mix.  First: Height as a % is nearly non-functional without flex-box, which brings up a whole other subject of compatibility. In order for height to work as a %, the parent element will need to have a fixed height, which can get complicated and makes % not really a thing. Therefore, it is very often ideal to define heights of objects relative to their CONTENT rather than the page.  We should assume that we'll want to have the container's height relative to the contents. If the contents are text, it is much MUCH easier to make everything look nice with ems:  font-size:1em; line-height:1.3em; min-height:1.3em; padding:.2em;  Now I KNOW that my text will fit in my container, and have reasonable padding no matter the text size. Furthermore, if I increase my text size, my container and it's contents will all increase appropriately. The key here is consistency.  If we did the following:  font-size:100%; line-height:16px; min-height:10%; padding:5px;  I can't be sure that 10% will be greater than the font size in all cases. In this case, I can't even be sure that my line-height is appropriate for my font-size, and if my parent's font-size changes, I could be in huge trouble. I'm also not sure how this will work with browser's zoom/settings for fonts. All around I've given up a lot of control.  Width can almost always be defined as a %, and actually probably should be in most cases. However, when I get to my min/max width, % may no longer be ideal. Setting the minimum width of an element to a certain number of characters is much easier to estimate with ems for instance.   And as for px, I think they get a bad rap. In almost every case, when you retrieve an object's dimensions via javascript, you'll get a px value. This means if I set a div to ""height:2em;"" and then retreieve that, I'll get a ""32px"" for instance. Now if I want to do math, and update the object, things can get very confusing. Now it's a 32px*1.3 all inside a 4em container... does it fit? For this reason, sometimes it's just simpler to do things in pixels.  TLDR: % is great for width, but should be avoided for height. ems are very useful. px is good too. Do what makes your work easier."
css,2veiyd,antiyoupunk,2,Tue Feb 10 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"IMHO:  percent: whenever you have things positioned or sized relatively on another element or screensize.  em/rem: whenever you want something ""static"". Meaning its position/size only scales with the font-size (zoom level/default font size) of course em/rem is also used for sizing texts.  px: Try to avoid this. Specially if you do something responsive. I use it for special images that doesn't scale. I also use it for borders."
css,2veiyd,Dronar,-2,Tue Feb 10 15:01:14 2015 UTC,"In my experience, percentages and em both produce different results in different browsers.

css,2vakxo,joeyhoer,4,Mon Feb 9 12:25:02 2015 UTC,What's the advantage over font-size:0;?
css,2vakxo,yaix,5,Mon Feb 9 15:13:35 2015 UTC,"Using a font-size of 0 essentially destroys the ability to allow font-size to cascade. Because the em unit is based off of the current font-size, this property is arguably one of the most important in the cascade.  By preserving the font-size you are freed to use em based values, on the parent element and all subsequent children - just as you normally would."
css,2vakxo,johnnyvibrant,0,Mon Feb 9 15:23:32 2015 UTC,"dont use em then, use rem"
css,2vakxo,duckumu,6,Mon Feb 9 20:51:04 2015 UTC,"This is a common misconception; em ≠ rem.  If you use rem as a replacement for em, then you don't understand the benefits of using em, and you're missing out. rem is only marginally better than using an absolute unit.  Because em is relative to the current font-size, we can develop interfaces that scale relative to their context.  rem on the other hand, being relative to the document root, is most useful for resetting the font-size.  In relation to this particular problem, if we choose to fight the white-space using font-size: 0, setting font-size: 1rem on the direct descendants, would be a fantastic use of the rem unit. However, we will not be able to ensure that these descendants are twice as large as the parent context, as we would with 2em, because the cascade has been broken, and 2em = 0.  This is commonly done with margin and padding, where it's important that these values are a derivative of the font-size to maintain relative sizing. For example, let's suppose we want to use the ""negative margin"" technique for collapsing whitespace between adjacent inline-block elements. If we suppose that the width of a single space character for our current font is equal to 4px when the font-size is equal to a root size of 16px, we could easily use margin-right: -4px to collapse the space. Setting margin-right: -0.25rem is superior, because if the font-size of the document root changes, then that value will still be valid. Now imagine that the font-size of the current context for the element we are collapsing space on is twice that of the document root at 32px – the width of a space is now doubled (8px), yet a right margin of -0.25rem is still only equal to -4px. A value of -0.25em, on the other hand, being relative to the current font-size, yields the correct value to compensate for a space at this size (-8px), and this will always be true, regardless of the font-size.  Note: I'm using px values for the font-size in the example above, only to illustrate the point, generally, all font-size declarations should use em."

The author of Responsive Web Design, Ethan Marcotte literally coined the term ""responsive web design"" so I'd imagine he knows what he is talking about.  I follow the author of Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3, Ben Frain's blog, which is pretty intense, but he absolutely knows what he's talking about.

css,2ussj9,AgentFreckles,2,Wed Feb 4 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"Here's some things to check:   In your stylesheet, you reference #body. Is this supposed to be an element with the ID of body, or the body element? In the link element, you are using min-width, but in the stylesheet, you are using min-device-width. I would take it out of the stylesheet, since it's a bit redundant. I'm not near a copy of Firefox right now, but the responsive design view may not adjust the supposed device-width, meaning even though the ""screen"" may be resized (causing the stylesheet to be loaded), your monitor is still larger (causing the media query inside the file to fail).   Hopefully something in there helps!"

css,2ussj9,philmayfield,2,Thu Feb 5 04:51:13 2015 UTC,"In your link your style sheet in the head of the document, change the media property to just ""screen"", let the media queries in the document do their job.  You can probably get rid of media attribute all together, but whatevs.  Also make sure the path is correct, happens all the time that you're tearing your hair out why somethings not working, only to find that the css isnt even loaded.  Next I would suggest using just min-width and max-width in your media queries, at least until you know theyre working (simplify to debug).  So go with @media (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 900px)  I would also not recommend breaking apart your css files, this just makes more http requests, and doesnt really save you any space or anything.  CSS files are pretty small in general.  Minifying it before deployment would be the better move.  Lastly, dont be afraid to combine rules when you have lots of things with the same properties.  In you case you can combine everything with 100% width like  #container, #body, #masthead  {     width: 100%; }   Good luck!"

It would help to understand where you're getting hung up?  What are some examples of classes that you make while trying BEM-like conventions that set off a red flag for you?  One thing I tend to do is write out my Markup and CSS in a document before setting anything to code.   My designers give my team the style library, wireframes, and a few mockups and from there we analyze them to plan our code. I use basic lists in a word processor to get an idea of how my markup is structured and from there keep a separate log of all the CSS I foresee needing.

I'd say your Main Navigation can stand alone.  As far as ordered lists go, and for other elements as well, if you have one style for your ordered lists through your site you should not have a class for them but rather style the ol selector directly. Now, lets say you do end up having a variant <ol> that appears less frequently on the site. That variant style would be module level.  Again though. Don't overthink it.

For instance: their modal is set up to pull from a separate page. That is hugely cool for dynamic web sites. You can even change the modal link location with some PHP. You can set your PHP code up in that page and run it when the user requests the modal.  Kube also has auto page load in their framework & drag-n-drop file upload. It's pretty unique among frameworks in that regard.  The grid naming system could be better, but it's nothing a few find and replace sweeps can't fix."

There is no such thing as something that can walk you through a to z, what crosses that gap is experience.  Design something and make it. Fail and smash your face into and hate everything. Solve each new problem as it arises. Learn what worked and what didn't and try to understand why. Read whatever you can get your hands on. Most importantly, make things all the time.  Getting to the beginner stage happens by reading and being guided. Getting to the next stage comes from doing and nothing else."
css,2ubg18,quilford,5,Sun Feb 1 01:27:30 2015 UTC,"Start by trying to understand the CSS and HTML on the sites you like going to. If you haven't already, become familiar with the F12 developer tools each browser provides. You'll want to get comfortable with them all because early on you will want to discover why your pages aren't looking the same in one browser to the next. Using the dev tools in the browser you can actually change the way the page is styled by literally changing the CSS in the developer tools. Or you can add styles as well which is GREAT when modifying your own site so you dont have to go back and republish it each time you make a change. IE's dev tools are actually pretty great. You can also simulate older browsers by changing the document/browser mode in the Emulation tab (this isn't perfect btw, but works well for the most part)  Next start using JSFiddle.net or CodePen.io and try to recreate some elements on a site you like. Do this daily, and do not get frustrated. By using the dev tools you can see how they used CSS to get the style you like, and the surrounding divs/spans/p/etc around it. You can also right click on the page and select ""inspect element"".  Codecademy is GREAT but one thing it doesn't do well is using real world tools since you are using their environment. You will learn far more by manipulating the dom in F12 or using JSFiddle/CodePen. Plus you can post a page you are working on in JSFiddle/CodePen to a forum like this one for help with what you are working on for a lot better discussion.  Another good site to keep in your toolbox is Can I use. This will help you with understanding which CSS can and can't be used for your specific browser support needs. One example that comes to mind is wanting to use text-shadow which isn't supported in IE9.  Because this is a post in a CSS sub, I'm not sure if you are going down the web developer route, but if you are, then continue reading. Otherwise, feel free to skip to the last paragraph.  Next you will want to move on to the final tool in your front end development toolbox you will want to master and that is JavaScript. Learn straight JavaScript first, and avoid mixing in jQuery until you feel like you have a great understanding of how JS works on its own. I believe the JS tutorial on Codecademy mixes jQuery early on, and if you are just starting out you may not realize the difference. Don't get me wrong, learning jQuery is almost as important as learning JavaScript, it's just important to understand it is a library for JavaScript, and as a framework has its uses and limitations. I really liked the JavaScript tutorial on Code School, so that would be a great place to start. It's not free, but I believe they have a free trial. Otherwise everyone will tell you JavaScript: the Good Parts and Eloquent JavaScript (which is online and free) are required reading.  After that you'll want to learn some of the more popular libraries and frameworks for CSS & JS, such as LESS, Sass, jQuery, AJAX, node.js, backbone.js, and Bootstrap to name a few.  After this, then you'll need to decide if you prefer to lean more to the designer side or the back-end developer side. Front-end developers are usually the bridge between the designer and back-end developer.   In my experience though, you fall in to either being an all-in-one or the designer who does front-end work. Learning designer tools like Illustrator and Photoshop will be helpful if you are asked to or need to create your assets. I actually prefer Fireworks (though I hear it is being discontinued) for creating quick assets I couldn't create with CSS instead of Illustrator because its a little less robust and for someone new its much easier to learn. Otherwise if you are going the back-end route you'll probably want to research which server-side language you want to start with like PHP, Ruby, Python, .NET, etc and then what database such as MySQL, MSSQL, etc.   The best advice I can give you though, is don't be a ""master of none"" web developer. Become a master at CSS before you move to JavaScript. Then become a master at JavaScript before you move to another language, or whichever language you choose next. When I started out I tried to learn CSS, JavaScript, ASP, PHP, jQuery, C#, AJAX, SQL, and a few others because I wanted to get started quickly...along with pressure from the company I worked at. You will get overwhelmed, burnt out, and start making mistakes, or even worse, not get to the bread and butter of the language you are trying to learn."

css,2u7zc0,kenok,7,Fri Jan 30 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"The obvious downsides to this is that you can only have two states: All in a row, or all vertically stacked. For a lot of cases this is all you need, but using table hacks means that you can't only flow some of the columns in a row underneath, which is extremely important when it comes to responsive columns. Which also means that smaller columns become practically unusable in this library.  Going off on a tangent here... the only two ways that this is possible while having complete browser coverage is the use of floats or inline-block hacks. Inline-blocks are not preferred as they retain the spacing around them (with the fix leading to some ugly HTML), but they don't have clearing issues like floats do (with the fix being extra classes). However these clearing issues can also be taken advantage of to create much more complex layouts. But it takes a bit more CSS to accomplish this.  Flexbox is the holy grail of column layouts, but it still has somewhat shitty browser support. Once IE9 support is dropped all of this columns bullshit will leave us behind once and for all!"

The animation for this is pretty annoying and not very intuitive. Would make more sense for the menu to slide in from the right hand side than this but I'm not even sure that's a good idea. A slight fade is probably best as you wouldn't suffer that slight jump when the blur effect kicks in either. I know this wasn't the point here but I'll say it anyway – putting black text over a picture like that is a terrible idea for readability purposes. And as almost always, form should follow function."

Prepare for some Googling if you'd like to understand more. :)  Because .postleft is floated left, it's taken out of the flow, but pushes inline content around. If you give .postright a background color and remove position: relative and also give the img half opacity, you'll see .postright goes all the way to the left.  Adding position: relative back does something to the stacking context, making it appear above .postleft. ...I think. Don't quote me on that.  To get around this issue, you could do something like add overflow: auto to .postright. This would create a new formatting context which would not overlap with .postleft.

The reason I didn't add overflow: auto to .postright, is because I wanted the text to wrap under the left image.  So both of the two options to solve the click-ability problem (.postright{overflow:auto;} and .postright{position:relative;} won't work for me, since I essentially need that .postright div to cover the whole .post space (so words wrap), but I also need it to be relative, so I can use absolute positioning inside it.

If position:scroll worked then does position:static work also?  position:static is default and if that works best to not define the position - less code is usually better code.  other issues that don't contribute to the footer issue:   The footer element needs to be inside of the body.

They are also not semantically meaningful, and are thus considered to be one of the worst practices in web design.  The layout you have would be very easy to implement with just 3 <div> or other block wrapper elements.  In addition, my way would reduce your entire <body> to the same number of lines of code as your table alone right now.  Take a look.  With some adjustment in how you originally thought about this layout - or maybe 1 additional wrapper element around the two columns to deal with small-width screens, you could perfectly replicate all behavior of the table in much more structured, attractive, maintainable code."

css,2twpuu,CodeKevin,2,Wed Jan 28 03:30:47 2015 UTC,"You can use a single image and animate the image using CSS animations. Refer to the following link to get information on this method: http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp  Or, if using a sprite sheet, you could animate through the sprite sheet using CSS as well. The properties are similar in the two methods, but, depending on what you're using it for, both methods would work just fine: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/css-sprite-sheet-animations-steps  The benefits of using the first method: The client only has to download and use one (or a few small) images. It also allows you, as the developer, to use the elements in a more flexible way and eliminates the need to have make a frame for every position of every element. When using the second method, if you decide the animation does not have enough frames, you'll have to go back and add more images to the sprite sheet. Use this if animating a few elements with simple animations or animating multiple objects the same way (For example, moving lots of cloud sprites across the screen.)  The benefits of the second method: If you have a complex animation going on, instead of having multiple images all overlapping with CSS animations, you could have one sprite sheet that does it all in the imagery versus the CSS. Use this if you have lots of things happening in your animation at once (For example, transforming a car into a robot)."

Put it all together and this is a good start:  .et_pb_portfolio_item {      position: relative;      overflow: visible !important;      margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0 !important;     background-color: #fff;     -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;     -moz-box-sizing: border-box;     box-sizing: border-box;     -webkit-border-radius: 2px;     -moz-border-radius: 2px;     border-radius: 2px;     background-clip: padding-box;     -webkit-box-shadow: 0 2px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0 2px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);     -moz-box-shadow: 0 2px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0 2px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);     box-shadow: 0 2px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0 2px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12); }      .et_pb_filterable_portfolio .et_pb_portfolio_items,  .et_pb_filterable_portfolio .et_pb_portfolio_items_wrapper {     overflow: visible !important;     padding-left: 4px;     padding-right: 4px; }  .et_pb_filterable_portfolio_grid .et_pb_portfolio_item h2 {     padding: 10px; }"

So right now, like I said, I'm using Divi as my wordpress theme. In my wordpress dashboard, I can go to ""appearence>>editor"" and it'll give me my style.css.  So basically what I'm going to do (correct me if I'm wrong) is insert that CSS into my style.css file, and then wherever I want to use one of the cards, call .et_pb_portfolio_item? Where would I call this?  Sorry if I'm being stupid. My entire programming knowledge consists of one basic java class haha.  Edit: Wait! I think I got it! They're on cards now! Now I can play around with this a bit more. Thank you so much!"

Eventually I would love to get rid of the grid with the categories and implement a slider (with no categories) with bigger ""Image Cards"" (From the materialize CSS).  Right now this is way beyond my capabilites though."
