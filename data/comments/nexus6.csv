It's not some massive change unless you're a serious power user, which I know some of you are, but if you have any tendency to actually control the device you use you'll definitely benefit from rooting."

nexus6,3dqu0j,elimi,2,Sun Jul 19 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"New Nexus user here with the only no vote so far, would rooting make me lose any data?"
nexus6,3dqu0j,Peenrose,3,Sat Jul 18 16:09:46 2015 UTC,Unlocking your bootloader will wioe your data. Unlocking bootloader is almost always the first step before actually rooting. Most toolkits give you options to backup your things however.
nexus6,3dqu0j,ShitsNGigglesdTB,3,Sat Jul 18 16:26:04 2015 UTC,"Not really. Unlocking the bootloader is a one time deal, though. Unlocked, which wipes all data on the phone, then root and setup the phone.   Bootloader is what controls the various system partitions of the phone like /recovery and /system. These are not generally editable with a locked bootloader, so unlocking it allows you to use a custom recovery like CWM or TWRP, which make it very easy to root."
nexus6,3dqu0j,33165564,3,Sat Jul 18 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"Nope. rooting does two things:  1) gives you access to modify root directory which for most people means being able to run specialized apps like Titanium Backup, Adaway, kernel control apps, terminal emulators, Nandroid Manager, font changing apps, etc.   2) since you've modified a system partition, you won't be able to grab OTAs anymore so you'll have to update your phone manually until you flash a Google image again."
nexus6,3dqu0j,itsjustadrian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"so is it possible to root without unlocking the bootloader, which will wipe data?"
nexus6,3dqu0j,Peenrose,3,Sat Jul 18 16:19:03 2015 UTC,No it is not
nexus6,3dqu0j,anonforbacon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:43:24 2015 UTC,No. However most utilities offer a backup first option
nexus6,3dqu0j,tacol00t,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"Unlocking the bootloader, the first requirement, makes you wipe the whole thing. The Nexus Root Toolkit (NRT) has options to make backups but recommends making manual backups of app data to avoid problems. Watch some videos of it, it's really easy to use and to revert to stock. Rooting does come with some risk so I wouldn't recommend doing it just to see what it's like. Find a few root apps that you feel strongly about then consider the risks and make frequent backups."
nexus6,3dqu0j,ThePointed,2,Sun Jul 19 00:15:41 2015 UTC,"So at first, when I was on Lolipop on my Nexus, I had my phone rooted, just because I had never been able to before. (Didn't want to void warranty on my S3 with Verizon) Didn't really use it for much, but I liked the option of having it there. (Although I did have an app that allowed me to play Google Play All Access Music through any player I wanted, and I liked that.) Later, I flashed Android M on it, and forgot to used the rooted version. A few of my apps stopped working because they weren't rooted, a lot of my apps stopped working because of Android M, and I just didn't like the feeling.    So much later when I finally found some free time to mess with my phone, I grabbed the rooted kernel, and flashed it. But at the same time, I decided to use MultiROM to keep Android M, Chroma, a better battery version of Android M (xTraSmooth), and Euphoria all on the device to use whenever I wanted.    And I've fallen in love with Euphoria, and use it as my primary ROM now."

nexus6,3dqu0j,cawpin,3,Sat Jul 18 20:09:28 2015 UTC,"I was always told when I was on Verizon with my Galaxy S3 that rooting would void the warranty I had there.    If that's not true...well oh well, mind you this was also 2-3 years ago.    I rooted the Nexus almost immediately, (I specifically asked the AT&T guy, and he said it was perfectly fine) just didn't play with any custom ROMs until very recently, if that's what you were getting at."

nexus6,3dqu0j,WonTheGame,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Why:  Vanilla Android UI is woefully inadequate for one-handed use on a six inch device.  Pie controls via an xposed module gives a massive boost in overall experience in my opinion.  LED notifications.  I respect rolling out active display, but it is not a good notification system.  I love having LED notifications working in lightflow so I don't have to so much as touch my phone to know if something is waiting for my attention.  Battery conservation.  Too many little things to bother mentioning here that saved me a decent amount of battery.  I'll mention the tools:  greenify+xposed module.  Amplify.  Smart radio in gravity box xposed module (so I can force connecting to the strongest signal instead of a super-weak lte signal, which this phone insists on doing, I don't know why).  So, yes, root.  But I think the more important thing is an unlocked boatloader and being able to flash factory images instead of being at the mercy of OTA schedules."

And it can be slippery (which was enough to convince me to immediately buy a case for it). But it's a phablet. So you'll either love it or hate it depending on your opinion of phablets.

nexus6,3dr06d,dexterfichuk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:55:31 2015 UTC,"Its very simple. If you plan on using the phone for a good amount of time (im talking 2 years) then get the Nexus 6. The difference is that, the Nexus 6 will progressively get better over time with software updates, its mostly the opposite with the Note 4. If you dont care for system updates then stick with the note 4 until the next Nexus phone arrives."

nexus6,3dsxv8,AM11295,2,Sun Jul 19 03:47:03 2015 UTC,"you could reflash TWRP to try to restore your backup. if that doesn't work, it'd be best to start clean again.  if you want to use NRT, just flash the M Preview 2 from scratch.  if you're still having trouble, you could try doing it manually.   grab your factory image from the official site which it looks like you've done already extract the files from the zip and also from the image zip within that folder individually flash the images in this order and follow rebooting into the bootloader (command is: fastboot reboot-bootloader): flash bootloader, reboot, flash radio, reboot, flash system, flash boot, fastboot erase cache, flash cache, reboot, flash recovery, reboot if you were unencrypted and you want to keep it that way, flash TWRP instead of the stock recovery, and instead of rebooting regularly on the previous step, go into recovery and flash this unencrypted boot img. BEFORE booting into Android restart"

nexus6,3dsxv8,darienswag420,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:24:55 2015 UTC,"Just curious how do you flash it by scratch? Because I was trying to flash 5.11 on my Nexus so I could then flash M  but I do it from the Fastboot flash section and I was curious if I could use the sideload OTA update section? For some reason when I flashed the 5.11 system it managed to get bast to boot animation but now its just goes to the Android is starting, optimizing app saying and once it completes it just boots up again."
nexus6,3dsxv8,alphanu22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:43:54 2015 UTC,"i'm thinking that your 5.1.1 backup is FUBAR ever since you flashed the M boot.img and then restored your backup.  AFAIK, you can't sideload OTA 5.1.1 to M Preview 2. so you'll have to flash the entire image. here's what i would do in your situation. commands are in quotes.   make sure you have TWRP installed. ""fastboot flash recovery twrpimage.img"" you don't have it. ""fastboot reboot-bootloader"" flash the M Preview 2 bootloader, available here in TWRP. from TWRP, reboot back into bootloader (NOT A REGULAR REBOOT) your reboot version should now say 71.11 with a radio version of 05.17. go into recovery mode (TWRP). download the M Preview 2 ""fastboot"" file from the previous link. wipe system, cache, and dalvik-cache. flash the ""fastboot"" zip in TWRP after wiping. OPTIONAL: if you're decrypted and want to stay that way, flash this mod in TWRP. reboot, when TWRP says no system is installed that's fine. do not install SuperSU. after a full regular reboot into Android, then you can flash all other mods (kernels, SuperSU, etc)."
nexus6,3dsxv8,alphanu22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"I'll try that once I get access to my laptop. Currently I tried to restore my backup from 5.01 and its just stuck on an optimizing apps loop and this was because I tried to flash to 5.11. I'm not sure why my restore didn't work, probably the reason you pointed out."

The first time it happened was with Google play music - the wallpaper became the album art and would actually change with the songs. I thought it was a feature, but even changing wallpapers wouldn't fix it - had to reboot.   Later on, the bottom part would freeze. I think a total of 4 times so far. Only way to fix is a reboot."
nexus6,3dssqd,confused_chopstick,2,Sun Jul 19 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"What I'm experiencing is the screen splitting vertically, and one side completely freezes while the other side is still active but is incredibly laggy. Hitting the power button to turn off the screen/lock the phone seems to fix the issue temporarily, but once it has happened it's very likely to happen again unless I reboot.  It doesn't happen too often (once or twice in succession every two or three weeks), and seems to have gotten better with 5.1 and 5.1.1. It seems to happen the most when the phone is running a bit hot (has a ton of apps running in the background), or when it's low on battery (under 25%)."

nexus6,3dr0ef,holic_2,4,Sat Jul 18 17:40:11 2015 UTC,Eh flashing isn't as primitive as it once was. They really just give that warning for insurance purposes. I highly recommend using Wugfresh's Nexus Toolkit found here it makes things so much easier.
nexus6,3dr0ef,TheDunadan29,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:39:00 2015 UTC,"There's always risk involved with flashing a ROM, even an official one from Google. But as long as you follow the instructions to the letter you should be fine. Really you just want to avoid irregularities, like losing power right in the middle of flashing. But that's why they recommend you charge it fully beforehand, and then plugging it in while flashing just in case."

nexus6,3dno8l,ImNaturallyConfused,3,Fri Jul 17 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"Does seem super odd since it's a warranty replacement, not an insurance replacement. My warranty replacement through Google was free."
nexus6,3dno8l,hothfox,3,Fri Jul 17 19:41:38 2015 UTC,I have done it twice. They only charge you for advanced replacement. Regular RMA procedures do not have a charge. If you ask nicely enough they will refund the 25 dollar charge upon recieving your device
nexus6,3dno8l,SippieCup,3,Sat Jul 18 15:26:49 2015 UTC,What did you tell them to get that refund?! I'm my replacement arrives Monday and I'd love to get the full charge back
nexus6,3dno8l,mechgingeneer,3,Sat Jul 18 17:37:22 2015 UTC,I just said that I should not be responsible for any cost of maintaining the warranty that was prescribed to me when i purchased the phone. that I think a $525 hold should be enough for the advanced replacement and that it was their fault that the phone was broken in the first place so I shouldnt be punished for them sending me a defective device.
nexus6,3dno8l,SippieCup,2,Sat Jul 18 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"See this is my thought exactly. Why am I paying extra for warranty on a defective device? I'm not doing an exchange because I feel like it. It's not my fault there is something wrong with what I payed hundreds of dollars for. Plus, why does it cost money to have them ship the replacement device before I ship mine in as opposed to shipping mine in first? There is literally no difference in logistical cost for them; either way they are shipping me another device, and receiving my defective I've in return. Or am I missing something?"
nexus6,3dno8l,Motox_xotoM,3,Sun Jul 19 01:28:54 2015 UTC,"The reason why they do it is because it significantly reduces insurance costs.  Advanced exchanges can be easily exploited for fraud, furthermore, people who just keep the device (or dont return the old one) actually end up costing the company more than $500. (couple hours of work for the people talking to insurance, cost of device, cost of people who were working support, etc).  Thus, in order to keep issues like that to a minimum companies charge a premium fee on top of the hold to 1) discourage people from doing advanced RMAs (as it is more risky to them) and 2) use it in court/investigations as acknowledgement that the client returning the device accepted the terms and conditions of the advanced RMA.   ""He willingly paid $25 dollars for the phone to be shipped first and a 500 dollar hold on my account"" goes much farther than ""we told him there would be a 500 dollar hold"" because the client, in theory at least, has an greater understanding of what is going on because they are willing to spend money on it.  That being said, the money is easily refundable for the same reason after the phone has been returned (and verified to be the correct IMEI/SN) since there is no obviously no fraud being commited and no reason to contact their insurance.  Just be sure to get them to say it in advanced like i did."
nexus6,3dno8l,SippieCup,2,Sun Jul 19 02:09:27 2015 UTC,"That certainly makes sense when you explain it like that. Thanks for taking the time to type that out!   It's unfortunate that they feel the need to take out the cost of their insurance by incurring an extra charge for their customers who are coming from a position of weakness, ie. with a defective device.   That's very solid advice. I'm curious how you were able to make them commit to refunding the $25 charge up front. It looks like you spoke with REST. I certainly wasn't able to get the rep I spoke with to agree to refund the $25 charge."
nexus6,3dno8l,Motox_xotoM,2,Sun Jul 19 02:19:14 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate that they feel the need to take out the cost of their insurance by incurring an extra charge for their customers who are coming from a position of weakness, ie. with a defective device.   Its not the cost of insurance, its that their insurance premium goes down if it is offered.  As for people who cannot authorize it. just ask for the next tier of support."
nexus6,3dno8l,SippieCup,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:12:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this advice! I've been arguing with them over this for the past few days. They've been a huge pain to deal with. No one knows what's going on. They ask me the same questions every time. I even had to send multiple proofs of purchase with dates, names, times, etc. One rep even said I had to send in a picture of the phone.   Then they want me to pay $25 on top of a $500 hold? What a terrible customer service experience. I don't think Apple does that to you."

nexus6,3dnv3r,couragethechicken,4,Mon Jul 20 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"The nexus 6 tends to obtain and keep a cell connection based on the fastest network rather than the strongest signal.  Irrespective of whether cellular data is in use.  This is an asinine behavior that does not adjust to wifi-connection status either.    Most of the time LTE isn't as strong nor as power-efficient.  But the phone will grasp onto the weakest LTE signal instead of going to 3G or 2G even when cellular data is not in use.    In my case it results in having effectively no cellular signal at home (LTE dead zone, apparently) despite very strong 2G and 3G signal.  I would frequently not receive calls or texts at home.  So I looked into a solution, and came across the Smart Radio settings in the GravityBox Xposed module.  This essentially lets you force the cellular network connection to use.  The spirit of this was in battery-saving measures (since later generations of networks use more and more power), but also allows one to select the network type to connect to if you want to force a stronger connection.  I'm not an expert in all things android, I just put together a few screenshots and a long-winded explanation in the imgur album.  I wanted to share this for others that either want to save some battery, or get better signal where it should exist (like me)!

nexus6,3dm7hi,AbsoluteZ3r0,2,Fri Jul 17 12:06:53 2015 UTC,"Are you rooted?  I ask because there is a setting in the gravity box xposed module that will force connection to a specific network (2g, 3g, , 4g, lte, etc).  It's meant for battery preservation, but has the secondary effect of better reception, and allowing you to specify what network to connect to (the cell settings in the stock os only pertain to battery, not voice).  I discovered this, along with an important behavior of the nexus 6:  The N6 maintains network connection in a way that prioritizes potential data speed over reception quality.  Supposedly this is due 'better experience' for WiFi/cell data handoff.  The consequence is that the phone will grasp into a very weak but higher data rate connection rather than connecting to a stronger but slower connection.  The ridiculous thing is even if you're on WiFi, your phone will still connect to an lte signal, which has higher battery drain, instead of connecting to a 2g or 3g signal.    In my case my phone would be connected to a -110dbm lte while a strong -50dbm 2g signal was also available.  I mainly just wanted a usable voice signal at home.  Since I have WiFi always connected, I couldn't care less what cell data connection I have.  This way I now get full bars of voice, but on 2g, instead of having zero bars or lte and never being able to receive our initiate calls.  It was a life saver.  And also note my battery doesn't lose 10% just due to cell standby drain.  If you are rooted and have xposed I can guide you through my setup and config.  /walloftext"

nexus6,3dm7hi,tauzins,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:57:19 2015 UTC,Like what are your settings doing that the phone isn't doing stock
nexus6,3dm7hi,cdegallo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"Gotcha!  Okay, so...I'll try to be as clear as possible.  The default behavior of the N6 (and afaik it's a lollipop thing in general as well) is to connect to LTE first, then slower and slower networks later.  But often the signal will be maintained at a very, very, very weak state to the point where it's unusable.  It's connected to an LTE signal, but you can't do much of anything for data or voice.  The phone does not always behave to switch down to a different network type for better signal.  From what I understand, this is because of some decision to have better high-speed data hand-off between wifi and cellular data--which is why one would prioritize connection to LTE.  However, that's a poor method because it does not balance signal quality (for example, I'm often in areas where I get faster data and better signal on a 3G network than I do on an LTE network--but my phone does not drop down to 3G because of this LTE-preference behavior).  So...  Smart radio settings override the default behavior of the radio.  It allows for certain rules to be followed with specific network-connect types to be used.  There are basically 3 states that Smart Radio settings use.  (1) When connected to Wifi, (2) when not connected to Wifi but have cellular data enabled, and (3) when not connected to Wifi and have cellular data disabled.  Normally the phone does not differentiate these 3 situations, and ignorantly tries to connect to the fastest signal regardless of strength.  But with smart radio, you can dictate which network (2G, 2G/3G auto, 2G/3G preferred, 3G, LTE) for the phone to connect to at each of those situations.  What this enables is 2-fold.  You can force a connection to a stronger signal (if you know that you generally have better 2G or 3G signal than LTE, you could choose to connect to 2G or 3G).  But also maintaining a connection to a 2G or 3G tower uses less power than LTE.  So you also incur less battery drain by doing this.  In the stock phone the only thing you can do is dictate which data connection you want to use (2G, 3G, or LTE).  But this has zero impact on what network to connect to for voice if you're currently connected to WiFi.  The stock phone behavior does not let you choose a network priority in this way, so you're stuck with the default behavior of prioritizing network speed type over signal strength.  If you're always in a strong LTE zone, you won't get much benefit in terms of signal strength improvement, but if you force connection to 3G or 2G while you're connected to wifi, it will cause less power consumption as maintaining a connection to those network tech's is less than maintaining a connected to an LTE network."

nexus6,3dlwlx,laszlof,6,Fri Jul 17 13:27:38 2015 UTC,"Rooting isnt always an option.  For example, I have some apps on my phone (work related) that will not run on a rooted phone for security reasons."
nexus6,3dlwlx,ryan_m,10,Fri Jul 17 14:13:18 2015 UTC,IT will eat you up for running enterprise stuff on a rooted phone.
nexus6,3dlwlx,silentrob_,2,Fri Jul 17 14:23:19 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, and it's frustrating as hell. I'd love to ""just root it""..."
nexus6,3dlwlx,IMightBeDaWalrus,2,Fri Jul 17 16:18:15 2015 UTC,"Reading that post title and then going ""if you have root"" or ""just root it"" is about as contributory (or is that contributive?) and productive as telling someone fallen ill to ""just get better."" One of the greatest draws of Android - and its most quoted pro vs. iOS - is the greater number and variety of options for nearly everything; I mean that more from an OS standpoint than a OEM tweaks/hardware one. Of course, Google has every right to tout its own services over those of its rivals, but the ability to circumvent most Google-imposed limitations via third-party alternatives has always been a major plus for the system. ""Root it"" shouldn't be the only way to gain an otherwise widely supported feature, especially considering the OS has had the capability baked in for a while, just not enabled in some of the latest devices.   Don't get me wrong, I'm very pro-rooting, but that's because there's nothing currently preventing me from doing so. It's not always an option (see below), and so just shouldn't be a go-to solution imo."
nexus6,3dlwlx,anotherfiz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:59:48 2015 UTC,You're right. I made that most before I ate breakfast this morning.  never make a post when you're hungry.
nexus6,3dlwlx,anotherfiz,0,Fri Jul 17 18:32:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, I will probably root it, and reinstall everything. (Probably an hour of my time or so) - what pisses me off is that this is an unnecessary step, just created because some guy in marketing thought this would help sell more Chromecasts. (Which I would have bought anyway) There are just situations, where Mirracast would work better, or may be the only choice.   Maybe I'm just frustrated, that a cheap Samsung, and the iPhone can screencast to this TV, and my flagship Nexus device cannot do that, for no reason, but greed."
nexus6,3dlwlx,ChrisChrisWTF,3,Fri Jul 17 17:13:46 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong about this - but if i recall, miracast is not open source.  Perhaps google doesn't want to pay licensing fees?  I do see your point, but that's one of the things i love about the nexus.  I get to pay a less expensive price for my phone (comparing release date / off contract prices), and I can add the things that I do not have."
nexus6,3dlwlx,laszlof,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not very happy about having to root a phone I'm doing banking on, for something as simple as a line of code."
nexus6,3dlwlx,anotherfiz,-2,Sat Jul 18 10:09:42 2015 UTC,"I get why some people literally can't root a phone, but then why even buy a Nexus?"
nexus6,3dlwlx,laszlof,5,Fri Jul 17 17:26:17 2015 UTC,"1) Screen size.  2) Project FI Support  3) Stock android.  What makes you think the only reason someone would buy a nexus is if they planned on rooting? Ok, its slightly easier to root than other phones, but most phones are pretty dead simple these days."
nexus6,3dlwlx,ChrisChrisWTF,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you there are merits to buying a nexus beyond rooting - i don't agree with ""it is slightly easier to root"".  it takes a single fastboot command to unlock the bootloader on a nexus. no tinkering required.  every other (locked) phone requires someone to bypass security and release the exploit to the public - 99% of users simply cannot do this , they do not have the education.   100% of people can unlock a nexus 6 with a little bit of googling and a usb cable"
nexus6,3dlwlx,laszlof,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"Thats untrue. There are several other phones out that are simple to root. GeeksPhone, OnePlus One, etc.  Not to mention rooting has gotten to the point of one click installers now from any PC. Nearly every rootable phone out there has some type of fast/easy method of rooting. One doesnt have to know how to ""bypass security"" and ""release an exploit to the public"" in order to root their phone, thats what the experts are for. Once the experts figure it out, its easy for the average person to do it.  That being said, the 99% of users that cant do this probably shouldnt be rooting their phones in the first place."
nexus6,3dlwlx,ChrisChrisWTF,2,Fri Jul 17 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"Simple rooting is simple on a lot of standard phones, but unlocking the bootloader isn't. Also all those phones you listed aren't standard consumer phones. I'd argue that the Nexus is in the same boat as those; more of a power user's phone than a standard consumer device, although Google is trying to change that a bit. Still, Fi support isn't exactly a popular consumer choice at this point, and the Note offers the same screen real estate and is more well known. The Moto X has stock Android with more convenient features. I definitely feel like there's little real reason behind a Nexus if you don't intend on unlocking the bootloader and rooting."
nexus6,3dlwlx,laszlof,0,Fri Jul 17 18:05:44 2015 UTC,"The note has that stupid curved screen on it, and runs TouchWiz, which is slightly better than it use to be, but is still pretty bad. (I had a Galaxy S6 before this on Sprint, long story, bad experience). The moto X has nowhere near the screen size of the N6. And just because Fi isnt popular (hell, its in beta, of course it isnt popular) doesnt invalidate my reasons for choosing it.  That being said, I choose not to root my phone. I'm certain I'm not alone in that front. You cannot sit there and tell me that every Nexus 6 owner has rooted their device. Everyone has their own requirements, mine includes not being rooted for security reasons."

nexus6,3dlwlx,Mark_is_on_his_droid,0,Fri Jul 17 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not claiming to be the rule. However, I believe you're greatly over-estimating the amount of users who actually root their devices. You cannot use a community like reddit to get that perspective, as its biased towards the tech community. The Nexus 6 was a widely sold device through all the major carriers, it ended up in the hands of the young, old, tech-savvy, and newbies alike.  Of course there is no real way to get those kinds of statistics. So we'll just have to agree to disagree on that front."
nexus6,3dlwlx,Mark_is_on_his_droid,0,Fri Jul 17 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"This is beyond bizarre-- my Nexus 4 can do Mirracast no problem, and has been able to since launch. I can't imagine why Mirracast would be disabled on the Nexus 6. That really sucks!  EDIT: I haven't used Mirracast in over a year so maybe something changed, but I doubt it."

nexus6,3dl3os,zachspringman,3,Fri Jul 17 03:39:22 2015 UTC,"regarding battery life, most people would agree it's average-above average. i've seen reports of SOT varying from 3 hours to 6.5 hours. and just like the S6, it also has turbo charging so if you ever get around to plugging it in for 15 minutes in the middle of the day, it adds more.  for the camera, it's not news that Samsung and Apple have the best phone cameras. once again, the N6 falls in average-above average scores in this category. however, one of the redeeming qualities of the phone is the capability to take advantage of the new Camera2 API. this doesn't exactly bring it up to speed with the S6 or Note4 but it allows for a bit of scalability.  if you want a 6-inch phone with a good screen and great speakers, i'd pick up the Nexus 6. according to rumor leaks, LG is making a ""better"" Nexus 5 while Huawei is a bigger phone at 5.7 inches with a fingerprint scanner.  if you want to stay on the smaller side of things, i'd suggest waiting for the official Nexus announcement to see if LG is indeed making an upgraded N5. if you want big, the N6 should be great especially if you're looking to avoid a Touchwiz experience."

I'd like to add, I have always been anti-phablet. I decided to just go ahead and try one already though (have 32 days to return it), and I don't know if it's the fact that I actually do like big screens or that the software is a breath of fresh air, but I gotta say I actually really like my Nexus 6, the size doesn't bother me at all."
nexus6,3dl3os,goblando,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, I'm almost inclined to buy one today. That however depends on how much I can sell my S6 for."

I'm on my 4th device due to constant issues. 1st had a faulty battery, 2nd had a faulty vibrating motor, 3rd had a completely misaligned screen. The screen hung over the top left upper corner and left side by a couple centimeters. It didn't feel right in the hand and would have likely shattered if dropped on that corner. All of these have been poor quality control on motorola's part. Now onto my current phone... The screen is still not perfectly aligned with the body but it is not worth replacing again. It has been frequently not sending/receiving texts or texts will come many hours after they are sent. It's not a carrier issue or location and there are many posts about the issues. WiFi constantly drops off while my other devices have no issues. I get an error about restricted data on WiFi all the time. These could just be software issues from 5.1.1 but still quite annoying. Lastly, I have noticed the white noise/static from the top speaker that many people also have. It has not been confirmed if it is hardware or software related, but the noise lasts close to 3 seconds after a system notification or the camera shutter sound. This is again not acceptable for the price of this phone. My nexus 5 was flawless compared to this model. I know nexus phones will have bugs but this is blatantly the worst nexus in my opinion. Motorola completely shit the bed on their side. Make sure you check these issues with your phone before walking out of the store or you'll end up in an endless RMA cycle. I'll never my another Motorola based on my experience. I'm waiting for the next nexus and will be jumping ship."

Any Nexus 6 will work with Fi, if you want the optimal results though you can flash the factory image for Fi.  If Amazon hits you with tax (like in my state) then Bestbuy probably is your best bet if you want a 32GB Blue one. If you want White or Blue 64GB then the Google store or Amazon are good.  Motorola's website is a last resort."

And I see what you mean about getting the 32 GB at Best Buy - looks like the one in my area has store pickup for that one in 3-5 days, whereas it just says ""Unavailable"" for the 64 GB one (although I could still order it in store)."

nexus6,3di8rf,akellar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:18:35 2015 UTC,Yeah mine was a refurb. They did send me an unlocked phone instead of another AT&T one which was cool.
nexus6,3di8rf,dragonice81,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:03 2015 UTC,That's weird. I got a brand new phone in sealed retail packaging.

nexus6,3di8rf,bukithd,0,Fri Jul 17 02:38:15 2015 UTC,No it's not   Where are you getting your information? I spoke to the head of their service department and explicitly asked her to explain how they were going to replace my device.
nexus6,3di8rf,akellar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:39:50 2015 UTC,"They'll tell you what you want to hear. I've received two replacement devices from them, neither new."
nexus6,3di8rf,Serialtoon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:46:48 2015 UTC,I guess we'll see when I get mine then.
nexus6,3di8rf,Serialtoon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:50:45 2015 UTC,"I've done 2 RMAs in the past with Motorola. One for a moto360 and another for a nexus 6. Both times when I got the ""new"" device you claim here, the IMEI and serial number they have won't register to your account since they are recycled phones and accessories from repairs. Which means they are refurbished products that they didn't remove or clear from their system. So when you try and get warranty a second time, you are screwed. You no longer have warranty and need to provide a receipt for the original purchase. In your case you won't be able to since you aren't the original owner and the warranty is now void. Cross your fingers you get a ""good"" one, which is unlikely. Motorola became the staple company on how to do bad warranty service. They even beat OPO. :)"
nexus6,3di8rf,Serialtoon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"See, I've heard people with bad experiences and people with wonderful ones. How long ago were your RMAs? It seems like most of the reports from within the last 2 months have been good, from what I've seen!"
nexus6,3di8rf,bern825,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:51:56 2015 UTC,"RMA turn around time was quick, but its the fact that they are not new devices that im trying to point out."
nexus6,3di8rf,akellar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:54:34 2015 UTC,"Right, but did this happen several months ago, or recently?"
nexus6,3di8rf,bern825,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:07 2015 UTC,"June 22nd. ;-) Also i literally bought ANOTHER Nexus 6 from BestBuy in blue to see if that also has a bad screen. Returned it within the hour. Now i DO have a little, hopefully better, news. I noticed that ALL the phones ive had issues with have had stock Android 5.0 out of the box. Perhaps these are ""old"" models they are shipping out with said issue? I dont know but hopefully that is the case and i can finally snag a ""good"" one."
nexus6,3di8rf,altimax98,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:20:43 2015 UTC,Hmm...mine has been doing it with 5.1.1 for as long as I've had it :/
nexus6,3di8rf,altimax98,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:29:41 2015 UTC,Could you please explain how you knew they weren't new?
nexus6,3di8rf,altimax98,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:24:26 2015 UTC,They come in a completely different box with no accessories. Motorola is not wasting time opening new product to put them in a different box for warranty replacements. This would be a complete waste of productivity and money for them to do so. If they were going to send you a new device as a replacement you'd receive it in a new box like retail. There are ways to look at codes to see if it's refurbed and how many hours the device has been used as well.
nexus6,3di8rf,jableux,2,Thu Jul 16 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  I dropped my phone and cracked the screen on mine a couple months ago.  Went through Motorola's customer service via their chat.  The entire process was very easy.  I asked them if I was getting a refurbed unit and they said no but I was a bit skeptical.  My arrived in the standard retail box with everything a new unit would have, including another turbo charger.  I guess I was one of the lucky ones to get a new replacement."
nexus6,3di8rf,ImNaturallyConfused,2,Thu Jul 16 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"Just a friendly heads up.   1 - Take photos of the phone before you send it in  2 - Take photos of the box packaged up and taped properly  3 - Take a photo of your shipping label, tracking number and any other info UPS gives you  4 - Track the package every day, setup the email reminder from UPS once it is delivered and print (save to PDF) the signature on delivery (free service you access online)  5 - Call them 24 hours after delivery to ensure they received the device, use the tracking number and status with UPS as proof of delivery  6 - Call them every 72 hours until the hold is released on your account and you get confirmation they received the phone and everything is done and closed  Trust me, a lot of us have been through this and if you take a few extra minutes to follow these steps you will save yourself a crap ton of headache, especially when it is held on your debit card."
nexus6,3dhtt9,ferdinand14,3,Thu Jul 16 11:45:28 2015 UTC,The update will fail if the system partition is modified at all. You have to reflash the system partition in order to update OTA. Or while you're flashing you might as well just flash 5.1.1 while you're at it
nexus6,3dhtt9,teamhoun,3,Thu Jul 16 13:13:18 2015 UTC,I'm rooted if that matters.   It does.  OTAs won't install if you're rooted.

nexus6,3dfqcl,mashuto,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:15:14 2015 UTC,"I think ill stick with PA over euphoria/cm or even stock, because it has the features i want without the excessive bugs and bloat haha.  just to name a few features in PA that i enjoy:   No audio ducking in ringtones! (the random jump in volume, that is seen in stock) swipe on right side screen for quick settings, and middle for notifications Immersive mode (expanded desktop) App Ops (granular permissions)   plus all the other features i could ever want are on xposed, which is surprisingly stable for an alpha release."

I am running Pure Nexus right now and it definitely has the quick pulldown and app ops, but I am not sure about the other two.  I would check out a few roms, those are definitely not features exclusive to PA, and there are many newer roms under much more active development that dont have the problems you mention."

I dont need all that extra crap.  That said, the two roms I have used, chroma and pure nexus, I feel are actually aimed at staying pretty close to stock while adding on just enough extra features to be good.  Maybe your definition of what constitutes bloat are just different than mine. I would suggest checking out pure nexus. It has a great development community on xda and the aim of the rom is to give users a stock like experience, with those extra features that people want, without going overboard."
nexus6,3dfqcl,parkerlreed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"does chroma/pure nexus have a native expandable volume bar? i might check it out if so.  I like really subtle features if you cant tell lol, thanks for the advice!"
nexus6,3dfqcl,parkerlreed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:48:38 2015 UTC,"Yes for both of those roms (you are talking about being able to expand it to show ring, media, and alarm volume, right? And notification volume if you choose to separate it from ring).  Chroma also has some additions to silent mode. You can still use the priority and none modes, but it also allows you to volume down directly from ring to vibrate, to silent (or tap on the icon in the volume panel to switch between them). Pure Nexus doesnt have that yet, and I am not sure its getting it, but its pretty new on the scene and only had a few updates, with regular updates coming.  And yes, I like the subtle features too, keeping it close to stock, but just adding things that enhance the experience, rather than change it (like pie controls... meh).  Again, I dont know your definition of bloat, but these two seem pretty close to stock. And personally, I am liking Pure Nexus. Seems to have a few extra features than Chroma, but missing some too. But it runs smoother for me than chroma, and as I said, the community for it on xda is much more welcoming than chroma."

nexus6,3dfwy9,RenegadeUK,4,Thu Jul 16 18:02:32 2015 UTC,"hellsCore is certainly the hottest (not literally!) kernel in development right now attracting a lot of attention for the Mako variation (i think ZEN might be too power hungry for most users). in my opinion, his kernel and flar2's ElementalX are the best kernels that opt for hotplugging instead of mpdecision. i think my biggest personal gripe with hellsCore is the choice to use BFQ as a default option but there are also other scheduler options available.  like the case with most kernels, it's all about preference and personal tastes. i think the first choice you have to make is whether you want a kernel that uses mpdecision (default for the N6) or their own hotplugging solution. hands down, leanKernel is the best for the mpdecision since he uses a patched variation of it. once you decide on that, i'd say the next big thing to look out for would be governor and I/O scheduler choices. these two things are honestly the biggest difference maker in battery life since you'll dictate how you want things to run.  different governor choices here  different schedulers here  my personal favorite governor is Imoseyon's own ""InteractiveX."" and as you can see on the ratings, it's near best in all categories. regarding I/O schedulers, FIOPS and NOOP are my selections. obviously if you're looking to game more or if you want to squeeze the absolute most of your battery, then there are other choices available.  hope this helps a bit with your kernel choice :)"

nexus6,3dfwy9,teamhoun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:14:42 2015 UTC,they generally aren't as stable as the stock kernel   that's what i said in my very first paragraph.   and instability with apps is usually caused by the end user with pushing the limits of the kernel. i've never heard of apps not playing nice with a specific kernel before. most default configs on custom kernels are relatively close to stock kernel settings.

nexus6,3dfwy9,darienswag420,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"if i'm remembering correctly, the LED light requires a custom ROM to turn on. just so you know, the current implementation is just a solid color that doesn't blink. i believe that the only ROM that has a blinking light is BlissPop but that's because they use a wakelock to have it running consistently (wakelocks are usually bad business for battery life...). and yes, Chroma with many other ROMs have a working notification light. oh, if i'm not mistaken, i think francoKernel enables the LED light too.  wake gestures on the other hand are more or less delegated to custom kernels. however, Google did happen to implement a double-tap-to-wake gesture and someone on XDA has packaged it into an APK to use if you're rooted. however, many will agree that it's quite buggy and inconsistent (probably the reason why it never made the final build). usually this is the option people take if they want to stay stock ROM and stock kernel. so that being said, i find that custom kernels' wake gestures are much more polished."
nexus6,3dfwy9,darienswag420,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:59:11 2015 UTC,"Cheers dude, I think i'll take a look into Chroma and see if I can find a decent kernel for the wake gestures once my phone arrives. Really appreciate the help! :)"

Play services network location provider has been acting up a bit lately and keeping the phone awake all the time. Have you tried rebooting to see if that fixes it and allows your phone to sleep?

nexus6,3de01s,ImNaturallyConfused,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:51:28 2015 UTC,They're not weird at all. The phone being huge is something you get used to. The power and volume buttons are on the same side and they're easily within thumbs reach. It's properly laid out.

Just make sure you pay around $25 or so and not sub $20 because the sub $20 are usually fakes. These are probably the best budget earbuds you can buy and come with controls that are built to work with Android although I'm not sure if they can skip tracks.

nexus6,3de7eu,DerpleNerple2000,5,Wed Jul 15 16:04:32 2015 UTC,Kernels perform differently on everyones devices because no chip is made the same.

A) If it isn't filled with entires, then you didn't give root permissions to change it.

nexus6,3dawh6,Synikull,8,Tue Jul 14 22:57:51 2015 UTC,"Ya! I have worked for at&t for several years, both on the sales floor and now on the business side of things so I get to play extensively with every device we sell. Hands down I always recommend the nexus 6 to people as long as they are willing to go for a larger phone. The iPhone 6plus to me looks huge and unweildy. But the nexus 6 with the curved back and slim bezels fit so perfectly in my hand. Samsung does make excellent hardware, but no matter how much r/android circlejerks about the s6 now, touchwiz is bloated and looks bad. In my opinion it looks cartoony. And because of carriers (if you are in the u.s.) you may never see more than one or two updates. Without the carriers Samsung still has a history of taking its sweet time time with rolling out updates. And the biggest thing for me, Samsung devices slow down incredibly over time. To the point that they become unusable. The nexus 6 has yet to slow down on me.   All that and then add in the rooting and ROM flashing community and the nexus 6 will stay up to date for some time. If you have never flashed a ROM before nexus devices make it ridiculously easy, and can be a lot of fun tbh.   Hands down I have no complaints on the nexus 6. It is a gorgeous phone, the camera is fantastic no matter what reviewers may say, and it is fast and powerful. There is not another phone on the market I would even consider right now.   Hope that helps!!"

nexus6,3dc1vf,syransea,4,Wed Jul 15 02:35:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the system partition was corrupted after having unlocked the bootloader, and then the bootloader was subsequently relocked.  It's a catch 22 situation: you need to be able to boot into the OS and toggle ""Enable OEM unlock"" in developer options to use the fastboot command, and you need the fastboot command to fix the system partition to boot the OS.  Looks like you'll need to send the device in for warranty repairs."
nexus6,3dc1vf,rayw_reddit,3,Wed Jul 15 03:10:01 2015 UTC,I was under the impression its almost impossible to brick a Nexus because they're so developer friendly. Id check and ask XDA. Wishing you the best of luck!  As for warranty...that may be complicated  Edit :ignore that idk I'm confused..lol
nexus6,3dc1vf,ImNaturallyConfused,3,Wed Jul 15 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"It's really dumb but for security purposes I assume, you can't unlock the bootloader unless you tick ""allow device to be oem unlocked"" in developer options.

nexus6,3dbgi6,inconceeeivable,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:58:45 2015 UTC,I have one. The boot tones can be removed via root. The couple AT&T apps can be removed without root. It runs the stock firmware but there's a small hidden partition that restores these things on a reflash. Very minor.

Thus reading mostly bad experiences people have had with a device is much more common.  With that said, I don't know you enough to ""sell"" you the N6. I believe if you read some reviews or watch a few videos, you have a pretty good idea of a smartphone. It's 2015 ; internet is full of those just a search away.  Don't get me wrong, places like Reddit are here to help people, but wouldn't it be more efficient of you had some specific questions about which aspect of the device you'd want some feedback about?

What makes it good enough to stick with? What features keep you on this phone instead of jumping ship?"
nexus6,3dbc7l,thegrau,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:10:28 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll bite 😉  1/ the big screen : I've always liked big smartphones for media consuming (even had the first Galaxy Tab as a phone at some point), but always struggled with OEM software. I never thought a Nexus would come out as a phablet... Dream come true.  2/ stock Android : not only have I enjoyed using stock Android since the beginning (G1), every time I've found myself using a ""skinned"" smartphone, I've been trying to remove whatever the manufacturer had been adding after a while (including UI). Not only do I find some additions redundant or useless, I usually prefer an alternative that was available on the Store, making said feature unnecessary. On top of that, I always bumped on some app that wouldn't perform well on said OEM version or found myself frustrated not having access to a new Android feature, waiting for months for an update.  3/ updates : like I said, having quick access to updates is great as I love to test new features.  4/ performances : Nexii have never been the most powerful phones, nor have they had the best cameras or battery life. But for my uses, they always performed very well and aged better. The Nexus 6 changes that a bit by being quite powerful (on release it was top-notch) and having a great camera (there's room left for improvement, but it's quite above average).  5/ front-facing stereo speakers: that is a game changer and I really hope I won't have to go back from it on my next device.  6/ ease of tweaking : being a Nexus, the phone is so easy to root and flash, it allows for faster and simpler operations toward better versatility. It's impossible to brick as long as you don't mess with changing the bootloader since you can always flash a factory image and there's a very active community.  7/ QI charging : another feature I couldn't live without.  There are tons of other specific features and possibilities that I could mention, but here are the main things that come to mind."
nexus6,3dbc7l,altimax98,2,Wed Jul 15 01:20:48 2015 UTC,"Here is the deal for me. Here is my device history (recent) and maybe you will agree, maybe not.   My advice is to stay far far away from the Note 4. That thing was a beast on 4.4 with 1 single flaw. The multitasking was way too slow. It was laggy as heck opening that window. Otherwise (if you can stand TouchWiz) the device was fantastic. Amazing screen, near perfect camera and call quality. It was great.... Then came the mess that is Lollipop. Sure 5.1 may fix it, but that device became a steaming pile after it. Lags everywhere, bad battery, everything was just awful.  I went to an S6 afterwards and it was good, but the lags came back and it was annoying so I dropped it.   I now have the Nexus 6 (which incidentally I traded for the Note 4 after 14 days lol) and I am happy again. I prefer stock Android for its look and being on the cutting edge has its pros. It has cons, but honestly Nexus 6 5.0 > Note 4 5.0. The hardware hardly holds a candle to the Note though. The camera (while good) isnt the quality of the Note 4, the screen isnt close. The call quality is good, but kinda quiet. The list goes on and on. Its in pros column though the rounded back makes the larger device more ergonomic, the front speakers are loud as balls and the battery is pretty decent.   The Nexus 6 is a great device and probably one of the best ive owned. I swap phones like underwear, but the last phone I had for 20 months was the Galaxy Nexus, actually had 2 of them a CDMA and a GSM model. That is wildly thought of as the worst Nexus to date, but I had it the longest, why? The same reason I have the Nexus 6. Spec to spec, feature to feature it is pale in comparison to the Note 4 or LG G4, but when you add all the parts together it is a very pleasing device to own."

nexus6,3d7u9c,FrostDPr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:48:37 2015 UTC,"You won't lose root, but it does wipe your data relocking it.  I advise against doing that though.  If you get into a bootloop and don't have a unlocked bootloader, unlockable bootloader and/or a custom recovery you will have an unrecoverable brick.  This is something that has happened to a few people already.  Which depending on what you are doing with root, this is definitely possible.  Another big downside, you will never be able to take OTAs again either unless you unlock the bootloader again.  Root will make it so the OTAs fail to install, so you will have to manually flash them.  Which will require you to have an unlocked bootloader or custom recovery.  Which will require you to unlock and wipe the device again for the update."

nexus6,3d6x21,Krojack76,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:01:21 2015 UTC,My N6 from the Google Play store didn't come with a SIM.  I also read that people say they can just take the SIM from their old verizon phone and put it in the N6 and it works (assuming it's a micro SIM) but Verizon said that doesn't work and they need to assign the SIM to my new phone.  I went in to a store and they gave me a SIM and it took maybe 20 minutes for them to get it to to work.  Part of me calls BS on Verizon's story but I didn't bother trying my old one.  I didn't want to buy a trimmer.  You can also buy a SIM Trimmer off Amazon which is what several people on XDA said they did.
nexus6,3d6x21,ImNaturallyConfused,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:04:36 2015 UTC,It's a Verizon branded one so it definitely comes with one pre installed. I also bought it from Costco and it did.

nexus6,3d79s6,bogus83,4,Tue Jul 14 02:19:42 2015 UTC,"If you're really seeing a 25% battery drain in 22 minutes and the temperatures you posted, that's indicative of a serious hardware malfunction, not software."
nexus6,3d79s6,bogus83,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:53:26 2015 UTC,"I initially was thinking that, but the drain is only when the screen is on. It wasn't even heavy apps- Evernote to type the message and Sync for Reddit to post. I guess my next question then would be that if this were hypothetically some sort of hardware issue, how would I replicate this in a way such that my carrier (AT&T) would replace it under warranty?"
nexus6,3d79s6,bogus83,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:07:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what they'd need as proof.  They may have some way of running a diagnostic test at one of the retail stores, or if you find a sales rep with a bit of patience you could demonstrate the 1%-per-minute battery drain, or the phone powering off at 49C (which should be easy to reach while playing any kind of full-screen 3d game).  Would you be willing to run a test for comparison's sake?  I'm using CPU Monitor to record temperature and Antutu Benchmark to stress test my phone.  I got a score of 52,244 on the benchmark and consumed 2% battery during the test with a maximum temperature of 143F [http://i.imgur.com/EXRWS3w.png http://i.imgur.com/cltvYC0.png].  And that's with a CPU overclock (using ElementalX kernel).  I'm curious what your results would be- it sounds like your phone would power off due to heat before completing the benchmark, and if it didn't, the score would be significantly lower.  You could probably use either of those results to show an AT&T rep that the phone isn't functioning correctly."
nexus6,3d79s6,bogus83,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:40:29 2015 UTC,"So again, thanks for being an awesome person and spending your time helping me out. So I did run a few tests and initially I got 36416 which is lower than a Nexus 5 then I got 50884 and 50536. All of these tests were with the cpu set to performance and nothing running (after a reboot). The lower scoring one was when the phone was at 37C initially then around 39C at the end and took 5%/7 minutes. The other two normal scores took only a couple minutes and around 2% while running the temps up to 39C. So I still can't believe you got 143F! I have yet to even see any device above 120F/39C. Tomorrow I'll try to run it up as hot as I can to get it to shut off, but I'm expecting the same results. Unfortunately they're the same as yours minus the temps.  Edit: link"
nexus6,3d79s6,bogus83,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:32:35 2015 UTC,"No problem- thanks for the gold!  One thing I noticed from those pictures is that the chart is showing the battery temperature, not the CPU temperature.  On my phone the battery temperature is pretty consistently 10-15C lower than the CPU, which could explain the temp difference between our two devices.  Most apps show the wrong CPU temperature (CPU Temp, Cooler Master, etc), the only ones that I've found that show both battery and CPU with individual values are the ElementalX kernel app and CPU Monitor Lite (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigbro.ProcessProfiler&hl=en).    The latter app is free and records both CPU/battery temp over an up to 4 minute period.  I'd use that app to monitor your phone while running the benchmark.  You can switch to the monitor in the middle of the benchmark (I'd do it during the 3d graphics test) and see the real-time temperatures.  I have a hunch that you're seeing battery temps idling around 115F, not the CPU, and it should really be more like 82F.  And that goes back to the original theory of something overheating and killing battery life and performance.    For reference, here's the data for my battery for the past almost 24-hours:  https://i.imgur.com/GwZAHlR.png  I didn't use the phone all that much during the second half of the day, but you can see the highest battery temperature was right around 100F and I've only gone through 15% capacity all day.    Hopefully that'll help you narrow things down a bit."
nexus6,3d79s6,bogus83,2,Wed Jul 15 02:12:52 2015 UTC,"as soon as I turn the screen on, the phone is instantly at 100° and if I am actually using the phone, its at 115°   What you're describing is not normal.  Are you talking about Celsius or Fahrenheit?  Because my N6 idles at 36C (98.6F), and it definitely does not disable any cores at 115F (46C).  It only just barely breaks 70C while running a benchmark app.    But if you're talking about 115C (239F) that's just completely absurd and you need to RMA your phone immediately.  Extreme overheating would account for the extreme battery drain (again, 25% in 22 minutes is completely absurd), performance issues, and instability."
nexus6,3d79s6,cawpin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's part of the throttling process to preserve the phone. At around 120° the phone shuts off which is very typical. I'd know because I've seen it happen quite a few times. Dude, definitely Fahrenheit. 115°C would melt my hand as well as probably most of the internal components!"
nexus6,3d79s6,crowntheking,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:51:14 2015 UTC,"LOL, that's why I was asking... that would be bonkers.  I still think there's some kind of hardware failure going on.  For me, throttling doesn't kick on until 70C, and I've never had the phone power off due to heat- even when playing games while charging (although it does get noticeably warm when I do that)."
nexus6,3d79s6,ImNaturallyConfused,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:59:38 2015 UTC,"Really? Can anyone else confirm this? Literally everytime I get my phone to 115° it shuts off the other 2 cores immediately and the phone is incredibly slow (and pretty hot). Screenshots incoming.....  Edit: so I couldn't think of a good way to show the differences, but obviously since the N6 processor is a 2.6ghz,normally each core would be up to that speed.  Here's a screenshot showing all them at 1.0ghz which is different from what I said because it's not shutting off the two cores right now (maybe that's at a higher temp?) but rather it's just slowing down the speed. All I had to do to get to 116°F (when this was taken) was watch a 10 minute 1080p video on YouTube."
nexus6,3d79s6,Zazie_Lavender,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:10:36 2015 UTC,"Ah, now I see.  Take a look at my phone at idle:  https://i.imgur.com/tKcmNds.png  Just because it's a quad-core that runs at 2.6 doesn't mean all four cores continuously operate at 2.6.  The phone reduces two of the cores to their lowest possible clock speed when they aren't being used, and ramps up the clock speed of the active cores as needed for the task at hand.  See how the 42C in the top-right corner is green?  That's because it's a normal operating temperature.  50-69 is yellow, and 70C is red because that's when throttling begins.    Your phone is doing what it's supposed to, and now I'm fairly certain Skripka was on the right track.  There have been instances of Google Play Services running wild and killing battery life, that may be what's happening here.  If you've been dirty flashing (even back to stock), I would do a 100% clean wipe, start with the factory image, and go from there."

With my HTC Hero and Evo 4G, I was constantly flashing to keep the most current version of Android and get the ""vanilla"" experience.  After moving to a Nexus 4, I continued to do a lot of flashing of custom ROMs; but when I moved to a Nexus 5, I simply unlocked the bootloader and rooted it; due to my satisfaction with the vanilla android experience.  With my N6, I've gone a step further by not even unlocking or rooting the device in the 8mo I've had it.   Since I don't flash, I don't really miss Titanium Backup's features.  I have enough storage even on my paltry 32GB version without needing to remove any OEM stuff.  Plus, since everything is locked up, I get Netflix at 5800kbps/1080p without any fuss/fiddling.  On the flipside: (i) I do miss the granularity of Better Battery Stats; (ii) not being able to tether for free (on Sprint) costs me an extra $20/mo; and (iii) it would have been nice to easily backup and flash over to the M dev preview.  I also echo the other posts here by /u/holic_2 and /u/thegrau as it would be nice to enable the LED and change the DPI settings; but that just hasn't been a necessity for me.

The only real downside I'd say is that some places may not fix your device for you if something goes wrong (Google Play, Motorola, etc) and warranties get voided.

nexus6,3d5g2z,Xramz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:03:59 2015 UTC,Yes the screen crack would most likely be an issue as warranty does not cover accidental damage. You can try and contact Motorola I heard they replace phones with broken screens for $175.

You can't really go wrong with either one, but I find the few extra features in CM handy.  I think it's really up to how you use the phone, most roms these days are pretty stable unless the developer accidentally messes something up (which they usually fix fairly quickly).

I want the phone to work as intended and work well, without having issues A. when I need it to perform such as when I'm out and about or B. during general use.

nexus6,3cwony,cdegallo,8,Sat Jul 11 12:38:04 2015 UTC,You could try blacklisting Mobileiron in SuperSU. It may or may not work depending on how it checks for root access.  There's also an xposed module that does this more reliably but I've never used it.  Personally I would just not root a work phone. You probably signed an AUP that included a provision against making unauthorized changes.

nexus6,3cwony,Dapado,3,Sat Jul 18 14:52:59 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation recently and found a good alternative if all you need is Exchange/ActiveSync support. My employer uses Maas360 MDM to detect root, and they require that you install it if you want to sync with the organization's Exchange server.  I wasn't willing to give up root, but I also didn't want to risk getting caught using RootCloak. Instead, I use this app, which just checks OWA every 30 minutes and doesn't store any messages locally.  This isn't a true solution and might not help your situation, but I figured I would let you know just in case. If you do use that app, go into the settings and change the font to the smaller option. It's an ugly app, but that helps somewhat."

Was downtown last Monday, trying to figure out where I was, holding my phone in my hand with my headphones in. Wire gets caught and phone flies out of my hands, bouncing twice on the concrete. Needless to say, my screen had spiderweb cracks all over and even touching it with my fingers left specs and shards of gorilla glass."

If anyone knows of an app that allows you to answer a call with the disconnected number sound please let me know.  This is the one thing I think might be able to fool their automated calling systems but I can't find a way to automate it.  I've kept the sound open in VLC on my desktop before when I was in the office most of the day but rarely managed to get a call while I was at my desk and not busy.  I just want a third button on the phone app to ""Send Disconnected"" or something as close to that as possible.

nexus6,3cuyds,Heliumx,2,Sat Jul 11 03:33:24 2015 UTC,Thanks guys. I was specifically referring to flashing with twrp. NRT doesn't work for me. I just used adb commands to flash it.
nexus6,3cuyds,OCTO13ER,4,Sat Jul 11 13:25:53 2015 UTC,"Hello OP!  Here's how I got my Nexus 6 to work with M; I downloaded this great tool called a Nexus Root Tool Kit (http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/development/toolkit-wugs-nexus-root-toolkit-v1-9-8-t2947452).  Basically this tool takes over the tedious tasks of maintaining / backing up / restoring / flashing ROM's / factory restoring (etc) on your Nexus 6.  It makes it a seemless process.  Go ahead and download the Android M dev preview, and simply flash the image on your phone with the program (like you're starting new, wipe needed).  Hope this helps!"
nexus6,3cuyds,IMightBeDaWalrus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:21:52 2015 UTC,"NRT merely automates the process of flashing ROM images through fastboot, whereas OP is looking for a way to flash the M Preview through a custom recovery via a zip file. The latter method is typically far more convenient than the former, simply because it does not require a computer once the recovery is installed on the phone.   OP, the thread linked in the other comment is kept up to date with flashable zips of every N6 stock ROM build as well as the bootloader and radio, including the M Preview images. Quite an excellent resource. I've used it for the last couple Lollipop images as well as the M Preview 1 bootloader/radio without issue."

You flash a zip file then install the apk once you reboot.  The best part is you don't have to wipe your phone.  I used to do a lot ROM flashing on all my old phones.  It is a pain in the ass.  Non-stock roms always have some kind of issue.  Won't send MMS, camera is buggy, screen tearing.  There was always something, and every time you wanted to try a new ROM you had to wipe everything and do a nandroid backup.  It takes forever.  Xposed is so much easier.

You flash the first file from your recovery,   allow unknown sources in your security settings then run the apk file.  Just keep the uninstaller zip on your SD card.

nexus6,3ctw07,blindfusion,0,Sat Jul 11 08:33:07 2015 UTC,"I'd wait for the Moto 360 V2.   I'd personally take the OP2 over the Nexus 6 if the 810 preforms right and doesn't overheat in it. Plus the battery will be larger and the OPO was better for me at 3100mAh.   Stock camera will always suck. Some apps can help but you have to manually set exposure, iso, etc."

nexus6,3cwtk1,altimax98,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"For me having both the app & fb msngr (which is still less useful than it was a year ago) was causing me about 8-12% battery life for things that I use rarely.  On top of that, I think Facebook's mobile development team must push out an update every day or two, which isn't such a big deal as much as its annoying.  And thirdly, navigating to Facebook.com, logging in @ saving the link to my home screen actually provides a faster, more functional (msgs included without changing apps/interface) than either of the apps themselves.  And finally I think Facebook messenger is obnoxious & both have a habit of requesting every permission available, which isn't necessary and allows for repeat wakelocks that I don't need, further killing the battery."

nexus6,3cp1wh,awaitforitb,4,Thu Jul 9 23:45:29 2015 UTC,I have both phones and the battery life is definitely better on the N6.
nexus6,3cp1wh,MistaClyde,2,Fri Jul 10 02:02:34 2015 UTC,The only thing stopping me is the camera. I know s6 is great but it's nexus 6 really bad comparatively?
nexus6,3cp1wh,awaitforitb,2,Fri Jul 10 02:19:23 2015 UTC,"This might not be a popular opinion, but seriously... it's a cell phone camera.  It works basically as well as every other modern cell phone camera for casual ""point and shoot"" photography.  You can nitpick about tiny details and low light shooting and HDR and whatnot, but at the end of the day, the S6 camera is a 3.0/10, the iPhone camera is a 3.1/10, the N6 is a 2.9/10, and any DSLR you can buy new or used from the past 5 years is going to be at least a 6/10.    If you really want to take high quality pictures, then spend $300 for a used DSLR and a kit lens.  If you want an amazing cell phone with a great screen, fantastic software support and good battery life, which is perfectly capable of ""lifestyle and social networking photography"" then get an N6.  I honestly don't understand why people put so much emphasis on pictures which are going to get compressed to hell by facebook and snapchat anyway."
nexus6,3cp1wh,socsa,3,Fri Jul 10 18:42:17 2015 UTC,"Yes to be totally honest the camera on the N6 is shit compared to the S6 and that's why I use my S6 90% of the time if not more.  When I say shit... If the S6 is a 10/10 the N6 is a 5/10 at best. Maybe worse.  If you have time to focus and everything is still the N6 is fine but for ""real life"" it doesn't stand a chance. The front facing is particularly terrible compared to the S6."
nexus6,3cp1wh,MistaClyde,9,Fri Jul 10 02:21:19 2015 UTC,"You must have a defective unit. Look at the /r/nexus6 subreddit, people can't stop talking about the camera and sharing pictures.

nexus6,3cp1wh,DryZebra,3,Fri Jul 10 02:57:53 2015 UTC,"You sure we're using the same phone? If the S6 is a 10/10 I'd give the N6 an 8/10. A 5/10 would be something that was beaten by HALF the smartphone cameras out there, like...the Galaxy S3 or a Moto G.  I do agree that the front-facing is pretty terrible though."
nexus6,3cp1wh,Dakar-A,5,Fri Jul 10 03:06:52 2015 UTC,Not sure who's downvoting you. I also have both phones and the s6 camera is far superior.  If the s6 is a 10 I'd put the nexus at 6.5ish
nexus6,3cp1wh,chipandpeach,2,Fri Jul 10 04:07:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I actually don't mind the n6 as a casual point & shooter... But my Canada day fireworks looked like shit.  Tried tweaking the exposure and using HDR+ but still looked like crap compared to my sister's S6.
nexus6,3cp1wh,sybau,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:59:08 2015 UTC,I took some great photos with the Nexus 5 when everyone said it was the worst camera ever.

nexus6,3cp1wh,casbar,2,Thu Jul 9 19:58:05 2015 UTC,I've had my phone since Nov of last year. The only physical problem I had was the accelerometer MEMS got stuck once and required a couple of harder smacks against a soft surface to loosen it up. This kind of problem happens on any kind of phone with an orientation sensor (including one of my iPhones).
nexus6,3cp1wh,ElGuano,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:24:13 2015 UTC,Not always.  I have problems with wifi because my router sucks.  And I have problems with LTE because the coverage sucks around here.

nexus6,3cp1wh,-tink,2,Thu Jul 9 19:31:02 2015 UTC,"Downvoting a complaint is petty, but complaints that have no other substance but complaint add nothing to any discussion, and based on reddiquite are downvote-worthy. /u/casbar puts nothing in their comment except that it is 'letting me down' and that it is sliding down their 'personal best list' without informing why it is doing so, and what makes their personal best list."

The problem here isn't that I don't like people who like Active Display but rather that these people like to shoot down any OPs who wanted to go unstock by saying stuff like ""Why would you want to do all that stuff and lose out on active display, the BEST thing in the world??!"" and any comments trying to defend OP would be down voted too no matter how sincere.  I hate that sub. Sorry."

I didn't have that issue on M but it is still a Dev preview and has some strange bugs. What I would do is make sure it is rooted and you can delete the battery config file(there is an app but I can't remember the name). If you don't want to do that or you are not rooted. Discharge it completely and charge it via USB on your computer. The slower charge will act as a trickle charger and give a ""healthier"" charge."

nexus6,3cspku,sybau,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:07:31 2015 UTC,I'd do a full reset/wipe in recovery.  First time I ran M1 it was really buggy and my battery died quickly (the phone also seemed to heat up faster and hotter han normal).  I did a clean wipe/factory reset and it worked great after that.  Using M2 preview now with no issues at all.

nexus6,3cqv8u,guma822,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:24:39 2015 UTC,"Just bought it on Sunday so haven't had much experience - compared to the Nexus 5, it is a lot bigger.  The Nexus 6 still fits in all of my jeans / shorts pockets (even some somewhat skinny jeans). Width and thickness are definitely fine for my pockets, height means that it comes quite close to the top of my pockets. I've even been cycling and whilst I was a bit worried at first it was pretty secure and didn't feel much different to my Nexus 5 (although the active display kept turning on in my pocket, but that can be turned off).  Holding the device in the hand is pretty nice, the shape of it means that its fairly easy to grip, although I did find myself steadying it with my other hand occasionally when stretching to the top corner. What you immediately notice is how wide it is, but after about 15 minutes of use you get used to it.  If you have access to a physical store that has one, defiantly take a look at it - I even asked the sales assistant if I could try it out in my pockets too :P If not its more or less the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus (might have an Apple store near you) and is slightly larger (but thinner) than the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.  The screen is very nice, and having a large screen does make browsing the web and watching videos a lot nice. It has meant that I have been traveling without my tablet more which is a bonus and compensates for its size nicely :)  I'm still on the lookout for a car dock for it - I've only just bought it and it wasn't my first priority. (If anyone else has any good car docks that stick to windscreens and fit a Nexus 6 feel free to post a link or name).  TL;DR It is comical compared to my friend's iPhone 5, but is still nice and easy to use.  If you have any other questions I'll be more than happy to do my best to answer them :)"

It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but I'd have preferred a 5 inch device. I settled for the larger because I like the Nexus philosophy of openness.  If I had to choose today, I'd wait until October for the smaller form factor. That is, unless you're on Verizon like me, where it will be almost a year until you can get the phone.

This phone took some getting used to, but dear god do I love it for the convenience of the size for vids and browsing. It is just a pleasure to use. One handing it can be cumbersome. I have big hands and can only just manage a few one handed manuevers, but its just not a hassle at all if you 2 hand. Which you just don't have to do with smaller phones but.. Seriously, it has zero impact on 95% of activities and usage.  If you use a low profile case, no problem getting it out of pants, etc. I have two: one is a bigger rubber guy with intense raised bevel and the other is a low profile spigen. The big rubber guy can be difficult to get out of pocket. But I have a moto 360 and that takes care of 80% of the reasons I pull my phone out in most normal situations.  End story: Nexus 6 is probably going to be my phone long after the next gen comes out bc they won't make the next one so large, but this phone is badass, useful, and beautiful."
nexus6,3cqv8u,jonginator,0,Sun Jul 12 16:33:57 2015 UTC,The camera and size are my only complaints.   Not sure why I got down voted. Compared to my S6 the camera on the N6 is bad...

I choose software because I prefer stock Android to any skinned android.   There are people exaggerating about the capabilities of the Nexus 6 camera, though. It is as if the pictures that it takes are on par with the pictures taken on the Nexus 4, which they are not. If we had to put on a scale the Nexus 6 camera from 1 to 10 (10 being s6 picture quality), the Nexus 6 could easily earn an 8 or 9."

nexus6,3cqwsg,-Gabe-,2,Fri Jul 10 21:11:38 2015 UTC,Yes I realize but flash just adds to it. As for the limit that varies from chip to chip its usually very high but just like with any drive can fail at any time. So flashing across that many sectors a lot will definitely lessen the life.

Autofocus also takes ages but I really like the quality. Video is also great and it is 4k capable.

nexus6,3cpzzw,Jamesinatr,0,Sat Jul 11 23:26:33 2015 UTC,"Coming from an iPhone 6.. The nexus 6's camera is quite horrible.  I don't really care about picture quality as much as the experience of snapping a photo.  Google's Camera app is okay.. For some reason, the auto focus really suffers when you try launch the camera from an app to quickly snap/send a photo (e.g. sending a photo from Telegram or WhatsApp)  I've actually set my camera to shoot as 5MP.. Not sure if it makes an actual difference speed wise, but it feels more reliable.  Picture taking on the iPhone is very seamless. Its fast.. It's more than good enough, and it just works.

nexus6,3cr7ls,anuragvivek93,3,Fri Jul 10 03:07:40 2015 UTC,"Here's how I applied mine (Black Leather front and back):  Let me start with the front, since the back is a little more complex. I took the skin off of the 3m paper, and re attached it so that the TOP speaker grill, camera, and sensor ports were exposed. For alignment, I made sure that the speaker grill was straight along the top and bottom edges, then used the camera as reference, and applied only that top area. This next trick is a little unconventional, but for the screen, I made my screen stay on, so light would shine through the skin, and made sure that the thin edge pieces didnt cover any part of the screen. I then aligned the bottom speaker grill, and finished that application. One thing to note is, i actually streched the skin just a tiny bit, to align with the bottom, and screen edge. Then i heated the edges with a hair dryer like dbrand says to do in their video.  Now onto the back. I used three points of alignment for this part. #1 is the microphone/bottom edge. If that little pinhole is aligned with the skin, the rest will be a lot easier. #2 was the camera. I made sure that the camera port was aligned, as well as the top edge. Now, this is a little hard to explain, but i aligned these two areas before even considering the letters. if the ""dip"" in the metal edge is aligned with the skin, and the skin doesnt touch the metal, then it should align, however, after doing this, the skin was puckering on the sides (more on this in a minute). Now, the letters. I had the full word exposed, no batwing. I used mainly the e and the u to align those little pieces, then once the e and u were situated, I ""forced"" the other letters into place, making sure that the silver on the phone was not covered up, at all. Now that all of the main areas are aligned, I grabbed some paper towel, and wadded it up (im serious) and used that wad to apply even pressure over the entire skin, even the puckers. These puckers actually worked themselves out, and the sides were aligned well.   I hope this helps. This skin that i talked about was my first skin, but it went well. Just take your time, and if its not aligned right, peel it back, but BE CAREFUL!   TL:DR: Use the main landmarks of the phone's design to help you align the skin properly, and be cautious around the letters."

nexus6,3cod5k,graesen,2,Fri Jul 10 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"The remotes in headphones works by sending signals similar to morse code through the headphone jack to the phone in analog form. There's nothing that intelligent about it. Where I'm going with this is that if you get a poor connection somewhere, it could make the phone think it's receiving one of these signals because connection might drop and re-connect quickly. Also with the audio sounding off, this is another clue that you're getting poor connection.  If you tried the headphones in another device, then either the headphone jack is wearing out OR something is preventing the jack from connecting all of the way. Even if you have a little lint or dirt in the jack, it can keep the connection from going in all of the way. And another set of headphones' jack might be ever so slightly smaller or larger than the next that may or may not be affected by any dirt in the jack. The case you use might also have a cutout too small to make the best connection.   I could be wrong entirely, though. The Crapple Buds might just be on their way out, the Nexus might be showing signs of hardware failure. I lean more toward buying a decent pair of headphones/buds. If the buttons work from the Apple buds, then you know other ""designed for Apple"" buds' remote will work because they work the same way.

nexus6,3cod5k,itsJonQ,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:34:34 2015 UTC,The buttons never worked - and I never wanted them to. The problem is that when the headphones are plugged in the phone is reading phantom inputs resulting in the volume control going haywire and audio distortion. This has never happened before despite using my phone from launch with this style of headphones and it only randomly started occurring yesterday. I have changed nothing on my end for this to start happening.

nexus6,3ck19v,crimzonphox,3,Wed Jul 8 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"A little bit of explanation.  I was having a backup camera installed into my car, and replaced the stereo head unit to something with a screen so that I could see the backup camera on that screen, rather than adding another one.  While I had the front panel off around the stereo, I had a small hole drilled by the 12V charging port, and a small hole where my phone mount lives.  I ran a USB cable through here, and just connected it up to the PowerBot Qi charging puck.  The GoXT phone mount for extra wide phones holds the Nexus6 perfectly with or without a case.  What I did by way of modification was that I scrapped off (rather poorly) all of the foam that is designed to cushion the back of the phone, and I took the rubber rings off of the PowerBox puck to make it as slim as possible.  Double sided adhesive holds the puck in place, after a few tests to make sure that it was placed well enough to charge both my Nexus6 and my wife's Nexus5.  Now, when I get into the car, all I need to do is place my phone, click the grips shut, and the phone charges wirelessly, and connects to the stereo wirelessly through Bluetooth for phone and media audio.  The only thing I cannot do is rotate the phone sideways for navigation or video; but that has never been an issue for me, as I don't watch video on it in the car, and I navigation works just fine in portrait mode.  I'm happy to ask any questions you guys might have about how I did this, or why I made certain decisions."

nexus6,3cohue,ImNaturallyConfused,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"Doesn't necessarily mean your service is dropping. Just means your signal quality is poor. The poorer service signal strength you have means the phone is going to be using more processor to search for better signal. It's the same as leaving wifi or location on, your phones going to be trying to find the best possible connections which uses more battery.    When I'm at work, i get pretty poor service, phone still works and makes calls/texts fine. Has LTE and stuff. My battery at work takes a hit. But on my days off at my house where I get good service.

You can, of course, flash images before the OTA pushes to VZW. That's what I've done with every build."
nexus6,3ckjvo,pntless,2,Thu Jul 9 01:38:27 2015 UTC,Ok great. I probably could have just bought one from my local verizon store. Is there any carrier apps or bloat?

They didn't when I activated, but that was long before VZW officially got the device. There's also VZWAPN 12.0, but that is directly baked into the Google Factory Images (so it is there regardless of your carrier) and isn't user facing.  Oh, and of course the carriers, including VZW, only have the 32GB version. You can't buy the 64GB version from them."

nexus6,3ckjvo,rmm989,2,Thu Jul 9 01:30:10 2015 UTC,Because there is no way for the carrier to know you unlocked the bootloader and/or are rooted. You'll still receive OTA's you just can't apply them. I believe the OTA is the same as every other carriers though so you can still apply it from the factory image (the Z build).
nexus6,3ckjvo,akellar,2,Wed Jul 8 17:38:01 2015 UTC,So I can't install the update that was automatically downloaded to my phone?
nexus6,3ckjvo,pntless,2,Thu Jul 9 00:17:40 2015 UTC,"Correct. Lollipop will not allow you to apply an OTA if you have modified the /system partition in any way. You will have to download the factory image and flash it yourself. To do so without losing data, follow these directions...  Only do these things if you are familiar with ADB/Fastboot   Make a backup of your phone in it's current state Completely unzip the factory image, un-gzip, un-tar, and un-zip the zip file that shows up in the folder with flash-all.bat. Do NOT run the flash-all.bat or you will lose all your data.   Note: If you already have the latest TWRP installled, or prefer to use a different recovery, you can feel free to skip that step. However you will need to have some sort of custom recovery installed so you can re-root.  Reboot in to the bootloader and enter the following:   fastboot flash bootloader bootloader-version.img fastboot flash radio radio-version.img fastboot reboot-bootloader fastboot flash recovery twrp-version-shamu.img fastboot flash boot unencrypted-up-to-date-kernel-of-choice.img (may just use included boot.img if you are encrypted) fastboot flash system system.img fastboot reboot-bootloader   Use the volume buttons to reboot in to recovery.

nexus6,3ckjvo,pntless,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:40:15 2015 UTC,Ok some of that stuff is extremely technical. What happens if I do a factory reset on my device? Will that unroot it? Do I have to unroot to update to 5.1.1 if I'm on 5.1 already? What is the easiest and safest thing to do?
nexus6,3ckjvo,NostradamAssHat,2,Thu Jul 9 19:32:00 2015 UTC,"A factory reset will not unroot, as the su binary (the file that escalates your priveleges) is on the /system partition, which a factory reset does not touch. If you have modified /system in any way, such as rooting, then you cannot use an OTA. The only way to restore /system to stock is by flashing a factory image.  The directions I detailed in that post will allow you to update without losing your data but do require that you have adb/fastboot executables and some knowledge of the stuff that is happening.   As long as you have adb & fastboot either in the same directory as the *.img's or linked as a system variable (just putting those .exe's in the same folder is the easier of the two) then following those step by step will allow you to update and re-root. The first time is intimidating, but it really isn't hard to do. I pasted those directions from a note that I keep to remind myself each time I do it. The entire process takes maybe 5 minutes (other than waiting for the ""Optimizing Android..."" boot process after the update  Here is a slightly more detailed set of directions that is specific to lmy47z. Remember, this is the slightly more complicated set of directions that will keep your data and re-root.     Make a backup of your phone in it's current state so that you may recover if something goes wrong, this requires that you currently have a custom recovery. If you don't, then skip to next step. If you don't have adb/fastboot then http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2588979  Download the factory image, LMY47Z is at https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/shamu-lmy47z-factory-33951732.tgz Use 7zip or similar to un-gzip, this will leave you with shamu-lmy47z-factory-33951732.tar Use 7zip to unarchive again, this will leave you with a folder ""shamu-lmy47z"" Open that directory, and unzip the contents of ""image-shamu-lmy47z.zip""  into it, you should now have these files in that folder:  http://i.imgur.com/oG53wd6.png Do NOT run the flash-all.bat or you will lose all your data. Download the latest TWRP to the same directory from: https://dl.twrp.me/shamu/twrp-2.8.7.1-shamu.img.html If you want a custom kernel, such as if you are un-encrypted, download it to the same directory. I use Franco.Kernel: http://kernels.franco-lnx.net/Nexus6/5.1/boot-r29.img   If you downloaded both of those, your directory should now look like: http://i.imgur.com/NqMKrNt.png  Note: If you already have the latest TWRP installled, or prefer to use a different recovery, you can feel free to skip that step. However you will need to have some sort of custom recovery installed so you can re-root.   Hold shift and right click inside of that directory, then choose ""Open command window here"" Reboot into bootloader: adb reboot bootloader    Enter the following:   fastboot flash bootloader bootloader-shamu-moto-apq8084-71.10.img fastboot flash radio radio-shamu-d4.0-9625-02.101.img fastboot reboot-bootloader fastboot flash recovery twrp-2.8.7.1-shamu.img fastboot flash boot boot-r29.img (filename will be different if not using franco.kernel I linked above) fastboot flash system system.img fastboot reboot-bootloader   Use the volume buttons to reboot in to TWRP. Swipe to allow modifications to /system when prompted then choose reboot and then system. You should be prompted to install SU if you want to root, do so. TWRP will install SU and then reboot.  Android will do it's optimizing thing. When done, you will be on 5.1.1 LMY47Z with your data intact.    If you don't mind losing your data and setting your phone back up, then just updating is easier. Get the Nexus Root Toolkit http://www.wugfresh.com/nrt/ choose the latest build when launching it and then just click ""Flash Stock + Unroot"". From there you can just re-root as you did when you first got your phone and set it back up.  The toolkit will also allow you to do everything I described above via the ""Advanced Utilities"" by flashing individual img's. Do not flash userdata if you do not want to lose your data.    Sorry that I'm not better at describing things in non-technical ways.   One last note, however you upgrade, you will have to re-enable the VOLTE flag if you wish to use VZW VOLTE.   *#*#4636#*#*   Then Phone Information, click and hold ""Turn ON VOLTE Provisioned Flag"", hit the home button, toggle airplane mode."

nexus6,3cndz9,Baalinooo,7,Thu Jul 9 06:40:50 2015 UTC,The load on the phone isn't the problem. Stop putting it under your pillow. The phone generates heat and you're putting it somewhere there is no airflow for 6+ hours.
nexus6,3cndz9,canphantom,2,Thu Jul 9 06:55:56 2015 UTC,Truth. This is how fires start.
nexus6,3cndz9,Chahk,-2,Thu Jul 9 14:49:32 2015 UTC,"Are you sure? I mean, a phone is designed to be able to sit in your pocket without air flow all day and against your hot leg. Why wouldn't it be able to handle being underneath a pillow? I used to do the same thing with my Nexus 5, and it didn't overheat."
nexus6,3cndz9,I_need_a_bath,5,Thu Jul 9 08:14:25 2015 UTC,"There is airflow in your pockets, clothing is relatively porous and allows air to move through as well as heat to move out of the pocket. The pillow acts as an insulator and causes the heat to be trapped with the phone, this is what's causing the overheating. As to why your N5 didn't overheat versus your N6, I don't know. But it definitely isn't a good idea for any phone to keep it under a pillow at night. Especially while charging."
nexus6,3cndz9,navjot94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:55:15 2015 UTC,"I have been putting /u/canphantom theory to the test. Left my Nexus 6 under my pillow with an audiobook playing, same way I would do it at night. It's been there for almost 3 hours now. It's not overheating.  Edit: I found the cause of my problem. It's a software issue that was introduced with 5.1.1 update apparently. I noticed my GPS location icon in the status bar blinking strangely and for way longer than it should, meaning my phone is polling for GPS location too often, leading to overheating and battery drain. There is a recent thread on XDA with people having the same problem."
nexus6,3cndz9,navjot94,6,Thu Jul 9 12:31:29 2015 UTC,"It's definitely the pillow. Maybe there is some software bug with with GPS or whatever, but that much overheating is the pillow. It'll happen with any device, maybe you weren't placing the Nexus 5 completely under the pillow.  As for this:   I have been putting /u/canphantom theory to the test. Left my Nexus 6 under my pillow with an audiobook playing, same way I would do it at night. It's been there for almost 3 hours now. It's not overheating.   That's because when you tested this, your head wasn't pushing down on the pillow and thus wasn't restricting air flow."
nexus6,3cndz9,canphantom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"That's because when you tested this, your head wasn't pushing down on the pillow and thus wasn't restricting air flow.   It has never been. I sleep in a large bed with an extra long pillow. I put the phone under the pillow but not anywhere near underneath my head, this way it's easy to reach for it every time I want to skip back 30 seconds because I fazed out for a moment and missed part of the story.  I regret mentioning the pillow. You're all focusing on that instead of the real problem. Sure, the pillow exacerbates the overheating, but it isn't the cause."
nexus6,3ckj36,bluefly1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"do they send you a refurbished device back? With the issues other people sometimes have, I feel like it would be better to just live with the missing letters than risk getting a device that's even more messed up."
nexus6,3ckj36,navjot94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:48:31 2015 UTC,Yes they send refurbished device. But the device I received is as good as new and have been using it for past 1 month with no issues.

nexus6,3cjpli,cdegallo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:57:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the N6 since I don't have one to test, but if the hardware reports that it's capable, there is API support to make the proper calls, so it should be able to do it. (Although during development on Android 5.0, I had devices report they could do 4K or 60fps, and then they'd crash. I hope 5.1 fixed that, and I'll revisit it soon)."

nexus6,3cjinu,Motox_xotoM,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:40:02 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Really hard to shop Motorola's site when Amazon has all the same products listed at least 30% of site list prices. You actually reminded me I was going to buy a bluetooth headset since holding the N6 to my head seems a bit awkward to me. Motorola makes excellent BT headsets so the same one priced at $129 on their site is available from Amazon for $48 if you're willing to eschew retail packing or $84 is you want the plastic. Add Amazon's customer service on top of that and Prime if you subscribe.
nexus6,3cjinu,AHrubik,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon. Definitely make use of that Prime Subscription.  On that note, Don't forget next Wednesday is ""Prime Day"" :)"
nexus6,3cjinu,kinglime,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:28:03 2015 UTC,Damn I just ordered a 64GB Nexus 6 on Amazon for $550. I even paid for 1 day shipping. Come to find out that it actually won't be arriving for another week. I just want my Nexus :(
nexus6,3cjinu,icameforgold,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"I just ordered one and had the same experience! It was suppose to be here today, but after the order was processed it won't be here until Friday -_-  You can email customer service and get your money back and they may also credit you with a one day free shipping for your next item. It sucks though, I'm trying to port over to t-mobile from sprint... just a few more days now."
nexus6,3cjinu,kinglime,2,Wed Jul 8 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"Dude! Did you place your order monday? I'm a prime customer and I placed my order around 6pm central time monday. I paid for one day shipping for both the phone and a case. The case came yesterday and the phone was supposed to come today. Lo and behold I got an email late yesterday saying my phone had shipped and it would be arriving Saturday. I was furious. I chatted with a customer rep who refunded my shipping, gave me a $10 credit and another month of prime but frankly I was still mad. Apparently all shipping dates are merely estimates on Amazon and they can change them at will while only subtly notifying you. Honestly I think they should have paid to ship it by plane. Each day I go without a phone I become more frustrated. Next time this happens I'll just go visit my local Best Buy..."
nexus6,3cjinu,icameforgold,2,Wed Jul 8 17:39:49 2015 UTC,"I actually bought the nexus 6 32gb on Sunday and tried to cancel it a few hours later and placed an order for the 64gb since it was suppose to arrive at the same time. I later got an email saying it was too late to cancel so the 32gb arrived on time. The 64gb was still estimated to arrive on time so I didn't feel too bad, but later I get a email saying it was shipping and will take a week to get here, that upset me. I still keep checking the tracking details expecting it to get here sooner than that since it has already left the warehouse.   I don't see why it is in shipment so long, they still mailed it out on time, its like they just decided to mail it the slow way instead of next day.   I am in the same boat, I order from Amazon because of the cheaper price and the fast shipping. I will sometimes pay a little more to order from amazon over other sites just because I can get the shipment faster. They have generally been good with the order, but recently with a few of the Sunday delivery orders I have had problems.   So right now I have the phones I ordered from t-mobile and all the cases and accessories I ordered, but not my nexus 6. So i have to wait for it to get here so I can finish porting everything over."
nexus6,3cjinu,kinglime,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:15:24 2015 UTC,Ughh yeah. I wonder if they did just pay the slower shipping. Mine is coming from WA and I'm in TX but that still seems like it shouldn't take a week.
nexus6,3cjinu,icameforgold,2,Wed Jul 8 20:18:23 2015 UTC,I'm in Texas too! Maybe they just don't like Texans -_-
nexus6,3cjinu,kinglime,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:40:07 2015 UTC,No way? I'm in Houston. Maybe the Texas fulfilment center reported having some in stock when they really didn't.

Thats what the message about the fulfilment center that was sent to me seems like it was saying, but still, I don't see why if its still being shipped in the US that it takes about a week to arrive.

nexus6,3cjinu,AwesomnusRadicus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:01:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll agree 9 times out of 10 my stuff comes in 2 days. It's the times when it doesn't that really frustrates me.

nexus6,3clyx3,TheJulian,9,Wed Jul 8 23:06:56 2015 UTC,I think if youre anywhere don't drop your phone... Why would google or motorola have to pay for your mistake? Don't be so entitled. If you want better/cheaper service when you break your phone get insurance. Screen replacements do cost that much so they aren't ripping you off. Also get a case its a 5-20 dollar investment that could have prevented your issue.
nexus6,3clyx3,Nocturnal86,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:49:28 2015 UTC,I don't want them to do it for free. I want them to do it for a reasonable price. I don't feel that $275 USD is a reasonable price when it costs $170 USD if I were in the US. Do you think that's fair?
nexus6,3clyx3,kenypowa,3,Thu Jul 9 13:57:12 2015 UTC,"Isn't the standard cost like $150-$200 USD for screen replacement? You are not being ripped off. Besides, you are not the only one a Nexus and Chromecast.  Next time drop a Galaxy S6 Edge and ask Samsung how much they charge to replace the curved screen."
nexus6,3clyx3,Milkpoyle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:23:45 2015 UTC,Isn't the standard cost like $150-$200 USD   The cost is $170 USD which is a far cry from the $275 USD I'm being quoted. This is the problem. I'd happily pay the $170 if that were an option. My annoyance is that Motorola is profiting from this.

For reference, here is a great article about all the diverse and fucking frustrating builds for the Nexus 6: http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/05/27/how-to-make-sense-of-all-the-different-nexus-6-builds-why-they-exist-and-what-it-all-means/  Here's how I got onto the correct build:  1) Install android SDK --some guides say you can use a smaller version, but it didn't work for me with anything other than the full SDK.  2) Make sure fastboot can find your device --ADB wasn't working for me but it didn't matter.  3) Download your T-mobile 5.1.1 factory image and follow this guide: https://wolfpaulus.com/jounal/android-journal/android-5-1-nexus-6/   You don't need the ./ on step 3 if you are on Windows. I put all the factory image files into the directory where fastboot was and just did everything there. I couldn't make it work any other way. Best of luck, man."
nexus6,3cjjqh,thiazzi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"If you are on 5.1.1 already, I'm pretty sure that nothing will happen, and you will have to flash the ROM manually.   As far as I am aware there is no OTA to move you from one 5.1.1 build to another."
nexus6,3ck96r,mjkristoff,2,Wed Jul 8 15:49:31 2015 UTC,It's pretty incredible tbh.
nexus6,3ck96r,fanaticalg,2,Wed Jul 8 16:21:16 2015 UTC,Just made the Jump From the HTC one M8 to the N6 and I love it! there are only a few features That you will find missing.   No remote blaster in the N6 Not that big of a issue but the Remote control was a neat feature.  Another feature is even tho the N6 has a far better rez Cam the M8 could take some really FAST photo's.   Oh and sound! even tho the N6 has front placed speakers my M8 did sound better.  But that's about it there is the size issue to get used too. I got a case and a screen protector on day 1 I would suggest anyone todo the same coming from a smaller device... It is a pain in the pocket by the way it will take some getting used too
nexus6,3ck96r,phantom2404,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:58:02 2015 UTC,My M8 just broke and my N6 is coming Saturday. I can't wait! How would you say the overall speed compares? Also I know the M8 takes faster pictures but how would you say they compare to the N6's pictures? Thanks.
nexus6,3ck96r,kinglime,2,Thu Jul 9 00:48:47 2015 UTC,Well the M8 has 2gigs of ram and the N6 has 3 and the Processor is also a bit faster. Soo in my opinion it is faster/Smoother And because of the bigger screen more enjoyable to play some games on or even watch video's. As far as the pictures go its all about the resolution!!! the n6 has a 13 megapixel vs the M8 with a dual cam 4 megapixel I think. So from what I can tell. I can take a Moving picture better with the N6 vs the M8 In fact I was experimenting with the N6 and took a Picture of the Sunset on my way home... No big deal except I was doing about 60mph and in one of the picture's I was passing a State sign and its completely legible... With the M8 that sign would have prob been a blur.
nexus6,3ck96r,phantom2404,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:06:17 2015 UTC,Wow I'm even more excited now! Just curious which carrier are you on and did you buy the unlocked phone online or did you buy your carrier's version?
nexus6,3ck96r,kinglime,2,Thu Jul 9 01:07:46 2015 UTC,Well I am on Verizon But im using a T-Mobile Device. I have had no issues but my sim card was activated on the M8. I even did a Full Re flash/Restore of the N6 using the T-mobile firmware and everything works just like it was a Verizon device. im not sure where the device came from. It was a C-list buy
nexus6,3ck96r,phantom2404,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"It's a big phone. Just switched from the M8 to the N6 last month. No regrets so far, except I miss the...idk, sleek ""cool factor"" of HTC, but my N6 has never let me down. I'm a fan."

nexus6,3ck96r,DRock4WC,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"I remember thinking my original Evo 4G was huge, then the 4G LTE was a bit bigger, then my M8 was slightly bigger than my already large 4G LTE.  Funny how in just a few minutes of playing around with the Nexus 6 my M8 seemed tiny.  I've had no problem with battery life at all so far.  I also keep it on a Tylt Vu most of the work day and the quick charger at home is fantastic.  I know the M8 was capable of quick charging, but I never got the adapter for it.  One thing I noticed that wasn't a big deal to me at all is in the initial setup there's an option to tap your phones together to transfer data via NFC.  My buddy went from a Nexus 4 to the 6 without any problems, but when I tried it with my M8 I'd hear the noise, but nothing else ever happened.  I just gave up after a few tries.  Entering wifi passwords again and stuff like that isn't that big a deal to me."

I RMA'd it to motorola (where I purchased it) and did the method where they hold onto i think $500 (I don't think thats right, it's probably less) and they send me a new phone within 3-5 business days. Once you get the phone you send out your old one with the stuff they gave you that's pre-labeled. Motorola took my old phone no questions asked and never charged me once. I'd highly recommend doing this if you can put a card with the amount on hold. It was the fastest transaction and phone replacement method I've ever done."

nexus6,3ck7n4,TonGi018,2,Wed Jul 8 17:54:27 2015 UTC,RMA it.  This is a known precursor to the batteries dying and it will probably start swelling up the back of the phone soon.

nexus6,3ckty3,dabbill,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:02:54 2015 UTC,I did. I did a full factory reset through TWRP with the wipe option. Did it thrice.

nexus6,3ckty3,dabbill,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:31:09 2015 UTC,When you do a standard factory reset with TWRP it does not wipe the storage partition. You need to go in to advance wipe and wipe everything.

People keep flashing userdata.img for 32GB phone on their 64GB phone and it shrinks the partition. Factory reset fixes this, and just dont flash userdata.img any time your changing roms."
nexus6,3cjh5c,shuusaku,4,Wed Jul 8 11:44:57 2015 UTC,"This is my experience. I've used ROMs for years and years. I rooted all my phones on the first day and pretty much flashed a ROM a few days later. My last two phones: this one and the 2013 Moto X, I've barely touched. With the N6, I always keep coming back to stock because it just works. What I'm trying to say is that I don't think that many ROMs offer that big of an improvement over stock. They do offer more customization and whatnot but sometimes I just prefer to have a completely stable experience and not have to worry about having the latest version of some ROM that claims to have improved battery life or some other common buzzword in the changelog. Especially if the developer has that typical XDA attitude like this one, unfortunately. I personally never found Chroma to be as smooth or stable as stock.  As for ROMs, I would recommend you try Paranoid Android 5.1. Been using it since it was released two days ago and it's been solid. Haven't used that ROM in a while so I figured I'd give it a try.  TL;DR: Nexus 6 is a good enough device for me to use without the need for ROMs. I don't find Chroma to that good and the developer is... Well he is pretty whiny, unfortunately."
nexus6,3cjh5c,eggydrums115,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:51:30 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for your comment. I had the same idea then I managed to break the stock android - something I could (and in retrospect I probably should) have  fixed instead of flashing a new rom. But I like experimenting a little bit :-)
nexus6,3cjh5c,eggydrums115,2,Wed Jul 8 13:03:26 2015 UTC,What did you do? And yeah it's happened to me before. Break something and then the opportunity comes up to just flash a ROM and go

Thinking it's free makes you a victim to clever marketing. Same thing has been made illegal in my country recently. You're basically taking out a 2 year loan on the phone.

Edit: if the reddit trolls are going to downvote at least explain why. The question makes no sense. It's free on contract. If he's asking the plan monthly payment there's no answer as you can pick any plan.
nexus6,3cgh0f,idip31,2,Tue Jul 7 19:19:40 2015 UTC,He's asking what the monthly price of the cell plan is... Free is not the same as Free with 2year contract. You end up paying for the phone in the contract price.

nexus6,3cgh0f,Hemingr,5,Tue Jul 7 20:40:44 2015 UTC,Actually no. You're falling victim to clever marketing. The phone costs 599 with a 199 down payment and 400 spread over 24 months.   It's still a good deal with a 199 discount over the Google play price. However that 400$ you're still paying wrapped into your monthly fee. Why do you think sim only contracts are cheaper ;)
nexus6,3cgh0f,Hemingr,4,Wed Jul 8 04:46:14 2015 UTC,Wrong. The phone doesn't cost 199. It costs 599. You pay 199 up front and 400 spread over the term of the contract. Please don't be so ignorant.
nexus6,3cgh0f,Hemingr,3,Tue Jul 7 21:10:47 2015 UTC,Nope. The payment is still wrapped in your contract fee. You didn't change your contract price because you were already paying for your old phone.

With that being said, you can fix this without wiping anything and losing data. Go to the Nexus factory image website and download the proper 5.1.1 image for your carrier. Extract it until you get each image separate. You should have a bootloader, radio, system, boot, recovery, cache and userdata img's. Flash in fastboot, bootloader, then reboot bootloader. Flash the radio and reboot bootloader. Then flash system.img, boot.img and recovery.img separately of course, but you don't need to reboot between each one. Then reboot the phone and you should be good to go. There are many, many guides on how to flash images in fastboot for Nexus devices, so find one of those because if I went into detail this would be one long post. Also, xda is your friend. You can probably get better help there."

nexus6,3cizm2,tmorel,2,Wed Jul 8 07:42:20 2015 UTC,You can force thé update with tour computer same thing for root. I don't thil you can OTA with root. To update your phone you can flash the stock ROM with the nexus root toolkit. You can also root with this software but you'll need to erase all of your data if your bootloader is not unblocked. You can find tutorialon Google xda dev etc . to scale down your screen  i guess you talk about the LCD density you can change this value in thé build prop file . but you need to be rooted  (Sorry for the typo and bad english il a french on m'y nexus 5 keyboard )

nexus6,3cizm2,jhk0215,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:52:44 2015 UTC,The phone ships with a 5.0 dev build. If you're on AT&T you have to skip the setup and connect to WiFi to get the phone to update. Otherwise it will never update. Once you're on 5.1.1 you can do a full reset and run through the setup like normal.
nexus6,3chtnz,pecarr,2,Wed Jul 8 00:47:12 2015 UTC,I think Snapchat just doesn't care about us nexus 6 users. The photo performance particularly in low light is abysmal.

It actually sort of forces you out of the phone rut while on vacation too.  Just remember to cache maps and all that.    That's what I would do - have a roaming plan available in case of an emergency, and keep the SIM card out of the phone unless you need it, and mostly rely on WiFi."
nexus6,3ch6t0,socsa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:00:28 2015 UTC,"Call your cell provider. So many variables like how long, what Country and type of use you are expecting with you phone. They have supplemental plans that might fit your needs. The main thing is what you need your phone for when on vacation. If you are taking a few pictures throughout the day, you can easily upload at night over wifi.   A few years back, I went to Mexico and turned my phone on for the alarm and it updated a ton of apps in the middle of the night. This ended up costing me about $250. Fast forward to last December when I returned to Mexico. I tried to find something that would work with Verizon and it still was going to cost me a lot for just 100 mb of data. I decided to lookup free wifi locations and just turned sync and any other features off. I downloaded some offline maps and made use of wifi to stay in contact.   Make sure to also tell people you are out of town. Change your voicemail to say something like ""text me if an emergency"". Create an email vacation responder with a ""text if an emergency"". This way, at least you can have peace of mind that something isn't going down in your hometown."

nexus6,3cffd2,42391,2,Tue Jul 7 14:21:44 2015 UTC,The root modified the system partition so you can't just hide root. You can download the factory image though and flash that. A clean flash will remove root and format userdata so you'll get the result you want. The Toolkit can also do this.
nexus6,3cffd2,technomancery,2,Tue Jul 7 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, if I download the image from here:    http://www.randomphantasmagoria.com/firmware/nexus-6/shamu/vzw/    I should be able to boot into TWRP and flash the new firmware from there without needing to return to stock?  I will then lose root, but then I can just restore root with Chainfire like I did initially?    Also, is there any particular reason why there is not an official factory ROM from Google for 5.1.1 which will work for VZW (site lists sprint and Tmo images only).  I'd use NRT, but I am working from Linux and don't trust my VM to do USB pass-through for stuff like this."
nexus6,3cffd2,socsa,2,Tue Jul 7 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"The factory rom for Sprint is actually the correct rom for you - LMY47Z As for your link I have no idea if his stuff is legit but he has images (which cannot be flashed in recovery) and Deltas (which I think are OTAs and will fail because root). Best bet is grab the images from Google for Sprint and flash then reroot.  If you think I'm wrong about using the Sprint images your dude's website shows that they have the same Build, Baseband and Bootloader between them, and those are different for T-Mobile."
nexus6,3cffd2,technomancery,0,Tue Jul 7 20:26:04 2015 UTC,"So grab the LMY47Z image from here and just flash ""image-shamu-lmy47z.zip"" and ""radio-shamu-d4.0-9625-02.101.img"" from recovery?  Then re-root?  Or do I have to flash those files with fastboot?  Thanks for the help - I'm pretty new to the Nexus scene and I'm still getting the workflow down.  I always just used RomManager and CM in the past."
nexus6,3cffd2,socsa,3,Tue Jul 7 20:35:40 2015 UTC,"You'll have to use fastboot, recovery can't flash img files. Unzip the zip file and you'll get more img files. Flash back to stock through Fastboot in this order: bootloader, radio, system, boot, recovery, cache then userdata. This will give you a fresh install. Skipping userdata would result in keeping your apps, for future reference. Then flash the root img as CF instructs. There's a script in the download too, which will work in Linux."
nexus6,3cffd2,technomancery,0,Tue Jul 7 20:49:01 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks.  One more question - can I just skip flashing the stock recovery and keep twrp in place as is?   Or does flashing the bootloader nuke the recovery?  This all sort of seems like a PITA.  Is there not just a stock, rooted 5.1.1 ROM somewhere which I can flash over my current install without going back to stock?  Thanks again!"
nexus6,3cffd2,socsa,2,Tue Jul 7 21:11:10 2015 UTC,"No you cannot keep TWRP.  Yes it seems like a PITA unrooting to stock, because it is a PITA...it is like being at work and having an untied shoe, and ""needing"" to tear off all your clothes and put them back on in order to retie said shoe.  There are several stockish ROMs on XDA.  And YES you need to be 100% stock...including unrooted, unmodified /system partition, AND stock bootloader in order to take OTAs."
nexus6,3cffd2,Skripka,0,Tue Jul 7 21:20:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured I'd have to unroot to take an OTA - I mostly just want stock 5.1.1 though, not necessarily the OTA.  I just always assumed there would be a simpler workflow for minor OS updates.  I guess there's not really much reason to even keep the custom recovery around then, unless I want to go with custom ROMs instead of stock images.  I guess having the ability to use NRT probably makes this all less convoluted.  Maybe I'll give it a try in a VM.  Sorry, just thinking out loud."
nexus6,3cffd2,socsa,2,Tue Jul 7 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"Flashing the bootloader doesn't change the recovery. Since you are fastboot flashing system it might work without switching recoveries, I don't know. If you skip recovery and it doesn't boot you'll know why! Then you can just go back into fastboot and start over. Personally I don't have a lot of love for TWRP. I don't flash packages and I don't make nandroids."
nexus6,3cffd2,technomancery,0,Tue Jul 7 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just came to the realization that the custom recovery is probably unnecessary for my purposes since I want to stick with factory images.  Interesting.  I think I spent so much time on phones where the bootloader needs an exploit to unlock, that I never thought about why the official factory upgrade procedures might be more involved than flashing a ROM.  You know, since OEM upgrades were never really an option."

This is why most Verizon customers need to get a new phone when changing cell companies.  The Nexus 6 just happens to support BOTH network types which is one of it's major perks.

nexus6,3cdiud,idksomuch,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:14:06 2015 UTC,"I waited over 2 months for my moto 360 replacement, some of the delay had to do with the fact that I have the monolink band, but it was mostly because of some stuff going on with Motorola. I ended up getting motors very own Wendy to help me who gave me the email to moto's social media help and a wonderful lady named Gaby I think kept in touch with me throughout the process. She even helped me contact FedEx when I told her they shipped it to an outdated address. Thanks Wendy and Gaby!"
nexus6,3cdiud,Aeong,5,Tue Jul 7 08:44:34 2015 UTC,That's nothing.  I paid $25 for an advanced RMA and they sent me a defective piece of shit. I asked them to send another one but they wanted ANOTHER $25 for their own fuck ups. The $25 is only good for a single use. If they mess up you have to go through the slow RMA or pay again.  So I gave up and returned the defective pos replacement they sent me.  And guess what? They said they didn't receive my original device because the imei doesn't match up with the device I'm supposed to return and now they're going to charge me $600! Fuck Motorola.

nexus6,3cdiud,Aeong,2,Tue Jul 7 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"You call the credit card company and tell them the story, that you did send them a device, and why they think it is the wrong device, and that you do not in any way authorize the charge, since they have the device back.  Credit card company effectively negates the charge Motorola has sent to your card, and they are left trying to get their money another way (via debt collectors or other ways), which never really works, because you didn't sign anything saying you owe them that money."
nexus6,3cdiud,holic_2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:34:52 2015 UTC,"See, this is where I'm worried my situation could go. When you start treating customers this way it's all down hill from there. I've had several defective phones from moto. What's to say the unit I get from them after spending $25 doesn't have some problem as well? Then what? If that's a risk you take with them, then I'm gone."
nexus6,3cdiud,whativebeenhiding,3,Tue Jul 7 11:47:09 2015 UTC,"You have no recourse if they screw up. Their support (which needs to be contracted via phone for anything RMA related, no email, no chat) is 100% overseas and aren't trained for the unexpected. If anything goes wrong you'll be bounced around, get your calls disconnected,  and be outright lied to just to get you off the phone. Once you're off the phone it's another representatives problem. People say oneplus support is bad but they haven't experienced the special kind of hell that is Motorola RMA."
nexus6,3cdiud,holic_2,2,Tue Jul 7 13:04:29 2015 UTC,Yeah Google has way better support for replacements. I had my Nexus 5 replaced by Google many times and they were amazing. During one phone call I told the man this is why I spend my money with you guys

nexus6,3cda3i,eggydrums115,2,Tue Jul 7 10:59:13 2015 UTC,It's basically a theme engine built by Sony that allows you theme only the apps you want. It's pretty great

nexus6,3cda3i,vcuramengineer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:15:44 2015 UTC,Don't have a great response.  I use the Pure Nexus ROM by Beanstown because I've used his work in the past.  He chose to include Layers support as part of the ROM.  I've heard it's much more user friendly but has some limitations compared to the CM theme engine.  I literally just jumped into the themeing world a few days ago.  Maybe someone else can speak more intelligently.

nexus6,3cda3i,xsuitup,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:04:18 2015 UTC,Layers is good. You need the manager and a theme like this.

I mainly want it for music. The headphone and USB jacks are at opposite ends, which makes it awkward, can't put it in my pocket, etc. It eats battery to leave it plugged in all day (I want to be able to play music on and off in bursts if I want to).

Please tell me, in all honesty, why do you record concert footage using your phone?  I'm genuinely curious."

Do you find it takes you out of the moment, and hinders enjoyment of the concert?  Do you ever go back to look at those videos for nostalgia?  Is it just to show others what you are doing, even though they can't really see in very good quality what it is you are watching or hear what you are listening to?  I guess my question is, what is the underlying, driving force to your recording clips of a concert?"
nexus6,3cbjup,zzisrafelzz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:30:54 2015 UTC,"Nostalgia mostly. It's fun to look back and watch the footage later. If I add it to Google+, it makes neat little ""auto awesome"" videos for me that I can show friends or whatever. I much prefer traditional photos to videos, but with stage production the way it is at some shows, a video can be much more telling than a picture. With my digital cameras, and the Nexus 6 if it weren't for this stupid auto focus, the video quality is pretty good considering my hand isn't very steady when I've been drinking."

nexus6,3cdwj5,Interanc,2,Tue Jul 7 03:49:34 2015 UTC,"I did the motorola advanced repair or whatever it's called. It's on Motorola's nexus 6 support page.  Motorola sends you a new (actually probably refurbished) phone, with all the return packaging to send back your old phone. You have 10 days or so, so I had plenty of time to transfer all my data and reset the old device.  The total cost with tax was about $196. They also put a $500 hold on your credit card, which is released once they receive the old phone.  During my first attempt to order, the site (or maybe my browser) crashed as soon as I hit purchase, and Motorola's support team was really helpful determining my status and all that stuff.   $200 isn't cheap, but the 3 local places I checked (Houston) were all over $300, as I couldn't find anywhere with the equipment to replace just the $6 piece of glass without replacing the whole screen/digitizer. Plus most people seem to get newer build date phones. My original was November, new one is May. So hopefully there are some improvements, though I haven't really noticed.  Also, if you try to replace yourself, a screen alone is $280. Go Moto.  P.S. Everything I read online said I was supposed to get a new turbo charger with the replacement phone, but no luck there so don't count on it."
nexus6,3cbj61,psrtx,10,Mon Jul 6 17:00:28 2015 UTC,I have to ask Google play store for replacement.   This is not how warranties work. If it's under warranty and outside of the vendor's coverage period then the manufacturer is responsible. Try again. If they give you the run around let them know you'll be contacting your state's Attorney General's office to notify them of the problem.
nexus6,3cbj61,AHrubik,2,Mon Jul 6 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"Not only that, claiming they don't have the item in stock isn't an excuse to get out of replacing something that's under warranty."

Use Xposed for Android 5.1.1  Take advantage of Google Now and all ways on voice detection (you can use ""Okay Google"" when the screen is off). With Xposed, you can use the Google Now Launcher with Xposed GEL Settings to customize the layout, like orientation and grid size, etc. Set Location Settings to Device Only so that you don't have excessive battery drain when the screen is off while using Google Now. Install Greenify and Amplify (requires Xposed) to save  even more battery Use a 3rd party camera app for better pictures, I like Camera FV-5 Use Google Photos it's amazing Create a back up image of your phone using TWRP once everything is all set up   edit: added more links"

I have a general idea on how they work, but I do prefer a very easy root tool.  I know I will root the phone and unlock the bootloader.  I do like the idea of a custom recovery as I remember how useful that was when I installed it.

nexus6,3cbfap,txaggies07,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:58:50 2015 UTC,Has anyone given a reason why formatting is necessary?  I ran M just fine without formatting my data partition.
nexus6,3cbfap,jfpbookworm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:33:03 2015 UTC,"It's mainly just a ""better safe than sorry"" thing. If a person has an issue with a new rom be it custom or a preview, the first question is ""Did you do a full wipe?"" That's just because that usually solves 90 percent of issues. If you can run it without problems then don't worry about. But if you do get a problem to show up, try a full wipe and see if that fixes it."
nexus6,3cbfap,thad137,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:36:47 2015 UTC,"But this isn't a full wipe, which I agree is generally a good idea.  It's a reformat, which seems unnecessary if you're not changing the file system."
nexus6,3cbfap,jfpbookworm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"Not that I've seen.  I know that on XDA, the dev for the M preview ROM JDX is pretty adamant about formatting data."
nexus6,3cbfap,jfpbookworm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:01:19 2015 UTC,Yeah. I figured that was just to have one less confounding factor when debugging. I'm unaware of any file system changes between Lollipop and M.
nexus6,3cbfap,Ubuntu_Linux_User,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:38:17 2015 UTC,I tried to use NRT to go back to stock 5.1.1 and had trouble with Gapps for some reason. Ended up having to wipe and reflash.

nexus6,3cbxl9,a2themosdef,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"This is definitely the most realistic. Not only was there already a Nexus 7 in tablet form, but 7"" really pushes the limit for a phone... Then again, the first iPhone was said to be way too big and that screen was around 3""."

nexus6,3cbvrp,ilikecakeeating,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:01:37 2015 UTC,Its a root app that enables the notification light under the top speaker grill.

nexus6,3cbvrp,jordyn89,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"I think this is caused when the device either loses or regains cell signal.

Ill use that procedure to test it while I mess with settings"
nexus6,3cbach,anandroiduser,2,Mon Jul 6 16:46:56 2015 UTC,No Nexus 6 is capable of having a response to specific hotword during sleep . It doesn't mean the phone isn't going to deep sleep.
nexus6,3cbach,retrogreq,0,Mon Jul 6 17:23:16 2015 UTC,"That's actually not true. There's an option in Google settings to allow ""OK Google"" from any screen, including when the device is sleeping."
nexus6,3cbach,proxyclean,2,Mon Jul 6 18:16:04 2015 UTC,"The ""okay google"" thing while the screen is off is part of a setting (maybe ambient display, actually)."

Not having the Notification LED was a big deal for me. It's one of those things I didn't appreciate until it wasn't there. The Nexus 6 has a notification LED in the top speaker, it's just not utilized by the software. I used Light Flow to enable it. Kind of clunky, but it does work."

I'm on mobile right now so don't have the string you need to add. I'll see if I can find it  Edit: http://m.pocketnow.com/2015/01/01/nexus-6-tethering Just do the build.prop part
nexus6,3c76sl,wbonnefond,4,Sun Jul 5 15:37:18 2015 UTC,"If you're crafty enough with ADB, you don't even necessarily need to root (though you may or may not need an unlocked bootloader). You can ADB pull the build.prop, make the necessary changes, then fastboot boot into an alternate recovery, and ADB push the modified build.prop back to the /system partition.   If any of this sounds difficult or unfamiliar, it'll be more work to learn all of it than to go through an easier method of rooting and having tethering included as part of whichever solution you choose."
nexus6,3c76sl,jableux,3,Sun Jul 5 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"Yes... But I don't know why you would do this.. (and don't say for OTA's), as thats invalid. An LP OTA checks to see if /system has EVER been mounted as RW (including by Recovery), and fails if that returns true."
nexus6,3c76sl,npjohnson1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:42:23 2015 UTC,I did this for an easy way to get tethering on the M preview and to stay away from any of the questionable root methods that have thus far come out for it. OTA's aren't important to me because I'm prepared to flash the next image when it becomes available anyway. This also keeps everything otherwise completely stock.
nexus6,3c76sl,jableux,2,Mon Jul 6 04:26:47 2015 UTC,Valid reason (:

nexus6,3c76sl,Krojack76,4,Tue Jul 7 20:38:39 2015 UTC,Depends on your plan. If you have one of their new share everything/more everything plans then tethering is included. Otherwise you need to root and modify your build.prop.

Melee actually loads, but with single-digit FPS in the menu screens I didn't even bother going all the way to the gameplay.  The Android section of the Dolphin forum seems to indicate that the app isn't really ready for prime time yet, and most mobile devices don't have the performance to run games at full speed even if it was.

nexus6,3c5vrz,taheromar,5,Sun Jul 5 20:11:23 2015 UTC,i think it was because of a huge backlash of people who didn't understand why subreddits were going dark and got mad at the mods for it
nexus6,3c5vrz,noneabove1182,15,Sun Jul 5 07:04:13 2015 UTC,"That, and the fact that the mods left the decision to go dark to the trolls and misanthropes without any input from, y'know, the entire rest of the sub.  ""Upvote 100 times if you want us to kill the sub"" was a pretty dumb approach, and a lot of people wanted to tell the mods how they felt about it."
nexus6,3c5vrz,bogus83,4,Sun Jul 5 02:58:45 2015 UTC,Mods go black because the admins don't communicate with mods. Mods then fail to communicate their intentions with subscribers and presume it will be alright. The cycle continues
nexus6,3c5vrz,CustosClavium,5,Sun Jul 5 03:02:29 2015 UTC,"It would be bad enough if that were the case, but it wasn't.

At best they displayed a lack of awareness and foresight.  At worst they were looking for a (lame) excuse to jump on a bandwagon at the expense of the community they're supposed to support.

nexus6,3c6a67,the_rape_sloth,3,Sun Jul 5 06:22:46 2015 UTC,True. Back to my N5 unless the rice works. May just get an LG G4 for the time being until the next iteration of the Nexus.
nexus6,3c6a67,the_rape_sloth,2,Sun Jul 5 06:40:06 2015 UTC,G4 is a nice phone. As long as you don't tinker.
nexus6,3c6a67,the_rape_sloth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:48:33 2015 UTC,What perplexes me is the fact that there is a video on youtube of a guy who submerged the N6 in water for over an hour while still on and nothing happened to the thing.  and mine only got splashed a few times.

nexus6,3c5y6y,slickhare,2,Sun Jul 5 08:48:06 2015 UTC,"I use to have Chroma & Franco Kernel the first 10mins of having my nexus 6 and its the closets to stock with added features like expanded desktop, longer battery life & stable enough with all the updates. and then i heard he took off some features out when he rebuilt his ROM so I went over to AOSIP ROM & Hells core Kernel Mako which is the closes to stock & chroma but with more added features I was looking for.  AOSIP had cm themes, change lockscreen wallpaper & slim launcher built in. When looking for a ROM a few things you need to ask yourself.  Are the developers active? Do they have a great community? How stable is their ROM? do you see users having a lot of problems?  stuff like that I went question before proceeding in doing anything to your nexus 6.... just my two cents"
nexus6,3c5y6y,jussaren,6,Sun Jul 5 13:50:50 2015 UTC,"Chroma.   Stable, lean, and with some great features baked in."

nexus6,3c5y6y,qdhcjv,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:21:46 2015 UTC,"If its the same as it used to be with PA and other roms that use it, it was basically like facebooks chat heads, but for all notifications. So you got this little floating circle that you could swipe from, then your apps would open in a small window above whatever else you were doing and respond right from there.  But I am pretty sure PA scrapped that feature over a hear ago to move towards a more heads up notification style feature they were working on. And who knows what happened to any of that since PA doesnt really seem to be very active anymore."
nexus6,3c5y6y,mashuto,4,Mon Jul 6 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"i'm just wondering how long until zephik's hiatus lasts since announcing his personal time off break. kind of hard to find a solid ""current"" ROM with Layers built in instead of the CM Theme Engine."
nexus6,3c5y6y,darienswag420,4,Sun Jul 5 04:26:11 2015 UTC,I'm on PureNexus. It has layers and runs great. The dev used to make roms for the SIII and was always top notch.
nexus6,3c5y6y,Kennyjive,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:19:33 2015 UTC,Just wanted to say thanks for drawing my attention to this ROM. Installed it last night and am quite impressed.
nexus6,3c5y6y,badokami,2,Mon Jul 6 13:15:42 2015 UTC,everything seems to work fine with the ROM (including Wi-Fi Calling on Tmo).  there's really no need to release very often at this point since it's mostly optimizations and not new features he has been focusing on recently.
nexus6,3c5y6y,drain_pipe,3,Sun Jul 5 04:32:40 2015 UTC,"oh yeah definitely he's keeping up well with it right now. i was just wondering if there were any solid alternatives if in the case that he decides to be less active with development.  i'm a big fan of bleeding edge (running Arch on my Macbook right now), and i have an incessant need for the latest."
nexus6,3c5y6y,darienswag420,2,Sun Jul 5 04:49:40 2015 UTC,"All the way. Been running it since I got my N6, and after a slew of dirty flashes, 7/1 bonked me. I did a factory reset and fresh flash of it + the 6/21 BaNkS gapps, and it is silk coated in butter on a baby's bottom smooth. Just awesome."
nexus6,3c5y6y,Nkredyble,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:50:49 2015 UTC,"I'm using CyanideL. I belive it is based from CyanogenMod, and it's a highly customizable version of it. AdBlock settings, floating windows, System App Remover, WakeLock blocker, Greeting message, Themes, Custom LCD density, Breathing notifications, Navigation button mods, led light mods, button mods, with much more than what has been said. Still able to crank out four or more hours of on screen time with 40% brightness or less. It has everything I need right now, and HDR camera works without force closing like it did for me on Blisspop. Speaking of Force Close, there is the occasional one here, but pretty easy to fix just by googling the issue.

I loved carbon ROM and it looks like cyanide has as many tweaks in it so it would be great if it were stable (use my phone for work so I don't have the tolerance for bugs that I used to be able to have..).

nexus6,3c5y6y,Coltsbro84,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"I used Cyanide for awhile. I got SystemUI failures a couple times a day. Also, you couldn't press the power button while it was laying down to wake the phone you almost alwyas had to pick the device up for it to wake up.  I looooved all the features but having to press the power button 4 times for it to wake was annoying. The system UI thing was a bit of a nuisance too.   I am currently looking for something else as customizable with an ad-block because screw ads."

nexus6,3c5y6y,Valkyrie743,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"I came back to give you a real response. I just flashed Euphoria (w/ the included kernel, flashed Benzo GApps as many seem to say they do) on a whim and I'm very impressed so far. Only been a day so far but not one hiccup despite me going crazy tinkering with all the settings. Though there is a lot added vs. Stock 5.1.1., somehow the performance is much better. The phone is very much usable on battery saver and I almost forgot it was on (you can even turn off the ugly orange border). Battery life should normalize after a handful of charge cycles but it already feels much better. I'm enjoying using my phone quite a bit more with this new ROM. Id definitely recommend it."

nexus6,3c7ehf,McNoxey,2,Sun Jul 5 16:10:48 2015 UTC,Iv noticed that too. I think there's a software threshold on what it determines things to be black and not. If it's more on the light side it might think it's gray. Maybe try nexus toolkit to go back to complete stock?
nexus6,3c7ehf,shane2811,2,Sun Jul 5 16:30:43 2015 UTC,I did flash a stock image. Didn't fix anything. Would this be different?
nexus6,3c7ehf,shane2811,2,Sun Jul 5 17:54:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, could still be some left over files. When you do a factory reset, unless you press wipe internal storage, there's left over junk."

nexus6,3c5xpn,UDK450,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:20:06 2015 UTC,Titanium can get apps but I don't know if it includes their data. The music might stay if it's stored in /data/media/ since TWRP doesn't wipe that part of the partition when factory resetting for a new ROM.
nexus6,3c5xpn,qdhcjv,2,Sun Jul 5 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"You can copy apps and app data, but any music downloaded through Google Play Music will be lost."
nexus6,3c5xpn,CWeaver34,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:43:45 2015 UTC,You cannot copy the songs from Google Play Music but you can use Titanium Backup to back everything up to a folder and then flash a rom. If your intention is to use factory images or wipe your data partition just copy the folder to your PC and then back when you are done.  Highly recommend paying the money for the Pro key. I have had it since they came out and while the interface leaves a little to be desired it is the longest running updated app I own
nexus6,3c5xpn,altimax98,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"Yup I have the pro key. Is it possible I could copy the music to another partition on my device, and then symlink it later?"
nexus6,3c5xpn,altimax98,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:56:06 2015 UTC,"IF you could find where it is stored you MIGHT be able to back it up with the folder structure and then restore your AndroidID. You can back that up by backing up Settings Storage in the apps list of TIBU. Restore that first on the new device and let it reboot.

It's the first phone that I've had in awhile that I haven't been too tempted to upgrade. It is really big though. And the camera is worse than any other flagship right now IMO - yes you can get some great shots, but you can do that with just about any phone in the last 2 years.  Overall, I like it a lot! The screen is huge, so I never feel odd playing a game on it. It has front facing speakers which are the second best I've used, and it's a Nexus"

Granted I haven't owned Samsungs or iPhones, which always seem to get top marks for camera quality. But while the N6 may not have the ""best"" camera you can buy, is certainly heads above previous generations. And I even prefer the N6 camera to the iPhone pictures I've seen my friends and family take as the colors are more natural. The iPhone makes everything look too warm."

More than anything, I love the Nexus experience where I didn't have to run a sketchy exploit to unlock the bootloader.  That's what sold me on the N6 instead of a Note4 (well, also the ability to finance through Motorola for free).  In fact, my GF liked it so much that I had to get one for her so she would stop ""borrowing"" mine.

nexus6,3c5z5l,m2n-,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"I had the Note 2 for almost 3 years.  Was considering the Note 4 BUT with Samsung's horrible Android updates, I choose not to risk it.  I got sick of waiting over a year or more for Android updates.  if I did get one it was like 1 to 2 minor versions behind.

nexus6,3c6n8r,qdhcjv,-3,Sun Jul 5 17:28:54 2015 UTC,Actually his ROM looks good on paper but if you follow other ROMS changed you will see that rom X gets an update and 1 days later Chroma gets the same update. Simply because Chroma is all about code stealing rather than code developing. And that also leads to unstable ROM experience (atleast for the 1-2 months where I tried Chroma).

Obviously, that would be a bit absurd- not to mention unfair. But we had calls for something like that coming in from peeved users regardless.   I'm just looking forward to this site-wide drama being over. While this incident was a bit ill-judged, what does it matter?

nexus6,3bz195,Ravenstown6,2,Sat Jul 4 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"If you want a larger phone, yes buy it. The new nexus coming out are rumored to be  different sizes but doubt the larger one will be bigger than the N6. And as far as performance its hard to imagine much of a bump in specs. This thing is crazy fast/smooth."
nexus6,3bz195,Solex159,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:41:48 2015 UTC,I really like the size of my n5 i just wish it lasted a bit longer. I can't play any games or video  or my battery is dead halfway through the day.   I'll have to hold it in my hand in a store before i make my decision i think
nexus6,3bz195,SocksForBreakfast,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:36:22 2015 UTC,"I was the same way, coming from a 5"" LG G2.  The size of the 6 concerned me, so I drove up to a Verizon store and asked if they could detach the phone from the security rope so I could see how it felt in my hand and pocket.  The size wasn't as big of a deal as I expected it to be.  I ended up buying it and have no regrets at all.. it's a fantastic phone.  The speakers are AMAZING, call quality is the best I've ever heard on a cell phone (almost on par with a landline).  Buttery smooth with 5.1.1.  I usually have about 40% battery left at the end of the day, so I can get about 36 hours of use out of mine on average.  Right now it's 4:00 in the afternoon and I'm still sitting at 90% with 1 hour SoT."
nexus6,3bz195,guitaristdel,0,Fri Jul 3 10:48:56 2015 UTC,"If you wanna buy n6 for the battery, don't. It is riddle with battery issues. Some days you get phenomenal battery, other days you will be shocked that it's running out so fast. Battery is erratic."
nexus6,3bz195,jhk0215,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:29:42 2015 UTC,I don't get why people downvoted you...  You guys need to embrace the problems of this phone you can't just pretend that no problems exist... No phone is perfect so stop downvoting people that mention a problem with the phone even if it is very true just because you don't want to hear it...
nexus6,3bz195,carajean2725,2,Sat Jul 4 18:00:48 2015 UTC,Bought mine the 30th of last month. I must say my battery life has been amazing compared to my moto x 2014. I usually have my 360 paired and easily get 24 hours. I'm not much of phone gamer I have an adult phone lol. Now I do have small lady hand and small lady jean pockets. I am currently running a case but I'm going to buy a smaller tpu case and glass screen protector.   The reason I didn't wait is because of the uncertainty of the next manufacturer. Love Motorola radios!  I mean the only thing they can improve on is the camera..... Everything else can be tweaked with updates.
nexus6,3bz195,ElectricFagSwatter,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:02:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, I'd take Motorola over LG any day. My g2 is almost 100% useless indoors and in low light. Besides having to wait seconds for it focus, you have to wait more for it to snap the picture, and you're always going to end up with a super blurry and soft photo. In daylight the camera is great though. Motorola seems to have built most nexus 6's pretty good. I just hope the camera isn't useless like my g2's in low light."

It's actually good to jump in late because all the hardware and software kinks have been ironed out (hopefully) and you can get the phone at a cheaper price than what it was at launch.   Honestly there's no point of asking if you should wait because there will ALWAYS be something new in a few months. Go into the store and try it out and if you like it, buy it."
nexus6,3bz195,lztandro,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:42:23 2015 UTC,Same here I love this phone. Using this running 5.1.1 and an almost polished version of Windows 10 on my Surface I am extremely happy with my OSes at the moment. If only Google's camera app wasn't shit

As soon as I turn the phone to landscape mode the volume resets and goes back to full only to go down again.   Support could not help me out, they refused to exchange it for a new one. I asked for a refund.  Awful experience so far..."

nexus6,3bz195,jhk0215,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:03:39 2015 UTC,Try asking again from a different Support member. Chances are you got unlucky and got paired with that one asshole support person and you might have better luck with someone else

This will be my second, my first I had for 14 days and got the Note instead and currently I have an S6.  I was debating about the new Nexus phones but I decided to go for the N6. I really don't care for Hwawi (sp?) and the general thought that Google is using them to get into China just makes me think N9 and N7 (2012) all over again. There were ulterior reasons for those devices (pushing new Nvidia chipsets) and those are 2 of the worst Nexus devices on record. Doesnt bode well IMO.  The LG made Nexus 5 (2015) sounds nice but again I wanted a larger device.  Add to all of that the fact that the 808 and 810 aren't really big  steps above the 805 except for 64bit and encryption benefits and it just doesn't make sense for me to wait.  To each their own though!"
nexus6,3bz195,howiela,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:17:20 2015 UTC,"Best phone I've spent money on. For me this year has been a bit of a dissapointment in the hardware category. The new 808/10 are not that much better than the 805. I would spend money on the n6 or wait for note 5 if you like big screens. Dont think the new huawei nexus will have a 6"" screen. Will most likely have smaller screen. I love the screen on the n6. G3 felt too small. My n6 have amazing battery life, nice performance, a good camera (much better after the last camera update) and fast updates. In August when they update to android M standby and battery overall will increase ( now I get 3,5-4 with 20-40% left and 5h+ with 5-10% left. This is with a day of use 12-14h, pluss my cell coverage is shit. Guess with better cell coverage I could get even better battery life. Also have bluetooth connected to moto 360 all day).   Would buy n6 again. Cannot get into smaller phones again. G3 feels tiny and the one m7 feels way to small."

My first one would randomly shut down, this refurb I have had a issue with the sensor when I made calls. It works now but its going to be torture if shit hits the fan again. The support is garbage and this phone has no one hand support so unless you have big hands I would avoid this phone. Retailers are only buying this phone back for 6$.

Difference is, yours was quite plainly a knee-jerk childish response to something you don't understand, and you aren't going to.  Terminations happen for a variety of reasons and are almost always abrupt.  An employer is never going to detail the reasons for a termination to the public.  We don't even know half the story here, people are just making shit up.  People come to this sub to get information.  Users, more than the mods provide this content.  You saw it in your right to deprive others of content we have created and shared.  You decided that people looking for information during the period you threw your tantrum couldn't get it here.  That's shitty.   Nevermind you didn't have a dog in this fight.  Nothing that happened effected this sub what-so-ever.

That's what you can do at this point, make it right by the users... if you continue to sit on a high horse about an issue you know very little about, which didn't affect you, which you handled in a hypocritical way, many of us will lose any respect."

nexus6,3c3uqj,Khaiyan,13,Sat Jul 4 19:10:10 2015 UTC,Mods think that they're making such a big difference because this tiny sub will cause all of Reddit to collapse under the protest.

nexus6,3c3uqj,ssjumper,4,Sat Jul 4 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"Yes but this is like a tip of a snowflake, no general customer would know about the N6, so this niche subreddit makes a bigger impact on the users than on Reddit as a whole."

All I am trying to say is dont make a rash decision, give some time for this community to express how the really feel.  Edit: Updated information.  PS: Isn't it required to keep user to user issues in PM's or with moderators? And not in the general setting. Sounds like you guys have an issue's with how admins communicate with you folks, and it has spilled over into the general setting."

nexus6,3c3uqj,mtbow,3,Sat Jul 4 16:34:25 2015 UTC,This seems like a fair reply. Don't know why you have so many downvotes for taking a principled stand in your own sub.

nexus6,3c3uqj,ssjumper,5,Sat Jul 4 15:52:08 2015 UTC,then what reason do you have for going dark? the whole point was that moderators of large subs were essentially putting in full-time hours with no compensation.    you probably just did this because your autistic desire to have power over a community was greater than your desire to prove yourself a good moderator.
nexus6,3c3uqj,Khaiyan,-8,Sat Jul 4 15:56:28 2015 UTC,lol don't mind them.. man people really freak out for anything

I plan on leaving as soon as an alternative becomes viable but until then I'm stuck and bitching about it and telling people who volunteer to mod subs for our personal enjoyment to go fuck themselves because they don't want to participate in the pissy party is pointless and way over the line.

I stand with the users who just want access to information and content about something they are passionate about with no drama
nexus6,3c3uqj,taheromar,4,Sat Jul 4 16:23:19 2015 UTC,People like us are the silent majority.

The protest was because the admins did not even bother to let the iama community KNOW that they had fired the person who had been organizing all their upcoming AMAs, they had to find out through someone else, and the admins had no plan for how to deal with future AMAs.  So really, it was more about the lack of caring/communication from the admins to mods than victoria's firing, and so because it's the admins not communicating with ANY mods, ALL mods are affected, all subs are affected, and so the mods rallied together to make their voices heard by blacking out a ton of subreddits to bring awareness and to show the admins they were serious."
nexus6,3c3uqj,Khaiyan,-6,Sat Jul 4 18:30:18 2015 UTC,The censorship on reddit affects us all and signals a fundamental shift in the nature of this site.
nexus6,3c3uqj,KilimIG,5,Sun Jul 5 03:04:39 2015 UTC,What censorship?
nexus6,3c3uqj,Khaiyan,-2,Sat Jul 4 17:53:08 2015 UTC,"Here's the link http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27100773 and an excerpt   Banned words.  The issue was brought to light by a Reddit user nicknamed Creq who posted a message to the site a week ago suggesting that 20 terms had been banned.  He said the list of censored words included: ""National Security Agency"", ""GCHQ"", ""Anonymous"", ""anti-piracy"", ""Bitcoin"", ""Snowden"" and ""net neutrality"".  It later became clear that other terms, including ""EU Court"", ""startup"" and ""Assange"" had also been blocked. An apology has been posted to the top of the technology subreddit's page  When the Daily Dot questioned one of the section's volunteer moderators about this, he confirmed that software was being used to automatically delete posts that featured ""politicised"" words in order to avoid the links making it to the core list of most popular topics.   Here's some more.  Auto censorship based on words is becoming the norm across a lot of subreddits and their mods are being corrupted into following the orders."
nexus6,3c3uqj,KilimIG,-16,Sat Jul 4 18:30:38 2015 UTC,"A bit hyperbolic, but that's actually exactly what this is but on a much, much more important scale... genuinely thanks for pointing this out."
nexus6,3c3uqj,kirbydude1234,13,Sat Jul 4 19:00:08 2015 UTC,"Please understand that reddit internet drama is pathetic and any sub who engages in it isn't worth the time of day, even more so when it's part of the lynch mob you just described.      reddit doesn't owe us anything, they facilitate a user generated bulletin board, if reddit went away tomorrow our lives would all continue unimpeded and we'd simply find somewhere else to get the same information. No one with an actual life gives a fuck about Victoria leaving or reddit not giving it's users a heads up about internal company occurrences. Grow up"
nexus6,3c3uqj,KilimIG,-4,Sat Jul 4 15:52:06 2015 UTC,so sorry you didnt have access to redditors to do all your fucking google search work for you for a day. you are so very inconvenienced. way to be a cunt about it.
nexus6,3c3uqj,kirbydude1234,-3,Sat Jul 4 15:09:35 2015 UTC,"Pff, stop being a grown up man. Thats not funny"
nexus6,3c3uqj,KilimIG,-22,Sat Jul 4 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"Actually I would argue that reddit does owe the moderators of subs - all of whom volunteer - a proper system of communication, which thus far has been completely absent. Of course, reddit doesn't actually matter, and as you say, if it disappeared tomorrow, all of our lives would continue unimpeded. However, mods do a lot of high quality and voluntary work for the site, and as such, should be treated with a certain degree of respect; something that the admins have never done to a legitimate extent. Just like you, I do not give two shits about Victoria leaving - that is up to her employers, however sad it may be for the userbase, and however fond one might be of her. The point stands though, that a major and essential part of arguably reddit's biggest commercial and most famous (outside of the site) asset, /r/IAmA, was removed with no notice to those who give up their time voluntarily to organise AMAs, thereby rather fucking everything up for at least 48 hours, if not longer, that they have spent their time, FOR FREE, setting up. This was completely symbolic of the constant bullshit that the admins spew at mods across reddit, and therefore was the sparkpoint for a protest against general poor treatment of mods, not of the sacking of Victoria. We joined in to show our displeasure at the admins' stream of crap, in the hope that the more subs were on board (as long as the community was happy for it to go dark), the greater the message would be to reddit management. This was not done pettily or for the sake of the ""DAE Victoria!!11!!?!!!!1!"" circlejerk.   I hope that clears things up."
nexus6,3c3uqj,mchungames4441,12,Sat Jul 4 15:16:43 2015 UTC,all of whom volunteer   This is really getting old.  You know what you're getting into when you sign up to become a mod.  No one forces you to do it.

nexus6,3bwdk6,effingsteam,5,Thu Jul 2 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"i don't think it's really all that necessary since most ROMs are based off CM/AOSP/Google Factory images. most developers borrow and take features from each other all the time and usually the big aftermarket branches with the development resources will hold onto a ""key feature"" for a limited amount of time before the entire community uses it.  descriptions like [extreme battery], [deodexed], [ultra smooth] in a XDA thread title are just fluff words. while searching for what ROMs to use, i'd suggest looking at the build that it's based on (e.g. 5.1.1_r6 or LMY48G) to see if it's updated, the last update that took place, and what kernel they're using."

nexus6,3byusb,altimax98,2,Fri Jul 3 11:07:30 2015 UTC,What's happening is the 4S is seeing your Nexus 6 as a WiFi network and it sees the iPhone as a hotspot. Devices are built to run differently on different connections. My iPad does the same thing when it comes to background downloading and such.  Maybe true Bluetooth tethering instead and see if it recognizes it properly
nexus6,3byusb,altimax98,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:02:49 2015 UTC,Thanks. Bluetooth works on iPad to nexus 6 and uses little data but will not pair using 4s or 6 plus via Bluetooth. Must be an iPhone thing. Will just have to wait until the android version is out. Hopefully all the bugs in it will be ironed out by then anyway.

nexus6,3bvlv9,cdegallo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:33:46 2015 UTC,"The advantages are you can install any operating system version you want when you want, rather than when/if you get an ota.  You can also do some very powerful things with root that highly improve the overall experience (like alternative user interfaces/navigation menus, which are nice on a phone this size).  And tons I'd other things can be enabled, like the led indicator light that is disabled by default.  Battery optimizations.  Etc.  The downsides are you can screw it up if you don't know what you are doing, and leave your phone open to security vulnerabilities that otherwise aren't there with an unmodified phone.  The former is the bigger concern, as you can brick a phone, but with so much support for this phone, I'd highly unlikely given so many step by step tutorials and instructions at places like gate and xda, etc."

First try not to charge the device while using navigation, place the device somewhere the sun cant get to it if all possible, and keep ac going.  I have a car with a little cubby hole underneath the stereo that I mount it to, and even when charging it gets hot, but not crazy hot like you seem to be experiencing. The extreme heat can damage the phone so try not to let it get that hot if your able to.   I damaged a screen on my first gen note running navigation on the windshield with the sun on it."

Basically my results now are 4h-4h30m SOT, obviously this is subjective and people who report 8 hours are obviously sacrificing a lot of what the nexus 6 can do to get there.

It requires you to have developer options enabled, the platform-tools installed on your PC, and the Google USB driver.  Sometimes when your phone initially connects, it wont show in adb so you have to manually point the phone driver in the device manager to be the Google adb device.  Edit: keep in mind when playing with this number you can cause some poorly written apps to freak out.  For instance, I would prefer to be at 400, but the Sirius/XM app chokes when the dpi is below 432.  Hence, my 433.  Also, be sure to reboot in between changes."

nexus6,3btntv,Faldorn,3,Thu Jul 2 01:35:57 2015 UTC,Can you check in battery stats for any suspect. It shouldn't act like this at all. Try restoring if nothing works before looking at other options.
nexus6,3btntv,asifms,3,Thu Jul 2 02:21:07 2015 UTC,You have a faulty battery. RMA the device.
nexus6,3btntv,tjharman,2,Thu Jul 2 02:46:42 2015 UTC,"That might be so, but considering the battery lasted a full day of normal use, what seems to be faulty is the phone's ability to track the current battery percentage. That indeed may be because something about the battery is faulty. However it is still staying on as long as it did before it was faulty, just reporting the wrong percentage.  My concern is that it will not properly recharge to true 100% in this state. Now that would be a problem!  I know you can root the device and delete data/system/batterystats.bin which will require the phone to recalibrate the battery stats. That sounds like a better first step, assuming this keeps up. Gonna hold out for more advice before doing that though. Running battery tests for now."
nexus6,3btntv,tjharman,4,Thu Jul 2 03:05:43 2015 UTC,"Deleting batterystats.bin is a stupid myth that's been debunked by senior Android developers.  There is this thread that was pointed out to me a while ago about fixing the way the phone reports its battery, but you have a read and see if you think it really works long term (hint: Doesn't seem to) - read the posts by Claire.  The steps are:   Power off your phone. Press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons. This will put the phone in fastboot. Use the Volume buttons to scroll through the menu until you see ""Bootloader logs"" Press and hold the power key for a long time (7+ seconds) until the phone reboots.   That might help.  But it really sounds like the battery is having trouble when any real load it being placed on it, causing the voltage to drop a large amount (which is how battery remaining percentage is calculated).  I'll be very surprised if you don't have a faulty battery.  You might be able to dick about with it for a while, but you'll just be fooling yourself.  A normal, properly functional battery doesn't take massive leaps down as yours does.  Sorry, I know no one likes to read bad news. Good luck."
nexus6,3btntv,33165564,5,Thu Jul 2 03:28:21 2015 UTC,"Can confirm that this method worked for me. Mine was shutting off when showing 60-70% life left.
