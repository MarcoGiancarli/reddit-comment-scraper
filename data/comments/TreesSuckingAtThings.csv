TreesSuckingAtThings,3cloez,omahaks,8,Wed Jul 8 21:55:17 2015 UTC,Birdswitharms is about birds that have arms. A lot of times people post humans with bird heads. That is the opposite! The comments are people just running with the established joke.

TreesSuckingAtThings,32cctt,nathanplays,18,Sun Apr 12 18:58:03 2015 UTC,This was almost me and a friend and an ex about 7 years ago.  Late night stroll with the three of us plus my dog.  We get about a block from my house and my dog sees a mouse and wants to chase.  We stop for about 20-30seconds so my dog can calm down and the mouse and run off.  Just as we get moving a huge tree starts falling over right about were we would have been walking.  Thing was all dead and rotten and just decided it needed to fsll apart at that moment.  I'm still convinced to this day that mouse bro saved our lives.

TreesSuckingAtThings,2xfazf,HomicideSS,19,Sat Feb 28 08:14:08 2015 UTC,"It looks like it got hit by a hurricane or tornado as a youngish tree. It got partially uprooted, but not before the trunk was badly damaged - snapped, but not completely separated. The way it got uprooted made it so the tree at the snap was lying down on itself, with the top of the tree twisted back toward its roots.  This tree, though, is one bad-ass motherfucker. It survives because fuck you, Weather. The crown of the tree still wants to grow straight up at the sun, so it does - at a 270° angle. In time, the snap starts healing over.  Then some human comes by and is astonished at the fact that this half-uprooted tree is not only alive, but growing. So the human digs it up, either brings it home or to a plant nursery, and plants it so that the bottom-most part of the trunk is once again perpendicular to the ground. The tree's earlier 270° angle is no longer any good, but it continues growing up to the sun, completing the loop.  You see a bunch of weird palm trees like that here in South Florida. Tree nursery owners will head out into the Everglades after hurricanes to see if there are any of these bad-ass motherfuckers around, bring 'em home, grow 'em good, and sell 'em for a fuck-ton of money because ""How does that even happen?"""

TreesSuckingAtThings,2watsu,autowikibot,2,Thu Feb 19 08:42:07 2015 UTC,"Inosculation:       Inosculation is a natural phenomenon in which trunks, branches or roots of two trees grow together. It is biologically very similar to grafting.  It is most common for branches of two trees of the same species to grow together, though inosculation may be noted across related species. The branches first grow separately in proximity to each other until they touch. At this point, the bark on the touching surfaces is gradually abraded away as the trees move in the wind. [clarification needed] Once the cambium of two trees touches, they self-graft and grow together. Inosculation customarily results when tree limbs are braided or pleached.  The term ""inosculation"" is also used in the context of plastic surgery, as one of the three mechanisms by which skin grafts take at the host site. Blood vessels from the recipient site are believed to connect with those of the graft in order to restore vascularity.

He had several trees like this with circles of yellow-flowered plants around each one that lined his driveway. Cue huge storm, lots of loud and nearby lightening strikes, fallen branches, etc.   I get up the next morning to head to the local college when I realize that all the flowers around one of the trees had died. They weren't charred or burned, just VERY dead and dried, like you see things in the desert in movies. The tree looked fine... Until I drove back up his driveway later.  Sure enough, the half of the tree facing AWAY from the house was just as dead, not a single leaf left and split top to bottom. I was astonished that, from the house, the only hint that anything was wrong was the perfect ring of dead flowers."

TreesSuckingAtThings,2ldeuz,anangryrock,4,Thu Nov 6 03:39:43 2014 UTC,it's a bike path
TreesSuckingAtThings,2ldeuz,thealaneffect,2,Wed Nov 5 16:11:30 2014 UTC,Seriously? It's made of (seemingly very separated) bricks! That doesn't look like it's any good for cycling on...

TreesSuckingAtThings,2ldeuz,Armadylspark,0,Thu Nov 6 20:26:22 2014 UTC,trees are jerks
TreesSuckingAtThings,2ldeuz,thealaneffect,0,Thu Nov 6 20:30:02 2014 UTC,My nephew is a tree and he is so leafing rude.
TreesSuckingAtThings,2ldeuz,AllrightsunnyD,2,Thu Nov 6 00:27:57 2014 UTC,its not that hard to leaf room for others. you should plant your foot in your nephew's ass. its about time someone gets to the root of his problem.

TreesSuckingAtThings,2lcjbt,pennypinball,3,Wed Nov 5 20:04:53 2014 UTC,"This was on the California State Monterey Bay campus for years. Sadly it was destroyed by some vandals in 2011.   The artist was a friend of mine named Jeff Mifflin. As a testament to his unwavering zen condition, when confronted with the news that his piece had been destroyed, he responded: ""(...) some people in this world like to make things, and some people in this world like to destroy them. That's their art. (...) Both are valid."""

TreesSuckingAtThings,2l7uha,JimOlmeyer,59,Tue Nov 4 01:35:07 2014 UTC,I'd say that tree is doing pretty darn good at taking a leisurely stroll. I don't know what you're talking about.

TreesSuckingAtThings,2l7uha,TurboShorts,3,Tue Nov 4 06:18:21 2014 UTC,The sad part is we even have rules against this behaviour but it's anarchy in here!
TreesSuckingAtThings,2l7uha,Toby-one,2,Tue Nov 4 11:36:03 2014 UTC,OP should have posted a timelapse to prove to us this tree wasn't really going anywhere.

TreesSuckingAtThings,2l7uha,AllrightsunnyD,8,Tue Nov 4 02:50:05 2014 UTC,Why do people still post trees being good at things on this sub? I feel like every post is exactly like this and regardless of everyones attempts (including the mods') they still come up.
