business,3e2a0o,IHateTheRedTeam,8,Tue Jul 21 13:27:26 2015 UTC,"Note, they're in Japan, not the US. I have no idea what the financial reporting laws are in Japan. It might very well be a go to jail thing.  The real question is: what the heck were their auditors doing? Why was this not caught? Edit: a touch of research shows that Toshiba's auditors are under the microscope too: http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Toshiba-s-accounting-firm-going-under-the-microscope-next  I assume that Japan uses IFRS, which has auditing requirements just like the GAAP."
business,3e2a0o,elvendude,4,Tue Jul 21 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"IFRS (and the GAAP of any particular country) is a set of financial reporting standards, not audit standards. You may be thinking of ISA (international standards of auditing).  Toshiba reports under US GAAP, which is allowed in Japan if a company meets certain eligibility requirements.  You're right in that the auditors absolutely should have caught this. I found this quote in your linked article pretty amusing: ""That panel has already found that employees gave auditors explanations not reflective of reality, so it does not suspect that auditors are at fault.""  Under ISA or any other rational set of audit standards, the entire point of the audit profession is independent verification. Employees giving you misleading explanations is not an excuse to overlook massive manipulation of earnings. It's nice when the client is helpful, but a chat with the client is not audit evidence.  The fundamental issue is most likely that they were afraid to challenge management for fear of losing a key client."

business,3e2a0o,ChickenMcTesticles,2,Tue Jul 21 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"I thought generally speaking auditors are not expected to find fraud for the exact reason listed above - it's far too easy for the client to just lie about what is going on, or collude among themselves.

So, auditors are absolutely expected to find fraud if it is material, which it was in this case.  Management override is a presumed fraud risk because, as you've said, they can collude. There are specifics tests we do to uncover evidence of this and we are, in fact, expected to see through it if it leads to a material misstatement.  Revenue also happens to be a presumed fraud risk for the exact reason you stated, though the article seems to be using the term ""earnings"" and ""profits"" interchangeably (they're not the same thing), so it's difficult to pinpoint where the actual issue was. The auditors were not as thorough as they should have been, I promise you that."

business,3e2a0o,nettu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"If it was as extensive as falsifying documentation then no, the auditors would probably find a way to get off the hook legally (thinking about Barry Minkow), but I'm not a lawyer so wouldn't know exactly what would result in a fine. I certainly did not mean to suggest an auditor would be prosecuted for negligence, I'm fairly certain that would only happen if the auditors were complicit (thinking of Arthur Andersen shredding documentation).  There's really no way to know whether or not the auditors were thorough without the details, but I would be very surprised if there wasn't some negligence involved.  EDIT: Misread your comment the first time."
business,3e2a0o,Durpulous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"If it were that simple then it would have been caught out early on. It was likely to be an area that relied heavily on management judgement - it may have had nothing to do with revenue. A lot of these articles are mixing up their use of ""earnings"" and ""profit"", but these are two different things, neither of which are ""revenue"" (the word ""earnings"" is often used synonymous with ""revenue"" but there are actually several ways to measure it). The FT likely has a more accurate reporting but I've yet to read about it there.  Also keep in mind that the misreported earnings doesn't neccessarily mean that they made up those earnings out of thin air. They could have misallocated them to the wrong accounting period.  As an example, provisions are typically an area that require management judgement. Management may have a legal claim that their lawyers say they are highly likely to lose and will cost them $100m. In reality they all know they won't lose the case. So, management credits provisions for $100m and you get a huge charge to your income statement for the same amount - but management doesn't care because it's a good year.  Then, a couple of years later when it's not a good year, the lawyers revise their estimate to $50m and you release the other half with a credit to the income statement. You've basically created a cookie jar for yourself that can be used to boost your profits in a bad year.  A good auditor will, in theory, see through that crap and won't simply smile and nod when the lawyers pull a number out of their ass. However, auditors are not engineers. To explain where they got their number, Toshiba might decide to roll out their most annoying patent lawyer to inundate you with technical blueprints and legal jargon and hope you accept the explanation without actually understanding it. At this point the auditor should bring a specialist in - but they often don't if it will ruin their budget.  EDIT: Missed a word."
business,3e2a0o,Durpulous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:28 2015 UTC,I agree - I was too hasty to lay blame on the audit firm in my first comment.    The NYT is saying    accusations that they drove the company to overstate its earnings by $1.2 billion over the last seven years.   They don't state how they are calculating that figure - the net impact to any particular period might not be material - but judging by the amount it would be a very close call.    Reading between the lines of these articles I am guessing this is a revenue cut-off issue rather than recognizing income from relieving a liability.  Over a 7 year period totaling $1.2 (USD) that misstatement would be more than than 0.5% of revenue for each period in question.    I would bet E&Y is using a materiality level lower than that for their audit.

Yeah, in reading/skimming through a couple of other articles, it seems that this was (much like the Olympus thing a while back) more a matter of mid-level people having done various things to either ""boost"" their own division's ""profit"" performance, and/or to hide/bury losses... and that upper management at some point became aware of it, and rather than expose/correct it, they colluded to continue the coverup.  It's pretty banal stuff -- the kind of thing that quite frankly goes on in just about every corporation -- especially those that establish ""targets"" and pay incentives based on them: doing so is pretty much just begging the employees to ""game"" the system.  There are in fact far worse ""shenanigans"" that are going on with much more ""high flying"" corporations -- including everyone from Apple, to Google, to the various non-GAAP ""creative accounting"" shenanigans of Elon Musks companies; to say nothing of the major TBTF Banks -- many of those are far more akin to the Enron kind of fraud.

business,3dzf2p,WalterBright,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:52:53 2015 UTC,Lets get back to the topic of capital gains(unearned income) vs earned income. Many people pay less in capital gains than earned income would. Does that make sense?
business,3dzf2p,adidasbdd,3,Tue Jul 21 04:12:40 2015 UTC,"This is not a simple question.   Short term CG tax rates are the same as earned income rates. Long term CG tax rates, for each tax bracket, are lower than income tax rates. A component of CG returns is inflation - that's taxed, too. You can lose money with CGs, too. You don't get a tax credit for that. CG tax rates are usually set at levels to encourage investment. The higher the CG tax rates, the more misallocation of resources there will be due to tax avoidance strategies. Higher CG rates will produce a shift towards income producing investments, such as dividends and bonds.   Dramatically changing tax rates will have all kinds of side effects, often unintended and unanticipated. I'd be very careful about such things."

If you were looking for ways to lessen the friction of taxes in this country, I'd suggest starting with the poorest Americans, those who have a very high marginal value on each dollar they earn.  Additionally, poor Americans have paid a heavy price to prop up the current status quo, in particular revive equities to some very high price levels. Seeing as the poorest Americans don't participate in the stock market, it's pretty easy to see why many see the American capitalistic system as rigged.

Raising capital gains rate makes way more sense than simply taxing all stock and bond transactions at a flat rate if your objective is to redistribute wealth a little bit. Rich people make a significantly larger portion of their income via stocks and bonds than everybody else. This is the case because they have the capital to invest. The guy struggling to make rent every month can't invest. By imposing a 50 cent tax on every transaction yet keeping capital gains rates the same, Bernie effectively makes it harder for the average American to invest (because that 50 cent tax matters to Joe schmo buying and selling $200 worth of securities but it doesn't matter at all to the rich guy buying and selling a million dollars in each transaction). It also shrinks the economy because people are less willing to invest and the market is less responsive. There's nothing wrong with a fast, responsive market free of government transaction fees, there is something wrong with the type of income earned mostly by the top 5% of Americans being taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income."

business,3e04di,Crecy333,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:50:13 2015 UTC,"Managers/management need to do their job and empower employees. That's not HRs job. HR should make sure management do that in a legal, ethical and non discriminatory manner.  IMO HR should be a passive role, invisible to most employees outside of joining/leaving the firm. Most employees should have no need to contact HR unless they feel mistreated or discriminated against. From the management POV, HR should get out of the way until explicitly engaged to help deal with the legalities around employee promotion/demotion/reprimand. In other words, HR should not be involved with day to day activities and instead focus on the hiring (attracting talent, if the company is large enough maybe you have internal recruiters) and firing (or that legal grey area about ""managing out""/getting a poor performing employee to move on without actually firing them).   It'll never work if HR tries to build ""company culture"". Culture comes from the guys on the ground, not some rubber stamped new policy.   I've worked at a few small/medium companies that were big enough to hire an HR person (department of one) but not big enough to keep that person busy. Inevitably, HR started sticking their nose in elsewhere and making stupid changes or taking on tasks that had really nothing to do with HR, but somehow came resulted in an HR spin to justify their continued employment.   You need to interview someone with at least two direct reports who are also doing HR responsibilities other than recruitment - recruitment can be easily outsourced, so it's like managing contractors instead of actual HR employees. Also doing payroll doesn't count. That belongs to the accounting dept. Actually that could be your first question, who handles payroll - Accounting or HR?"

A ""bubble"" typically refers to a period of excessive valuations. If Google's current standing is attributable to a tech bubble that would indicate they have a low or unprofitable business model with a tremendous market value.  As it stands Google makes plenty of money: $14.44B in 2014 and TTM net income to common of $14.57B. They're also growing, with their 5-year EPS growth rate standing at 15.53% and revenue at 22.8%.   Their valuation at current prices results in a 33 P/E, 18.8 P/CF versus the S&P 500's of 19 and 11.7, respectively. Arguably this is attributable to their fast growth on both top and bottom lines."

business,3dngz2,noodlez,4,Sat Jul 18 13:31:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, but there was no way for you to know that the price would go up like it did. If you want to invest look for mutual funds. These are similar to stock in that they have shares and a price per share, but they contain stock from multiple companies. Some funds contain other funds. One fund I have from Vanguard contains other funds, bonds, and cash. You'll have to see what's offered in your country and currency.   You would want to invest in a fund rather than an individual stock to diversify the assets you own. If you have all of your money in Evil Corp. and they go bankrupt you've lost all your money. If your mutual fund has Evil Corp. in it and it goes bankrupt, you won't lose all of your money because you're also invested in other companies.  Mutual funds and stocks also pay out dividends and capital gains, but not always. A dividend is money paid to you just for owning a share. It's not very much, but it adds up the more shares you have. If you own 1000 shares in a mutual fund and they pay out 5 cents per share for the year, they give you $50. You can choose to take the money, or reinvest it to buy more shares. Dividends are taxed, so sometimes it's not in your best interest to get a dividend, and you can't turn down a dividend. If a stock or fund pays out a dividend it's yours and it's taxed.  Edit: If you look at Google's revenue, you'll notice it's about $1 billion lower than it was two quarters ago, yet their stock price is at an all time high. Even though revenue went down, costs went down and profits went up. People are investing in the future of Google believing that their profit will continue to go up"

business,3dm66l,ReallyRick,18,Fri Jul 17 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of ways to look at it. I think the banks get too much of the ire from the financial meltdown but many of the actors deserve a proportionate share of the blame - The fed, fannie/Freddie, AIG, Country Wide, the government were just as culpable. Nobody was without blood on their hands but the government decided very early on that the banks would be the scape goat. Which makes sense since that's the logical place to start from a regulatory perspective.   Looking at the banks individually, GS is certainly less culpable than many of the others. First of all, they didn't originate mortgages - they were simply middlemen fulfilling demand for a product. Second, they took a much lower-risk approach than the other banks in the mortgage market and were offloading risk earlier than most if not all of the other banks. Yet Goldman by far draws the biggest criticism despite these facts.   The head of the banks are always going to be culpable for their entire firms behavior. But how much did he know about manipulating Greece's debt problems away? Probably nothing at all. How much did Jaime Dimon know about the London Whale? Probably nothing.  Lastly, he just comes off a lot more humble and down to earth than the other bank CEOs."
business,3dm66l,naked_short,9,Fri Jul 17 18:44:28 2015 UTC,"Never been able to meet him myself, but I've only heard good things about him personally.

Not to mention, everyone says he's very personable and I've never heard of anyone having an unpleasant experience with him.  The person you hear the most ""isn't he the best?'s"" about on Wall Street is Lloyd Blankfein.  I can't think of a Wall Street banker more deserving of success.  Some might say Wall Street banker is a low bar, but it's higher than you think, and it could probably be higher and Lloyd would still come out on top."

You can better blame the individual politicians.   But those politicians just did what the banks told them to do. They just tried to raise as much money as possible to win elections and made some bad promises.  You could blame the american people for not protesting for a better political system.   Placing blame is a difficult issue altogether.  It's better to talk about what might solve the problem for the future, and it mainly involves regulating the banks, but you're correct to say that AIG and other actors may also share some blame."
business,3dm66l,redditor3000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:35:09 2015 UTC,"Why would it be lame to blame the government? They're responsible for the body of laws that set the structure of this and all markets. People like to blame the behavior of the banks for the crisis but the fact is that the banks were behaving perfectly rationally within the system of laws. There was demand for a product that they were in a unique position to create. The chief reason for the extraordinary amounts of demand for these products was soley a function of government doctrine. The federal reserve, a government agency, set interest rates too low creating too much monetary liquidity and forcing institutional money into riskier and riskier products. The government demanded that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac step up purchases of both private-label MBS and privately-originated mortgages during the worst years of the crisis, making the bubble far worse than it would have been if it had been allowed to pop in late '06/early '07 when housing took its initial downturn.   The banks are definitely not without blame but the official story is certainly not one that I put much stock in. If you read the financial crisis inquiry report I think it's difficult to agree with their conclusions which became the prominent narrative in the public consciousness. This sweeping narrative allowed the government to pass laws which they claim ""solved the crisis"" but in fact just swept the majority of the problems under the rug."

business,3dnm5j,Wannabe2good,2,Sun Jul 19 04:33:56 2015 UTC,"My wife and I started a business four years ago that employs us full time.  If I had to do it over again, I would have waited until we had more capital to invest and more cash reserves.  Instead of capitalizing the business properly so it may grow, we consistently cannibalize it for living expenses.    Also, I was intrigued by working from home so I could spend more time with the kids.  Kids don't like it when you work, they want your full attention when you are there.  Sorting out work/life balance while I worked from home took far more time and energy than I ever would have anticipated.  I am looking forward to achieving growth that warrants leasing an office so that business is conducted outside the home.  It would make that separation of work/life all that easier.   Lastly, in building a business, everything takes longer than you think it will and costs more than you think it should.  Don't price your product to undercut the competition, make your product's quality worth the premium.  As you grow, you can scale to a competitive price.  It is easier to cut your prices than raise them."

Everyone here's talking about how they wouldn't hire Bill Gates to be the secretary or bring in an NBA star to their pick-up game.  What I think a lot of folks are failing to see is that at the end of the day what they teach you at an Ivy league school is not that significantly different than at a non-Ivy or even 2nd tier school. At the end of the day what the Ivy's really afford their students are networks. Granted the concentration of top ""genius"" level prospects are probably higher at the top schools, but I would be willing to bet that the median Ivy is no brighter than the median 2nd tier school student. Seriously think about it. All the tests and qualifications the top schools put out there are just maxed out meaning that the schools have to look at other qualities such as extra curricular activities, essays, and financial donations even. how good are you at picking out people from that? A lot of other companies (google being one of them) have recently announced that they are placing less precedence on performance in school than before. the primary reason (as far as I remember) was that book smarts do not necessarily translate to real world productivity.   In my own experience having an Ivy degree helps grads with springboarding to their first job out of school. After that it's really up to their own skill level.   To boot have any of you seen the complaints here about how hard it is for law school grads to get jobs. Granted top school grads still get jobs but it's not necessarily top level jobs.   Sorry for the rant just sick of people idolizing the Ivy's like it's a place where the gods wander."

I have noticed that ivy leagues get much higher profile guest speakers, professors and so on, so I do think they tend to excel in teaching to the real world vs. Theory (especially in something like economics) but that doesn't count for shit if the student has a mental breakdown from competing on every little assignment. Ivy leagues do have higher suicide rates than regular schools."

I mean yeah if youre a student there you're supposed to be smart but at the end of the day your grades are supposed to be a reflection of how well you are against your peers but if everyone makes the same grade what does that mean for you as a student or the teacher/university in general?

business,3dmmg3,jeffhext,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:19:41 2015 UTC,"remember what Coca-Cola did to those Union Leaders... killed them with death squads).   This is quite a claim that has no basis in fact.  Let's look at the 11th Circuit's opinion affirming the district court's dismissal of all claims:   Plaintiffsâ complaints outline a litany of unfortunate events occurring in a country that Plaintiffs describe as experiencing ongoing civil unrest and lacking a robust legal system. Nevertheless, as explained above, the Gil, Galvis, and Leal plaintiffs fail to sufficiently plead factual allegations to connect the paramilitary forces, who perpetrated the wrongful acts, with the Colombian government.   Furthermore, the Garcia plaintiffs fail to sufficiently plead factual allegations to connect the Panamco Defendants to actionable torture. We affirm the dismissal of the ATS claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We vacate the dismissal of the TVPA claims for want of jurisdiction and instruct the district court to enter a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.   Let's pay particular attention to Coca-Cola's alleged involvement in the incidents:   The court determined a bottlerâs agreement, which gave Coca-Cola USA the right to enforce standards necessary to protect Coca-Colaâs product in the marketplace, including the use of the trademark, packaging, and quality control, did not give Coca-Cola USA the total control over day-to-day activities that Plaintiffs alleged. It concluded the Coca-Cola Defendants therefore did not have the requisite control to be liable for the actions of Bebidas or its employees.   So basically we have three bottling companies, Bebidas, Alimentos de UrabÃ¡ and Panamco Colombia, that contracted with Coco-Cola de Colombia (Coca-Cola USA's Colombian subsidiary).  The killings you're talking about occurred at the Bebidas facility, where Coca-Cola de Colombia only had contractual permission to regulate trademark, packaging and quality control standards (i.e. they made regular inspections of the facilities).  They did not operate or control the facilities.  And nothing happened at Coca-Cola de Colombia's facilities, so there is absolutely nothing to tie the acts of the paramilitary units and local police officers to Coca-Cola de Colombia or Coca-Cola USA."

If you want to learn how to apply the theory and strategy you're trained in, you first have to put some serious boots to the ground to learn how a real business works day to day.   This wont help for monday's interview, but look up your local polytechnic and consider taking a day or night excel class. It will only help in your interviews if you can speak intelligently about using excel. Hope this helps."

business,3dlg7k,LegalShieldJon,3,Fri Jul 17 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"MLM doesn't always mean it's a scam.  MLM companies focus on selling a dream.  They'll show success stories and people like your sister get inspired and think they can achieve that success too.  And you know what, maybe she can.  But the odds are stacked against her.    By nature, an MLM is set up to focus on having reps like your sister a) sell mediocre quality products at huge markups and b) recruit other people to be reps ""under"" her.  The latter is where the company makes the majority of their money (both in dues and in scale). Think of it like this, most companies want to hire a good sales rep that can sell, say, 100 products on their own.  An MLM wants to have 100 people that can sell 1 deal, and you can almost guarantee that any rep that signs up will sell a few deals to friends and family (plus the ""demo kit"" that rep had to buy themselves).  The vast majority of people get hyped up, pay their money, then hit a dead end once they've exhausted all the sales they can get from friends and family.  There are much better ways to make money.  For the amount of work it takes to be successful at MLM, she could probably start her own business and make greater margins and not have to worry about recruiting other reps.   If the startup costs aren't huge (like more than a couple hundred) then you might have to let her learn the hard way.  It's a cheap lesson and you get to say you told her so.  If it's more than that, or if it interferes with something more important (like school or a real job) then it's a problem.  Also, if your sister is the type of person that could become super annoying about selling this shit on Facebook and at thanksgiving dinner, then you might want to put up a fight."
business,3dlg7k,sendmorewhisky,3,Fri Jul 17 07:33:42 2015 UTC,"MLM companies focus on selling a dream. They'll show success stories and people like your sister get inspired and think they can achieve that success....   This is true with all MLM companies, but whether or not they have a good compensation scale or product it is the only realistic way to motivate since there is no fixed income. It would be silly if a company were to advocate little to mediocre amount of income potential.. heh.  But on your side of the debate, I've seen plenty of promo videos and recruiters basically promise $5,000 a month within months... lol! Those guys are scumbags that hard close on costly MLM startup fees for new recruits that are uneducated.  There are some reputable companies in the top 20 MLM list, which I believe Primerica is one, but financials is a tough product to sell and you have to usually take insurance license classes. /u/dude12322 I'd tell her to do more research on other companies if she's interested in trying MLM. I have female friends that are successful in some of the makeup MLMs, and other friends finding success in LegalShield."
business,3dlg7k,LegalShieldJon,2,Fri Jul 17 08:39:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to generalize all MLMs here, I don't have first hand experience with this one in particular.  Here's the big issue I have with even reputable MLMs:   I'm willing to bet that his sister didn't wake up one day and say ""I want to get into MLM sales"".  I'll bet she has little to no sales experience.  I'll bet she also has no experience as a business owner.  She has no idea what she's getting into, and she's only hearing one side of the opportunity, the company's side.  She's probably not using any critical thinking about it, and is buying into the emotional response they triggered in her.  They are very good at that.     MLMs are great at marketing the dream.  They're awesome about parading the .01% that have been successful in front of a room full of people that have a dream of improving their situation, or ambitions of getting rich quick.    They prey on those people, not in the sense that their being fraudulent, most at least, but in the sense that they do not tell you how long and challenging the road ahead will be.  They use highly refined recruitment tactics against people that aren't a match for that, mainly due to inexperience, and convince them that they just need to write their check for a demo kit, follow the system and BAM... Money.  The reality is that as an MLM sales rep you are a business owner.  There are challenges to that, there's risk involved, and it takes a long time to build.  However good their comp plan is, it's not good enough for most people to thrive in that business model. It's disproportionate to the amount of time, effort and risk required.   On top of that, your business in this case is worthless.  All this work to earn commission, but what's the exit strategy?  What exactly is the valuation on the book of business you build?  If you wanted to sell it, could you?  What's the multiple?  There is none; because there are no assets, IP, recurring revenue/subscription base, etc.You're not building any equity in anything. To that end, you're better off getting an entry level sales job with a small salary while you learn and the same opportunity to earn commissions.  It's the same upside, less risk.     Another issue for the average person is that they don't consider the opportunity cost.  The time they spend spinning their wheels at an MLM is better spent looking for a job, going to school, learning a trade or even writing a business plan and starting their own thing, etc.   Also, you can really strain relationships with friends and family with this shit.    Could /u/dude12322 's sister work their system and be successful?  Absolutely.  Is it likely?  Not even close.  All in all, I just don't think there's enough upside to even consider getting involved in MLM.  It's short sighted; even if you are the .01% that can hit it big, you'd be better off doing it for yourself."
business,3dlg7k,sendmorewhisky,3,Fri Jul 17 15:36:52 2015 UTC,"The benefit to MLM vs a traditional business, in regard the point you make about selling down the road, is the residual income generated that you can't get from simply owning a small business unless you get into licensing. You also have to admit startup and operating expenses are drastically different between the two.  And I'll agree with you MLMs do prey on anyone and everyone that they can find, but this doesn't mean Joe Schmoe who can't sell water in the dessert right now can't improve himself and become a superstar.. There is a lot of emphasis on personal growth in most MLMs, and some people never get adequate training or have the drive to succeed in the first place and have no shot --> 99.99% according to you stats.. ;)  I got into my MLM under the assumption I wouldn't make much money but would be for sure building a new stream of income that could someday fruit into residual income. My total investment was $150, along with a $17/mo membership, which viewed initially as investing in sales/business/networking training and personal growth, with an opportunity to make money.   **TL;DR:  MLMs aren't able to immediately replace primary income immediately as often promised, which is the ultimate misconception often causing new associates to fail due to unmet expectations.  Presented realistically and honestly there is room for success."
business,3dlg7k,LegalShieldJon,2,Fri Jul 17 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"I have to say, there are many, many business models based on residuals.  In fact, that happens to be a niche in which I have over 15 years experience so I can't agree to that being a benefit unique to MLM.  I will concede that I hadn't considered residual based MLM services, but was framing my argument around consumer product oriented models."
business,3dlg7k,sendmorewhisky,3,Sat Jul 18 02:32:52 2015 UTC,"May you grace me with some other residual ideas? :)   'Multiple Streams of Income' really peaked my interest in generating wealth and it's been a while since I've read it but he has some other legitimate killer ideas like licensing art, music, writing, etc in order to generate royalties. Would be nice."
business,3dlg7k,LegalShieldJon,2,Sat Jul 18 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"Well I'm in the telecom and IT industries.  There are a number of models in that space that are all about residuals.    Basically, you are a consultant.  You sign contracts with service providers like Comcast or ATT to sell their services and receive a commission in return.  You analyze a customers needs and help them find the right solution and service provider.  Then you sell an enterprise an Internet connection from Comcast for, say $1000 and a three year commitment.  Comcast pays you maybe 20%.  So you get $400 per month for 36 months.    There's over a 98% chance that customer renews.  Then you proactively up sell your base, but it will  naturally grow even if you don't.  The technology today really is so interdependent that it's really easy to laterally market other services.  The services are somewhat deflationary, so over time (3-6 years) that revenue starts to be reduced, but the demand for new services usually results in a net gain over time.    We call that the agent model.  In your case where you don't have telecom or IT experience, you'd be what we call a referral agent.  In this case you pitch a warm lead over the fence to an experienced rep and they do the rest.  Same compensation model, except the commission is more like 5-10%.    Most of the time there's a SPIF component as well, where you get an up front bonus of $500-$1000 per account in addition to the residuals.    The same model exists in IT, the products are managed services and cloud applications.  Comp isn't as rich there and there's less of a formal referral agent program.  We call them VARs and MSPs.    There are over 250,000 such businesses in telecom and IT in the US alone, and the channel (as we call it) accounts controls a huge portion of overall telecom and IT spend.    Energy is another; you audit energy bills and resell a competing provider.  This earns you a % of their monthly bill.  Most will also do consulting and even sell hardware like wind turbines and solar panels as a way to supplement the residuals.  That actually leads me to an additional residual revenue stream in these industries.  Telecom, IT and sustainable energy all have a hardware component.  Many will arrange the financing and earn points on the interest.    Ok, another opportunity is SaaS applications.  Essentially the same model, but generally closer to the residual structure.  For example, we sell a software called a content management system.  We give them a warm lead, and get 10% of the subscription fees.  We can earn up to 30%.  There are endless opportunities here including line of business software, expense management, HR, marketing automation.  Another is logistics.  Same model, except you analyze the shipping needs and find the right carrier for them and the carriers pay you a %.  That's all I have for you off the top of my head."

business,3dfklz,bluehat9,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:36:30 2015 UTC,"Facebook can access a user's browsing history and cookies. They can see how many people have searched shaving their arms, shopped for razors, etc. Statuses, page ""likes"", and other Facebook quirks could be thrown into the mix, but I'm not sure how/if they implement that.   Facebook has large amounts of consumer data that may reveal a demand for arm hair razors, or it may reveal a demand for a product with some other function. Regardless, it's highly valuable data to companies."

Should I open an h&r block in this town, no because it has the highest number of cpa's per capita in the nation.   On the other hand, this is data I can already get without Facebook..."
business,3dfklz,TomSwirly,-1,Thu Jul 16 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your point - However I disagree in the fact that this data doesn't have a strong correlation to the value.  Big data and data mining is hugely profitable.  Lets take the following example: Company A has a market and they spend 10m on marketing and get a 5% return on that.  Lets say they spend 5m to buy some of these large data trends and end up finding out there's two things they didn't know in there - that there's a group of people they're not tapping that will buy their products, and there's a group of people they're marketing to that never purchase unless it's a critically low margin item.  So they shift their marketing expense to capture this new group and exclude that previous group.  They don't change their marketing spend and leave it at 10m, but they see their return has gone up to 12.5%.  Now, since the data access was a one time investment, this is a 6.67 year ROE.  Not terrible, but if you can actually use it to build a loyalty following of your brand, you could actually see upwards of 15, 20% return by being able to focus your market spend.  There's a huge market for this and unless you understand big data/data mining techniques, you'll miss a lot of it."

You know whenever you go to a site and there are Facebook comments? Yeah, Facebook is there too, monitoring all your activity. Ever read these comments, or spend time on a page reading a part of an article? Yeah, FB is able to detect that as well.   They know way more about you than you probably know about you. And this data is being crunched and A/B tested all day, trying to funnel you into the direction they want you to.   FB is currently in it's exploration phase where they aren't getting too agressive with their information, but rest assured, their long term plan is to go head to head with Google once they feel like their analytics is at that point."

Whereas Google only has vague demographic data to construct who the user is, Facebook has everything--photos, likes, beliefs, thoughts, networks, friends, family, you name it. And the only thing holding it back is public outcry, like the news about the emotional contagion study that came out last year.

I used to work at a consultancy company and saw social media performance numbers for dozens and dozens of companies. The social media platform that consistently performed better (Conversion wise) was Pinterest and the research that I have seen also matches my experience.  Facebook users don't convert yet. If they do in the future depends on how they refine it. The ad campaign manager in Facebook is still rudimentary at best in comparison to the data they have available."

That money gets spent on the companies that are best at getting between companies that sell things and consumers eyeballs. Print is dying. Cable subscription is declining. The places where ad money used to be spent are on their way out. Facebook and Google are on their way in. They aren't overvalued, they're just getting started. Facebook is especially well positioned.

Facebook tripled it's revenue in the 4 years from 2011 to 2014, and is beating forcasts. It won't keep up at that rate forever, but there's a lot of room for growth still. Walmart, on the other hand isn't eating, it's getting eaten.   The future belongs to these companies that have few assets, a few thousand really smart employees, and mountains of capital. They are unique in their ability to turn on a dime to adapt and mould themselves according to the whims of technological change, and there'll be a lot of it over the coming decade. Facebook hit the ground running through the transition to mobile, and is best amongst American tech companies at getting into new markets early.   There are billions of people who have yet to get online, and when they do Facebook will be there waiting for them. They did a survey in Indonesia and found out that most people who have recently got online have no knowledge of the internet beyond Facebook. Facebook is the internet. The internet is facebook.  It's the dominant hyperlocal networking platform- and that's a very valuable tool for people in places who don't have things like local newspapers, the yellow pages, reliable postal services, or any of these things we've taken for granted for generations here in America."
business,3dfklz,fricken,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:48:09 2015 UTC,"Hey - valid points, but I'm not buying. I'm not invested in facebook, nor do I plan on it.   The adbased model will only go so far. There are only 7 Billion people on the planet - and who gives a fuck if you are advertising to a bunch of dirt poor indonesians? of the billions of people who are not currently on the internet, their entire summed wealth is equal to a few square blocks of NYC. It is an outsize effort for a very, very low return.   I'm not convinced that eyeballs are really worth that much in the longrun - the people who have money are already on facebook, and the efficacy of online advertising is plummeting, not increasing. Facebook has one income stream - advertising. It's a one trick pony. Unless they start bringing in other major sources of revenue, their model will not sustain them indefinitely. Something will replace them eventually.    Look, maybe oculus rift will be the next big thing. Or maybe they will find a way to monetize dirt poor people in a way that really is profitable. Or maybe they will act as the next bell labs and start throwing off massively successful commercial software left and right. However this:   The future belongs to these companies that have few assets, a few thousand really smart employees, and mountains of capital   Is simply not true. ALL large companies start to show institutional inertia. Look at Google: the lion's share of its money is still made from good old search ads - and, quite frankly, their thousands of top engineers don't mean a good goddamn when their b2b products and b2c non-search and non-map products are stinking piles of garbage. I know - I have used a ton of them. They range from mildly infuriating to ""i-vow-to-wipe-the-designers-family-from-the-earth"" kind of bad.   I'm skeptical.

Facebook has a business in a growth industry, whose market hasn't fully matured, and the high valuation is reflective of what people think the future earnings will be. Walmart is a mature company in a mature and very crowded market. Their value is completely understood and can grow only if the population grows, but will likely contract in the future as companies often do. Their stock priced is pushed down until the dividend yield is about average for a blue chip (2.5%)."

Facebook on the other hand is completely unpredictable.    Will they oust youtube as the primary online video source?    Perhaps they'll add an ebay-esque type feature in the future, allowing people to sell things through their website, but targeting just friends and friend of friends.  The more personal nature of the transactions, as well as generally lower shipping costs could make that a serious business model.  Maybe they'll get really aggressive and move into Netflix's territory.  They boast a fairly committed userbase, and it doesn't strike me as an impossible move either.  Indeed if they DID start delivering subscription movie content, then even if there selection was slightly inferior I might go with them anyways, through pure familiarity and due to better social media integration.  Finally, while Walmart's revenue is 60x higher, the net income is 16 billion for walmart, against 3 billion for facebook.  A factor of 5 is serious, but not as serious as the factor of 60 in revenue.  Facebook has a ton of cash on hand, and a lot of different paths they can explore.  It's almost impossible to know what they'll do next, but people are betting that given the strength of their brand, the nature of the industry, their cash on hand, and the many potentially profitable directions they could move in, the company will continue to grow quickly well into the future."

Now in regards of understanding market capital and revenue, these two variables don't necessarily correlate because investors look for specific drivers within each industry. Growth and mature industries have their own respective drivers (as people mentioned below) that stipulate investors highlighted by key analyst that follow the company. Also remember how each what financial models each industry analyst applies to create valuations (the ones you should know are Discounted Cash Flow, Precedent Transaction Analysis, and Comparable Company Analysis. I'm not going to summarize each one since you should really take the time to read them.  A brief summary: social media companies derive (not all but a lot to majority of) their revenue from advertisement dollars from large corporations that will pay for these advertisement placements on sites they determine is:   1) effectively advertising their product to the right consumers and in result, to boost their own sales (their own revenue)   2) increase their market presence   3) anything that draws revenue for advertisers   however, facebook is different than many companies because they make the platform that companies have to tailor their advertisements to fit - for they have enough cash that many small businesses have to tailor their advertisements to fit the facebook advertisement slots.   In my opinion, if you are really want to understand the social media industry (which in all honestly, not many people do for it consistently changes every year), please read this brief analysis of the social media valuation by Appraisal Economics  TL;DR: Different industries means different valuation models that drive the valuation of the companies and Social Media Industry is a new budding industry most people don't understand but many  companies are pouring millions into online advertisements that target consumers to efficiently use marketing expenses."

Car tech has only undergone incremental improvements in the meantime, the personal automobile still basically the same thing it was a century ago.  Autonomous taxis are comparably revolutionary, they open up a total rethink of how we do mobility. There are reasons why Google, Uber, Apple, Tesla, Baidu, Tencent, and many incumbent car companies are all racing to get their ducks in a row for when this rodeo kicks off.

business,3dfklz,fricken,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"You just highlighted my original point about being decades for it to take off. Self-driving cars are not even available yet. Why? First, they aren't ready, no matter what is being fed through the news. Like you said, pilot programs MAY start in 2-3 years, but all that means is a couple cars in real world long term testing. No traffic scenarios where all cars are driverless can even be tested at that point, and those are probably the biggest problem. The potential to alleviate traffic and improve safety is there, but so is the potential to amplify it. Self parking cars only work half the damn time if the parking spot isn't flawless.   The first commercially available car is at the very least 5 years off and will still require a driver to be present and a lot of legislation to be passed. Remember that there is going to have to be months maybe even years of meetings between the companies making these things and law enforcement on how to handle these vehicles being pulled over. And that's one of many issues.  I should add your point about the printing press being ""replaced"" is also backing the decades scenario. We've had monitors for a long time with text. We didn't replace libraries in 10 years and in fact they're still quite prevalent. Hardcover and softcover books still outsell ebooks. Only in news, where the news is free, is digital winning out."

Some blogs get paid by companies to promote certain ideas and outcomes  Another way is to value the whole site as an asset. This is good for big companies that running sites is not their main activity. In that way you don't generate cash directly but you have a better balance sheet position.   I believe in general a huge audience is an asset and it's also power. You can then find a way to get paid. Maybe a different approach for every article you write

Instead of having titles and ownership records  spread across all cities and counties in the US, Mers centralized it all & did it A LOT CHEAPER.     The legal problem came from  court filings  being filed in Mers's name and not the correct owners (or not being kept up with the correct bank's name or transfer records).   For example MERS would be the one suing for foreclosure and not Bank of America who should have been the lien holder.  Also some places (very few actually) had laws that stated those recording docs had to be filed in the court house and not with a centralized authority.   Also county records could be 6-12 months behind where as MERS was days.  Remember many banks where wholesalers (did not hold their loans in their portfolios but rather sold them on to bigger banks who sold them onto Wall Street who shold them to mutual funds, pensions & on (county records could never keep up with that in a timely matter)    The banks got lazy and abused MERS and that is where the trouble started.

Mock interview questions are pretty easy to find. I would recommend researching and practicing your responses beforehand.  Look up common brain teasers and pretend you've never heard them if they ask you. You don't even have to arrive at the answer even if you know it beforehand. They just want to see analytical skills in action.  Eye contact is essential. It demonstrates attentiveness and confidence. Not too much, though! It can be over done to a creepy extent. If you can multitask while conversing I would say aim for 7 to 10 seconds of eye contact and then look away for a second like you're listening and taking in what they're saying. Throw in a few nods for good effect. I'm sorry to be so oddly specific, but this is actually quite an issue for some people. Especially in high pressure situations.   Talking for the right amount of time, and at the right time, is essential, as well. Aim for about a minute or a little over in your responses. Unless, of course, they specify a detailed response. Being succinct is essential for maintaining your interviewers attention span and interest. In addition, make sure to never interrupt or cut someone off! Always think before you talk.  Always be standing for the handshake when entering or exiting.  Remember every. Single. Name. Right them down as soon as they say them (discreetly) along with an identifier to remember who they are. This one is always impressive if there's a group of people."

business,3dbeoj,Pas__,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:20:35 2015 UTC,"Several reasons:    1. Profits are not ""actual gains"" until you sell the stock/bond/currency. The $x gain is just a number - turn that number into cash and only then you are ""safe"" (relatively speaking). Someone selling 100 shares @$5 of some stock is not going to impact anyone. Someone selling $1 mil worth? Some effect, depending on the stock. Now someone selling $1 bil? Yeah, the market is going to respond to that. Of someone is going to ""lock in"" on profit (aka sell), they might as well get additional profit as the stock dives. Double the profit!    2. Controlled wealth exchange. There are always new blood in the industry, and there will always be a need for money. The same old people who has been playing the market are mostly still there, and then there are new guys who want their share of millions too.  So  There is always preasure to ""lock in"" the profit. A stock has gone from $5 to $50, of course someone will sell. And by cashing in on the down, they actually gain some control on the lowest price - let's say $20. So people can start a new cycle at $20. Isn't that nice?     3. Some people want to ""get in"" at a ""bargain"" price. Someone has been eyeing, say, Melon company since it was $100, but now it's $300. They want in, and they'll help pull the market down.    Example: So you have held a stock since it was $5, and the stock is now $30. The company is still making good profit - hell, their business is bigger than ever! But for some reason you need to sell (e.g. a private jet as wedding gift to your daughter) - but you still like the company. What do you do? Well you get together with your friends who are also the major shareholders of the company, and also the heads of the company, and you say - ""let's drive the market up and push for around $35 while spreading positive news - I'll sell to you +$1 each share and you'll sell to him +$2 and back to me at +$3, same old tricks. Hold and buy until price point. Once the market gain ""momentum"" with enough fools, we'll then unload and capitalize on we gains. Heh, the fools will get some gains too. After that, we'll drive the market down and we can get another round of gains. I'm thinking at $10 we'll start buying again. Mr Director of the company, I think we can do that before your next dividend payment, which is great right? But I don't know if the price is too low for your quarter report. What do you guys think? Btw, anyone else looking at Melon Inc?""    In a very simplified calculation, let say their ""final"" sell price is $45, and the their ""buyback"" price is $10: (45-5) + (45-10) - 10 = 65 Remember, it's not just $65 gain. It $65 with $10 stock! If they don't want to buyback, they could have gained more!    And if they do it right (aka do it with the companies involved, other banks and give the government a cut), then no one will get into too much trouble (a small fine at most). Lovely, ain't it?"

Sure, a bubble can pop anytime, but your explanation doesn't seem to include how it was good for AIG to almost go bust, and for the other players in finance to go down with the giant too.  Clever investors make good money when they buy in at the low point, but anyone with new money wanting to get on the profit train are usually more vulnerable to these downturns themselves tha the old boys.  For me, it just doesn't add up, that investors and other money managers want a crash, slowdown, or such. They see enough opportunities without that already.

And that drives the market lower than normal standards.      This is partially why the market always ""over-react,"" that it rises above and sink lower than ""confident points.""

I'm not sure you have any legal right to anything without an agreement.    Did you track the hours you put into the business? Is it comparable to the hours he put in up to this point? Was he drawing income from the business while you weren't? I assume he is the only one that put working capital in the business, you didn't put any? These are all points of discussion in allocating equity.  The other option is to start with the 5% and structure an earn in for additional equity over time.

A non-dilutable stake is possible, but highly uncommon. What's more common are anti-dilution protections, which would allow you to maintain your pro-rata share of the company, by being allowed to purchase further shares at future funding events. Which is what you are not looking to do.  If you feel it is warranted, you can try to negotiate a larger initial share, so future dilution leave you with a larger ultimate share. You can also negotiate future additional shares, perhaps based on higher involvement from you. (I'm assuming you are part-time now, and the business would need you, and could afford you, going fulltime after future funding)  Also - have an attorney review the paperwork. Try to find a startup-friendly one, so you don't have to spend $5-10K. Depending on complexity, you may be able to get a review for $1K or so.  If he is using common docs, like the YCombinator Series AA, you should be able to find an attorney who is familiar with these, and the review should be pretty cheap. If you can influence him to use these, it's not a bad idea."

I am waiting for people to be frightened of the robo copters. I am exotically interested in the prospect of ordering lots of little things so that I can be the guy on the block that amazon's robots get to know the most. I don't know just to show off I might order 500 books and save up my money to place a huge order just so that I can watch a small army of robot copters delivering my product. In 1000 years it might not be impressive to witness that but I wonder what people would be impressed with in 1000 years if it wasn't 100 robo copters delivering necessary household products. I just laugh. I mean UPS does a decent enough job delivering things but that ain good enough. We need more of the future which as far as I can tell when it comes to the future it's just different ways of doing the same stuff. The past is going to the store. The future is delivering the product by robo copter. The past and the future still need teeth being brushed but it's how the brush is delivered that determines the time period or if there is even a brush to begin with. Like time isn't measured in days or weeks or years it's measured in tools and robo copters are further in the future than UPS and until people get used to it there would probably be a novelty surge where everyone literally everyone would want to splurge on warehouse goods until they got bored or annoyed or got all the kicks out of it but yeah for the price of developing robo copters and a robo copter delivery service there will probably be a huge surge in sales and a movie making fun of the process and everyone who can't afford robo delivery services will want one and grit there teeth over losing sales to the genius that was audacious enough to do something difficult like deliver a tooth brush to someone with a robo copter. I do plan on marveling at the robo copter and maybe noticing how the first generation robo copter will be awkward and will barely get the job done. I imagine one day robo copters will work in tandem and robo copters will pass off goods in mid air to other robo copters and everyone will remark on the good old days and snark on isn't UPS good enough when really amazon is just doing amazing and thinking different like apple instructed us all to do and apple thinks it thought different, amazon really did."

The hfcs employed in soda contains a slightly higher proportion of fructose than cane sugar, around 55% fructose-45% glucose, which could be the difference you taste.  Also, hfcs isn't a single chemical but corn syrup where a desired amount of glucose has been convert to fructose.

Plenty of Fish has never tried to look polished, because the only thing that matters to it is user numbers and clicks.

If things like pretty graphics and stock photos helped, he would have added them.   For users, the biggest selling point was the sheer number of other users. If Match decides to jack up rates, users will go away and start a spiral of lost users and revenue.  The funny thing about Plenty of Fish's advertising base was that its biggest clients were competing dating sites including Match. A lot of daters want to get themselves out there and will use several different dating services â especially Plenty of Fish because it's free.   If Match drives away users from Plenty of Fish, there will be fewer users seeing Match's ads on Plenty of Fish, leaving Match doubly screwed.

I feel like they would have to be pretty lucky to have a customer base that, when faced with a lack of cheaper, counterfeit options, would want the product so much that they would instead pay retail price for an authentic product."

The blame lies squarely on the management and owners.  Are they trying to create a curated community? If so, lay down firm content guidelines. The logic required to justify vile pornographic necrophilia but not ""hate"" doesn't make a lick of sense to anyone over 30. And after they ban those, move on to the degenerate incest, cuckoldry, and pro-substance abuse communities, because now they've demonstrated that they are curating content for the public.   But wait, won't users revolt? Exactly. The future reddit will be nothing like this one. This is what they have to do, however, if they want to make money. That they can't make money out of reddit seems, to me, that the project is a complete failure. Just like zombie banks, reddit is a zombie website, kept afloat by wishful thinking.  The only alternative is to remain mostly free, limiting intervention to takedown requests and illegal content. To do this, they need to follow a chan-style model where users are able to raid, post gore, and hate on whomever. Mods can still curate their own communities, so it's not like all subs need be NSFW, only that management can't give it a stamp of approval. The default subs, or public face, would not be presentable.  One can not really monetize the second option. Perhaps they can pay hosting, but they're not becoming the next Facebook. How's that for an inconvenient truth? No more perks, status, and capital gains.  Are they idiots? I would figure they'd know their business better than an OEM steel parts guy like myself.

Many of communities are some of the most focused and segmented any business could hope for in terms of marketing.  If they targeted ads and had embedded, but clearly labelled, sponsored posts and incentivized the mods of those subs to keep the resulting discussion civil they could print money.  Hell, incentivise the mods to give sponsored pointers when a post or discussion calls for it.  Or, better yet, trigger an auto bidding process on organic keywords brought up naturally in users posts and discussions.  People are already used to being shuttled off site so the pass through rate would be much higher than for Facebook ads or maybe even Google.  /r/askalawyer alone would generate a ton of cash using a scheme like this.    Think google AdWords triggered on the fly by people already actively searching and discussing the topic and by people intimately familiar with the ecosystem.   The main problem would be preserving the ecosystem so it doesn't seem like constant shilling.  That can be done by a combination of extreme transparency, allowing bad providers to be dragged through the mud a la amazon, and giving each sub some democratic control over the mods so the mods would lose their gravy train if they favor lining their pockets over creating value for the community.  This scheme might also necessitate subreddit specific karma to prevent brigading from outsiders from breaking certain communities."

So we are going to try some things and we are going to be completely transparent about it.  If those parties want access to you it will be on your terms.  If there is something we do that you don't like or you think is eroding something you love about Reddit, let us know!  We know we can't please everyone but doesn't mean we can't try our best.""   and then have a few initial proposals, maybe with roll outs to individual subs to give the announcement a concrete foothold.  The last thing they want to do is something that looks sneaky like having AMA participants have to pay to play without being up front about it.  That kind of move leads to all sorts of gloom and doom conspiracy theories that start running under their own energy.

It wasn't quite massive at the time, plus everyone knew it had to make money some how and no one balked at it.  More so when Adwords came out there was no other advertising platform quite like it.  So it was popular at that with marketers.     I think the main problem is that they are being so secretive and creating mistrust.   This is adding to the problem, but not the main problem.

I did take note of a few things I've seen which I feel has really contributed to his sustained success.     Plenty of startup funding. Tons of little unexpected expenses during opening that really add up. Huge marketing push for grand opening. Made a huge stink in the local community about the new place opening up RIGHT HERE IN YOUR BACKYARD OMG YOU GUNNA GET FIT, SON. There was no human in 5 square miles that could have possibly missed this news.  He did give some fiscal incentive to be one of the opening-day members, but was careful not to give away memberships to flighty customers who would flee at the first site of a real rate. These people are basically your investors. Incentivise them to join, but these are the memberships you'll be relying on in the first months. Build community - corny, but with gyms specifically, it's important that people feel like they've got a support network. Classes, activities, and (oddly) accountability. Think cross fit: a group of tight-knit people who take pride in their place, but without the ... cross fit horseshit. Also, this means your facility/equipment last longer, as your customers will take better care. Customer Service - People could quit their membership with 30 day's notice. I know that doesn't work for all gym business models, but this was one of the first question people would ask. Many of them were only halfway in the door until they got their answer to this. Valued Feedback - He listened to his customers and made changes when their feedback made sense. This is a gripe I've got with my current gym. Everybody wants another goddamn squat rack (and there's room!),  but it's just not going to happen.   I realize these are high-level items which may or may not apply, but maybe something in there will help.    Above all, good luck!"

Don't underestimate the enthusiasm your patrons will bring to the gym, I don't know how involved the franchise is in helping to facilitate fun activities but we would have monthly events such as group competitions, charity events, cook-outs.   If you or your business partner are male, I highly recommend staying out of the club(s) until they are closed, at least until your patron get to know who you are.    Track your traffic patterns - we found that mid-morning was consistently dead so we would shut down for an hour or so to catch up on administrative tasks and re-open for the lunch and early afternoons groups.

business,3d7rai,djchazradio,2,Tue Jul 14 07:24:28 2015 UTC,How did you get into that? Do you have any formal writing training? College level or above? Just curious.
business,3d7rai,b_sinning,3,Tue Jul 14 12:34:19 2015 UTC,"It's funny. Every time I've brought up that I worked in radio, people always ask if I had training.  The truth is I took some communications classes in college before I dropped out. I got the job through a tip from a friend, and I played up my radio experience. A LOT. I put down that I had worked at a college radio station when in fact I had once drunkenly wandered into the studio with a friend.   Funny thing was, I worked at an unlicensed (aka pirate) radio station in Knoxville spinning records and also doing an hour-long talk-show. I put that down as working at a ""community radio co-op"" or some nonesense.   So really, I had no training except that I LOVED talk radio, and thought it was the most powerful form of media possible. It's a pure verbal connection that relies solely on humanity's most primal form of communication. So I listened to every type of talk radio. News radio, comedy radio, those well-produced long-form shows from NPR like 'This American Life:' They all gave me some education on how radio works.   Also, I used to listen to a talk radio show out of Baltimore called the Don & Mike show, and it was really the height of lifestyle/comedy talk radio. They talked CONSTANTLY about the business and technical aspects of radio, and I learned a LOT from them. My college courses in broadcasting were a joke.   So I got the job and then just started cranking out material that I thought the hosts could use. And they started using it. I was once was asked to write a segment for Rush Limbaugh by my company as a favor to some journalist who wanted to get his story out. That was fun just for the notoriety of it.   But talk radio has become just a bunch of sad-sack shouting. There's hardly any art to it. And the conservative takeover of talk radio is a real bummer. They are fanatical and have no love of the truth. The whole right-wing media game is full of vicious climbers and backstabbers.   So I got out of it. I said goodbye to radio and now I prepare taxes and do business consulting."

business,3d9o8n,s-c,3,Tue Jul 14 23:02:23 2015 UTC,"From the owner's perspective, they are giving their control / responsibility to someone else that they just met.  Control that they know can sink them if this new person doesn't do the job.  This is a career / job for you, but for them it is their life and always thinking / worrying about it.  They could have all their money tied in to this company and if it goes under they are screwed.  (backup plan?  haha)   As such, owners can be over reactive to situations that come up and can be very demanding and it does not help if they are control freaks.  Add in a bit of ""jackassness"" and you'll get what you have now.   As a small business owner, if I was to give that control over I would likely be over their shoulders, double checking, asking them questions, telling them how something should be done, and expecting results.  However, I would expect my self to be professional and not be rude and belittle that person for no reason.  Though, if I was that way I would hope that the GM would set me straight as a GM can be great asset to an owner.  Since they have gone through 6 GMs in 2 years, I would say the owner is a control freak that is under a lot of stress (probably business money issues), is simply an asshole, or a mix of the two.  You have two options:   Leave and just leave this position off your resume since its been short Sit the owner down to a meeting between you and him and tell him to act professionally, stop yelling, being rude, and belittling you as you are there to be their right arm. Also tell them to not do that to employees.  Tell them you are there to make their life easier and to give you a chance and it takes a bit of time for someone new to get up to speed.  Explain that their actions have likely resulted in the other 6 GMs to quit / be fired and if they want to continue to grow their business they'll need change.  If they don't take kindly to that, then see #1.  If they don't straighten up, see #1.  Be warned though that they likely wont react good, at least at first.   TLDR;  Owners can be hard to deal with but as a GM don't let them if they have no reason to do so.  GMs can help owners in ways the owner will not realize because they are control freaks.  The same goes for regular employees but for those peons their ""power"" isn't as high as you."

business,3d4hae,eyal0,12,Mon Jul 13 20:28:21 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind you are talking about the low skill labor market - people in these types of jobs typically make minimum wage with little to no benefits. You can debate if whether or not that is acceptable morally, but economically they are compensated based off of supply of similarly skilled workers in the workforce. In the case of the low skill market the supply is virtually infinite for low-skill workers as far as businesses are concerned.   That being said, these ""jobs"" can pay more than minimum wage since they are typically based off of work completed/services rendered as opposed to hours worked. The function that a contracted worker serves in the labor market is mostly cost efficiency as it limits your overhead since you are not needing to salary/hire a worker anytime you want a specific singular task/project done. The benefit of this for the workers is that they get paid more on a per-job basis than they would if they were salaried/on a wage.   As a result contract workers typically work for several entities at once in order to utilize their time most effectively and generate as much income as possible. While they may not be entitled to benefits their higher income offsets that economically; it simply is up to them to organize their own benefits. Contract workers can also claim their income under their own company and pay corporate taxes which are significantly less than the personal tax rate, this also makes them eligible to ""write off"" expenses and a few other benefits.  Long post, I am sorry. However, it is a complex subject and condensing it down into a few lines would be making a lot of assumptions about your knowledge and I would like to err on the safe side."

Uber has the technical know-how and the investment capital that isn't available to the workers and, in controlling those, can demand a part of the workers' wage.

Here are some things you don't seem to understand.    self driving cars are coming, maybe not 2020, but when they're here all cabs are gone, uber drivers included. economic and regulatory components, are not all bad. Things like having all cars checked by a licensed garage, having proper business insurance (notice you didn't have a clever slam for that), how about proper criminal checks and licenses? How about not being able to ban drivers just from prejudiced passengers? How about minimum fixed rates for drivers and paying properly for expenses? Uber drivers are not forced to work, but they are destroying the chauffer industry by sidestepping costs that cabs/limos are forced to pay (and in some cities operating illegally), which gives them a competitive advantage that actually erodes pay in the marketplace. Evolution is not always a good thing, and for people trying to survive in the service area, turning them into desperate workers just to reduce fares is stupid. Less income, less spending, less tax base, less jobs for the rest of us. When you're fired from wherever you work because they didn't have enough customers to support you because uber drivers can't afford to buy latte's, see how you like it. if you don't want benefits, insurance, retirement, all power to you. Be a contractor or start your own business. However, the 99% of the rest of the workforce would like to keep those things, we've been able to make it work for over 80 years, and really aren't ready to give them up because some twat wants to save $3 on a cab ride."

business,3d4hae,adremeaux,5,Mon Jul 13 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"The last paragraph nailed it. We wouldn't have to worry about the contractors if the government provided the benefits that companies currently need to provide to take up the government's slack.  In fields where employee demand outstrips supply, like hi-tech, choosy workers can demand those benefits and the employers provide. But in low-skill work, companies can take advantage of their workers and the government isn't doing enough to help them. And it's the employer that benefits, at the expense of the employees. The customer's slight savings are a pittance compared to the money and benefits that are basically robbed from the workers."
business,3d4hae,eyal0,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"I think their point about Obamacare is key.  Part of what makes the contractor economy viable is the ability to buy affordable health insurance on the open market without depending on getting it through an employer.  The more of these traditionally company sponsored benefits we can make available to those who do not work as traditional employees, the more viable the sharing economy becomes.  Personally, I think this is a good thing because it gives the most flexibility to employers and employees.  Employees don't feel stuck in a job for the benefits, and employers have more freedom to terminate someone's contract if they're not working out."

Otherwise, word of mouth is one way although that could easily get back to your employees, which could be a problem.  You personally (or someone you know and trust) might have to ask around and maybe approach 10-15 electricians and ask them if they might be interested in buying a turn-key retail (wholesale?) business in his/her trade and if so, qualify them financially and if they qualify and sign a Non-disclosure Agreement, you can the give them more of the specifics about the business and terms of the sale.    You should have a package put together for each prospective purchaser to review including 3-4 years of financials, tax returns, Year-to-Date financials, how you justify the sales price, assets and inventory included, etc., etc.  Each package should be numbered and you should keep track of who has what number package.  If that person doesn't move forward with the purchase, you retrieve the package from them. Your Non-disclosure Agreement should say that they are not permitted to make copies of anything in the package. I have also seen where the relevant information is posted on a secure website where it can only be viewed.  It cannot be downloaded or printed.  If a buyer moves forward and you enter into a purchase and sale agreement with them, then you will provide them with hard copies of the package.   An should prepare the Non-disclosure Agreement to provide that the recipient of the sale package promises not to disclose the possible sale of the business to anyone other than their attorney, accountant or priest (just kidding about the priest).  My suggestions is you spend the money to hire an attorney.  The sale of a business is a rather complicated process with lots of places to get sued.  Pick a lawyer who handles business sales as his/her primary area of practice and get them to provide you with a fixed fee to handle the sale for you.    Good luck!

business,3d71m3,krinklekut,2,Tue Jul 14 04:05:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess you start by working with the clientele you've got and go other directions once you've got some financial wiggle room. Sounds like you've got to do a lot of volume to make a decent profit with these jobs. Not a lot of repeat business either, but if you keep your overhead really low you could start the business that way.   If you own equipment, your clients should pay a rental or at least a ""kit"" fee. My studio makes good returns on equipment when we choose the purchases wisely.   For example, We bought a fleet of drones a couple of months ago and they have been renting out almost constantly. They paid for themselves almost immediately.  The same thing would work on a small scale with camera equipment, grip gear, computers for editing, etc..   Learning to fly drones is probably a good investment of time and entry level drones are fairly inexpensive. There's high demand for cheap aerial work and it gives you a specialty that could help you bag bigger game.   Don't invest in fancy cameras. They depreciate fast and it's better to rent them per project.   In the end, it's all about getting clients and watching your margins."

Keep in mind that if a customer gets a broken item from you, and you make them pay to ship it back, that will be a good reason for them to shop at the local brick and mortar next time.  You can pay slightly more for shipping to have them insured. That way the shipping company reimburses you for the damage."
business,3d5vff,syslog2000,3,Mon Jul 13 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed, customer should get a prepaid shipping label back. You would want to keep your customers satisfied when you can.   Like you said, 'Nobody wants to receive something that is broken then have to pay to ship it back'.   A happy customer might come back the next time their bulb/lighting for their car fails and will think of your company to get a replacement because of ease and convenience. If I had to pay for a return label for a defective product that the company I bought from failed to quality control I doubt they will make a repeat purchase. Or give a good word of mouth to family and friends which will/could hurt your growth in the future."
business,3d5vff,syslog2000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:19:53 2015 UTC,"They can't buy what I sell in any type of local store.  And it is not a big repeat customer type of business.  Most people have one car and once they get this product they won't be ordering another set for 5-7 years.  And it is not clear if it got damaged in shipping or if they themselves broke it.  It never is. When the customer gets the product they have to fine tune it a bit when it is on their car, and it is possible in that process to break it if you are not paying attention.  Part of the issue is that I get A LOT of people thinking something is defective when it is really their own ignorance.  Or, I'll get something where something can be corrected in 5 minutes with minimal effort, but they want to ship it back instead.  So in these cases, if I a m to allow people to send stuff back to me on my dime and if they live out in the west it will cost me $40 to take that item back and ship it to them again, which essentially eliminates the profit margin and creates a loss for me.

business,3d5vff,Miklot,3,Tue Jul 14 16:27:58 2015 UTC,"Do you have any kind of RMA policy at the moment?  It's usually a process for large-volume vendors to keep their costs/returns organised, but might work if you need can't manage whatever percentage of unnecessary returns.  I suggest that, at least under reasonable circumstances, you'd be responsible for return shipping.  You might institute an RMA process that requires a short online form/FAQ with reason for return and tries to check they're not just misunderstanding it. You could also request pics of the damage and try to assess if it's shipping/QA fault vs end-user result.  I've seen some companies that will cover shipping, but potentially deduct it out of a refund or replacement (requiring customer to pay difference) if, upon return, it's found to be an invalid reason for return. ""Restocking Fees"" is the common term, I think.  Lastly, depending on the overall value of what you're selling, you could consider just telling htem to keep/scrap the received item, and reship a replacement. Tricky to manage people defrauding you for freebies without solid evidence of disposal though.  On philosophies, I'd say that a large percentage of the XERO STARS WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN!!!! reviews are from people with broken product (either QA, shipping, or setup/installation incompetence) and angry at the company for not ""doing them right"".  If you don't see much repeat custom from individuals, you might be tempted to show them the door and leave it at that, but with reviews and forums and social what-the-buggery, potential buyers can see negative things about you easier than ever before.  So it's still in your interests to keep the crappy customers somewhat happy, even to some degree cover for their own incompetence. The trick is to find the minimum cost solution to keep these people satisfied (if not happy), and keep your good customers very happy.  In summary:  U has problem? email pics of damage to get free return shipping if covered, otherwise I bill you x% of the return shipping costs (or you can arrange yourself)."
business,3d5vff,Miklot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:30:25 2015 UTC,"The conclusion you've come to when making a comparison to a brick and mortar store is flawed. It's not reasonable for a customer at a brick and mortar store to ask for mileage and gas reimbursement because they took possession of the product when they bought it at the store. Thus, at the store is where the responsibility of the item's care changed hands from the store to the customer. That same point is where the customer should bear the responsibility of returning it to.  When you mail order something, you don't take possession of it until it arrives in the mail.  Another way to look at it is that in the store they have the opportunity to inspect an item and pick one that looks good. If it turns out to not be, they should have to bring it back. When you mail order something the customer pays the shipping and handling with the expectation that they will receive a product that is undamaged. If that doesn't occur, it's completely reasonable to expect the company that sent it to cover the cost of sending a replacement and sending back the defective item."

Yes, consumer consumption (paying for gas) will rise as well as employment (being able to get to a job).  However, there's another factor called environmental economics. Is cheaper oil/gas prices really benefiting the whole economy? So we have people getting to work, but more people driving = more pollution. More pollution = more health risks. Which in turn can lead to more sick days being used or government sponsored healthcare. These are NOT good for the economy in anyway. The economy needs healthy people to be working and producing! So where is this equilibrium?   It may seem like a 'slippery slope' situation, but it is one that dwells heavily on environmentalists and economists.

A purse manufacturer isn't anywhere close to a monopoly.   no one is forcing the manufacturer to price gouge   It's not price gouging as much as the purse is a luxury. Luxury items bring no more utility to a person than a cheaper option, and it's this increased cost that's designed to make the item a luxury. The counterfeit market is created because people want the $500 purse but can't afford it.  Counterfeiting, which as another user stated isn't  is found, literally, everywhere, even in smaller-priced items. From antibiotics to makeup, brake pads to batteries, counterfeit items are common. In fact, these are often true counterfeits - items being sold under the real name that aren't the real item, without the purchaser's knowledge."

business,3d0q8p,CautiousToaster,22,Mon Jul 13 01:03:59 2015 UTC,They broke no laws nor did anything that constitutes fraud.  They simply restructured a lot of the Greek debt in to swaps.  The EU had a stupid fucking method of not counting the expected future payments of the swap as debt so they ended up counting the swaps as a write down in debt and ignoring the high expected future value of the payments Greece had to make.  Even a modicum of due diligence would have made this painfully obvious.  The Eurozone wanted to include Greece so badly for sentimental reasons they basically turned a blind eye to the problems Greece had.  So none of this is Goldman's fault nor did they actively try to screw over a country.  Their name is just being dragged through the media because it makes for good headlines.
business,3d0q8p,bringindabacon,3,Mon Jul 13 01:14:11 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget they did the same thing for Spain and Portugal.  Greece is a country where only the employed, middle class folks, pay income tax. And that's because its taken at source. Everyone else cheats on taxes. And I don't blame them because they have had the most useless and corrupt politicians these past decades.  If they want to hold responsible and have a few heads roll, it should be past presidents and their finance ministers. Or at least launch an in-depth investigation into those periods unbridled corruption.

Of your 30% carbs, you are expected to get some simple sugars. Your liver turns all carbs into glucose once they are absorbed, there's nothing wrong with consuming some simple sugars directly.   Our bodies have evolved over millions of years of mammals eating fruits, and even vegetables and basic grains have a few grams of fructose in them. Our species has quite literally evolved to live on a diet that has sugar as part of its total consumption.  Obviously it's bad to drink gallons of soda every week, but saying ""no amount of sugar is acceptable"" is more ludicrous then saying Coke is healthy."
business,3czpfa,Namika,3,Sun Jul 12 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"I should also be clear that when I say sugar I mean fructose. Yes, you are expected to get some calories from fructose, but not in a processed form. In nature those sugars are paired with fiber. Typically the more sugar the more fiber there is.  Fructose itself is processed in the body as if it is a poison via the liver. Same as alcohol. It messes with your insulin balance (leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes) and creates all sort of bad chemical reactions in your liver. Approximately 30% of fructose consumed ends up as fat. Fructose and alcohol as basically the same thing, except alcohol also affects you mind and has a natural limit to how much you can consume.

business,3czpfa,Trollfouridiots,13,Sun Jul 12 13:31:59 2015 UTC,I think the reason for no females is because this commercial is directed towards a Middle Eastern audience. Some countries in that region (but not all countries) have very strict rules regarding female modesty.   This commercial's message tells the viewer not to judge a person's character by appearance alone. (Consider the implications in a society where women must be fully clothed at all times). In that sense alone I think this commercial deserves much more credit than you are giving it.

Effectively if they weren't prepared for this before it happened they weren't going to get it together while it was happening.   At the end of the day they had no plan to scale, and that's why they failed.

business,3cudga,rchase,4,Sat Jul 11 01:07:08 2015 UTC,"The Reddit circle-jerk over hated topics like the NSA, Michael Moore, Police Officers, Hulu... It'll never end.  I agree with you, to an extent.  There has been an enormous amount of circle-jerking and the 16 and under crowd has enjoyed an unduly amplified voice during the reddit shit blizzard of 2015, but...  I have no axe to grind with regard to Ellen Pao, and frankly couldn't care less. But as an outside observer and a 7 year contributing member of reddit, I can opine that she publicly exhibited a breathtaking level of incompetence as interim CEO of a major social media website.  In the space of a month she basically failed to do anything required in her position correctly.  Perhaps most infuriating to the userbase is that she repeatedly publicly failed to even use reddit correctly to communicate to the users (even today in her resignation post), which is the entire purpose of the website in the first place.  The whole debacle has been an embarrassment deserving of at least some small part of the disdain we've seen clogging the front page for weeks now.    It's so easy.  Reddit is its users.  Simple.  For some weird reason a person was appointed interim CEO who seemed to aggressively fail to comprehend that. That's unforgivable, and also indicates that the problem with the company goes deeper than just Ellen Pao and these last couple weeks.  That she was tapped to be interim CEO by board members who must know her personally gives me serious reservations about the future of the company."

Ignoring all these improvements is this ungrounded and frankly ridiculous ""none of it ever matters"" mentality.   I know Pao was supposed to be interim CEO but I don't believe this was all some sort of master plan pf the board to put out unpopular changes under her. She failed at her job. She never wanted to leave this function. The board wanted her to make reddit profitable and she failed. The changes that were under her name where met with backlash and even if all those changes where planned the backlash and the negative press certainly wasn't.

The key is how you go about doing it. There are many examples of where this has been done wrong, so I suspect this is why Reddit has been so slow to make any radical changes.  But changing the things that make Reddit 'work', like the mostly open ability to make subreddits, express opinions or even share whatever deviant fetishes people are in to is why Reddit is so popular.  Once it becomes a marketing tool where users have to sort through the shrills and hawkers, especially those disguised as regular posts to get to content is the day Reddit begins to die."

Like every other company with a user base the size of Reddit, the users and communities are the product that they can then turn around and sell to entities with real money.  That demographic and marketing information is what would keep this site around.

I work in this industry and not only does this stuff get approved at a snail's pace, there are a hundred things wrong with this design that will never allow it to become a viable option.   For instance: you have to have emergency egress in the TTL position. You can't have a seat in front of you on your way out. What if the hinged seat gets stuck in the down position during a crash??  Second, the seats will deform oddly in a crash setting. If you have a plane crashing at a fifteen degree yaw (a standard HIC test), you're going to get face on face smashing."

Unfortunately you are far from the only skilled and personable person around desperate to find any kind of stable employment--and soulless but sharp managers have learned how effective dangling empty promise carrots can be. They love to give out titles--it's much better than giving out raises. Hey, if you don't like it, 30 other marginally qualified people will jump at the chance to take your job at minimum wage.    You need to look to your future, of course. The good news is, working looks a lot better on your resume than not working, and everything you can list as experience helps. The bad news is, future prospective employers will ask what you made at your last job, and when they find out, they will happily lowball you. The tricky balance you have to find is how much more than their initial offer you can get away with demanding, before they decide to hire someone less qualified for less money.   You should continue doing your best at your current job; be wary of being asked to do things outside your job description for free; and spend as much time as you can spare looking for a better job. And when you get an interview for a better job, take the time to research the average wage for similar positions in your area, because the prospective employer WILL try to lowball you."

business,3co53d,flavornic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:33:40 2015 UTC,"As I'm aware, Dish has a ton of low band spectrum, which is what T-Mobile needs.    You're right on the second part (T-Mobile needs low-band spectrum) but wrong on the first (Dish has low-band).  Dish only owns a paltry 6 MHz of low-band spectrum (spectrum below 1 GHz, or 1000 MHz) and it's downlink only (so not useful on its own, needs to be aggregated with suitable uplink spectrum).  All of the rest of their spectrum is in the same ""mid"" band (roughly between 1 GHz and about 2.1 GHz) that T-Mobile's existing spectrum is also in.  (Sprint is the only carrier with ""high"" band spectrum, around 2.5 GHz, and they're having lots of trouble deploying it because it's even weaker than T-Mobile's mid-band spectrum.)  The upside to a Dish-T-Mobile merger would be that T-Mobile would be able to have the fastest network anywhere you could get a signal.  In my market I calculated they could reach up to 1 Gbps in aggregate (though any individual phone would probably cap out around 300 Mbps).  The downside is that their combined signals wouldn't travel any farther or penetrate buildings any better than their existing signals."

Neither T-Mobile nor Dish have a ton of cash to spare and Dish buying Deutsche Telekom's share of T-Mobile wouldn't do anything to improve that situation.

I had AT&T for years, went to TMobile for a few months and had to switch back.  couldn't take the lack of coverage by TMobile in some well populated areas that I had great coverage with AT&T. Other times I'd get coverage but only Edge, so though I could make calls data was practically useless. Finally, their spectrum doesn't penetrate buildings well. I'd put my iPhone in my pocket and when pulling it out it would show no service, then 10 seconds later get 2 bars. I know thy have challenges with everyone wanting the limited spectrum but if they could address those I'd love to switch back. I really like what they are doing to disrupt the industry.

The remedies themselves are rarely what is in the bottle in either event. It is fraud.  Vitamins. There is no scientific evidence that vitamin supplements have any beneficial effect on health with the exception of those suffering from specific vitamin deficiencies.

You can't always get enough of something and that's why they exist.  Just because some exist as fraudulent doesn't mean all of them are all.  As for homeopathic remedies, I'm not going to defend them. It is fraud. combine it with traditional medicine. Maybe it is all in the patients head and a sugar pill will do them good.

They can also investigate you 10 years after the fact for certain types of outgoing money transfers, specifically IP. Also you are looking at 6-9 months of paperwork and waiting to be up and running as a WFOE. Not to mention 20-50k depending on what type of business you are in. Keep in mind, your local competition will be able to take short cuts you can't. In some cases, you are pretty much expected to break the law to stay in business.   For example, if you open a restaurant you need to have a property rented to start your paperwork (even Chinese owned). So you are paying rent for maybe 6 months before you can even get people to sign off on everything. No restaurant could operate with that much capital down the drain. Which is why you can't get a receipt or use a card at most new restaurants in Beijing. They are open illegally without proper licenses, paying off all the bureaucrats and police to allow them to sell. And I'm talking about nice places, not a guy frying dumplings in a corner stand. That's how it's done in the capital (supposedly the least corrupt place).   Once you can finally be legit, you have already paid off so many people that you can never really be legit.

It isn't.   You are not asking the right questions.  The question about any business activity isn't ""What (How many exist? A pittance)?""  The question is ""Why?""  The government isn't in control.  Businesses are.  That is why government legislation is written by business lobbyists and rubber stamped by government.  (Connected) Banks backed off of student loan lending because it was less profitable than all of the other options they had after the bubble burst.  The market rigging bankruptcy legislation and lack of funding for colleges, which business interests created via government manipulation, still exist to this day.    The only thing Obama is guilty of is stopping subsidies to private lenders for federally backed loans.  (Wonder who set that in motion?)  And all that happened inside of Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.  We are only now seeing it begin to work.  So again I ask, when are we going to stop blaming ""government"" and start blaming the forces which are controlling and/or manipulating government?"

business,3cm0xs,TRoyJenkins,2,Thu Jul 9 02:05:52 2015 UTC,What kind of idiot would take a company's stock as collateral for a loan?  What good is stock in a company that just defaulted on their debt? Plus at least in the US you basically are a shareholder if a company misses it's payment to you. He'll even better than a shareholder at that point.   And if the company has all those treasury shares anyways why not sell them for capital?
business,3cm0xs,roflburger,2,Thu Jul 9 02:45:15 2015 UTC,"What kind of idiot would take a company's stock as collateral for a loan?   It's a fairly common business practice to secure a loan against an asset. After all, isn't that how mortgages work?  The lender takes a risk that the asset will be worth at least the value of the loan should a default occurs and the loan is converted into collateral. Just like a domestic mortgage.  There are loads of examples of corporate lenders converting loans into shares when dealing with a distressed investment.  It's not idiotic at all."
business,3cm0xs,ianvisits,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:13:14 2015 UTC,"What's the practical difference between accepting shares as collateral and just being completely uncollateralized? If a company defaults on an uncollateralized loan then the bank has a claim on whatever assets remain, which sounds a lot like owning equity shares."
business,3cm0xs,yellowstuff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:16:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That's my point. Loans have a higher on a companies assets than stock so there is very little reason to have stock as a collateral. If the company defaults that isn't worth much anyways.   Plus converting loans to shares of stock isn't usually built in to a bank loan. This is done in bankruptcy and usually after wiping out value for original shareholders, obviously making the hypothetical collateral pretty useless.   Obviously collateral is common but not shares of the company. That's what I'm questioning. everyone knows assets are used as collateral."
business,3cm0xs,roflburger,0,Thu Jul 9 14:43:55 2015 UTC,"Also you example is not collateral. I don't think you have the right definition of collateral or are confused with what it is.   Collateral is assets used to guarantee the payment of a loan. These are given priority in case of default to the lender before other assets are distributed.   Anyone who understand that can clearly see why stock of the same company makes terrible collateral.   Just because they are distributed when in distress doesn't mean that's the desire of the lender. (With the exception of convertible bonds, but even then it's doubtful that a bond holder would exercise the option going into a default. )"

Nobody cares. Big chains simply aren't worth talking about or reviewing.. Unless you give people a reason to care..    I love Pizza, but my biggest issue with Pizza imho is the wait doing nothing. Pizza stores SUCK at this, and all you can do is watch  them making pizza for 10mins.    Provide something so customers actually WANT to wait longer, and doesn't give them a chance to get bored. Pizza Hut used to do placemats for kids to colour in. You could almost though build one or two gaming tables into the joint though, and nerds will want to order in-store. McDonalds handles this with Playgrounds. OF course, you'd know a better strategy on this.  But everyone has a crappy computer around.. you could almost put MAME on it, and offer a really crappy arcade machine to play on, and run monthly tournaments for a free pizza.    Interact with the community more. Don't just serve pizzas. Coach a soccer team, etc.  Doubt this is doable, but offer something that makes you stand out in the area. Everyone loves pizza, but honestly, most people I know only go to the big chains because its closer than smaller ones. The reality is that here in Australia, anything Domino's offers, I can get from any other store. Furthermore, here in Australia, some people don't want chocolate, and that is the only available desert..    If you offer Slurpies, or Ice cream (ie, lots of flavours, which generally works quite well because ice cream keeps easily), or something else that stands out, you can accommodate a larger range of people, and make you stand out against other pizza stores.

business,3cnh5w,Auzy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:28:44 2015 UTC,"Big chains simply aren't worth talking about or reviewing.. Unless you give people a reason to care..   True. I just attended a user research seminar put on by a researcher at Google and he mentioned that participants usually have no idea that they're participating in research for Google.  Abstract it a little. Don't let them know they're helping domino's or it will taint the data. There are two surveys that need to happen. One to qualify participants as your active market. And one to figure out what they do and don't like about the ordering experience.  Qualifying a participant can be as easy as defining a few characteristics each person would need: * Legal age to participate in a survey without guardian consent. * has a household income. * Lives in your region. * Has ordered takeout from you within the last few months. (Multiple choice, have you ordered takeout from A b c or d)  Make an online form with Google forms and post a link on the social media pages of groups and organizations in your region. Use an account not identifiably your business. You should offer an incentive. You're taking people's time, and will likely profit from it. You can get away without it, but it doesn't have to be cash. It can be as simple as offering to mail participants discounts (that you already offer online, but whatever) or ensuring them their efforts will be put to good use to improve the restaurants in your area.   Once you've qualified enough people to represent a sample of useful data (no right answer here. 20 probably isn't enough. 50 is getting there. 100 would be comfortable.)  Then it's time to deliver an experience satisfaction survey. Ask about everything from how safe they feel in the parking lot, how they felt about bringing their kids, how confident they felt about the bike racks, to how awkward they feel standing for ten minutes against a wall waiting for their cardboard box without a beer in their hands.  Ask questions that identify problems to the takeout experience in your region. Don't be specific about your location, ask about what people liked and didn't like about takeout places in general. You could learn from the mistakes of others, too, not just your location's.   Don't ask how people would respond to ideas you have; they either don't know, or will say whatever sounds more entertaining to the survey experience. Don't ask ""if we did this, would you do that?"" If you want the answer to that question you have to actually do it, not just hypothesize. (Sure, a jukebox sounds like an entertaining idea in theory but once you're in front of it 1.99 for a song you hope you don't have to stick around to hear it play out is a situation that wasn't so good after all)  Deliver on your incentive as promised. Go over the data and see where you and your competition is lacking."

The government encouraged everyone to invest in a ""30-year golden age"" of the stock market, to borrow up to 10x their own money to gamble in the market. Margin calls are a big part of what's fueling the dramatic sell-off now. And now everything but state-owned blue chips are suspended, so brokerages are forced to sell blue chips, commodities and anything else just to pay back investors who are bailing out of their funds. It's a snowballing mess.  Also, people largely were not speculating as much on the blue chips because they weren't rising as fast as all the new IPOs and random small- and mid-caps. And the blue chips are now being propped up by the government, which, in the benchmark indexes, masks what's happening with the stocks people were actually trading. Here's the Shanghai mid-cap index. (On mobile: choose the 1-year chart.) It's down 46% in less than a month, compared to a still-bad 32% for the Shanghai Composite. That's a little more reflective of most casual investors' experiences.

Mass sell offs as everyone tries to go liquid to manage losses/risk.  BUT... Then you will see a general gain in foreign markets, as everyone who pulls out of Chinese exchanges need to park their money somewhere else... Which will inevitably be NYSE and Europe.  So... Expect a cooling Chinese market to result in gains elsewhere.  With that said, China has so many fucked up laws about taking money out of China, ad the fact that Chinese imports are so out of whack vs their exports, that none of the ""standard"" ways a market moves may apply as they should.

I've never had to worry about tuition or car payments. I can't begin to express how lucky I've been.   I also thought we were poor at a time, but truth is the lowest my parents have dipped is lower middle class when my dad got diabetes and lost his job and my mom quit to help him.

I'm sure that studies would prove that ""city dwellers"", if you isolate factors such as relative wealth, probably travel the world and learn more about other places compared to non-city dwellers.

business,3cf4pr,Deductions,58,Tue Jul 7 12:45:11 2015 UTC,"This is such a hard concept to tackle. I think could be better, but what's the realistic solution? Getting back to the 10 minute turn around isn't the issue of getting to a place on time.   From what I've seen, the major issue with late departures and arrivals is a combination of weather, air traffic, available runways, aircraft inspection/maintenance, and a whole bunch of other things that are pretty much out of the control of an airline. They could be ready to go on time, but weather might prevent them from taking off, or they get stuck waiting in the taxis lanes for other airplanes ahead of them to take off."
business,3cf4pr,slccsoccer28,8,Tue Jul 7 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"This.  I worked for the world's largest airline and there's just too many variables out of the airline's control to ensure an on-time departure/arrival each and every flight.  Believe me, each airliner really cares about being on-time.  Being late severely impacts their bottom line."
business,3cf4pr,airjam21,2,Tue Jul 7 16:19:13 2015 UTC,How does it impact their bottom line?  Is there a penalty of some kind?   Serious question...I know as a customer I don't really pick between the majors based on that - they're all late a decent enough % of the time that it all washes out in my mind.
business,3cf4pr,Ad_Astra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"There's many different ways a delay can impact the bottom line, but imagine this scenario:  Your plane is scheduled to leave LA at 3pm and arrive in Dallas at 7pm. You push back from the gate at 5pm due to a weather delay and now you're expected arrival time is 9pm.  The airlines now has to staff accordingly so they need to pay all of those employees at the arrival airport extra to ensure people are working when your aircraft arrives.  So right off the bat you're looking at higher labor costs.  Now, if people miss their connecting flights, the airliner might have to comp them a meal voucher and/or put them up in a hotel if they can't accommodate them on a flight later that evening.  Very simplistic scenario, but it happens more often than the airlines would like."
business,3cf4pr,airjam21,2,Wed Jul 8 22:22:23 2015 UTC,"Got it - I was purely thinking from the demand side.   Is the airline not normally paying the gate agents/baggage handlers to be there anyways? I would've thought they were all standard FT employees. (Of course this would go out the window if the new arrival is 2 am or something, but in general)"
business,3cf4pr,Ad_Astra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"It really depends.  At a big hub airport, a late aircraft might not affect employee needs based on a capacity model.   But as you mentioned, if an aircraft lands at some podunk airport at 2am, the airlines has to keep some employees working that normally would be off the clock."
business,3cf4pr,airjam21,19,Wed Jul 8 22:36:41 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how I see it. I don't think making someone responsible for making airlines be on time is going to do a whole lot. I am not sure what exactly they would do to enforce it? Fine Airlines? Ok no problem, your ticket prices just went up. Or maybe they just have some kind of rating system (which I am fairly certain already exists, though it may be in an unofficial manner).   Additionally, its not like the airlines don't want to be on time. Pilots and crews are under intense pressure to get places on time, however unfortunately a lot (not all, but a lot) of things are out of their control as you said."
business,3cf4pr,mitch_kramer,11,Tue Jul 7 15:54:09 2015 UTC,"So the funny thing is Airlines are currently being investigated for price fixing.  Fuel is at a very low price right now, yet Airlines have not dropped their prices much in the last year and they are posting record profits.  The thing is if Airlines are truly competing, prices would drop more.    So basically, I agree fining airlines is not the solution because they will simply pass the price to the consumer."
business,3cf4pr,heyletsdothis,24,Tue Jul 7 19:03:23 2015 UTC,"Airlines haven't felt a strong effect from the drop in fuel prices because they hedge their fuel.  Basically they sign agreements with oil companies that say they can buy fuel at a set price for a set period of time into the future - regardless of what the ""street price"" for fuel does in the future. So they're still locked into higher prices they set with the oil companies a while ago, in many cases.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_hedging"
business,3cf4pr,alex9001,5,Tue Jul 7 22:07:07 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a big part of it, but lower current fuel prices means airlines can also lock on lower rates for the future now.

business,3cf4pr,heyletsdothis,7,Tue Jul 7 19:51:11 2015 UTC,"The poster is saying that expanding capacity isn't a real option because of the constraint on terminal space so there is a lack of supply.

It's not soaring demand.
business,3cf4pr,bmc2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:03:54 2015 UTC,Citation on terminal space?  Airlines have been pulling out capacity for years to up their load factors - fail to see how that would result in decreasing terminal space.

My main point was a simplistic way of saying that the short term supply of flights is relatively inelastic to the upside. Any airline can decide to ground flights, but it's hard to wave a magic wand and get more flights in response to something like falling fuel prices - especially if the demand is generally for flights at peak travel hours at major airport hubs."
business,3cf4pr,HellaSober,4,Wed Jul 8 22:22:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The only way I could see this being resolved is by requiring buffer periods. But then that leaves you with periods where your planes would just have to sit on the ground, doing nothing, losing money."
business,3cf4pr,slccsoccer28,4,Tue Jul 7 17:23:16 2015 UTC,The article addresses buffer periods. Claiming that flight times today are already overbuffered causing planes to arrive early too often. And arriving early also has negative consequences.

Then they cancel the flight because a crew member timed out. It's now midnight in clt or ord or atl and you gotta scramble for a place to sleep and to confirm how you're getting Home.  What time is the flight going to get rescheduled?   Instead of sitting at the gate for 4 hours,  cancel the damn flight early so we can all go to sleep.   Then there's the time we turned around on the taxi way because we wouldn't have landed before a crew member timed out. But I'm sure they boarded and pushed back just to get that on time departure.   The govt did well with the tarmac delays. There was a storm last summer, we waited exactly 2:45 before taking off.

business,3cf4pr,3rdFunkyBot,0,Tue Jul 7 22:08:15 2015 UTC,Yep. Frankly it's a miracle the failure rate is only 40%. There are literally thousands of variables going into every flight. The airline could do everything right but be delayed because the fuel truck guys (not owned by the airline) run behind. Or literally thousands of other reasons that all have real safety of flight implications.
business,3cf4pr,DarkSideMoon,26,Wed Jul 8 02:25:08 2015 UTC,"The real truth is closer to the following:   From a business perspective, airlines would like nothing more than to run 100% on-time.  It's the most straightforward way to maximize revenues. Unfortunately, there are too many variables arrayed against the airlines to allow them to even come close to being on-time to the extent that they would desire.   Look:  If an airline owned 100% of an airport (on both ends), required every passenger and crew member to arrive hours in advance to avoid hold-ups, and had aircraft that they didn't mind operating in any weather condition, then you'd see on-time rates close to 100%.  As it stands, it's just the opposite.  A delay from one airline ripples to other airlines.  A problem at one airport spreads to others.  A late crew member screws everybody.  You can't operate aircraft in any weather condition.  It's laudable to hope for 100% on-time rates, but it just isn't feasible."

Even if it is USPS or UPS that is screwing up, they're screwing up Amazon's service and you as a customer whould move-on for anything you needed quicker than a week.  What's happening here is that the airlines are overloading the airports, who are building more and more terminals without additional runway space to accomodate additional flights, causing backups and delays at the drop of a hat.  The airlines need to be held more accountable because they're the only ones in a position to be able to hold the airports accountable since they are the ones who rent or buy space in the terminals.

Airline B - Your airplane shows up an 90 minutes late, they turn it around, you board, taxi directly to the runway and leave two hours behind schedule.   Would you blame both airlines equally for leaving late? Personally I can tell the difference in what is causing a delay. If I look at the package tracking and see that Amazon shipped it on time but USPS is delayed, I have no beef with Amazon, especially if I chose the delivery service. I can certainly see how people would blame the nearest available entity (airline or Amazon) though.  Are airports running at maximum capacity? Sure. What are airlines supposed to do? Cut flights? Then passengers complain about ticket prices being too high because supply is being constrained. The airlines don't make money by having their planes on the ground so they are walking the fine line of trying to maximize revenue by adding flights without adding excessive delay risk.  But the real question is: does it even matter? How many people book based on on-time performance? If the whole industry runs late (the article doesn't show all that much variance) what's a traveler to do? Take a car, bus, or train?"

It is a decades long project, which costs tens of billions of dollars and almost always has well-funded and organized interest groups arrayed in opposition.    Just look at London's Heathrow - the busiest airport in Europe.  they've needed a 3rd runway for quite some time.  They published formal documents in 2003 outlining their plans.    Just last week the main commission studying the feasibility of a 3rd runway at Heathrow endorsed it vs. adding more capacity at Gatwick.  This expansion has a forecasted cost of almost $29 billion, and will probably take over 10 years just to build - that is, when they authorize building.  What's your answer?  ""Just punish the airlines so they push it through.""  A child can be born and go through it's entire working life from the time a proposal is submitted to the day a plane lands on a new runway, but you're totally OK with just socking it to the airlines.

This is a little intangible, but it's what I believe and I think it's reflected in how Apple markets the iPad and also in the types of apps that are popular on it. And when people feel like a device is personal, they're more willing to make an investment of both money and time into it.   -The price point is in a sweet spot.

That's why they're cheap, because they're meant to be replaced entirely. Same thing applies to the Apple Watch. At it's core its cheap, and because it's dependent on keeping up with the other silicon competition that will come to market over the coming years every purchase is another step in an endless cycle of replacements for the next bigger and better thing. Your Rolex's, however, will never be outdated. They may be vintage but they won't be outdated.

business,3cgj5n,NorbertDupner,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"Well first bit of clarification, I don't own a Rolex I own an Omega Speedmaster. Rolex's tend to be the focal point of luxury watch conversations because they tend to hold their value better than other brands, although Patek would be an exception to that but because its priced out of a lot of luxury watch buyers budgets for their most basic offering its not as practical for discussion purposes. TAG, while definitely a luxury brand, sits more on the lower end of the spectrum since they use ETA movements, but for all intents and purposes those movements are as high if not higher quality than the brands who make their own movements.     You are correct that comparing longevity directly from the use of watches in space isn't logically sound. However the durability needed for a watch to properly function in space for even short periods of time is a good indicator of a watches longevity in that it has been tested under the most stressing of circumstances (no gravity, no air pressure, etc) and if it can perform as accurately as needed to potentially survive the Apollo 13 event (rumored that the Speedy's were used to time thrust maneuvers but not confirmed), then it stands to reason down here on earth that movement will perform very well for a long period of time.     You are also correct that servicing a luxury watch is not a cheap endeavor. However this is not a yearly expense, and for most watches is recommended every 5 years but in many cases can be prolonged even further. Using u/NortbertDupner's numbers that would break down to roughly 250-350 per year, which would be about the cost of upgrading an Apple watch yearly if you buy the lowest priced sport version or every other year for the standard end version. However, your money spent on the Apple Watches is essentially a total loss with little to no ability to recover it. For most watches the servicing cost is also a total loss, but it does help to keep the resale price of the watch higher which lets you at least recover some of your initial payment for the item, much like a car with insurance and maintenance costs.     I understand that there's a whole cling to the old vs blaze into the new dynamic here between luxury watches and smart watches. Like I said earlier I own a smart device in the Microsoft band which has many functions of other smart watches, but at the end of the day I found that what I was getting out of an electronic device on my wrist isn't significant enough, nor do I respect its engineering achievement enough, to carry it on my person daily. Don't get me wrong, the devices coming out, especially the Band and the Apple Watch, are significant achievements in electric engineering, however they are not such that the achievements will maintain any real value in a very short timespan. They are the first iterations of what will be many improvements to come and as such they nearly fully deplete in value in less than a year. I recently turned on my first iPhone (3G) the other night and marveled at how something that was so revolutionary at the time that I literally camped out overnight in front of an ATT store to secure it as early as possible could look so incredibly old in less than 10 years. As such, when it comes to watches, I favor spending my money on something that will have a classic look that won't change and won't be seen as a relic of the past decades from now, vs continuing to buy electronic devices that will constantly become trash in a matter of two years. Some people have technological fetishes just like watch enthusiasts have mechanical/jewelry fetishes, and the technological fetish is just as absurd on nearly every level. However when looking at money spent in terms of maintaining value and use over a decade or more, I don't think there's any argument yet that smart devices can compete in this arena. Maybe the $10,000+ Apple Watch will prove this wrong and beat Rolex's and Patek's in this regard, but I have very strong doubts that this is the case simply based on the history of electronics to date."

They'll pay $00's, $000's even for a watch that provides the functionality of a $10 Timex, because it looks good. Apple have provided the first programmable interface, as an app developer I could design a Rorschach blot, a biometric driven fractal, or some unique pattern that makes a statement worth a lot of money to a particular demographic. Instead I can only customize the front face of the watch by 'complications', little more than dashboard widgets. So Apple is implicitly declaring that the world will pay a premium for the fixed design of their watch hardware. That's not new, they are just another player in the crowded watch space with some incrementally more accessible iPhone data. Not worth a premium. It's a shame. It's a big opportunity lost. I actually wrote Apple about this concept of Identity, why it had to be on a watch, and I begged them to build it. That was about 3 years ago.
