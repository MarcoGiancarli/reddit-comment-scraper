kendalljenner,3e0lex,ShockRocker87,5,Tue Jul 21 02:31:50 2015 UTC,"Haha I love how you have to add that disclaimer just to avoid the downvotes in subs like these. And to answer your question I honestly have no idea, but it doesn't look photoshopped to me. She's just turned at kind of a weird angle so that part is flat and then right when it starts to angle out a little bit a shadow starts and gives the illusion that it's flatter for more than it really is."
kendalljenner,3e0lex,nine-tails,2,Tue Jul 21 04:03:36 2015 UTC,"The disclaimer was more just my personality but I have seen some people get attacked for similar comments. And yeah, I can see that. It just stood out to me at first. Thank you for your reply."
