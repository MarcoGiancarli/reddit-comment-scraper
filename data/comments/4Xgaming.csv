4Xgaming,3e4gos,lapin0u,7,Tue Jul 21 21:53:16 2015 UTC,"Both good games. Endless Space was a little shallow for genre fans, and the asymmetry did not work at all compared to Endless Legend, but it's got plenty of polish to appreciate, especially at this price.  Fallen Enchantress is a rabbit hole of customization and rpg themed tactical combat in a 4x veneer. Empire management is very light, squad and combat management heavy. You'll have fun just building armies to take on the wild neutral lands and exploration, but if true conquest is what you're after, this game has battles that will terrify you in their difficulty once you've grown overly attached to your empire. The environments are quite immersive by modern genre standards. It lacks polish, but more than makes up for it in sheer volume of features.  These are both games which will easily gove enough enjoyment to justify this price unless you're looking for only the best of the genre."
4Xgaming,3e4gos,Switche,2,Wed Jul 22 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"How similar is Fallen Enchantress LH to Endless Legend?  Bought it a long time ago actually but didn't stick with it, then a few years later got Endless Legend and thought it was everything FE was supposed to be. Should I give FE another go?"
4Xgaming,3e4gos,reallyreallyrealyfun,3,Wed Jul 22 04:25:52 2015 UTC,"IIRC, not very aside from the basic 4X stuff. FE was more similar to Age of Wonders where it's kind of a 4X/RPG hybrid, but IMO they didn't blend the genres very well and so it kind of fell flat for me. If you already couldn't get into it once but still think it looks interesting, consider giving Age of Wonders 3 a try instead -- I felt that did the 4X-RPG thing much better, but unfortunately is not currently having any kind of sale right now."

But yeah, FE never really did it for me so maybe I'll give vanilla AOW3 a bit more time."
4Xgaming,3e4ign,Vrachos,6,Tue Jul 21 22:06:02 2015 UTC,"I'm one of five, maybe six people who liked that game and played it to death. The real time combat sucks majorly and DOES NOT hold up, but the rest of the game is still fun. The UI and music are very atmospheric.  The game had some clever mechanics and at harder difficulties you really had to make full use of espionage, sabotage, and military action to win. Managing your limited resources and balancing investments in construction buildings, resource buildings, and units was handled well. By the late game you've built an industrial juggernaut and enormous battlefleet, and it was really satisfying. Individual ships felt super valuable.  It suffers from the same late game grind as other 4x games once you get the upper hand. But the AI, which doesn't cheat (!), can still surprise you and typically leads a spirited guerilla campaign.  All in all I think it's a great game that holds up well. Empire at War was a super dumbed down version and a big disappointment to me, although the combat was nifty for about 30 minutes."
4Xgaming,3e4ign,first_five-eighth,2,Tue Jul 21 23:15:09 2015 UTC,"I really liked it for the ""weight"" your actions have. Every character on a mission, every ship is important in the earlygame and getting solid intel is really hard in the game. The cat and mouse feel made the game satisfying.  Later on the managing focus gets a bit out of hand, as it takes some time to hunt down the enemy key characters. But it is still a better mechanic than the usual conquest/diplomacy/science victory types."

4Xgaming,3e4i56,runetrantor,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:23:01 2015 UTC,"Multiplayer should be an ""all or nothing"" design decision. Those 4x games that were ""designed"" around multiplayer are known for it and are often best of their field (AI War, Sins of a Solar Empire, Star Ruler 2).  But those games that ""have"" multiplayer, but are not designed 100% around it tend to not be well received (or at least have their multiplayer aspect ignored). Such as Sword of the Stars, GalCiv, Space Empires. Not to say any of these are bad because they have multiplayer, just that the multiplayer community never took off ""because"" the games were not designed in a way that makes a multiplayer game feasible.  A multiplayer 4x game needs several things, usually. The notable exception that breaks all of these rules is Civilization. Which is an entire discussion onto itself.   Can be played in one session. It may be a long 8 hour gaming session, but being played all at once is a big plus for any multiplayer 4x game. Most games that require 40+ hours to do a playthrough have no real multiplayer potential. Frequent inter-player interaction at all stages of the game. I'm looking at you Space Empires, where you can spend 100 turns and barely do anything more than say ""Hi!"" to your neighbors. A multiplayer game stays interesting if the 4x game assumes that players will be trying to outmaneuver eachother from the earliest stages of the game. In contrast, Sins gives you an early game flagship (as does Star Ruler), and you can use this flagship for harassment or scouting or simply attacking neutral factions before the other faction can do so. Realtime. In order to accomplish point #1, you really need a realtime 4x game. I don't even know of any 4x games with well received multiplayer that are turn based."

Creature summoning and stuff too.  CK2 is not at all complex. I mean the actual systems. The world is complex sort of. But the game systems aren't too hard.

4Xgaming,3dy8ol,MentegaA,4,Tue Jul 21 10:24:12 2015 UTC,"I'm new to game myself but I think the game is much deeper than it first appear. Also the game is geared more toward multiplayer play where tactic and diplomacy matters more.  In the early game you'll be relying on your troops more and most of time it does indeed boil down to most of your armies just contain all your possible units with infantry up front, ranged at back etc. But as you research more magic the mages will become much more powerful, instead of casting fireflies that does pitiful damage your mages will be able to cast firestorm that deals AOE damage to all units on the field, they'll be casting darkness which make your enemy units blind and your demons with darkvision can chop up,You will be able to field mage communions and super combatants (SC) like demi gods and angels (basicly one guy that can take an army by himself) etc.   Also ritual spells are spell you can cast on the world map. In the late game this spells are game changer for example the spell Burden of Time which makes every units age faster. If you 're a nation that doesn't care about age such as an undead nation you can cast this spell and indirectly hurt your enemies. Just make sure you're a strong enough nation to survive getting attacked by several other nation at once because casting this spell is basically declaring war on the world.  Forging item is actually important because to able to cast magic you need to have the magic paths, for example Burden of time need Death 5 to cast. There's no mage you can get that have Death 5 (except maybe your pretender) so you'll have to forge item to boost the death magic of your mages. There's also item that is very nice to have for your SC like winged boots , fire/cold brands.. but wait! these item also need magic paths to forge, for example say you want to forge the dwarven hammer which needed Earth 3, but your best Earth mage is Earth 2, what you can do is make earth boots (need Earth 2) equip  it to the mage to boost it path to Earth 3 then forge the hammer.  So as you can see you need to plan your builds, You need to look at your nations and ask yourself what magic path do have access to with my mages? what items do I want? what ritual spells do I want to cast? what is my late game spells? you need to know these before you even start the game.   That said, most of these only apply in multiplayer since you can just throw anything against the AI and win easily without using forging/ritual spells/etc. Tbh the AI in this game is pretty lacking, then don't even have diplomacy.  tl;dr jump into MP, get destroyed, have fun."

Although there's always few games running.   Will I be jumping in with multi-year vets and get turned off?   Depends, sometimes you can find people running ""noob"" games, you can even start one yourself!   There's basically 2 kind of games Blitzs and PBEM (Play by Email).  Blitz is where a group people try to finish a game in one sitting, they can last up to several hours.  PBEM is the slower game, player submit their turns by email usually via llamaserver. The turn limit is usually 24-48 hours/turn so a game in the large map could take months.  As to where do you join a game, the community is kinda clustered..   The steamgroup host blitz game regularly. They also host PBEM games if you prefer that  the Desura froums and dom4mods is also a good place to find PBEM. If there's no game recruiting you can always start your own.  There's even a reddit PBEM game currently running!"

Don't use boarding pods, use extra hab modules. Those are the main boarding defense source. Both these modules give you that, but habitats are cheaper, smaller and more efficient."
4Xgaming,3dt37x,Infamously_Unknown,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:12:31 2015 UTC,Are they just as powerful?
4Xgaming,3dt37x,Shogouki,2,Sun Jul 19 21:13:09 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I never really checked (or cared about) exact values for a single module of either of them, but they're definitelly more powerful at defense per size, by design. The downside is that they can only defend, but that's not really an issue for a station.  Note that when adding extra hab modules, you don't need to match them with life support. Just habitats will do."

4Xgaming,3dt37x,Shogouki,2,Mon Jul 20 00:47:11 2015 UTC,Also don't pay off the pirates for too long or they become a bigger threat than other Empires and at some point they may just say screw you and cancel your protection agreement.
4Xgaming,3dt37x,Dozed12,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:19:06 2015 UTC,"Right now I stop paying them off pretty early, and then I get wiped out with 7 pirate factions constantly attacking.  Sometime around when I'm struggling to get my 2nd colony up, BAM! Pirate flagship attack and that's basically game-over"
4Xgaming,3dt37x,waterbucket999,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the first suggestion here. Just design your mining stations to have cruiser-level combat capability, basically enough to fend off 3-4 escorts without help. The bonus is that the construction and upkeep costs are paid for by the private sector, so it's a good way to use private sector funds to upgrade your empire's combat capability (this doesn't work for freighters though, as they will always flee combat instead of fight).  Since stations can't move, you typically want to use torpedoes or missiles to maximize the weapons coverage area. Past a certain point, I swap out the direct fire weapons and add fighter bays instead. IMO fighter bays are the most efficient offense capability for almost any design large enough to hold them."
4Xgaming,3dt37x,Hyndis,13,Mon Jul 20 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"I use destroyers on automatic. I'll set my automatic ship building to build 100% destroyers. No other ships should be built automatically.  I also manage fleet designs manually. My destroyers are manually designed as well.  No ships are added to fleets unless I do it myself, so these automatically built destroyers will spread out around my empire for empire defense. Destroyers will protect planets and stations (don't build escorts, escorts try to follow freighters which is a waste of time, destroyers guard only stations and planets, nothing else). They will automatically attack any hostiles. If a destroyer gets blown up? No big deal, new ones will be built automatically. New stations are built? More destroyers get automatically built to protect them.  This also functions are a very organic defense network. If something is under attack my destroyer in-system stops escorting it because it veers off to shoot at the attack. Now my planet or station is unescorted. Destroyers will then fly to that system to protect it, but upon arriving they see a hostile and engage it. Planet/station is still unescorted. More and more destroyers show up to protect it, but so long as there are hostiles in the area they will engage hostiles, causing yet more destroyers to show up.  You can see how this turns out. The longer battle rages the more ships show up. Once hostiles are all gone the destroyers spread out again across my empire.  Empire defense is pretty much automatic, and its all thanks to the magic of automated destroyers."
4Xgaming,3dt37x,MegaGrubby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:26:08 2015 UTC,"I'm having trouble with automating my ships.  Basically, they don't do anything... it usually feels like they do the exact opposite of what I would want them to do.  ""Oh nothing happening? Let's go to this random system and chill out instead of hanging around important targets.  Pirates attacking?  Nah bro, can't be bothered.  Oh, you assign to attack someone?  I think I'm going to go refuel even though I have plenty"".  It's borderline rage-quit inducing.  What settings do you have?  You have construction automoted, if I read your comment correctly.  Are the ships also automated (as in, pressing 'a' on the ship?  Or the fleet?  Or neither, and you just use  postures (this doesn't seem to work for me)"
4Xgaming,3dt37x,MegaGrubby,2,Sun Jul 19 12:54:23 2015 UTC,"If you give a fleet orders, it needs to stay off of automated mode. Automated means the computer completely controls the fleet and will override any existing settings at any time (and it usually changes the settings right away). So you can set it to a defensive posture on the border.  edit: I found the computer does a terrible job of defending your territory. You'll need to pause a lot and manually combat the aggression."
4Xgaming,3dt37x,Hyndis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm doing manual across the board and (trying) to only command with postures and right clicking to patrol.  Is this the right way?  I never get far enough to have to worry about about defending and empire. I just need ""defend this station"" or ""kill anyone who comes into this system"""
4Xgaming,3dt37x,avamk,2,Sun Jul 19 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"Postures are fine. Just don't hit the ""automate"" button afterwards. You get a little circle showing you how much area the posture covers.  edit: typically, I would put larger fleets in hotspots in my empire (around the outer edge). Once you seen an enemy, pause, issue your defense orders, let the game run..."
4Xgaming,3dt37x,Hyndis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"Ships on automatic will only engage hostiles that are close by. They will not rush off to another system to defend it, but they will defend the system they're in. You need enough destroyers that are on automatic and not part of a fleet to cover your empire.  I found that by setting ship construction to 100% destroyers (0 for all other ship classes) and automating that, then turning off all fleet automation is enough to get the job done. Enough ships will be built to spread out and cover my empire. Every station gets at least 1 destroyer protecting it. More important things get more ships. My homeworld has at least a dozen destroyers defending it at any one time. All destroyers in the same system will engage hostiles, so if you have 2 planets and 3 stations in a system you might have 6-12 destroyers in-system all ready to pounce on something. Thats a lot of fast reaction force. Over time other destroyers will show up to help out, but usually the destroyers already there will do the job, especially against mere pirates.  And note that I've said destroyers many times. When I say destroyers I mean destroyers. Don't try to do this with escorts or carriers. Use destroyers.  Leave them on automatic. Its remarkably hands off."

4Xgaming,3dt37x,Hyndis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:23:35 2015 UTC,Its in that big list of empire policies. This is the single most important screen in the game.
4Xgaming,3dt37x,avamk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:08:03 2015 UTC,"Ah OK, under the ""Construction"" section in the Empire Policy window I have now set all to 0% except destroyers which is 100%, however, what about ""Minimum distance between new spaceports"", and the minimum populations for the three sizes of spaceports? I'd still like to build them manually! And what about the ""Military Construction Level""?"
4Xgaming,3dt37x,avamk,2,Mon Jul 20 07:24:49 2015 UTC,"You can adjust the settings so that spaceports are built everywhere or you can adjust the settings so its so restrictive that spaceports will never be built automatically. Your call.  Military spending is how much of your budget, roughly, available to spend on military stuff."
4Xgaming,3dt37x,Infamously_Unknown,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"Oh I see good idea. I like manually managing spaceports so I'll just set the minimum populations very high, then. Thanks for the tip!"
4Xgaming,3dt37x,MegaGrubby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:53:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry one more thing, I just tried making the settings so restrictive that spaceports will never be build. But the highest I can set the minimum population for a small spaceport is 1000 M, and 5000 M for medium spaceports. Both are conceivable in the span of a game, which means they will get automatically built!! I also thought about making the minimum distance between spaceports unrealistically high, but the maximum it is allowing is 2000 K, which is still possible...  Can automating ONLY destroyers be still possible while manually managing the construction of everything else???"
4Xgaming,3deg94,cwilsons,9,Wed Jul 15 17:07:44 2015 UTC,This makes me much more interested in the game then I was previously.  I did enjoy my time with Fallen Enchantress so there is that.
4Xgaming,3deg94,cbsa82,4,Wed Jul 15 18:19:50 2015 UTC,"Great write up!  Color me a little surprised this didn't receive your highest rating as you've been singing this game's praises for a long time.  It seems to me that the complaints of replay ability and 'having to play game one way' are consequences of trying to paint this game into the straight 4x genre.  But if that's the case, can't we criticize all 4x games for not having a 'story?'    In truth, this game appears to create an identifiable story much better than most 'open' 4x games (surely much better than Stardock's down Gal Civ 3) so shouldn't that be celebrated?  Maybe you felt like your excitement over this game required you to be 'impartial' and give this less than highest marks.  I get it and overall, great review.  FWIW, I have not yet played this.  I did buy it during the steam summer sale but decided to wait until they 'released' it so as many bugs get stomped as possible."
4Xgaming,3deg94,shmael,12,Wed Jul 15 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"I think you're overhyping it. In my successful playthrough, granted normal mode, the Doomsday clock was totally irrelevant. In 143 turns, on a huge map, cause I blew like 50 turns trying to make a pally army in the end game, my clock was at 0/500. And no one could argue that my play was optimal. I won the final fight taking 0 damage with a single champion missed the last 4 skills. I did use a blizzard scroll and a flaming head elemental summon. I think that its probably possible even on insane to win the game with a single city, a ton of outposts, and a single high level champion with good items and maybe 50% of them enchanted.  Also, that destiny enchantment buff plus courage is ridiculously abuseable. With good enchanted items and a few of those permanent buffs I was immune to nearly all damage. Also the prismatic potion that blocks phys damage is op.  Also due to monsters almost never attacking and a single flame wave or blizzard or fireball scroll clearing up anything that does, the game has no real sense of anxiety.  I'll have to try max difficulty, minimum shards, aggressive AI, high speed doomclock to see if that fixes anything."
4Xgaming,3deg94,domainsofascension,4,Thu Jul 16 03:34:36 2015 UTC,"I think there are still some balance issues with some of the items and spells. If you go at it a different way, it's a lot harder - there are just optimal ""win now"" items that are OP. I expect we'll see patches to address that. But, I confess I am totally comning at the game from a pure roleplaying angle, which makes it (to me) more interesting and ore of a challenge. I don't make any attempt to optimize or min-max if it is out of character for the ruler I am portraying."
4Xgaming,3deg94,hbgk10,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:41:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the game is so unbalanced that I doubt patches can help them. 3 of the heroes, the melee combat ones, are ridiculously strong. Hypnotism and Tame are so good now that Coercion is nerfed. Scrolls are unbelievably strong. Its like having a giant army everywhere."
4Xgaming,3deg94,domainsofascension,3,Thu Jul 16 12:48:36 2015 UTC,"It's a bit silly to say balancing couldn't be fixed with patches, because it certainly could be. It's not like some deep underlining game mechanic is broken. There is one thing you can say about Stardock, they do patch their games. GC3 has already had a ton for instance."
4Xgaming,3deg94,Leeabe51,5,Fri Jul 17 02:24:44 2015 UTC,"Huh? No, not at all. I don't care if there's tons of info available. I can decide whether or not to pay attention to it myself. I don't want to remove if so others can't see it.  And I didn't give ANY beta feedback - I imply didn't have time to do so with any level of quality. So I just played and kept up best I could and liked what I say. So, um, don't rage on me?"
4Xgaming,3deg94,hbgk10,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:48:39 2015 UTC,"I wasn't raging at you specifically, but Brad said that a ton of beta testers complained that trait info ruined their immersion and he took the trait screen out against his will."

He was completely willing to make changes the beta players wanted, that may just not have been the right thing to do.

4Xgaming,3deg94,Leeabe51,2,Thu Jul 16 04:29:13 2015 UTC,"My wording might have been a little strong. Brad struggled to argue the removing the screen side because he really thought the screen was good but that literally no one in the beta wanted to keep it but given the response he got from myself and others like Tom Chick he said he will probably bring it back, perhaps optionally to appease people who didn't like it."
4Xgaming,3deg94,domainsofascension,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:29:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that on Qt3. I think Brad is completely wrong from reading the thread, but then again I haven't played the game. I am going to wait to see how the patches play out before I decide to get it."

4Xgaming,3deg94,domainsofascension,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:31:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it should be shown, and he was wrong to back down to some beta testers.

4Xgaming,3deg94,Leeabe51,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:12:50 2015 UTC,Its supposed to take after Master of Magic so at least BSOP spells were kind of intentional. There should be a way to change your starting mage and focus on something other than heroes and EQ.

Lengthy, well organized, and offered information and explanation to flesh out the general feelings I had developed myself.  Also came to pretty much the same conclusion I did."
4Xgaming,3dbkx8,FalseTautology,13,Wed Jul 15 02:28:08 2015 UTC,I 100% agree. A well written review is so much nicer than a video review 99% of the time.
4Xgaming,3dbkx8,hbgk10,2,Wed Jul 15 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"Totally. I get so tired of having to watch videos or listen to podcasts. I can read so much faster and process more data that way. I can only hope the ""multimedia all the things!!!!"" is a passing fad. Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you should every time. I mean, sure, toss out a podcast - but provide notes or something so I don't have to slog through the whole damn thing when I could read the important bits in 1/10 the time."
4Xgaming,3dbkx8,Sophocles5,3,Thu Jul 16 03:46:36 2015 UTC,"I like the use of the word risqué, though I'm not sure if Stardock was willing to go in an overtly sexual direction with the game.  Really though, it's a more or less spot on review, but as someone that played a lot of Gal Civ II, I really didn't something radically different. I wanted an update and improvement that I could play with a few of my friends that are also fans, that's what Stardock delivered. I'm also pretty hopeful that the game will continue to improve both with the mind to making modding easier and just adding more features, so we'll see. Right now it's not really a huge leap from II, it's more like an update to a decade old game. I do agree with the sentiment though, if you weren't a fan of II I don't see a reason to pick up III."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,mainichi,8,Sat Jul 11 18:12:33 2015 UTC,What did you make of the Fallen Enchantress games?  It'd help me figure out if your opinion of Sorcerer King is likely to be similar to my own.
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,lordcooper,5,Sat Jul 11 20:24:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP, but after looking at the first 1/3 of this video it seems to me that SK is FE with a new coat of paint.   The gameplay and mechanics are extremely similar to FE, if not identical."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,fishy007,2,Sun Jul 12 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"I came to the same conclusion. It seems to be FE/LE with a few minor changes.  Gameplay mechanics seem to be almost identical. The only differences I can see is that the resource system is different (slider between gold/mana/xp) and item crafting. The game also now has a soft pastel coat of paint.  Sorcerer King seems like it should be a DLC. maybe a $5-10 DLC, but this isn't a new game.  Elemental bombed, so they re-releaed it as Fallen Enchantress. Then a while later they re-released Fallen Enchantress as Legendary Heroes. And now we're on the 4th re-release of what is fundamentally the same game.  FE/LE weren't bad games, don't get me wrong, but I don't see how this justifies a $40 price tag. There are just too many similarities with not only the prior game, but also the game before that one.   This should have been made as a DLC."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,Hyndis,0,Tue Jul 14 07:38:46 2015 UTC,"That's not true and 1/3 of the video probably wouldn't be enough to determine that, so I don't think you're trying to be antagonistic.   FE is a true fantasy 4X game with all the normal tropes of building your empire and building armies, all the while conducting diplomacy and trying to ""win"" the game. There's a couple win conditions and the latest iteration, Legendary Heroes, was fun, if not a bit boring in its setting, etc.   Sorcerer King is much more focused on the RPG elements and I've been calling it a 4X RPG. It's less about building your emipre - though there is some of that - and more about building a party of strong adventurers that go questing, killing monsters, and winning, or losing, favor with the various (8, I think) minor factions. Those minors are actually pretty rad, being Ice Lord Yetis, Swamp Giants, Fiery Flame people, and others. They finally bring a bit of personality and flavor to the series.   There's also a strong emphasis on crafting and enchanting that doesn't even exist in FE or LH. It helps allow you to customize every unit you train, as you can craft and enchant each item of their loadout to really customize their abilities and strengths.   They're not even close to being ""identical""."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,hbgk10,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:51:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to say I have not played the FE games, which admittedly makes me not able to have that perspective of comparison with earlier games in the series. You'll have to canvass others for comparisons to FE, sorry. (I believe there are some on the Steam discussion pages who raise the same question.)   If it helps at all I looked at the earlier FE games when they came out, but something didn't click with me and I didn't get them."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,fishy007,5,Sun Jul 12 02:21:41 2015 UTC,"I have played both FE and SK. While the two share a lot (art design, some back story, general UI), SK is far better than FE. I got Elemental when it first came out, and was vastly disappointed. FE made it better, but it's still not a great game. Too random, and too much doesn't feel balanced. SK, while it still has perhaps a few balance issues (can't speak for the latest update as my gaming computer is down waiting for a part at the moment) it is a much tighter, much more enjoyable game to me. Is there stuff I'd change? Sure, but no game is perfect. But I can say I like it a LOT more than FE."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,AdanteHand,18,Sun Jul 12 03:25:34 2015 UTC,"I read your post and decided to take a look at it. Then I saw it was developed/published by Stardock and I noped back out of there.   I own Fallen Enchantress:Legendary Heroes and felt very let down by that game. It had a lot of potential but everything seemed half-assed. Nothing was fleshed out properly.   The funny thing is that many people that I talk to felt the same way, but the Steam Reviews are 'Mostly Positive'.  Maybe the other players were also like me. They really enjoyed the first game they played and wrote a review. Then they realized that the game wasn't very 'deep'.  Anyway, all this to say that I hope Sorcerer King is good, but Stardock and I don't have a good history. I'll wait for release and see how it's reviewed. Thanks for your write-up. It paints an interesting picture :)  EDIT: LOL  I see that it's not OK to dislike this game. Thanks for the downvotes.  I have truly learned my lesson."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,MegaGrubby,10,Sat Jul 11 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"You know it's weird, I noticed the same reaction when I raised similar points.   There seems to be a very noticeable effort to suppress any negative opinions about this game.

4Xgaming,3cxmcz,AdanteHand,-5,Sun Jul 12 02:27:13 2015 UTC,Maybe the majority just likes the game? I think you points are laughable and I wholehearthedly disagree and to say the game is shallow just blows my mind. Compared to distant worlds? Sure but in general? Yeah no. But people like different things and that is okay. What I don't like is people offering their opinion and claiming it as a fact.
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,Maskirovka,10,Sun Jul 12 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"I would be more than happy to expand on and discuss any of the points you find laughable. What I really want to see is discussion, good and bad.  However what really bothers me are people that try to suppress discourse by laughing and downvoting and simply saying ""you're wrong"" without giving any reason for your disagreement.   See I would say Distant Worlds falls into the same problem here, it's funny you mention it. They hardly at all go into background for any of their races, you get a few paragraphs and a picture, and that's the extent of your race. Now I still think DW:U is an incredible game for many reasons (delightfully complex, easily moddable, etc) however that doesn't mean we can't talk about it's short comings instead of just label everything as ""good"" or ""bad"".  Please spend a little less time trying to discourage discourse and more time asking questions."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,hbgk10,2,Sun Jul 12 01:12:23 2015 UTC,Thank you for saying all that.  Your sentiment is important and relevant for many topics of discussion way beyond 4x gaming.  More people need to be inquisitive and listen to what people have to say rather than stating their opinion as though it means something in and of itself without discourse and discussion with others.
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,AdanteHand,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:12:25 2015 UTC,"I am not a reviewer. I just play a lot of 4X games. I like FE (see below for commentary). As for DW:U, it gets raves, and I can see why, but I have to confess I don't care for it too much. And for the life of me, I can't really put my finger on why. Maybe the real time aspect? but it's not odious, and it's very pausable. Maybe it feels too generic. Or maybe I get frustrated with the automation - I WANT to automate parts of it, but the AI does such a lame-brained job of it. Even if you give yourself the ""ask my approval"" options, the game continually pesters the crap out of you about buying troops or ships that you just don't need at the moment.AI ship designs are not great. I dunno. It just seems more like a chore to play than something that is fun. I know I am in the minority here, and that's cool - people can like stuff I don't like. I just want you to be aware that when I say ""I like SK"" I want you to know that I don't much care for DW:U despite it's popularity."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,AdanteHand,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:34:06 2015 UTC,"You know I think you are making a good point here with the automation of DW:U. To me, the over automation is one of the game's greatest weaknesses and at the same time one of it's most unique strengths.  So, from the outset, when you have a game that can automate 100% of gameplay it can really take the player out of the feeling that any of their choices matter. The game is very, and delightfully, complex however and some degree of automation is always helpful. This is sort of where I end up coming back around and falling in love with it.  It's very unique, I can't think of any other simulation this complex where you can automate so much of the gameplay. Which really can change it from a goal given game, to a self-defined goals simulation. I ended up discovering I can do a lot with this. Set up your empire, and say you just want to pull back and focus on one thing? Because of the extreme level of automation, you really can just disconnect yourself. Tired of playing the space emperor? Automate everything and become a ship captain, only controlling your one ship, or a fleet, or a random space station if you like.   The AI can make some very wonky decisions. They choose to invade with insufficient forces, leave critical research stations undefended, frequently leaving important characters to die. However, when you pull back from it, you realize every empire is using the same AI, playing by the same retarded rules. In my experience with the game, it ends up finding it's own balance somewhere along the way.  So yea, this got a bit wordy, but the automation of DW:U is such a unique feature that I just had to throw some pros at."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,Zaranazer,-15,Sun Jul 12 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Shitty game review blogs, eh? What exactly have YOU done for the genre, other than complaining about other peoples' efforts?  I don't think anyone is trying to ""suppress any negative opinions"". I think Zaranazer is right, people just like the game. To each their own, yeah? Just because there are differing opinions does not mean that you're right and they're wrong, or vice-versa.   Get over yourself, man.   Edit: And to negate your ridiculous point about ""press copies"", we buy our games and the games we get for free we give away."
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,POTUS_Washington,10,Sun Jul 12 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"What exactly have YOU done for the genre   First of all if you're going to end with ""get over yourself"" don't be so ironic. I buy 4x games... spend money on them, talk about them, play them, get friends to play them. That's all I do. I don't try to profit from any of that. And I certainly am not telling people they shouldn't talk about it. Let me ask, what all should I be doing in order for you to allow me to disagree with you?  The difference is I want both sides. Both sides are very important to me as a consumer, I am greatly benefited from reviewers that are very very far away from the companies they review. I want unbiased reviews that aren't given simply because the reviewer is getting a press release of the game to increase their own income. The good and bad, if someone wants to talk about the strengths and weaknesses for a certain game I am not going to stop them and say ""hey you you shouldn't be saying this"". I will talk about their points, one by one.   Have you noticed that everytime, last thread is a great example, someone asks what people think about this game, you show up to tell people they are wrong for disliking anything about it?"

4Xgaming,3cxmcz,eriman,5,Sun Jul 12 09:01:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything wrong with blogs or reviews since that's where I form my bias to whether I buy a game or not. That said, I do want to hear all the negatives before purchasing a game-   For example, had I known (before just jumping straight into it) that GC III was utter crap in terms of bugs, then I would have either waited to buy it until patches came out. That said, lesson learned.  As for suppressing negative opinions, I agree that people don't really do that. Some people might be really excited, others see the potential this game can bring, and other can be utterly turned off. It's good to see all points in the game so the end user actually figures if they want the game or not."

I'm not saying it's acceptable that they release games like this but it's just the way of things. And if you really think GC 3 was utter crap(yes yes I know you said utter crap BUGS, but that is pretty damn strong wording), then by your standard most games that are released are a godamn disgrace(which to some extent I agree on). GC 3 was in the grand scheme of things not one of the worst, not even close."

4Xgaming,3cxmcz,Maskirovka,3,Mon Jul 13 02:56:55 2015 UTC,SSE   I assume you mean Sins of a Solar Empire. It was developed by Irconclad and published by Stardock.   FE and SK are both developed and published by Stardock.
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,domainsofascension,2,Mon Jul 13 03:27:07 2015 UTC,Ahh true. Well from what I've seen of Soul King it looks and plays very similar to Age of Winders which was a series I enjoyed. I'll have to check it out at some point.
4Xgaming,3cxmcz,domainsofascension,2,Mon Jul 13 07:33:37 2015 UTC,"Another game by Stardock is GalCiv3, which is a game that I cannot recommend to anyone but the most die-hard 4x fan.  GalCiv3 is, in a word, sloppy. There's missing artwork and typos everywhere. Errors in the xml files galore. Balance? Whats that? The AI is limp and impotent, made dangerous only by heaping upon it all kinds of bonuses and outright free stuff.  Many of these I've been fixing myself by tinkering with the game's files, but this is dumb. Why should I have to go through and manually fix error after error after error when we're on patch 1.10? The AI is also hampered by really bad priorities in the xml files. Again, they're xml so I've been able to fix a lot of these problems myself, but this is still a problem. Why do I have to fix all of these things myself?  The game is also a gigantic resource hog, using up far more resources than it has any right to. 6gb of RAM is barely the minimum. And thats not 6gb of RAM installed. Thats 6g of RAM free/unused. This means you need closer to 10-12gb of RAM installed.   GalCiv3 isn't ready for prime time. There's still a lot of potential in there, but you have to roll up your sleeves, tinker with xml files, and forgive a lot of the game's faults and quirks.  Dwarf Fortress is a game that seems to have a more thorough QA than GalCiv3. Yes. Fricking Dwarf Fortress has fewer bugs, errors, and missing content."

EU4 and CK2 have some interesting attempted solutions in this area as well, but they aren't quite right and furious min/maxers can still blob everywhere and conquer everything.

There was no crystal within miles of my area. In fact in my current game I haven't seen any at all. And since crystal is required for paladins, the only non hero unit worth building, it ruined my game.  Actually my best non-hero units are beast units I tamed. I got a black widow queen who was a goddess at war in an earlier game. Even more powerful than heroes. Hell if my tame had failed she woulda wiped my army.  Also the Tyrant power is OP. And the warrior and ranger are the only good heroes. The warrior is the best. The black magic tyrant dude is terrible, dies too easy and has no damage. Haven't used the mage but non hero mages are shit so I assume he is.  Because archers and mages have infinite range, maps are small, and there are units who can swap places, defending your squishies is pretty much impossible and healing is not super useful.  The whole Sorcerer King mechanic barely registers. They spent enough money to have complex road graphics with roundabouts and shit but they can't spend some money to make the map gen spawn crystals and metal in a reasonable spot? But seriously, aside from paladins sentinels are okay but still die too easy for too little damage. With maxed out training buffs they do a little better."

The diplomacy is structured so that you MUST have a hated relationship with someone near you as opposed to a cooperative one. Ultimately it means you end up spamming gifts at each other to maintain enough relations to stop a war from breaking out Treaties are kind of shallow, and there's no option to federate governments in the late game   etc etc  Basically diplomacy is on rails and nothing you do really matters."

The cookie-cutter asteroids are pretty much gone, they're quite varied now and people have been adding their own modded ones. People have been creating crazy modded components in the workshop.  I remember Minecraft when it was in alpha, is was pretty bare but I still had fun occasionally. It's not even close to what it was, and I expect SE to follow the same development cycle.  The main fun I'm having with SE is creating ships in creative mode that have multiple functions, like carriers with docks that can carry fighters, transport ships, mining rigs, etc. I don't play survival because it is boring at the moment but I do enjoy creating a ship once in a while.

4Xgaming,3csq9m,Phukets,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"The only real automation that you can't override, as far as I know, is the private sector, but even then you can force mining bases to be constructed at certain locations. After that, the construction ships run on automation.  Everything else can be controlled manually. I think I even saw a mod that allows to control the number of ships the private sector builds."
4Xgaming,3csq9m,SlyScorpion,2,Sat Jul 11 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"Well, you've not said how much of the game you personally manage....  Fleets get moved all over even though you set them for certain spots. It will override one off manual ship builds.  Here is the example I often use...   in settings, say you set minimum number of troops on a planet to 4 in settings, you set minimum population for troops to 1 million inhabitants  let's say you have 20ish planets and many have huge populations (greater than 1.5 billion) let's say you are at peace and your economy is growing. Cash on hand is 300k (top number...upper right), cash flow is 5k (middle number...upper right) and bonus income is 30k (bottom number...upper right)   You will scroll through your planets and see that many do not have 4 troops. The reason is because the AI believes you do not have the cash flow to support 4 troops per planet. The AI also believes that lower populations do not warrant 4 troops. So....even though you set 4 troops for planets with any population...the AI decides otherwise.  You could even manually place recruit orders for 4 troops on all the planets. You will later review those planets and discover that the AI cancelled those recruit orders or got rid of the troops.  A typical game would let you live with the consequences of your settings. Not so in DW:U. If there is an income level involved in deciding to build troops then that income level should be a setting. It is not, you must live with it and the enemy will often capture your planets because you have no troops defending them."
4Xgaming,3csq9m,Phukets,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"I must admit I didn't pay attention to that. Maybe try to put recruitment of infantries at high in the options to increase the likelihood of having some sort of garrison.   I play the game more like an emperor that puts his seal of approval on decisions and control manually the important things. The universe is full of those little details to make it vibrant with actual tangible elements as opposed to abstracting the features. That's just the way the game is, you can't control everything and I think it's a design decision made on purpose. I notices that my colonies of decent population have always enough troops to repel pirate raids. And if an empire comes to invade, 4 troops won't cut it. It's like freaking out because a few ships destroy your mining bases, it happens and that's just casualties of war.  Besides, if you really wanted to protect those colonies, you should have at least a couple of fleets with troops patrolling the borders to intercept enemy fleets and reinforce colonies under invasion. The way I see it, I let the A.I. focus on irrelevant colonies, accept the loses and push deep in his core colonies to hurt him bad whilst protecting the important worlds. If the colonies are too far then you've over-extended yourself and are likely not important. In a war, focus on raw gain and learn to let go of minor losses.  I always try to colonize in a blob, and once I can't expand anymore I refit my ships with latest techs and build a sudden, massive fleet to invade my neighbor of choice. You could try doing that."

Either full manual or the game will decide what to do and when it wants to do it and you cannot stop it.  edit: it's supposed to be a game that lets you play the way you want to play. What many avid fans, and the game itself, end up saying is ""play this way and it could work for you"". Well then...you cannot play the game your way.   Buyers should beware. Most people who recommend the game do not have an understanding of the intricacies of gameplay."

4Xgaming,3cgddv,Cheet4h,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:50:32 2015 UTC,I think I've heard it's optimized better as well.
4Xgaming,3cgddv,HallowedError,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:53:06 2015 UTC,Im not really sure if there are still bug fixes for the previous expansions. I would imagine that there aren't though. So you might be missing out on some stability improvements and such.   I have never played anything but Universe but I'm pretty sure the big thing that Universe brought to the table was mod support. So if you don't care too much about that then you should be fine. There is however a great modding community around Universe that makes the game so so so much better imo. So I would recommend checking that out at least. But overall you should still have fun with the game definitely.
4Xgaming,3cgddv,Nilhomini,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:37:30 2015 UTC,I'm preying for you to be able to return it.

4Xgaming,3cdblr,Mezmorki,4,Tue Jul 7 11:09:52 2015 UTC,"Really nice job! I would add a legend, either as a separate tab or a grid on each tab because I have no idea what TBT is.  I would also add a column for standalone vs. expansion to make for easier filtering."
4Xgaming,3cdblr,jlobster,3,Tue Jul 7 13:05:14 2015 UTC,"Good suggestions.  The second column (EXP) flags whether the entry is an expansion or not.    Adding a legend makes sense, I'll see what I can do.  TBT = Turn-based Tactical Combat TBS = Turn-based Strategy and so on ....  The other thing I started trying to do was to sort the games into rough sub-genres.  E.G., Total War games are mainly RTS games but with a robust campaign system that works similarly to many 4X games.  Paradox grand strategy games overlap a lot with 4X games, but are a little different too.  Pure 4X wargames are different from more Civ-inspired 4X games focused on empire building (as well as warfare).  And so on...."
4Xgaming,3cdblr,Mezmorki,3,Tue Jul 7 13:37:40 2015 UTC,"Ah! I missed that. Do you think it's necessary to have a distinction with expansions vs. standalone expansions? I'm putting myself in the shoes of a user saying, ""What do I have to buy?""  I think the STRAT, TACT, and Sub-Genre columns should help with the What Else Would I Like? questions."

It doesn't help that it can be kind of opaque when it comes to game mechanics... whenever I play, I have Google open in a browser window. >_>  Plus with automation, it's the Civilization worker problem: if you want shit to get done right, you have to do it yourself. I wouldn't dream of giving the AI control of ship design, and that shit takes forever.  But I'll be damned if it isn't the best space 4x I've played in some time."
4Xgaming,3c3tio,megazver,2,Sat Jul 4 14:32:53 2015 UTC,"The game looks ok. I don't like that it's developed with tablets in mind too but I do like that it's turn-based. Too bad that with only 9 days left on KS, this project won't make it. Maybe they will continue it. Who knows.."

4Xgaming,3c00a7,Bigheadmike,19,Fri Jul 3 15:11:06 2015 UTC,"Its a game you really have to love in order to be able to forgive all of its flaws. And boy does it have flaws.  The battleviewer is bugged to the point where what it shows you has nothing to do with the actual results of the battle. It might show you winning, but when you go back to the galaxy map your entire fleet is dead.  There's no automation/macro-management anywhere. There's no way to put fleets on search and destroy. Herding constructors for starbases is micromanagement hell.  The AI needs a lot of work also. The AI is pretty dumb. The only thing it has going for it are huge production/money bonuses at higher difficulty levels. Its ships can cram in way more stuff and their ships can fly further just because. It also outright gets free technology. The AI needs this level of cheating to put up a fight, and even then, its not much of one.  I wouldn't recommend it for a new player or someone on the fence. You have to overlook a lot to enjoy it. That shouldn't be the case, but sadly, it is."
4Xgaming,3c00a7,Hyndis,7,Fri Jul 3 15:34:46 2015 UTC,"Well said. The game could have been so much better with another 6 months or so of beta. Instead they rush and it and adopt the ""it's broken now but it'll be good in a few years after patches and DLC!"" business model which seems to plague 4X gaming at the moment.  I have about 8 hours played and haven't touched it since, and this is someone who absolutely LOVED GalCiv 2. I feel cheated even when I bought it at 50% off."
4Xgaming,3c00a7,PseudoElite,7,Fri Jul 3 19:43:12 2015 UTC,Don't forget the shitty map. This game would have been better with clearer map symbols. Governing a large empire is a PITA.

4Xgaming,3c00a7,Hoooooooar,2,Fri Jul 3 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"For the constructors, it helps to only manually build those for new starbases, and use the Request Constructor button for upgrades. Then they automatically get build and move to the starbase without a hassle."
4Xgaming,3c00a7,Flater420,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:07:05 2015 UTC,"New tech is always rolling in which means starbases always have upgrades waiting. A big stack of constructors to build a fully upgraded starbase in one go only works for the tech you have at that moment. Got a new tech coming in next turn? Oh look, you need to queue up another round of constructors for every starbase in you empire. You have to click on every starbase and have every starbase request a constructor.  Hostile ship blows up a constructor? Gotta figure out which starbase is missing it.  Then once the constructors show up you have to go into each starbase and manually click the upgrade button, even if there's only 1 possible thing to upgrade on the starbase.  Sure, you can get around starbase micromanagement hell by not building many starbases, but you're missing out on a major game mechanic. Starbases are a big feature."

4Xgaming,3c00a7,KingMoonfish,7,Fri Jul 3 20:43:58 2015 UTC,It just doesnt have the pull factor of other 4x at the moment for me. It feels tedious and needlessly complex on the one hand. And grazes over other parts pretty recklessly.   Fleets feel cumbersome. Space battles are not interesting. Neither is ship design.  I never stuck around long enough to experience lategame tech.
4Xgaming,3c00a7,ReneG8,9,Fri Jul 3 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"I had some fun with it for 30 hours. Won on Gifted, I think. Now I'm waiting for some major update on AI. Exploits like sensor ships feel wrong.  Good game. I see some problems but it's core is good. Even if they don't change anything else I'd play it from time to time probably.  On the other hand, I've played Endless Space much more to see it has some core problems, and ES had really good UX. I still think GalCiv3 is the best thing you can get if you love space."

I never really got to the mid game in any of them, either, only small skirmishes and events.  My last experience goes like this: I was exploring and expanding as usual, colonizing dozens of worlds and building up a lot of tech and military power. I was doing everything I could. I had a good armada going, several fully stacked fleets.   For 10 hours or so this went on until I come into contact with another race for the first time that (nearly) insta-declares war on me. I figured it'd be fun - until I saw that they had conquered three times as much of the map as me, and had nearly 10x my number of vessels. This is was on the normal difficulty.   I rage quit and haven't played it since."
4Xgaming,3c00a7,KingMoonfish,2,Fri Jul 3 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"It doesn't feel nearly as good as GC2 DA (I say DA because Twilight of the Arnor was a giant step backwards, I think the introduction of the different tech trees really changed things for the worse (the AI in particular was considerably easier in ToA)  If GC3 is the best space 4x on the market, then the market needs some new space 4x games.

A large hull crammed with sensors and only sensors can see everything. Sensors stack forever.  This doesn't matter vs the AI however, because at anything higher than normal difficulty level the AI ignores fog of war. It has perfect vision. Even then, the AI is pretty lethargic."

4Xgaming,3c00a7,letitgo_obaminaver,2,Fri Jul 3 17:43:34 2015 UTC,"I'll give you the honest truth. For me it's a solid game. I had fun first watching the YouTubers who showed it off (Arumba is my boy) them I got it and played it. As a casual 4x gamer I had a good time. I messed with the management for a couple hours across different save files, then crushed the AI. For me it was worth the money I paid for the time I took to beat it. It's a fun interactive game. I recommend it."

One HUGE and I mean HUGE plus for it is the map sizes. You goto the insane setting and then. Holy shit. I've never seen something so big in my life, if you ever played Spore imagine space stage except in a strategy game. It's absolutely beautiful. One flaw in the game is lack of auto-managing, hopefully this is fixed in the future and in the mean time there's always a menu open to help you see all your planets and the end turn button will tell you if something important isn't done."

But man is it fun to roleplay your alternate universe Roman empire that never collapsed, conquered the earth, and is now expanding into the stars. It has everything 4x players could want, except pretty graphics.  However, it bogs down in the mid and end game, to the point it becomes unplayable (in my opinion). People are working on a modern version of it, called pulsar 4x, which should deal with the legacy speed issues. I'm at work, otherwise I'd link it, but you can find it on the Aurora forums. Still very much in development, but something to keep an eye on once you understand Aurora well."

SR2 takes it all and turns it into an actual game. They basically took SR1 and thought ""how do we add actual gameplay to this?"". And so they did, while still adding more novel concepts to it.

Then certain planetary conquest elements were filtered out..You'd get Beyond Sol.  The result is a rather satisfying Action RT4X where you can build a city colony in space.  The game starts rather slowly. You establish your city in a sector and manually start harvesting resources from asteroids or attacking rogue pirates for their loot. Events will occur where you will get the chance to collect more resources (such as a passing comet) or gain additional money (such as answering distress calls).  Through additional mining facilities, trading and diplomacy you can speed up the process as you build civil quarters, shops, shipyards and defenses. Which in turn allows you to increase the size of your fleet, upgrade your ships and buildings and eventually expand and conquer the galaxy full of already well developed civilisations.  It's a very interesting mix of genres that actually works rather well. There's still an awful lot to go in.

The key tenets of Reddit are (1) new is better than old (2) more points is better (3) what is said is more important than who said it. Those all help Reddit capture moments in history, but make it terrible for promoting long term discussion on a niche topic.

People use forums less these days because they stagnate terribly and are biased against new users with miles of sticky posts to read through.  Reddit tries to be the opposite of that.  I mean, nobody is trying to discuss specific 4x games here at length...it's more to discuss developments in the industry and new stuff...in that sense it's perfect.

4Xgaming,3bpdcx,basshead17,3,Wed Jul 1 04:51:43 2015 UTC,"Of the ones I've played:   Distant Worlds is pretty incredible and my personal recommendation. The scale of the game is huge and there's a lot going on in the galaxies it creates. But on the other hand, it might be quite difficult to learn since it is quite complex. I'd need a long time to describe all of the features. Endless Space is a turn-based game, and has simplified many of the common elements of space 4x games, such as ship design (which can be tedious in other titles). It's easy to pick up and has some interesting variation in playable factions, such as am insect/robot faction that consumes worlds and cannot make treaties with other civilizations. Visual and especially audio presentation is pretty superb. Plus I really dig the flavor text for the technologies you research. Sins of a Solar Empire simplifies still further, and is more of an RTS than a 4x game, although a slow-paced RTS with a heavy emphasis on the macro. It is the most accessible of anything I've listed here. It does away with ship design and only offers 3 factions with 2 variants (loyalists/rebels), but what's left is extremely polished. It has some of the most impressive space battles of any video game.   Also, avoid Star Drive."

4Xgaming,3bgjx9,domainsofascension,7,Mon Jun 29 01:05:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure a bureaucracy simulator is going to be much fun. This stuff is abstracted for a reason. Bureaucrats don't tell the stories people want to hear, and careful shepherding of minutiae isn't an attractive design. The hyperfocus on imagined vassal mechanics in the absence of historical context is another thing that makes this whole post odd and tone deaf."
4Xgaming,3bgjx9,roboczar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:12:26 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between something that simulates a bureaucracy and a bureaucracy simulator, though.  Firstly its extremely abstract. You aren't managing personalities. You just need to assign some population once and they will do their thing. Its there as part of simulating internal politics. I'd make it more detailed if I thought the average player had a computer that could handle it. If you abstract it any more it wouldn't be able to perform its function.  Secondly we have solid evidence that people will perform a task if it furthers some other goal. Workers in civ are examples of this. We still had them even into the later Civ games because having the game automagically link cities by road with no reason was silly.  As far as vassals and historical context, its not a historical game, however the potential vassal options and the way they form your kingdom is perfectly consistent with history. Rome or the Mongols or China all had many diverse treaties with various states that acted as vassals and tributaries. All the possible terms of treaties are drawn from real history. And its only hyperfocused on vassals because this one specific thread happens to be about vassals and internal political issues. That's the point of this post. I should hope I talk a lot about vassals.  Minutiae is a problem if it becomes tedious to manage and serves little purpose. The details here don't require tons of time investment, much less than in successful games like Dominions or Galciv or something. And they serve a specific purpose as opposed to manually assigning mages to research every turn like in Dominions. The vassal mechanics for instance allow much more historical concordance than the famously history obsessed Paradox games even though the game is fantasy.  Anyways bureaucracy simulators that are intentionally that actually exist, as do management sims and crap."
4Xgaming,3bgjx9,MilitaryDivination,3,Mon Jun 29 05:34:37 2015 UTC,"You aren't managing personalities.  Why? It could be an interesting set of mechanics that would add to the game and make the player care about his vassals and governors.  The details here don't require tons of time investment  No, they don't. They do not create any new decisions for the player or make the game more engaging. They don't change how you approach expansion. All this does is add another click, or fifty, into the UI and loads the machine with more unnecessary simulation.  If you want more engaging vassalisation/annexation mechanics, use personalities. Give groups and individuals desires that use the game mechanics that are relevant to said groups, and make the player manage those."
4Xgaming,3bgjx9,roboczar,0,Mon Jun 29 12:23:39 2015 UTC,"Clearly you are not actually reading what I am writing. When I said you don't manage personalities I was talking about the low level bureaucrats.  http://www.rpgcodex.net/forums/index.php?threads/real-espionage-and-dirty-politics.100525/  Here is a post on rpgcodex that deals with part of the character based mechanics. Although I specifically already said in the post that governors and nobles DO have personalities and desires to manage. But that goes into more detail.  However each of these threads is on a particular issue. So there is a lot more to characters than even the second post notes.  Also literally BOTH the things you quoted related specifically to complaints by the other poster about the population and not character based bureaucrat mechanic but I gave a longer response anyways since you seem not to have read my actual post.  Also they absolutely create new decisions. Because you have to deal with assigning too many characters, or bureaucrats from a similar population, perhaps because that group is more skilled, causing unrest and jealousy among other populations. Or as specifically mentioned in the post in detail, how some populations are ethnocentric and want their group, whatever it is, to be the one in power.  It also deals with how actual cultural acceptance and political integration works. Consider the US and the political fallout over racial or religious representation among politicians, government workers, and high level corporate positions. Or go even farther back in time and look at the history of how non-Germanic Europeans dealt with integration into society after immigration to places like Ellis Island. Consider how most of the NYC Fire department is, or at least was, Irish, or the way that Irish holidays became national ones like St. Patrick's day.  The system also describes issues with European colonialism. America was not integrated into English government causing its eventual revolt. I specifically detailed how raising taxes or recruiting soldiers becomes an issue if you fail to integrate a population at the same time as you increase those responsibilities."

What story are you trying to tell with the bureaucracy simulator mechanic? What essential concepts are being explored and what is the payoff for the player? Your main thrust appears to be that the EU4 abstraction doesn't have enough complexity or detail, but I'm not really seeing a compelling reason to change this other than it suits your aesthetic."
4Xgaming,3bgjx9,roboczar,2,Mon Jun 29 12:08:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a grand strategy game out there that has a narrative or a story beyond the one you make for yourself. Everything Paradox has ever put out it is a very basic excel spreadsheet with a wildly random roll of a die whenever you change something on the sheet. And then they slapped some graphics on it.   One of the biggest complaints with the Paradox titles is a significant lack of political, diplomatic and economical control. There's nothing at all to do in peace time but to prepare your next war. The people who play grand strategy games want intricate and complex. The secret is making the UI and tooltips good.   As far as I am concerned there's every reason to take the EU4 concept and make an actual complicated and detailed game out of it."
4Xgaming,3bgjx9,roboczar,0,Mon Jun 29 16:43:00 2015 UTC,Well at least one person understands the argument I'm making... I can only conclude that the other poster just doesn't care for the the kind of game I'm discussing. Which makes discourse with him pointless.

There are only two resources to exploit. Diplomacy and trade is a joke. Only three races that are more similar than they are different, and the Rebellion expansion didn't do much to change that. And the phase lanes are extremely limiting in terms of gameplay.   I'm not knocking the game, I love it. I've played it, and it's various expansions, for well over 300 cumulative hours.

Now I've only really mucked around with development and never really committed to a specific game but a 4X inherently tends towards complexity, in the game systems themselves if not always the way the player interacts with them.  For your high level decisions to feel meaningful, I'd suggest that there has to be an awful lot going on in the background (inter and intra empire diplomacy, some form of character personality being affected the simulation of their actions, planetary development, local and empire wide morale, criminality, well performing strategic and tactical AI (likely multiple varieties of each as you're trying to make aliens properly alien etc etc  I'm worried you may be overpromising, overreaching or simply underestimating the amount of time it'll take one person to design, code and balance all this.

I've watched all your videos and am really looking forward to giving this a shot. For what it's worth, I've a few suggestions:    Make admirals, govenors and so on persistant characters, ala Cursader Kings, with allies and friends and rivals, land holdings, children, businesses etc. Play rivals against each other, keep powerful men onside by giving them plum roles, etc... I suppose that is micro management of a sort, but it's exactly the sort of micro management an emperor would have to engage in - court politics!  It would be very cool if corruption had more relevance than just lost cedits per turn, which is (no offence) a little bland. Maybe that could result in them selling technology to other factions, becoming an informant/spy, or even switching sides entirely?  Likewise, could impetuous admirals/generals/commodores accidentally create diplomatic crises by overstepping your orders?  This one is super trivial: the general/colonel ranking seems a bit off. A colonel is a relatively junior rank so it feels odd that they would command a planetary force - maybe it should go grand marshal/general or something like that.   Sorry if any of these ideas are already implemented or based on a misunderstanding of the game systems. Like I say, the game sounds tremendous and I look forward to seeing how it turns out.

I was thinking of ""tiers of corruption"", like it you have below 5 it's just less money, 6+ means reduced happiness of population, 7+ they start selling weapons to rebels. Also corruption should decrease your counterintelligence (since other races can bribe your officials).  But I have a more fundamental question about corruption, what about corruption of military leaders? Should this be separate from civil service (governors)? I mean, if a governor is corrupted it means people don't like it and money are lost. But if it's an admiral shouldn't he sell excessive military equipment reserves on the market or something? Or maybe corruption of military shoudl be removed altogether (and replaced with, let's say, Patriotism or something?)

The interface is not great, with several information displays that take up the entire screen ....(edited) Diplomacy is accomplished by undertaking positive or negative media campaigns against the other races, a slow, gradual process. War is always the end result, and combat is automated. It can take a long time for something to happen, which is less of a problem in a turn-based game but still notable.

It's been like that for years now.  Having some developers come at it from a different angle may actually be a good thing.  Probably not a good idea to attach that to the MOO name though."
4Xgaming,3av7io,lolasaurusrex1234,3,Tue Jun 23 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"Probably not a good idea to attach that to the MOO name though.   And that's why World War Z the movie is horrible.  If it had been any other name it might pass, but it was nothing like it's namesake."
4Xgaming,3av7io,JohnLeafback,2,Wed Jun 24 03:33:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think WWZ would really be doable as a movie. As a Netflix style series? Absolutely. But not as a movie. WWZ involves multiple people each telling their own story about their own experiences in the same event, all from different perspectives. This is ideal for a miniseries but it doesn't work for a movie.  I, Robot, was another horrible misuse of a book. Its like people who made the movie not only failed to read the book, they've never been in the same building with the book. Its a complete misunderstanding of the entire point of the book. Asimov's book has exactly the opposite story of the movie."

The interviewer wrote a lot of words but these words didn't contain very much information. The interviewer spends more time talking about themselves than the game.  Things that the game has, according to this preview:   Different factions. Ability to focus production on a planet to different things. 75 technologies. Orbital bombardment, including destroying a planet outright. Random events. Multiplayer of some sort.   That seems a bit sparse to me. I'd like some more info. Most 4x players are keen on tons and tons of info."

Simpler can still be fun. I may end up enjoying it and people that prefer MOO to MOO2 may be in for a treat.  My other big concern is that the GUI will push accessibility at the cost of functionality. Tasks that are easy to figure out by clicking around, but require extra work every time you do it until you give up on the game. Being a modern game with a modern resolution bring great potential for the GUI, but it's not a gimme."
4Xgaming,3av7io,Park555,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:53:24 2015 UTC,If you've played any of the Paradox grand strategy games and then seen its prequels you can see that accessibility can most definitely be added without losing much complexity. As long as they add a very functional colonies screen I don't think much more functionality can be asked for.
4Xgaming,3av7io,real_jeeger,5,Wed Jun 24 08:24:46 2015 UTC,"Eh, accessibility and Paradox... Don't know. The CK2 interface is only intuitive because you spend so many hours with it. I think it's more geared towards heavy players that want to do things efficiently."

That doesn't mean I personally find it all incredibly fun to play...I don't really know yet...and maybe it's all more simple than I think and I'm just a newb and the UI is unnecessarily complex."
4Xgaming,3av7io,Park555,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:06:03 2015 UTC,I'm referring to improvement over previous UI. If you look at CK1 to CK2 they have improved significantly. Diddo for EU3  to EU4.

I've haven't closely followed the pre-release hype for a Paradox game since they switched to the bilion expansions that fill out gameplay model - but I have heard significant of grousing about complexities removed from HoI4.  To clarify, I didn't mean to say that interfaces can't be improved or that all methods of presenting equal complexity are equally accessible. But when a developer stands up before release and says they are making it more accessible, that doesn't mean they are optimizing the interface. It means the current target audience is too small, so they need to make the game more palatable to a larger audience. They justify themselves by saying they are preserving the wheat and discarding the chaff, but I've had features I enjoy discarded as the chaff enough to wait for the details (e.g. meaningful stat choices in FO3, skills in FO4).   As long as they add a very functional colonies screen I don't think much more functionality can be asked for.   Just the usual stuff - is all the information I need to make a decision on the same screen? how long does it take to do common tasks?"
4Xgaming,3av7io,Maskirovka,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:19:25 2015 UTC,I agree about the marketing considerations.  That preview was full of marketing nonsense and buzzwords.

It's actually not that terrible of a DLC model considering there's also a free patch with every DLC and it goes on sale frequently for 75% off. I'm mostly talking about, as someone who played EU3, that EU4 has just as much complexity but is much easier to play.   but I have heard significant of grousing about complexities removed from HoI4.   I can't confirm this due to the fact that HoI4 hasn't come out yet, but I hear this primarily from HoI3 fans. They removed a lot of the clutter which some people either consider complexity or really annoying micromanagement. That one's debatable."
4Xgaming,3av7io,Park555,3,Thu Jun 25 03:19:57 2015 UTC,It's interesting that instead of doing a range radius like MoO or MoO2 they instead went with system connection lines. I'm not really sure what I think of this. Having to potentially go through someone elses star system in order to get to a destination doesn't seem like great game design.

If you want something truly epic though try Crusader Kings 2. The learning curve is brutal, but once you learn the ""basics"" it's a hell of ride...  edit: spelling"
4Xgaming,3alf08,domainsofascension,5,Sun Jun 21 11:07:36 2015 UTC,"GalCiv doesn't seem like it's finished yet. As I understand it it's still missing features like politics and internal decisions and those will be added later. So I'm not sure if it's worth investing in yet? Like the reviews look good, but most of them seem to suggest it's simply not a complete game yet.   CK2 I have given up on. I've played it since release and it's just too darn easy. Once you've spent 2 hours learning it it's probably one of the most basic games on the market, despite its exceedingly complex appearance."
4Xgaming,3alf08,andreasn2,2,Sun Jun 21 11:39:41 2015 UTC,Self imposed challenges and mods help a lot with CK2.  Start as a minor lord in the Iron Islands and try to conquer Dorne for your liege or something.
4Xgaming,3alf08,domainsofascension,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:47:12 2015 UTC,"It would be better if the game itself was more difficult. Sure if you start as a single holding count christian count it takes a while to move on, but its not hard exactly. A two province count will probably beat you unless you used the ruler designer for a massive martial stat and good combat traits. Unless you just sit around waiting for the cash for mercs. Paradox games aren't HARDER as an OPM, they are just duller with more waiting to be able to do anything."
4Xgaming,3alf08,domainsofascension,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:43:04 2015 UTC,"Can't say I disagree on the difficulty point at least.  IMO they are at their best when you're playing for the story/roleplay rather than playing to win.  I barely remember the time I took over the entire world, but I could rant for ages about the time I made sure every major title was held by my dynasty or the time I conquered all of Britain, Spain and France before merging the titles and setting them to gavelkind or the time I basically moved the HRE to Africa or the time I played a bloodthirsty line of rulers who slaughtered the entire dynasty of anyone who wronged them or the time I played every single character according to their personality traits.  Not everyone enjoys that kind of playstyle (which is fine) but I find it makes this sort of sandbox far more enjoyable."
4Xgaming,3alf08,DhulKarnain,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:25:21 2015 UTC,"I like to do crazy fun crap too but the problem for CK2 is that that is all there is because the systems lack depth. I mean when I was a kid I made an econ system of a simulated sci fi adventurers village out of legos using those circular gem things as currency. Or we literally played Starcraft in the dirt patch at my school. Or I play the equivalent of gratuitous space battles on paper with my brother. Or in Latchkey I invented a simple system of breeding based on block colors that mix and matched like simple DNA and we had like a MonsterRancher/Digimon style combat league and shit and different color mixes had different powers.  But that doesn't mean that just cause I can make shit up in my head I'm gonna pay Paradox 100$s of dollars, if you don't buy it at all on sale 4 months after release, to do the same thing in CK2. I have a cost/mental investment/hours played equation in my head and CK2 is not meeting the requirements. EU4 gets worse and worse every expansion as well.  And the mental investment value accounts for mods, too. For the prices they charge Paradox needs to bring more of their own quality design to the table."
4Xgaming,3alf08,MEaster,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"100s of dollars? I bought all of the paradox grand strategy games currently newest in each series, for about 20€. That was without the expansions, but I don't buy expansions unless I really, really enjoy the basegame. You don't need to buy every new DLC that comes out like a slave!"
4Xgaming,3alf08,MEaster,3,Sun Jun 21 22:53:22 2015 UTC,"I only buy content related DLC, not that worthless cosmetic crap. The problem, specifically with EU4, no idea about CK2, is that DLC unlock important shit. Common Sense unlocks development which is shit, but without access to that what do I do with all my extra monarch points? Core 700ADM provinces that I took just to burn off ADM while having shitty overextension penalties that raise liberty desires and shit? Also until players made a HUGE FUCKING SHITSTORM, critical features like national focus were intended to drop in the DLC and not the patch. Also each DLC will add something awesome but it will then offset it with lots of annoying garbage. The content in the free patch aside from bugfixes, is vastly overrated.  Also every design decision Paradox makes is based on the DLC features, so you can get extra fucked over by the dumb changes if you don't buy them.  Also the games tend to launch at 40$.  The thing about Paradox games is the same issue EVE or LOL has. There is so much potential but they never realize it and since no one else on the market is making games that are even as close to your goal as they are, you are really stuck with them and just deluding yourself into thinking maybe this time will be different or chasing the few moments when something awesome happened even though its mostly a dull slog. But its not like I have the choice to just play a better game because most other devs are even worse making dull popamole cookie cutter shit like Civ5. Even GalCiv2-3 which not really being pushed too hard by greed or market pressure still lacks any sort of interesting depth. It doesn't do anything unique to resolve my issues with current 4x games. At least Paradox TRIED to do something unique even if they fudge up the execution massively."
4Xgaming,3alf08,domainsofascension,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:52:41 2015 UTC,"CK2's DLCs often add whole new mechanics to specific regions, or entire new regions. Like the Old Gods expansion pack changed the whole game. They've done a few meh ones too, like Way of Life which just adds 100 more random events or something and fiddles a bit with choices your characters can make. But overall CK2s DLC strategy is largely about content. EU4 largely sends out minor alterations to existing systems, what other games would call updates.   Problem with CK2 is that there's warfare and there's inheritance. That's it. The entire game is based on those two things. There's nothing else to do. There's no economy, no diplomacy, no management of anything. It all looks really daunting when you first start, but pretty soon it becomes evident that the game is so basic as a strategy game.   EU4 does a much better job at this stuff. Yet there as well they keep fumbling with the ball. You have many more ways to reach your goal, but there's such a lack of more intricate features and that's a real shame."
4Xgaming,3alf08,Dozed12,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:05:27 2015 UTC,There's no diplomacy or real management in EU4 either. There's vassal feeding but that's just because part of CK2's schtick hides the vassal feeding you can do in that game. Buildings are now worse in EU4 than CK2. PUs/royal marriages have always been worse. Both of them have lame tech systems but EU4 wins cause its slightly less linear.

4Xgaming,3afgms,Hannibal_Rex,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:49:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I love long blocks of text. It's not about the devs seeing it, rather it's a list of areas in which MOO2 is weak at (which is rarely talked about, as it is usually just all praise)"
4Xgaming,3afgms,Hannibal_Rex,2,Sat Jun 20 07:44:28 2015 UTC,"Masters of Orion: The Re-imagining would need to develop in a few areas which restricted MoO2 because of technology or programming.  Let's start with Customization.  MoO2 allowed customizing races and ship design, but did not have the ability to design the look of ships beyond the color palette or a species beyond a set of attributes, which could have affected how the race looked or behaved overall.  Cosmetic ship customization is something GalCiv has always done very well and it is upsetting that Stardock is the only company allowing that level of free form exterior design.  MoO needs this, if only to make it easier to distinguish between different designs against the 5 Frigate hull shapes.  Eventually it becomes hard to remember, unless the name is goofy, what ship has laser cannons and what ship has neutron beams if they both have the same body design.  Technology needs some randomization.  MoO2 had the racial attribute ""Creative"" and this ruined the idea of 1 tech per research topic.  Each time I made a race, Creative was always #1 at the top of the list for how they would be made.  This is something Sword of the Stars does that most others games ignore completely and it makes each game actually unique (and amazing).  The idea is that there is a core block of technologies that we will have access to each game and an electives (for lack of a better term) block that we might chance into while researching.  So while everyone will get fusion technology and better warp drives, it doesn't mean that everyone will get automated factories AND robotic housing.  Sometimes a race doesn't explore or dedicate enough resources to one type of research category and it causes long term consequences.  Enhanced spying.  If you don't have a technology because you didn't have access to it, maybe your neighbor has it.  Stealing tech is usually one of only a couple spying options in any 4X and having the complete satisfaction of knowing that you have researched all possible avenues of tech allows all of the spies you make to be defensive and stop enemy spying.  What if your nation was Space Einsteins and yet you didn't have a chance to research anti-matter beams?  The Psilons have it, but you don't - now you want to move those spies onto offensive mode and try to take it.  It means spying is a bigger part of the game, and that means more options for spying should be there already.  What if you could sabotage an enemy on the scale of its entire empire?  Start by causing unrest on a planet and then have that unrest turn into a rebellion with dissonance spreading throughout the rival nation and causing a civil war?  It will be two equally large nations with equal tech fighting each other - suddenly being a smart, small race doesn't have to be a disadvantage.  It also means no one will trust the Darlok, exactly as they shouldn't.  Spying doesn't have to be about only information.  It can and should cause serious problems for everyone involved.  A government that finds out you actively supported their downfall would have a reason to go to war.  Government types in MoO2 were only statistical advantages.  A hive mind was better at building than a democracy, but a democracy made more money.  What if war was more difficult because the citizens didn't want to fight?  Civ2 was a perfect example of this - you can't fight a war because the people won't support it.  Make government types count towards any decisions a player may make and have those decisions actually matter.  Crusader Kings 2 has the Casus Belli system of war that requires a leader to have a legitimate reason to attack, like having a dynastic or jurisdictional claim on the area.  MoO2 just threw it out the window and let anyone be Kim Jong-Il, regardless of whatever government type they were supposed to have.  What if a democratic government was ridiculously good and had bonuses to everything but you had to worry about being re-elected?  Hearts of Iron 3 does this and it makes decisions count.  If your leader loses an election, you don't lose the game - it makes in-game politics much more difficult.  If FDR isn't president then Britain is less likely to be friendly and Germany becomes an attractive trade partner.  All of the nations shift allegiances somehow and it makes the game tense when what you want to do as a player is hinged on the notion that you have an election coming up.  Government types are important and need to be treated as such.  Bringing together government types and spying and all of the tech into an improved diplomatic dialogue with other races NEEDS to be a thing these days.  More than just trade agreements and research agreements, a diplomatic partnership between races should have some kind of ability to change a game.  If trade and research between nations improved over time, it would make keeping friends very valuable.  It would also mean that if you or your friend were attacked then it may be in both of your best interests to return the aggression and attack back.  But what if you and your friendly nation were the small fish in the ocean and the big, mean empire that is aggressive would crush you both?  Do you want to help your friend now?  What if your friend was trying to start a rebellion and got caught?  The big empire is totally justified in going to war because your friend was being a dick and now the only way that your trade and research bonuses go on is to go to war and save them yourself.  But these are Civ5 level of diplomatic choices.  What if we take it a step further and say that the big rival empire is actually a small clique of a couple nations and you get an offer to join their little Warsaw Pact?  Do you form NATO or do you join up and become ""safe"", provided you follow the rules of the Pact by unilaterally sharing information, research, and meeting a ship quota for the Pact's fleet?  It could be fun if you control the Pact/NATO fleet but being voted out of control could happen if you are careless and keep presenting things that destabilize the Pact like needless wars of aggression.    The endgame in MoO2 was limited to conquering Antares and unifying the entire galaxy into a blob that voted you as supreme leader.  But that isn't always a feasible endgame for empires that play tall.  The answer to playing wide vs. tall is to have more options in game.  By expanding out the diplomatic and spying mechanics of the game, making a meaningful government, and removing the ability to soak up all the technologies in one pass through the tech tree it will make a more dynamic environment to be a power player in without the need or vast fleets or a crushing tech lead.  The option for a political victory is now on the table with the introduction of expanded government types.  If the entire galaxy was democratic, or died trying, it would be a great win condition.  Especially if the Klackons were in the game.  An enhanced spy mechanic would make small nations as powerful as the large nations.  The end of a game would be completely different each time.  This is just a start of the ideas that they could include.  I just woke up and haven't had coffee yet, so I apologize for anything that doesn't make sense.  I could go on and on about things that no 4X game has yet, like nomadic nations (that strip planets for resources and move on like in Independence Day) and finding a progenitor race that wants its galaxy back (similar to the Antarans from MoO2 but Genghis Khan style invading from outside the galaxy).  MoO2 did lots of things right but it could also do many more things in general."
4Xgaming,3afgms,ran88dom99,0,Sat Jun 20 16:00:19 2015 UTC,You just want CK. MOO2 is the wrong base to start CK in space.

4Xgaming,3afgms,Soviet_elf,0,Sat Jun 20 18:05:03 2015 UTC,"MoO2 had the racial attribute ""Creative"" and this ruined the idea of 1 tech per research topic. Each time I made a race, Creative was always #1 at the top of the list for how they would be made.   Noobs and low level players love Creative, nothing bad if a person likes playing SP with it, but it's actually a weak expensive and unimportant trait with no early economic advantage, it's not good strategically for anything (for competitive multiplayer, for fast wins, for fast development, for highest score).  Sorry, if I was a developer of new MoO, I would automatically discard advice of everybody who praises ""Creative"" trait."
4Xgaming,3afgms,Soviet_elf,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:05:49 2015 UTC,"rather it's a list of areas in which MOO2 is weak at (which is rarely talked about, as it is usually just all praise)   Mostly AI and balance.   AI. AI is very bad even at simple things: never builds colony bases, AI ship designs are usually very bad, doesn't prioritize factories and labs in tech tree etc. Balance. Race creation is absolutely disbalanced, Unification is too good, especially for 6 points, UniTol/UniAqua are one of the best combos (and also UniTele against AI), production & pop bonuses are strong, some bonuses are garbage (lucky, +ground combat), Stealthy Ships don't even work against AI, some disadvantages are too bad for too low price (like Feudalism with -50% science or Uncreative for just +4 points). Etc. Default races are weak (except Silicoids), especially the militaristic ones with no significant economic bonuses. Tech tree is disbalanced, some things are must-have (basic factories and labs) and definitely should be alone in their category."

4Xgaming,3afgms,General_Fear,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:59:08 2015 UTC,"What I would like to see . . .  More ways to win. Technological victory, Economic victory.  Mortal enemies. Make it an on and of switch. Your race has ""historical enemies"" that can't be reasoned with. They are out for blood. It's kill or be killed.  A Historical Map. Besides the typical random map that 4x games tend to have. It would be nice to have a ""historical map"" In this map, each race has an equal fair share of resources. No advantage to anyone. And each race starts at the same starting place.  I would like to see 3 types of tech trees. Each is an on and off switch so that you can pick what you want.  Standard tech tree. Everyone gets the same tech and you can see what you want to research.  Blind research tech tree. Your scientist research a general topic like weapons. You can't pick what you want to research, instead it is the luck of the draw. Your scientist come back with, ""Hey we discovered anti matter torps""   Race specific tech trees. Here each race gets a unique tech tree. For example, maybe humans have planet wide shields protecting the planet. And no other race has it.   Worm holes. Like all my ideas, this is an on and off switch. You can't fly directly to the other guy's planet. The only worlds you can go to are those worlds that are connected by worm holes. Maybe late in the game, factions can research artificial worm holes so you can go where you want.  A 3 dimensional map option. You can either play 2d like the old game, or 3 D like real space.  Minor races. One thing I liked about the Birth of the Federation is minor races. If you can get them to join you. Or you conquer them, you get a bonus. For example, in BOTF, if the Vulcans joined your empire, you get a boost in scientific research. Minor races took the place of legendary heroes for hire. I prefer minor races over heroes for hire because you have to deal with locals who have their own agendas."

It sounds promising with the fully voiced races along with the expansive tech tree.  The Mrrshan make a come back - sweet!  It does bring up some points that are worrying though.  Dozens of solar systems in a galaxy sound a little sparse, albeit with mention of hundreds of worlds total.  It does mean that a galaxy map will need to be a screenshot to be seen for clarification.  BUT!   Master of Orion did see two sequels though – but neither really lived up to the legacy and potential that started in the first game.   MoO2 was the greatest of the series.  It took the Final Fantasy battle line fighting from MoO1 and expanded it to make smaller ships a HUGE component that required some serious thinking about how to use them to their most effective potential.  I hope this was a typo because if the combat is as simplistic as MoO1, it will be a little disheartening.  Fingers crossed that it comes out as more a technical update on MoO2!"

Fingers crossed that it comes out as more a technical update on MoO2!   While I think MoO2's combat experience was superior there is one aspect of MoO that could be nice to see: the insanely large fleet sizes.  There's something just inherently cool about sending thousands of ships into battle, and it meshes well with the idea of a galactic super power.  Customising meaningful ships and carefully employing them is a lot of fun, but I think 4x space games feel more epic with a bit of scale to them."

I had a strong start in a custom game pre-warp with an 'Excellent' starting system. Eventually had a very rich and populated empire across the 3 habitable worlds of my single-star empire. Mining ships warped to and fro. frigates and escorts sat still.    When my first enemy empire declared war on me out of jealousy for my wealth, I was unprepared. I had been content just paying off pirates, so my fleets were untested and too few. I realized far too late that shields are actually pretty effective to get and heavily stack up. My lasers were effective, but my ships were destroyed before they could apply damage.     The enemy conquered one of my worlds and destroyed everything I had. Two of my worlds remained mine, but it was over. My resources were expended, and no amount of income from my world's mighty population would convince me to try to rebuild after such a defeat.

If you let the AI take over (at least with the AI mod), it'll make intelligent decisions (most of the time) and just prompt you to make decisions here and there like, ""Hey. Do you want to colonize this planet?"", ""Should we go to war with these folks?"", ""Should we send an intelligence agent to steal tech from these folks?"", etc. It's a great game and this is absolutely the time to jump in. I've heavily modded my game by taking the aspects of mods that I've liked and incorporating them all into a bundle.  One of the best aspects of DW:U is that each game is different. I literally feel like I'm exploring space every time when I first discover warp drives and break out of my initial star system. It's the best space 4x on the market."

4Xgaming,3a841i,hbgk10,2,Thu Jun 18 10:30:27 2015 UTC,The game looks good and seems complicated and yet one simple mistake in design can easily break the whole thing.
4Xgaming,3a841i,pdboddy,2,Thu Jun 18 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"That great, many enjoyed Fallen Enchantress and Legendary Heroes too.  I got them for free from WoM pre order, and I could never get to like them, they felt bare.  Different tastes."
4Xgaming,3a841i,Tombot3000,4,Fri Jun 19 05:37:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I had been looking at this, and had decided to wait until release - I too had been ""burned"" by elemental/Fallen Enchantress (though, to Stardock's credit, they did give me free upgrades and DLC and such).  But, I said what the heck and got it. So far, have played about 8 hours or so. It does have the FE ""feel"" to it, but it's a lot more engaging. I like the RPG elements of it. I do hope they give us more customization options for our sovereign and starting hero units in the future, but even if they didn't there's still a lot of variety. The encounter and crafting system is very interesting. My one gripe at the moment (mind you, I'm not beyond early mid-game so far) is that you can't really ""see"" your Sovereign information very well. The skills, yes, but not how much Honor, or Courage, or what have you. Or maybe you can and I don't know how to get to that screen. Also little quality of life things like when I sent a Pioneer waaaay over there to set up an outpost near a shard, only to find out that you can't build outposts in the forest or swamp. But hey, it's still beta.  And no bugs so far at all, which is kinda nice. I had expected at least a few."
4Xgaming,3a841i,Tombot3000,2,Fri Jun 19 04:11:44 2015 UTC,"There is not any feedback on the ""acquired"" stats, i.e. Courage, Scoundrel, and I'm not sure if that's intended or not. I do agree that I'd like some feedback on those, too.   Agree with you on the pioneer's limits, too. It's frustrating that they're not more clear.   I'm really excited to see you picked it up and enjoy it. There's a lot more replayability than one would expect, so try all the sovereigns!   There's probably only one more beta before release. Beta 5.3 is in Opt-In (as the title suggests) and the changes to Minors (now Rivals) are quite fun.   I have heard some really cool things are coming to the ""end game"" in the next patch. Will report on it the moment I can ;)"
4Xgaming,3a841i,pdboddy,6,Fri Jun 19 11:15:22 2015 UTC,"I can easily recommend waiting for a lower price, after the game is launched.  I bought Elemental: War of Magic.  Stardock doesn't get an easy ride from me, not any more.  On the other hand, GalCiv3 is great so far.  Stardock does have the capability to put out great games, when hubris is not blinding them."
4Xgaming,3a841i,pdboddy,-2,Thu Jun 18 09:32:35 2015 UTC,"This is only similar to EWOM in universe, but nothing else. Unless you've played Sorcerer King, which I'm almost certain you haven't, you can't recommend against it with any authority.   Sorcerer King is a great game and it feels more complete than most games do at launch, despite its Early Access status."
4Xgaming,3a841i,reck0,9,Thu Jun 18 10:29:51 2015 UTC,He absolutely can recommend against a company which left many customers feeling burned with their last game in the genre. I like stardock and bought both elemental and galciv3 before release but I'm also waiting on this one. Being good for early access at this point doesn't mean the finished product will definitely be something I like
4Xgaming,3a841i,reck0,-3,Thu Jun 18 11:57:16 2015 UTC,"It's almost complete and it's good, period. Doesn't need a ""good for Early Access"" qualifier. But it's fine, I tried. You guys are missing out."
4Xgaming,3a841i,Lushington,3,Thu Jun 18 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying its bad, I'm saying its reasonable to be suspicious based on past results from the people making the game. Your replies in this thread are just dismissing people because you think the game is good, and I'm pointing out that there's another way to look at it."

4Xgaming,3a841i,mainichi,3,Sat Jun 20 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"I don't have to have played it to caution people about buying in early access.  Stardock royally screwed up with War of Magic, and despite making amends there, they essentially abandoned Fallen Enchantress.  There is lingering upsetness about this.  People who've experienced the issues with WoM and FE know well enough to be cautious about Early Access.  People new to it should be given fair warning.  It's not about Sorcerer King, it's about Stardock.  EDIT: Also, I can play Sorcerer King and still recommend against early access."
4Xgaming,3a841i,mainichi,2,Thu Jun 18 13:37:34 2015 UTC,I know you've played this quite a bit so I wonder if you wouldn't mind telling me how it compares to fallen entrantress:legendary heroes?  I really enjoyed legendary heroes but this looks vey similar. What extra things does this bring to the table or where does it fall short compared to heroes?  Appreciate your thoughts.
4Xgaming,3a841i,mainichi,2,Thu Jun 18 12:48:47 2015 UTC,"It's much more of an RPG/4X hybrid than a true 4X game. You always play as the Altar, but you choose which leader type you are, very similar to choosing an RPG class. You build cities and they level up like FE, but the empire management portion plays a smaller role. We have a bunch of LPs, so you may want to check those out for more details ;)"

Edit: Im'm trying to choose between the whole series, or just the first or the second. I don't care about the graphics, the game mechanics are the important part."
4Xgaming,3a6w94,gaby321,13,Wed Jun 17 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"I am confused, why do you want to play either game if it's buggy and poorly made? Youve seen the bad reviews already. I bought SD2 on release and it was very disappointing for me. The mechanics and gameplay are not good, i dont care about graphics either. AI is broken and there are lots of bugs. The game is not getting bad reviews because of graphics or sounds, its because of gameplay and mechanics  It looks good in videos, but so do most games, which is why i stupidly bought it. There are much better made games that have mods, mods should improve a good game, not fix a bad broken one. Even if there were mods for sd2 to make it playable, they are not there  Dont waste your money, if you're enjoying star ruler 2 then stick to that. The original MOO2 is much better than SD2 at a less price"
4Xgaming,3a6w94,klngarthur,4,Wed Jun 17 21:45:10 2015 UTC,"The modding capabilities of the game are pretty limited.  Basically just swapping/adding art assets and modifying data files where things aren't hardcoded (and a lot of things are hardcoded, unfortunately).   There is no API or SDK, so mods that add significant new mechanics or that fix bugs are unlikely to happen."
4Xgaming,3a6w94,runetrantor,2,Wed Jun 17 23:58:25 2015 UTC,"Mods cant save a game whose base is damaged, see Simcity 5 for that.  If you want a space game, wait for Star Ruler 2, or Galactic Civilizations 3 to be on sale. Distant Worlds is also GREAT, if you can find it on sale, if not, it's a big pricey."
4Xgaming,3a6w94,Zivodor,-6,Fri Jun 19 05:34:12 2015 UTC,Well he kind of had to abandon it. The person developing the engine he was using for the game quit updating it so there was nothing he could do to improve the games performance because it was a engine problem. At least that's the explanation I heard.
4Xgaming,3a6w94,Corusmaximus,9,Wed Jun 17 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"and yet, with the new engine,  similar issues."
4Xgaming,3a6w94,Zivodor,3,Wed Jun 17 22:52:30 2015 UTC,I'm not defending him I was pissed when I heard he abandoned it. I am just saying there was an actual reason besides money that he quit working on it.
4Xgaming,3a6w94,readitour,13,Thu Jun 18 00:53:58 2015 UTC,No. Try Star Ruler 2 instead.
4Xgaming,3a6w94,Corusmaximus,7,Thu Jun 18 02:32:00 2015 UTC,Short answer: No.
4Xgaming,3a6w94,jmpeelman,7,Wed Jun 17 22:51:45 2015 UTC,No

Basically everyone seems to agree that GalCiv is a great game, so why not play that instead? Why would you want to play a game that is only playable when you can get an amazing game for less."
4Xgaming,3a6w94,patrick227,4,Wed Jun 17 23:11:23 2015 UTC,"I've only played the first one, so I'll say that although it has some awesome ship design  features, and the combat is pretty fun, the rest of the game really isn't up to snuff. Technology isn't too bad but it could use a bit more expansion. Intrigue is pretty boring, and late game is just a steamroll.   Really outside of ship building and fleets, the game is lacking  a ton of polish . It just feels very unfinished. I won't be buying the second one because the developer pretty much just left the first game in the dust, so I can't help you ther"

4Xgaming,3a6w94,fknpee,3,Thu Jun 18 13:00:28 2015 UTC,The first game might be worth it if you use the black box mod. It fixes a large number of issues.

4Xgaming,3a6w94,ran88dom99,2,Thu Jun 18 13:09:56 2015 UTC,"I bought sd2 and it's true, moo 2 us much better. The ship building is tedious as hell and the worse part is the ground combat. It has less customization options when creating your race (basically the same ones as moo2). The tech tree is awful I haven't played a lot but I had te gotten to the point of researching how to convert Barrens planets. It does have some nice ideas but none are worth spending money on the game."

Lots of post mortems, twitter posts showcasing games in development, some podcasts about these kinds of games, reviews, etc.  If there's something specific in mind let me know.

4Xgaming,3a7g7e,Zephilinox,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"There's space sector's forums, but it isn't that active. Pretty much any forum for a 4x game will have people who are fans of 4x in general (such as on stardock and steam). There is a 4x game general on 4chan if that's your thing.  I believe there is a strategy game subreddit somewhere which would contain 4x fans, but those same fans would likely be here as well.  Twitch has/had one or two 4x games being developed that were streamed, so that might be something to look in to.  Generally the online community is quite small as not all 4x players bother with those things (with 4x being such a single player genre)."
4Xgaming,3a3ydk,Blue_Spider,6,Wed Jun 17 01:15:19 2015 UTC,Endless Space or Star Ruler have some customization. Not as much as Galciv 3 though.

4Xgaming,3a3ydk,Azkik,2,Wed Jun 17 16:37:44 2015 UTC,I played it after that expansion and it still just felt like a pretty but super flat MoO3. Did they release another?  That reminds me though: a friend recommend I get Endless Legend specifically because I didn't like Endless Space.
4Xgaming,3a3ydk,tomassavage,2,Wed Jun 17 16:40:36 2015 UTC,"flat moo3 was my impression of the game also.  but alas, it's one of the best offerings of 4x currently available.  that and gal-civ 2/3.  gal civ 2 was my favorite, but i must have had a bad disk because every game would crash irrecoverably after turn 150 or so.  very sad about that."
4Xgaming,3a3ydk,Azkik,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"I'd give it a 4 or 5/10. There's a fair amount of better stuff out there, particularly Distant Worlds and Star Ruler as far as space 4x go.  I didn't like Gal Civ 1 or 2. That one felt like flat Civilization in space...   Maybe I just hate starlanes and non-dynamic small-scale games."
4Xgaming,3a3ydk,Corusmaximus,2,Wed Jun 17 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"Endless Space is certainly not better than MOO2,  but I think it is different enough. Endless Space is still my favorite modern space 4x,  MOO2 being the best in all other categories. Sadly you can only play MOO2 for so many thousands of hours before it starts to get samey. :P  I own but dont really care for Endless Legend,  it has a fairly bad AI, poor balance and it is pretty easy to steamroll the map leading to boring expansionist games."

4Xgaming,3a3ydk,IamRem,2,Wed Jun 17 16:58:17 2015 UTC,Definitely Distant Worlds: Universe if you want immersion and complexity.
4Xgaming,3a22gs,MoXria,21,Tue Jun 16 16:57:05 2015 UTC,I would say Distant Worlds.  I always feel like combat takes a back seat to everything else going on in that game.
4Xgaming,3a22gs,Stuie66,4,Tue Jun 16 17:02:14 2015 UTC,I notice some mindblowing detail almost every time I play it even 150ish hours later.
4Xgaming,3a22gs,Azkik,15,Wed Jun 17 14:44:03 2015 UTC,Most complex? Aurora for space 4X and Dwarf Fortress for empire/fantasy 4X.
4Xgaming,3a22gs,Hannibal_Rex,3,Tue Jun 16 20:38:55 2015 UTC,I honestly define Aurora and DF as their own genre. DF is actually a survival game combined with hilarious physics sim and you don't manage an empire as in a standard 4x game. Aurora is similar but perhaps a bit more 4xy.
4Xgaming,3a22gs,domainsofascension,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"But all the !Fun! to be had is beyond measure. Have an entire colony wiped out by a wereshrew, then resettling close to that fortress and then all the immigrants coming in be wereshrews as well because you had to have that good spot, and then of course there's the circus, beware the clowns."
4Xgaming,3a22gs,Soerinth,5,Wed Jun 17 04:48:49 2015 UTC,Oh they are hilarious fun. But 4x or empire building is not exactly an accurate genre title.
4Xgaming,3a22gs,domainsofascension,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:58:30 2015 UTC,"True.... though Empire building makes sense it's just not your typical route to empire building. This one is paved with surly dwarves and booze. No diplomacy, no real econ, unless you count food per person,and the only politics involved is killing Elves after they bitch about you using wood. Lots of fighting though."
4Xgaming,3a22gs,Soerinth,2,Wed Jun 17 10:39:00 2015 UTC,"Its more like city building though, no?"
4Xgaming,3a22gs,domainsofascension,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:17:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with that.  I would only say empire because king and queen move in with you, but that does little to affect the game."
4Xgaming,3a22gs,Soerinth,2,Wed Jun 17 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"This is the answer. The only game that beats Aurora in complexity is Dwarf Fortress, and really, it's a close race."
4Xgaming,3a22gs,rizzen93,2,Wed Jun 17 02:11:19 2015 UTC,"In DF, you neither explore nor expand. It's closer to a city builder game with higher stakes than a 4x."
4Xgaming,3a22gs,Grognor,3,Thu Jun 18 03:08:50 2015 UTC,"Emporer of the Fading Suns  And Imperia 5x is set to be very inner political heavy, you have to make sure your governers are managing your planets well and not plotting your death but you only have so much time to talk to them in a turn."

4Xgaming,3a22gs,RaistlanSol,4,Sun Jun 28 02:08:20 2015 UTC,"That's a tricky one, depending on how you define  ""complex"". Maybe one of the CIV IV mods - A New Dawn, Civilization Invictus, and Destiny mods all ratchet up the empire building somewhat. DW:U has a lot going on, but I wouldn't call it overly deep. Lots of stuff to manage, if you want to go that route, but not really ""grand strategy"" type of deep (or maybe I've just not seen it in my play-thrus). I'd have to say some of the Paradox games - Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, EU - though many wouldn't call them true 4X games.  It's worth looking into some old games called Imperialism and Imperialism II. Limited scope (age of exploration/colonization), but the military and economic models were nice. The AI was a bit lacking, as I recall."
4Xgaming,3a22gs,hbgk10,4,Tue Jun 16 17:22:43 2015 UTC,"Ooh yes, Imperialism II was the shit. I still dig it up and play it on occasion. Combat is ultimately how you win the game, yes, but no matter how good you are at the tactical game, you simply cannot win with a poor empire/economy. That's really the biggest part of the game."
4Xgaming,3a22gs,StrategiaSE,2,Tue Jun 16 22:15:48 2015 UTC,Be more specific! No getting away from war though.
4Xgaming,3a22gs,stilig,2,Tue Jun 16 21:20:20 2015 UTC,I don't mind war or the setting of the game. I just want the empire building/expansion/management to be VAST and also the game has to be turn based too!   War is fine and battle is fine and military is fine - I just want something with huge empire management
4Xgaming,3a22gs,domainsofascension,4,Tue Jun 16 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"I am currently working on a game that was going to be Paradox style real time but ended up going turnbased because of complexity.

The world is approximate 10000 provinces large plus seas and oceans.  There is going to be a time cap, even though many TBS players raged at me when I said that. I'm not sure if it will be 10 minutes or an hour or somewhere in between. In theory you should run the world gen each game for a totally unique world, or alternatively start from scratch Dominions style. You can replay the same year on the same map repeatedly ala Paradox games, but it interferes with the goals somewhat.  The purpose of the game is to allow you to create an empire of a size correlated to your personal capabilities. Genning new worlds prevents guides, the time cap simulates a real life ruler's limitations, logistics means no marching 100k soldiers from Germany to invade China. There is automation and a massive myriad of potential relationships between nations, mercenaries, merchants, mages, factors, and nobles. Its almost like the game in that Orson Scott Card story, except not professionally, globally, massively multiplayer.  Your goal is to build an empire as powerful as possible through whatever means you prefer. There are no arbitrary caps like relation limits, overextension, force limits, cores, or w/e. You are limited by how well you can build a nation that you can run smoothly within the turn time limit. You must deal with religious and political conflicts, greedy nobles, economics, logistics, outside threats, and so forth.  So you see why the time limit per turn has been added to remove all those stupid arbitrary limitations that most games have. I suppose there will be a toggle to take it off, but there will be side effects on the AI side to make the game harder then probably. The game will still function without it because of the above mentioned issues of management, but it won't be the same experience if you have time control powers on top of being an immortal who can call on a vast network of other immortals for help while time is frozen. Aka the internet. That's also the reason I recommend genning a new map each game.  You can also play as an archmage, mercenary captain, merchant, factor, or vassal, besides playing as the king/emperor. And switch between them if you like. These archetypes don't exist in the game. All the game supplies to characters is the stuff you own. Buildings, money, troops, tomes, etc. Its up to the player to claim their title, whatever they want it to be.  Also you don't have ""ideas"" or ""techs"" in the game per say. You can enact government policies like actually raising taxes which causes opinion modifiers and so forth. And you can raise taxes on any population in any province uniquely. You gain knowledge from finding books or maybe even tools inside ruins, getting them traded or gifted from other nations, or through the research system. You'll advance in crafts or jobs through use. If your nation owns lots of arable land, has a large farming population, and farms that land with tools, your agricultural knowledge will grow more effective over time. Same for soldiers, magic, etc.  Granted its slightly prealpha right now. I've got maps and characters and nations and races and all that and I'm working on systems right now. The large number of diplomatic actions for instance.  There are no peace treaties in the sense that civ 4 or eu4 has them. There are a large number of diplomatic requests and agreements you can offer or receive at any time in any combination. You could be at war, decide to make peace and go to the diplomacy screen between you and the enemy's lead character. You could hit truce, royal marriage tier 1(a daughter or sister or something), 14% of tax income for the duration of the treaty, 2 border provinces, magic tomes from their castle library, and rights to sell staple foods in their markets and to let your merchants use their ports and rivers. Now you could technically ask solely for the right to sell your wheat crop in their markets, but I suspect generally you'll hit the staple crop checkbox instead of selecting specific staple crops but not all of them.  Static governments also don't exist. No switching to monarchy. Your government will have player specific rights and privileges and power. To simulate the HRE you would probably make 3 tiers of nations, as well as assign one to leadership. Free cities, members, electors. You would specifically define what rights each class of state has in the empire. Again you could give unique rights to each member state but templates save time if you don't want to do that. Each choice you make in government causes certain results among each character or population group in your nation. Its mostly opinion modifications. Also over time the choices you make slowly become accepted as natural by citizens and what not. If a nation was a monarchy for 3000 years, the monarch selected gets a bonus of opinion as part of a diving right type thing. If you try to change government types you lose the accrued benefits. Similarly, vassal states also accept their status better the longer they've existed.  Every other system in the game follows the same spirit as those described above. You can go as granular or as abstract as you like in managing your state, or your mages guild or w/e if you aren't a ruler. Your personally designed policies on religion and racial integration or class differences or even your caste system if you have one work similarly. Maybe your half dragon populace can be priests but dwarves can only be miners or soldiers or w/e you like. Perhaps you seek to wipe out the Occulanium religion because it encourages revolts against mundane authority and seeks to set up a theocracy. Or maybe you start your own religion in which you are a god and want all your citizens worshipping you.  Anyways I don't wanna hit the character limit so I'll stop here."

4Xgaming,3a22gs,stilig,3,Wed Jun 17 07:26:59 2015 UTC,"has to be turn based too!   Well shit! I think EU4 and CK2, which are not turn based, have been doing the most meaningful empire management lately. They are pretty abstract but your ability to effect change and do things on and to the map and other powers is rly impressive.   They're both pausable and you can set the speed on the fly if that helps?"

4Xgaming,3a22gs,SharkMolester,2,Tue Jun 16 21:46:14 2015 UTC,"Check out some let's plays. All these games have rly dumb learning curves, way too steep so you probably want to research the basics anyway.  It might be a no go! In which case, idk that there are any semi-recent empire builders without a big war focus other than civ 5. And even Civ 5 is not exactly vast.  Endless Space has a cool take on the eXploit X I guess. You colonize entire systems and different types of planets are good for different things. There's a lot of room to optimize your resource usage which can be fun. Lots or random stuff and resources to manage.  It is a good game but Amplitude games have a basic blandness about them that can be off-putting. They are very goal oriented and sometimes this makes a game feel bare or something, idk."
4Xgaming,3a22gs,Lorini,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:09:17 2015 UTC,yea I don't mind focus on war I just want the empire management/building/expansion to also be a huge focus and quite complex - but I think I will watch some EU4 let's plays and take it from there!
4Xgaming,3a22gs,Turambar87,2,Tue Jun 16 22:18:09 2015 UTC,"OP, there is no empire management in EU4. Don't believe Paradox's hype about ""development"" either. You just hit a button every 5 months to drop 60 monarch mana on ""base tax"", ""production"", or ""manpower"". Vickoria2 has some pop sim and a half decent industrial minigame with factories and resource trade. But the other Paradox games are purely map painters."

4Xgaming,3a22gs,Dozed12,0,Wed Jun 17 00:05:34 2015 UTC,"Try Endless Space. It has some nice empire building stuff. If you play on the right map you can place some defensive units at the right choke point and then focus on building up your empire for a long time. (There are galaxy settings that you can make one largish self contained section for each race with a single choke point to the central hub.) Eventually you have to go out and crush your enemies, but by that time you have pretty much built up your empire to the limits."
4Xgaming,3a22gs,stilig,-1,Wed Jun 17 14:37:29 2015 UTC,Endless Legend from what I heard isnt too military focused and has other components. In my opinion the most complex 4x game is Distant Worlds and there are quite a lot of different ways to win/be successfull

4Xgaming,3a0mea,Icapica,2,Wed Jun 17 03:34:09 2015 UTC,"What economy management? Dom4 is definitely a complicated game, but there's not much economy management unless you choose to play one of the nations that use blood magic so much that it basically replaces gold economy in the later game."
4Xgaming,3a0mea,zasxcd,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:39:48 2015 UTC,What economy management?   The part where I have to focus on generating gold more than strategically using my units.
4Xgaming,3a0mea,Icapica,2,Thu Jun 18 02:07:53 2015 UTC,"But the game doesn't really have much of that. You conquer provinces and those bring you a certain amount of gold each turn. Then you just spend that gold. After the game has started you can't significantly affect your income in any other way than by conquering provinces. In Dominions 3 you could control the taxation in individual provinces, but not in Dominions 4.  In very long times of peace you may end up getting a too high upkeep cost from gathering a lot of troops and mages and not getting more provinces, but that isn't very common."

4Xgaming,39y3em,CapnHighlands,15,Mon Jun 15 19:03:31 2015 UTC,"AI Wars probably has the best AI in the genre, noting that it's not a symmetrical game."
4Xgaming,39y3em,Lorini,10,Mon Jun 15 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"Fucking yes!  I don't know if AI War counts as a 4X, but the AI in that game is bloody brilliant. Tactically, strategically, the works.  Mind you, it's the player and the computer both playing to their strengths, but AI War lacks any sort of ""hole in the wall"" gimmick that lets you exploit the AI. Anything you can do, the AI can counter. It's remarkably fair, for a game that is completely asymmetrical. It doesn't feel like playing against a human, but it doesn't entirely feel like playing against a computer, either. They really nail that feeling of playing against an sentient computer.  Everyone I know who's put much time into the game has a story of how they got curbstomped by some brilliant tactic. My personal favorite-   Back in the early versions (pre-4.000, I think), the AI and the player both had the same types of force fields- mobile structures that block hostile ship movement and fire. The player had occupied an AI gravity well and was hacking a data cache. The AI couldn't attack directly because the player could simply retreat through the wormhole. Instead, it baited the player away slightly, then moved a high level force field over the wormhole, leaving him trapped as the AI's fleets came rolling in.   It's got a difficulty cliff that makes EVE Online seem warm and fuzzy, but if you can make it through that... (and the terrible graphics), AI War is my favorite game of all time."
4Xgaming,39y3em,sk_2013,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:03:38 2015 UTC,"damn, AI war is not really my cup of tea. Could i expect this kind of feature in their other games?"
4Xgaming,39y3em,jebjev,3,Tue Jun 16 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"An AI of that level? I doubt it, and I don't know what makes it not your cup of tea, which makes it harder. AI War is technically an RTS, not a 4X.  Galactic Civilizations 2 had an AI that tended to be strategically brilliant, if a bit slow regarding tactical decisions. Civ's AI is terrible.   Supreme Commander (the Total Annihilation remake) has a relatively solid AI, but it will occasionally emulate successful player tactics.  Galciv 3's AIs check previously played player games online to try to better predict the player, but they're still such a work in progress that it doesn't help much.  Sword of the Stars has a really wonky battle AI. Sins of a solar empire just blobs, and while it can make good tactical decisions, it can grind to a halt pretty easily.  What makes AI War special is that there is no unbeatable strategy. Take Sins: A double Marza Dreadnaught rush on a small map is pretty much an instant win. On a large map (even against cheating AIs), starbases and entrenched defenses are so powerful that the AI will throw entire fleets at them, rather than actually bringing any starbase killers, and you can choke off your vulnerable planets doing this with no real downside.  Try the same stunt in AI War, and the AI will stop trying to break through that planet, instead it will switch tactics and focus on containment, and work on the strategic reserve to send a giant strike force to try to breach your defense. Where in SINS, most ships beeline to the biggest target, in AI War you'll see them shatter. Five or six fighters will go after each of your resource collectors. A dozen bombers will target the most valuble thing they can find. Around a fifth of their force will deliberately pin down your mobile defenses, while the toughest ships try to punch a hole in your static defenses. Sometimes the AI will send waves to attack your planet, only to have the waves decide that they can't take your planet, and become ""Roaming threat"", where they'll move around the galaxy using guerrilla tactics, waiting for the ideal time to fuck your shit up. (And they're very, very good at that. Trust me.)  Games like Civ are a pond- wide, shallow. Lots of things the AI can do, so it stalls out. In Sins, strategic decisions are easy (especially with maphacks), so the AI can just attack where you're not, and the battle AI tends to have issues, like Sword of the Stars does.  AI War does one thing- AI. It doesn't do fancy spectacle. It doesn't do unit micro or mechanics. It doesn't give the AI multiple paths to victory to consider, or diplomatic choices to weigh- it tells the AI to murderstomp the player, so that's what it does."
4Xgaming,39y3em,sk_2013,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"The thing about AI War is that the AI openly cheats. It could crush you whenever it wanted but it can't be bothered. Essentially the AI scales to player skill because you decide how fast you can safely win. Its the same as EU4 or Vicky2. You only lose if you get greedy and cause too much of the curbstomp bar to fill.  Comparatively, games like GalCiv or Sins are about ostensibly equally or similarly strong groups fighting it out. The AI cheating then becomes something that angers players but in AI War it impresses them. I'm not saying AI War is bad. Its incredible. But its not really a 4x game in the same sense."
4Xgaming,39y3em,domainsofascension,3,Wed Jun 17 02:29:35 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, the idea is to limit the AI's awareness of you. It's not a symmetrical game, and you don't need to fill the 'curbstomp' bar, as you so excellently called it, in order to lose. Any number of mistakes, or even bad luck can get you killed.  I mentioned it not being 4x above. Second sentence.   AI War is technically an RTS, not a 4X.   The reason AI War is impressive is because it has limited view of the player. In most games, the AI has maphacks for strategic view, and the AI for small scale battles is pretty bad. AI War doesn't have those issues.; the AI doesn't have maphacks, and the battle AI is brilliant. There is no ""RNG"" that will conveniently benefit the AI, no random events, no randomness, so the numbers can't be fudged. The strategic reinforcement AI determines where to send reinforcements and spawn attack waves, and the individual AI determines how to manage attacks or defenses or attacks they are given. This sometimes results in the two AIs disagreeing, where the strategic AI will order a wave to attack a beachhead, and the subcommander AI will determine that it can't be done at the moment and wait on the other side of a wormhole to ambush you. It ""cheats"" in that it doesn't send it's entire force to kill you, but it can't. Those ships aren't connected to the strategic AI, and it (and about a couple dozen ships at the nearest couple planets) actually realize you're there. It's asymmetrical.  Honestly, when it comes to good AI in a true 4X game, the only example I can think of is the Galciv 2 skirmish AI. (The dreadlords in the campaign tend to be kind of stupid, so they don't count).  Finding a good 4X AI is difficult, unsurprisingly so. Making a good racing AI is easy. Making a good FPS AI is more difficult. A good RTS is difficult beyond that. A 4X AI? Good freaking luck. Most players aren't much good at 4X games, and trying to get an AI to play long term intelligently and not make dumb decisions in the short term at the same time almost never happens."
4Xgaming,39y3em,sk_2013,2,Wed Jun 17 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"I know people say 4x AI is hard, but I'm not convinced. A lot of the way you beat the AI in say, EU4, is with exploits. Bait stacks in mountains and across rivers, canceling and resending move orders for the best situation, and so forth. Also the AI can't react to your decisions. If you break truce 1000 times the AI will still not break them and will give you peace deals when it should fight til the end. Also AI refuses to follow basic rules like use deathstacks.  These are obvious failure modes that the designers could fix if they wanted to. They certainly know about them.  Of course most of these specific issues don't cross to other games.   Another more general way players beat the AI is to use their metaphorical power as a time stopping, immortal god with perfect access to other such beings who have already beaten the scenario they are involved in. Of course the AI can't win.  The final reason AI can't be good is the most horrifying. We don't want them to win! Even the designer doesn't really want the AI to win. The majority of players want to win and feel smart. Sure there is an audience for real challenge but financially its tiny. There is no real motivation to make a strong AI. And if you had one you'd have an issue with difficulty levels. You'd have to make the AI mess up, so that whether the player's plan worked in any given scenario was mostly dependent on the AI hitting one of its random whoopsie moments.  Consider those special Broodwar AIs. They mostly operate on specific plans. A player can look up the AI and learn the general strategy that beats it. The AI can't look up the person. That famous mutalisk spam AI would obliterate 99% of all starcraft players. Can you imagine how the sales would have tanked if that had been the standard AI shipped with the game? Until people looked up the winning strategy for a given scenario.  Even if you managed to make an AI that could evaluate and scale with player scale so it seemed like the player was losing a few times, crushing it others, but mainly scraping by by the skin of their teeth, anyone who googled it would know that the AI was letting them win."
4Xgaming,39y3em,domainsofascension,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"Some things are obvious (not using deathstacks), some things aren't. I can teach a player how to recognize bait. A computer will have a harder time. Fighting to the bitter end against a player that has overwhelming firepower doesn't make sense. The computer's goal is to win, so it buys time.  I would point out that GalCiv 3 actually has their AIs access a record of past games to predict player behavior. They're still a huge work in progress, but they do have that feature.  We don't want the AI to win, but sometimes we do. I don't know about you, but consider the starcraft 2 AI. If you sent a few airborne units behind its base, it will try to kill them, even though it can't reach them, allowing the player to wipe out their base with ease. That's not fun, it gets old quickly. High difficulty AIs in games like starcraft and SINS get a massive resource multiplier to balance out their lack of capabilities.  Assuming sales would have tanked because the game sold with a muta spam AI is pointless conjecture, and most people played the campaign, then moved on to multiplayer.  The goal isn't to have an AI that crushes the player. The goal isn't to have an AI that falls for stupid tricks. The goal is to have an AI that plays like a player. It's not about the AI letting you win, it's about getting interesting gameplay.  If you are disappointed when an AI lets you win, does that mean you don't feel a sense of victory when you beat the highest level AI? I can't think of a game that doesn't give them superior capabilities- higher incomes, weighted RNGs, so on.   We don't want them to win!    No, you don't want them to win. Don't speak for others. That whole paragraph is a mess, and until you link a source for it, I'm going to have to call bullshit."
4Xgaming,39y3em,sk_2013,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"Yes the goal is interesting games where the player feels like they get better over time. But if you use an AI that doesn't cheat, and at its best can beat you reliably, then a lower difficulty setting means the AI is letting you win. Most current AIs are given bonuses at higher levels. An AI that can actually play the game would be getting negative power at lower levels. Unless you capped it with processing time. Of course that would make the player who has unlimited time look kinda sad if they spent a ton of time to beat the AI but the AI didn't.  Some games like Paradox games are a bit more interesting. Instead of ""winning"" or having the AI cheat, its more about how much you can do in the 376 year time limit. You don't have to give the AI a huge boost since the skill of the player means they own more land before the end instead of a traditional win condition. AI War is similar. Your skill merely determines how much you can push the curbstomp bar and still win. Compare to RTS games where the only option is annihilate the enemy.  People stop playing 1v1 games with their friends when their friends reliably beat them or vice versa. If the AI was like a human it would get better over time and would make real mistakes of attention rather than RNG failures. So eventually the player or the AI would outgrow the other person."
4Xgaming,39y3em,domainsofascension,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"But if you use an AI that doesn't cheat, and at its best can beat you reliably, then a lower difficulty setting means the AI is letting you win.    Or you include multiple AIs or several variations of the same AI with different levels of knowledge and competency.  The AI you fight on easy difficulty may not have the same level of knowledge and competency as the AI you fight on hard.  It doesn't have to let you win on easy if the AI you're up against can only take basic things into consideration.  As an overly simplified example of what different tactical AIs could consider in a small skirmish;  Very easy AI takes numbers and troop type into consideration  Easy AI takes the above and terrain into consideration.  Normal AI takes the above, it's short term objective, special abilities (the possibility of hidden/cloaked units, buffs/maluses etc) and the value of any nearby structures into consideration  Hard AI takes the above, the player's previously used tactics, the player's perceived goals, their own long term objectives, the diplomatic situation (can it realistically sue for peace if necessary or forge a new alliance/bring in existing allies?  Would crushing you anger a more powerful AI group?  Are their buffer zones that can be exploited?) into consideration and makes heavier use of spy type units."
4Xgaming,39y3em,lordcooper,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:47:10 2015 UTC,"It's only partially true. Yes, the AI is there to lose, that's its purpose. But even if, the AI is not equal to player. Imagine a scenario where you control 100,000 units issuing them orders one by one (no grouping and the like). The computer would manage, the player would not.  There is this inherited asymmery, AI is faster and can compute infinitely, the player is smarter and can think. And no algorithm is going to change this unequality.  You have to slow down the computer otherwise the human will stand no chance at all."

It wasn't amazing, also I don't think it was able to handle naval transportation well enough, but it was OK. It used doomstacks rather well and that was pretty much what was required from it combat-wise. Economically it was alright too. It was fun to play this game for many years. (played it mostly on Immortal, that difficulty level is challenging and fun)"

Gal Civ 2 (dont know about 3) has very good AI, in my opinion the best of all 4x games, it is however a bit static (agressive nation is agressive, no surprises)."
4Xgaming,39y3em,Dozed12,5,Mon Jun 15 19:33:22 2015 UTC,"GalCiv 3 has the same AI as GalCiv 2, as far as I can tell. With a few notable exceptions:   The AI appears to still place buildings as if its GalCiv 2. It doesn't know about the new adjacency bonus system, and will build worlds at random. Which can lead to ""really"" sub-par decisions like building an expensive building that only gives adjacency bonuses, on an island with only 1 tile. The AI's diplomacy values items strangely. Their tech-trading values are vastly out of wack. Often selling to you a 500 research tech for 50 credits, and then buying from you a 50 research tech for 500 credits. The AI eventually learns what ship counters to build, but it has to have been at war with you for a while before it'll tech switch. They won't pay to upgrade existing 10shield/10armor/10ECM ships into all ecm ships if you have all missile ships, for example. Only new ships will be 0/0/10 (and they only change ship designs when they get new tech). So if you go to war and they're researching non-military techs, they may never upgrade their ships. But if they plan to go to war with you, they'll build 0/0/10 ships if you have only one weapon type before the war starts. So, good war AI, but also pretty blind."

EU4 England can't manage landings right either. There should be some AI code saying if you don't have your troops already on the land for fighting, or you have fewer than 1 boat per 2 regiments, don't declare war. But apparently that's not a thing."

Civilization IV also had passable AI; it deals with combat a bit better than Civ V AI because combat was simpler in that game (doomstacks).  But at the end of the day, I'm basically in the same boat as you OP; I really enjoy 4X games, or the basic premise of them, but I seldom have fun playing them anymore because it became so easy to spot all the failings of the AI.  I nowadays mostly only play Paradox Games and Total War games (Grand Strategy instead of 4X), or Age of Wonders (which I too consider to be too simple to be called 4X; at least the simplicity means the AI performs slightly better). Or just wargames like Battle of Wesnoth."

It just does everything so differently.  I recommend endless space instead, It's a really good introduction. Though lacking a bit in the combat department. But It's 6€ right now on steam. Grab it now before the sale runs out.  Although, if budget isn't an issue I would pick up both, since you'll probably want to play star ruler 2 at some point too. but I recommend starting with endless space."

I really enjoyed it. I loved the feeling of stopping all of my opponents political moves. It made me feel like some kind of  intergalactic power broker. Also, as far as war goes it doesn't disappoint either. I love the feeling of watching my fleets clash. The damage the ships take is directional based on your ship design and you can divide your fleet into wings for flanking maneuvers. It's a lot like ""Legend of the Galactic Heroes"" as far as the combat goes.   The tech tree however, is 'meh', or a big negative depending on how you feel about it. I think they tried to deviate from tradition a little and just wound up making a disgusting mess. The ship design can feel a little shitty at times as well. It can also be confusing setting up your resource tree at times but once you get used to it, it becomes second nature. You'll very likely fuck up your first couple of games and be disappointed in the results you have, but that's a 4x staple.   It's not perfect but I found it to be very refreshing, and it just sucks the time away while being enjoyable at the same time."

To sum it up, the game has a lot of bugs and a lot of tedium. TB compares it with Stardrive 1, and he concludes that Stardrive 2 is worse than Stardrive 1. Thats right, the first game was better.  Stardrive 2 is a micromanagement heavy game, but not the good kind of micromanagement. It seems to be filled with busywork micromanagement to the point where you have to personally outfit every soldier in your entire military with equipment. Got a new recruit? Well, you need to personally outfit him with gear.  On larger maps this would quickly devolve into micromanagement hell.  Other issues: autocalcing battles seems to give bizarre results, fleets can vanish into the aether if you try to retrofit ships, and for some reason you cannot click on a planet two times in a row.

4Xgaming,39wy6o,happyjamjam,5,Tue Jun 16 00:39:07 2015 UTC,track record for zero is not good. i own both stardrive and stardrive 2. i bought the first because it had so much potential and i though i could support a one man dev on a kick ass game. what happened was took my money gave me a useless forum to report and suggest feautures. promised features but then abandons the game and cashes in and announces a equal. feature and broken promises was a quest system. he added one quest... non repeatable... unplayable races. as in the races space ships were just copies of another.   why i bought sd2 was because i had a discount for being a sd1 owner. i do not suggest buying the sequel. it is a stripped version of sd1. any new features are meh compared to having just fixed versions of the original features of the first game. another cash grab. if you must buy then buy on sale. do not pay full price and personally i will not buy any other games with the devs name attached to it just because of the history of how he dealt with his customers. mknightsham style.
4Xgaming,39wy6o,Spacey138,6,Tue Jun 16 01:18:04 2015 UTC,"The thing that frustrated me most was that SD1 had the potential to be a great game. Underneath all of the bugs and crashes and incomplete stuff, it was a great game at its core. SD1 was a diamond in the rough.  Unfortunately Zero abandoned the game, leaving it forever a diamond in the rough. I had bought SD1 early on and regretted it. It was left in a barely complete, barely playable state. I have never been able to complete a full game of SD1 due to crashes. The game is incredibly unstable. I gave up trying.  I have no plans for buying SD2, but from all accounts its just as incomplete and buggy as SD1. Even worse is that SD2 doesn't appear to be a gem in the rough. Its just plain bad to the core. SD2 didn't even have potential."

SD2 definitely has a lot of problems in terms of ui and balance but it seems like he's looking for things to dislike.  Like ground combat, usually there's nothing. If you don't like the grid combat, just don't use it.   Diplomacy makes it hard to trade infinitely because of tolerance, but that's on purpose to keep you from trading everything immediately as soon as you meet a new player. At least you can see what's going on, unlike civ 5 where your neighbor will randomly war Dec you for no reason and there's no indication of what they're angry about.   You can test out ships before using them; theres the whole battle arena game mode.   Espionage is a bit shallow but it'd on par with most other games.   He didn't even touch on all the work that got put into the random events and characters and end game quest lines that show up."

4Xgaming,39x93b,Niarro,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:37:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah that optimization part is what really turns me off. I really like to play with 'my gut feeling'. I don't want to follow a set of rules for the first turns in order to stand a chance (e.g. settle on turn one, build colonist on turn 5, settle on day 6), really ruins the fun for me.   I guess that's also why I never play on very high difficulties. I can see the appeal, but it's just not for me."

Playing with and against humans is more fun, in the end.  That said, with individual games taking forever, it can be hard to deal with all the human factors if you go above a small party of 2-4 people.  I enjoyed my coop sins game last night, and sometime soon I need to do my space empires V turn."

The infrastructure demands of the population is easily satisfied, things like water supply, crime and so on are missing.

4Xgaming,39tw59,friendlyhornet,6,Sun Jun 14 18:58:02 2015 UTC,"I have both, and have spent a pretty equal time on both.. you're statement above generally describing them is very accurate.  I personally think the AI in EL isn't so bad where the game isn't enjoyable, but definitely not if you're looking for a challenge.  The combat is probably the most lacking part of EL.  If you like building an empire, cities, improvements, etc.. EL is your choice.  Lots of things to see and try and experiment with on that side of the house.  If you like turn based tactical combat, with a bit of empire management on the side.. AOW3 has a very deep suite of combat abilities, spells, mechanics and units to have fun with."
4Xgaming,39tw59,Gula25,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"This is a very good description.  Might I ask you which you prefer personally? You said equal time, so I understand that already. But if you had to choose one maybe?"
4Xgaming,39tw59,Gula25,9,Sun Jun 14 21:46:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think I enjoyed AOW3 more.. the tactical battles really are fun, as there is quite a bit which can be considered.  Flanking, rock/paper/scissors type mechanics, morale, spells.. hundreds of unit types, heroes with a pretty full fledged inventory.. It's a very deep game.    As I said though, from an empire/traditional 4x standpoint it feels a little flat.  There's only really a couple win conditions which all focus on developing the strongest army and dominating those around you.  EL has a great selection of factions which all look and feel quite different, and offers much more variation in the development of a fantasy empire.  Also I wrote these a while back, an in depth look at the growth/population systems in both games:  https://4xmechanics.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/modeling-population-and-growth-in-4x-endless-legend/  https://4xmechanics.wordpress.com/2015/04/05/modeling-population-and-growth-in-4x/"

4Xgaming,39tw59,LinFTW,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:32:56 2015 UTC,The battle system for Endless Legend sucks so MUCH. It is so so bad... I wish it was more like AOW3 where you simply move each unit and attack and then his turn to do so etc... In endless legend it just deploying phase and then targeting phase... argh  Having said that I like heavier 4X elements in my games and so I still prefer endless legend (I almost always auto-resolve combat though...)   It has been a day... may I ask which one did you pick?

I've been eyeing Endless Legend for a while, but after Endless Space they've left a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth. The AI is a serious concern for me.  Edit: Someone asked a similar question on the discussion forums: https://steamcommunity.com/app/289130/discussions/0/594820656454052170/"
4Xgaming,39tw59,herropreese27,2,Sun Jun 14 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"Endless Legend is way better than Endless Space.  I found ES to be lacking in personality.  The game felt too sterile.  Endless Legend has its own style; it is a unique and fresh take on the 4x strategy game.  The AI is lacking beyond a certain point though, so that is a definite caveat.  To the OP, if you're going with AOW3, you definitely need both expansions in order for the game to really shine.  The base game is meh, with first expansion its great, and with both expansions it is wonderful."

4Xgaming,39tw59,rafaelbn,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:04:57 2015 UTC,"Enjoyed both, I really like the tactical battles in AoW while the highlight of EL is how unique each faction feels, I played a couple games of EW and each one felt different. I think the single player campaigns included with AoW greatly increase the time you can spend with the game as well as mods and maps people have created. Personally I have played more AoW and really enjoyed it. But I did just pick up the EW expansion and am looking forward to a game or two of that.  I would get AoW but you can't go wrong with either."

4Xgaming,39ttlw,Waervyn,9,Sun Jun 14 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"1) Not entirely sure. I think both are pretty approachable for a 4x. Bit of a shameless plug, I made videos with beginners tips for both games: (Endless legend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOFhs-wsNEo ), (GalCiv3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1Qzo_Ijbk).   2) I think the AI is a bit better in GalCiv 3. The AI is definitely not EL's strong point. That said, it's still very competent. At least against me (but I'm not a 'minmaxer').  3) Not entirely sure. The atmosphere of EL is downright amazing. The first 20 hours I played I was just dumbstruck by everything. Each race has a story, there's awesome visuals and music. Really amazing. There's lots of customization too. That said, I really enjoy building my colonies more in GalCiv3.  Overall I think I would recommend Endless legend if you plan on playing the game less than...let's say 100 hours. If you plan to play over and over and over then I think Galciv 3 might be better (especially once it gets more fleshed out with expansions)."
4Xgaming,39ttlw,wOlfLisK,5,Sun Jun 14 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"1) I'd say EL because it's going to feel a lot more familiar than GalCiv if you've played Civ V. Really though, both are relatively easy to learn.    2) GalCiv, no contest. EL's AI is the main flaw in the game    3) That depends, do you prefer a fantasy or sci-fi setting? I can't really say which is better as both are completely different games and amazing in their own right. If you want something a bit more like Civ V (Although neither are that close to it honestly), I'd suggest EL."
4Xgaming,39ttlw,PseudoElite,3,Sun Jun 14 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"I've played both a bit (about 5-10 hours each).   I'd say Gal Civ 3 is way more beginner friendly. Endless Legend's tutorial is not great, and a lot of the stuff is undocumented. Gal Civ 3 has better AI. Endless Legend's AI is actually quite poor from what I've seen and what I've heard, which is a shame because the game itself is fantastic. Despite choosing Gal Civ 3 for the above 2 answers, I'm going to say it really depends on what you're looking for. GalCiv 3 is a space 4X, whereas Endless Legend is a fantasy RPG game.    If you're more into exploration of new concepts and races in a fantasy setting, and don't mind poor AI and non-existent multiplayer, then get Endless Legend.  If you want a more familiar 4X experience in space that is well polished and easier to pick up, but with so-so diplomacy and non-existent tactical combat, then get GalCiv 3.   Both games are generally good, albeit with serious pros and cons. Both are being updated constantly too, so that's always nice.  PS: If you do get either, wait until it's ACTUALLY on sale. Endless Legend is today, but if you wait a bit longer I am quite certain GalCiv 3 will be at a cheaper price soon as well."

4Xgaming,39ttlw,Uloldodok,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:19:30 2015 UTC,"Played both for >10h and I'd say GalCiv 3 was more fun in the end, even though neither is really A+ good.   They're both about the same amount of ""friendliness""; GalCiv might be the one with the friendliest elements as everything is very straightforward while in EL you have to count and calculate a little more. Both games have pretty iffy AI; EL becomes a little boring as the AI seems to do the same stuff every game, same buildings and units etc. GalCiv has the ""spam for territory"" kind of AI and the diplomacy is a little funny in the sense of ""I'm afraid of you, so I don't want to start a war but hey, have a war!"" EL is fun earlygame, exploring and planning expansion is good and meaningful while mid/late-game is more of a spamfest in my opinion, with building unit after unit to tackle the AI's unit after unit tactic.  GalCiv is more fun than EL early/mid as you can design your own ships/fleets making combat a little more fun than in EL, exploration is as fun as in EL but the planning is definitely better in GalCiv; you want everything around you, but the AI feels the same and will do everything it can to prevent your expansion. It's more challenging by far but the late-game is the same as most other 4X games; spam units to take over the enemies spammed units.   btw; GalCiv 3 is probably cheaper on kinguin/g2a than Steam - at least right now (41.99 on steam, 14.99 on Kinguin/G2A)"

Even though it is a bit old and not quite a pretty as any of the newer ones it's still an amazing game.  If you enjoy Civ then Galactic Civilizations might be the easiest to get into, it has a pretty similar gameplay.  Did you ever play the space mod that came with Civ IV?  GalCiv is pretty similar to that."
4Xgaming,39t2ic,NeptunesNookGames,2,Sun Jun 14 18:10:15 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the UI be too much of a problem for a newcomer to MOO2? Google Image only give me 320*240 pixel bloat screenshots.
4Xgaming,39t2ic,Dillinur,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:31:35 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason Moo2 is so well done is the simplicity of the UI.  Most of the game is run from the main galaxy screen, if you have any experience with any of the civilizations then the colony management screen will be of no issue either.  It doesn't have the depth that other 4x's have but that is part of the allure for me, it hits all the points of a well done strategy game without getting too bogged down with the micromanagement."
4Xgaming,39t2ic,NeptunesNookGames,2,Tue Jun 16 06:20:39 2015 UTC,"then the colony management screen will be of no issue either.

Try to focus your research towards what your end goal is and dont waste time getting every tech, unless you are going for a tech victory.  Another thing, terraforming tech is very important so try to throw those in from time to time.  Start on the lowest difficulty and increase the difficulty each time you win until you find your skill level.  Then start reading some strats and work them into your playstyle.  Happy X'ing!"

Victory in DW comes from the accumulation of points, and the way you earn points is largely dependent on (or at least modified by) the race you play as. Some races might earn points by being warmongers, but others might earn points by remaining at peace, through economics,  diplomacy, planet habitation (whether you gained them through military conquest or peaceful colonization) or empire development.   For example, in the last game I played I was race who accumulated points fastest by a) having X% of the galactic population in my empire, b) owning X% of total galactic income, and c) the territory my empire covers is X% of the total area of the galaxy. There were times when I declared war and others where I had war declared on me, but winning and conquering didn't help me achieve my victory conditions nearly as fast as other endeavors."

Imagine a Paradox game, like EU4. 2k provinces, ends after 400 years, can take hundreds of hours for one game.  Now imagine a game with an infinite timeline, 8000+ provinces. Don't ever have to go to war but you can. Espionage game, partrician game, science game, magic game, diplomatic game all functional without really using the other parts much. Also political system is not just hit button pay 100 mana change government or culture or religion. And you have granular interaction with all name characters and populace. Want to rule your majority culture with respect but treat minorities using fear and intimidation? Can do. Could vice verse it but weird roleplay there."

4Xgaming,39tot8,domainsofascension,2,Mon Jun 15 02:26:36 2015 UTC,"Alphaish. You can read in data files, and draw maps, but the map generator isn't set up yet so you have to draw them in an image program yourself, as well as generate the corresponding list of rgb colors. You can manage a few basic actions and most major data structures are set up. I have a map with 2860 land provinces and some sea ones, but I use a smaller 40 province land map single giant sea province for testing. Quicker load times.

4Xgaming,39jesm,ReneG8,2,Sat Jun 13 09:32:17 2015 UTC,How does this game compare to galactic civilizations?
4Xgaming,39jesm,No_Spin_Zone360,4,Fri Jun 12 06:01:05 2015 UTC,"Quoting other redditors here: It's much more a simulation as compared to GalCiv, which for lack of better words is more ""board-gamey"".  In DW resources are more ""simulated"" in that they have empire-wide demand and supply, and factor into the component costs for building ships.  The economy is also split between private and state.  Can't speak to GalCiv3 as I don't have it, but diplomacy is slightly less complete than GalCiv2 was at the end of its life. Still damned fun to diplomatize but lacking a few options AFAIK (getting other empires to directly go to war against another, for example.)  Others will have to tell you about GalCiv3, but for me DW made me want GalCiv3 much less, simply because I know what GalCiv is like from 2, and the level of simulation in DW is just way ahead.  Edit: DW is real-time pausable with real-time battles on strategic map. GC is instanced, viewable (non-controllable) battles on separate tactical map.  Edit: DW less planet building (done only through specific facilities that you might not want on every planet), GC hex-based ""fill up entire planet with improvements"""

4Xgaming,39jesm,amaturelawyer,3,Tue Jun 16 01:27:16 2015 UTC,"If you like running an empire as opposed to micromanaging an empire, there are few games at DW's level."
4Xgaming,39jesm,Corusmaximus,3,Fri Jun 12 13:47:09 2015 UTC,DW is a hot mess. It lacks polish. Moving your fleets is like herding cats. The ui is impressively bad. All that and I can't stop playing it. Its good in an unconventional way.
4Xgaming,39jesm,Dozed12,-3,Fri Jun 12 11:58:27 2015 UTC,"I assume you havent picked DW recently, in latest DW: Universe the UI is much better and overall good. I dont understand the ""Moving your fleets is like herding cats."""
4Xgaming,39jesm,Eviljim,6,Fri Jun 12 13:35:40 2015 UTC,"Well, they do kind of go where they want to sometimes."
4Xgaming,39jesm,Corusmaximus,2,Fri Jun 12 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"I am playing it right now (fully updated).   A few minutes ago, with the AI off and range set to target, I had a fleet ignore my orders, go across the galaxy and try to invade a heavily defended world. I caught them,  gave them different orders again.  A minute later they were back doing what they wanted."
4Xgaming,39jesm,DirtyPirateApe,2,Fri Jun 12 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"That honestly sounds like one of the AI settings is enabled and taking control away from you since I've never had something like that happen to me.  To be fair though, the UI can be pretty unwieldy and it's easy to accidentally automate something you didn't meant to (for example, accidentally having new ships built automatically set to 'automate').  It gets even a bit more confusing when you factor in their default postures."
4Xgaming,39jesm,Dozed12,2,Sun Jun 14 18:01:01 2015 UTC,"You for sure have something wrong in settings, either automation or fleet posture. Check the forums."

4Xgaming,39jesm,Gula25,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:01:27 2015 UTC,"DW:U has a much higher learning curve, barrier to entry (due to a clunky UI, complexity of game systems, etc) and larger scope.  It's real time pause-able as opposed to turn based.  You'll get much more out of DW:U than Gal Civ, if you're willing to put time and effort into understanding how the game works and also fine tuning the MANY customization options it offers.  You can go from a hands-off basically spectator mode amount of automation, to the complete opposite where you handle everything from designing ships, choosing research, creating and managing fleets, hiring ground troops etc.  After experimenting a bit you can sort of identify the things you enjoy managing and leave the rest to the AI.  Often times I start out controlling everything, but as the empire spreads across the galaxy I begin automating things, becomes once you've expanded a bit beyond you're starting system there is a ton of stuff to keep you busy.  Also the way pirate factions work in DW:U is awesome.  They basically start out ahead in warp technology, so they go around the galaxy harassing the various empires and setting up outposts at the beginning of the game.  After a while many will be beaten back by the empires as they grow out of their starting system, but some may remain strong throughout the game.  You can even play in a galaxy as a pirate faction, which is very different and unique experience which requires completely different tactics and strategy."
4Xgaming,39jesm,jebjev,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"I really want to get into DW, in fact, i already have a copy and the mod. But i hate that feel of not being able to comprehend how to do simple task in a short span of time, i have played the game for 1 and a half hour and i have still no idea how to capture a planet! I am just literally just clicking through objective decisions and it makes it feel like i am playing democracy 3 which leaves me a bad taste."
4Xgaming,39jesm,DirtyPirateApe,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:32:21 2015 UTC,"Most all of these comments are true, I just want to say that as somebody who only recently decided to dive into DW:U it's really not as hardcore and complicated as some make it out to be, the key is to just take everything at your own pace.  The best part is that you can automate most anything you get tired of dealing with and the AI will generally do a good job (at least as good as the other empires anyway).  Gal Civ is a great game too (well at least 2 is, I haven't played yet) but they are quite different in how they play out.  Gal Civ is much more similar to MoO and Civ type games.  Also 3 has multiplayer which could be a deciding factor for you if you want to play with friends."
4Xgaming,39j033,Bresken,14,Fri Jun 12 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"Yes. This is one of those genre's that you want the game to age first to receive the best experience against a challenging AI. If you cannot decide which mods to install, you could always root to the community patch in which it installs everything essential, including Enhanced UI."
4Xgaming,39j033,jebjev,23,Fri Jun 12 01:43:34 2015 UTC,It is up there as one of the best strategy games of all time.
4Xgaming,39j033,thelandofdreams,5,Fri Jun 12 04:32:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Civ V is a fun and great game but it is a really poor strategy game. All of it's features simply fall apart once you get to higher level play, hell even at Prince difficulty some of the mechanics begin to fall apart. Decisions become railroaded and tradeoffs nonexistent. Not to mention that despite every attempt to quell ICS it still thrives more than ever since literally any city above 6 pop is net profit on everything including the science and culture it increases the cost of. It simply does not live up to Civ 4 at all in terms of strategy."

The system has a lot of game-able mechanics and exploits. Or so I've heard.  The only positive reviews I've seen are from casual ""we play strategy sometimes"" people and people who don't try to understand the mechanics.  Have I been reading the wrong reviews?  Edit: I'm honestly surprised by the downvotes. It was an honest question. Are there reviews from detail-oriented strategy gamers that have praised Civ 5? Provide links."

4Xgaming,39j033,Waervyn,7,Fri Jun 12 08:47:43 2015 UTC,Of course It is. One of best strategies ever. And to be honest  You don't need better graphics in 4X game so age is not a problem. With small community tweaks (but even without) interface is super intuitive.  I envy You that you can start playing now and enjoy it like a new game :3
4Xgaming,39j033,duskhorizon,3,Fri Jun 12 05:43:57 2015 UTC,"The answer to this question is a most definite yes.  If you have any interest in turn based strategy/4x games games, this is the hallmark modern title.  It doesn't defy conventions, it basically advances existing ones from the franchise and the genre in a very focused way.  As others have said, when the vanilla game came out it wasn't as well rounded as people hoped so there was some backlash.  Now after having the 2 big expansions drop in, the game now has loads to offer, arguably more than any other non-modded Civ game before it.  2015 is the perfect time to buy.  A cohesive and polished package with tons of content, strategies, civs, mechanics to tinker with.  Still the cream of the 4x crop.  Anyone who says this game is game is simple, stupid, lacks features etc is just trolling."

It wasn't as good as Civ IV at launch but since the expansions (all of which are in the complete pack) came out, imo, it may even be a little better than its predecessor. Then again, if you value your sleep and job, it's certainly a dangerous game."

4Xgaming,39j033,Buzz_Nation,2,Sat Jun 13 20:31:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Civ 5 with the two expansions is still my favorite 4x game. The game was missing a lot of key elements at launch but patches and expansions really shored things up. Even for your first expansion, I would recommend you at least play it with the first expansion, Gods and Kings. The second expansion, Brave New World, complicates a few mechanics -- e.g., trade routes, Great Works of Art, the World Congress -- beyond what some more casual players might want, so it might not be wrong to skip Brave New World for your first game or two, but the more I play with Brave New World the more I appreciate how brilliantly it makes everything come together. I have consistently interesting meaningful decisions in every game of Civ, and it has insane replay value, even before you get into mods, custom maps, and scenarios."
4Xgaming,39j033,Hoooooooar,4,Fri Jun 19 00:15:49 2015 UTC,Civ 5 AI is so incredibly painfully stupid I can't play the game anymore.

4Xgaming,39j033,AjCheeze,2,Fri Jun 12 12:22:01 2015 UTC,"It is definately worth buying. I still play this every weekend. It is also better than its (kind of) sequel, Beyond Earth. The game doesnt feel like it has aged at all."

4Xgaming,39j033,Mouon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:19:14 2015 UTC,True. But Civ 5 was still a more complete game on release than Beyond Earth was. Their expansions are going to have to be astonishing in order to bump it up to the level of Civ5. And quite frankly I doubt it. The base game is just lacking.

The AI is bad, end game is just too much micro, quite a few decisions are just so much better then others with no tradeoffs at all, combat feels like I am playing a tactical game at all times instead of strategic game (tbh, it was not much better in Civ 4 either, but at least having stacks felt much better. Besides, AI can do much better in Civ 4 then Civ 5 because of that feature alone)."

4Xgaming,39h765,warbuddha,13,Thu Jun 11 18:15:09 2015 UTC,The comment on tactical combat is a bit worrying tbh.
4Xgaming,39h765,PseudoElite,11,Thu Jun 11 18:31:50 2015 UTC,"To me, it's promising.  The endlessly repetitive tactical combat is one of the weaknesses of most 4X games, in my mind.  Give me a system where I can make meaningful decisions about force mixtures and a resolution engine that gives me feedback about how that worked out, and I'll be much happier than if I have to babysit every single battle (or watch my forces get obliterated in battles that would have been a walkover in my favor if I'd controlled them)."
4Xgaming,39h765,visage,17,Thu Jun 11 18:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah ... they are missing the boat if they pull away from tactical combat.  One of THE driving reasons why other developers keep trying (and failing) to capture the MOO bliss is that NONE of them has made a good turn-based tactical combat system.  The one thing that MOO did that remains exceptional is/was it's tactical combat system, and no other space game has come close to replicating it do date.  So if they ditch the turn-based tactical combat - they just aren't remaking MOO anymore.    Examples:   Endless Space = mostly hands off tactical battle (cinematic with card plays) Armada 2526 = Real-time, not done all that well Sword of the Stars = Real-time, scale held artificially small Distant Worlds = real-time on strategic map StarDrive = real-time on strategic map StarDrive 2 = real-time on tactical map, probably closest to MOO Horizon = Turn-based, poor execution   And so on...."
4Xgaming,39h765,Mezmorki,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:46:51 2015 UTC,Sword of the Stars   It's scale may not be the largest but it has some of the most meaningful combat I have ever experienced in a game thus far.

4Xgaming,39h765,zzerk,6,Thu Jun 11 21:18:41 2015 UTC,"The problem is that these games often are shallow. This is why it get's repetitive. Try something like Aurora, every engagement is tense as fuck.  But it also does not happen every 10 minutes."

4Xgaming,39h765,SharkMolester,2,Fri Jun 12 12:31:44 2015 UTC,Yeah... it does give me some reservations
4Xgaming,39h765,IMADV8,2,Thu Jun 11 19:26:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm afraid that they don't know that A LOT of 4X gamers like this aspect. The way they downplayed that is a bit worrying...
4Xgaming,39h765,Corusmaximus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:36:39 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm not a fan of the focus on combat in so many modern 4X games.

The big picture is more fun, let the little one handle itself."

4Xgaming,39h765,Mezmorki,9,Thu Jun 25 10:34:01 2015 UTC,"Wargaming is contradicting itself in the article.   ""[W]hile there are a lot of players that played tactical battles, there's not that many. It's about 10% of the players.""   To say that 10% is a lot isn't honest to either the minority or the majority - they can't have it both ways.  Wargaming spends an entire paragraph talking about how tactical battles is a problem with 4X games is more than a little worrying.  The idea that strategy doesn't need tactics or tactical interaction with opposition is complete rubbish.    ""We wanted to focus on those things that are are more strategic, core aspects of the game that will help you do those things that Victor learned from the game,"" Keeling said. ""Strategic planning. Resource management. The 4Xs, right?""   Those are the sentences of someone who has no idea what a meaningful strategic vision is.  As with all 4X games there is a research component and often times that research bears weapons or advantages to use against enemies in battle.  If we don't have a hands-on tactical combat situation to use those weapons, what is the purpose of the over-arching research program?  To give passive modifiers to our own empire?  That is BORING and Wargaming is showing that they obviously don't understand what made MoO such a pleasure to so many.  They are only making the game that they want to play and that will be ""streamlined"" and ""simple.""    Why did they have to take the crown jewel of space 4X games and butcher it?  This was tried in MoO3 and look how little anyone talks about it!"

I don't know WTF they have planned (and neither do you) - so we'll both have to just wait and see.  But again... I liked the tactical combat of MoOII - even endgame. So we'll see.
4Xgaming,39h765,kaspar42,3,Thu Jun 11 20:49:05 2015 UTC,I never said it was a fail.  I just pointed out that MoO3 did the exact same thing as what Wargaming is talking about right now and that MoO3 was a fail.  Everything the article laid out has me deeply worried.  I will reserve judgement of the finished product when it is finished but this is a genuinely troubling route that they are laying out.
4Xgaming,39h765,fedora718,2,Thu Jun 11 21:02:16 2015 UTC,Sure. I think we're in the same boat. I think I'm erring more on the side of hopeful...   Moo3 was indemic of the fact that there wasn't anyone from the previous design team giving them direction. Among other problems.

I think the downfall of MoO3 was lack of editorial power to keep the scope in check, and someone with a keen insight for gameplay / playability -- more ""why"" instead of ""what"" being applied to the feature list."

4Xgaming,39ca7a,Skrattii,3,Wed Jun 10 20:14:04 2015 UTC,"How do you solve the problem of asymmetrical turns?  In RTS games, that issue is taken care of by the fact that it is ""live"", if you don't react and do things, you'll be beaten handily by players who have interacted more.  In TBS games, nothing happens until everyone has pressed that turn button.  Does the game keep moving forward for everyone?  Does that mean stuff will happen to a player's empire, research, etc., without their input or approval?"
4Xgaming,39ca7a,pdboddy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:21:22 2015 UTC,"When the server does the turn evaluation, it does it for everyone. During turn evaluation, you gain research points, goods (as long as storage capacity is not exceeded), population and construction points. Your ships gain movement points, but these only sum up for five turns. Nothing of that is spent, it just accumulates.    In an earlier state, I had research and building queues. After enabling the summing up of the values, I deactivated them. It seems that that was premature, and I will reactivate these queues.    The bigger problem than the turn summaries is the fact that one can be attacked by other players during ones offline time. I am balancing ship movement points so that a blitzkrieg is not possible. At the moment, most of the blitzkrieg prevention is done during the declaration of war. The aggressors ships are moved away from the defender, loose their summed up movement points and do not gain movement points for a few turns.    There are many downsides to this concept. It will get a complete overhaul as soon as borders/ownership of regions is implemented, or at least some kind of warp interdictor is available for colonies. I'm also open for suggestions how to tackle this problem.  War is risky in this game. If the defender gets other neighboring empires to join the war on his side, the attacker might well loose everything."
4Xgaming,39ca7a,vampatori,2,Thu Jun 11 09:36:39 2015 UTC,"I spent some time on this exact problem, and I think I came up with a workable solution.  The key is that you have to build the combat from the ground-up with it being resolved asynchronously from the outset.  I settled for having different actions that your units could take (note, being adjacent to an enemy unit or fortification generally means your unit is considered 'in conflict'):   Assault - Charge the enemy inflicting as many casualties as possible. Harass - Take a small risk to do a small amount of damage. Fortify - Dig in, settle in, and brace for any attacks. Defensive Retreat - Leave the conflict cautiously, but more slowly, to reduce any potential casualties. Retreat - Leave the conflict as quickly as possible, opening yourself up to casualties if attacked. Move - Move across the terrain. Scout - Reveal tiles around the unit.   Each unit would have an attribute that indicated how good they were at a particular action.  For example - Mounted Archers:   Assault: Weak Harass: Very Strong Fortify: Weak Defensive Retreat: Strong Retreat: Very Strong Move: Very Strong Scout: Strong   Each player would choose for all their units which actions they would take.  For example:  Player One   Unit A > Assault > Unit X Unit B > Harass > Unit X Unit C > Scout   Player Two   Unit X > Fortify Unit Y > Move > Assault > Unit A Unit Z > Move > Assault > Unit A   Note: Player One has no knowledge that Unit Y and Unit Z exist yet.    When both players have made all their moves, or on a set timer (a default action would be needed if a timer was being used), the turns are resolved.  So the resolution phase would be reasonably complex.  I've given the example above to highlight a couple of non-obvious things to show the potential of the system.   The Scout action occurs first - it's important to do this to ensure that you're aware of all enemy units that might be involved in the engagement.  Those that you're not aware of will get bonuses to their actions.  So Unit C spots Unit Y, which helps mitigate some of the potential damage. A Harass action occurs next so there is basically no way to avoid it - it has to be like this otherwise fights will just turn into Benny Hill chases around the map.  So although Unit X is going to Fortify, Unit B gets to harass them while they do it - and they deal some damage, suffering very minor losses. Unit X then digs in, however as they've only just issued the order it's only a stage one Fortification.  That's pretty good still, their best course of action right now - but if they kept fortifying over turns it would get stronger (at a rate and to a limit defined by the unit, technology, resources, worker units, etc.). Unit A then assaults Unit X, and it gets bonuses because the enemy has been scouted, and the enemy has been harassed.  In contrast, Unit X gets a bonus because it's Fortified.  So there's losses on both sides, but Unit A has the clear upper-hand. Then both Unit Y and Unit Z enter the battle, both charging into Unit A.  Unit Y gets two bonuses because they're attacking a unit that's already in conflict with two friendly units.  They don't get any advantage for surprise because they were successfully scouted earlier in the resolution. Unit Z then comes in and makes a devastating attack - they get all the bonuses that Unit Y had, but gain an additional bonus for surprise.  Then, let's also say that it was a flanking attack - so they get yet another bonus, completely destroying Unit A.   EDIT: Thinking about it, might the scout action occur in your own turn?  And if two sets of scouts overlap, you detect each others scout units.  That might be quite cool, and makes it so you can properly assess what's going to come at you (as best as possible).    So I think that's pretty cool.. as you can see there is a lot of scope to quite realistic feeling mechanics.  It all happens simultaneously too.  With movement, just move each unit one space, then move them all one more space again, etc. until either there's a clash (clashing units stop) or they've completed their designated move.  You can give units attributes based on the resolution engine too - for example you could make Calvary good at joining an existing fight and flanking, you could have a special unit that can perform an action earlier than normal (for example Fortifying), Veterans might reduce the bonus opponents get for out-numbering them, and so on.  Anyway.. I've waffled on far too much, you get the idea I'm sure.  I genuinely think it's the way forward for 4x games, as it opens up truly decent multi-player, including a massive number of players.  However, my time is already very tight and as much as I'd like to I've not yet been able to put together a prototype.  I have a couple of other projects on my plate for the next few months or so, but after that I might re-look at this."
4Xgaming,39ca7a,Daimonin_123,2,Thu Jun 11 18:34:45 2015 UTC,"That seems like a bad way to do it...  So, if two players are doing a military buildup along each others borders, threatening, etc, and one finally decides enough time has been wasted, if his opponent wants war, he'll have war, before he can buildup even more fleets. So he declares war. Suddenly all his ships teleport back from the border, and can't move for several turns, while the other player is now free to advance and ruin his shit. Am I understanding that right?  Maybe a part of the server turn summary should be AI control of player factions if they haven't done anything that turn? Ideally the player could select an AI behavior (turtle, explore, aggressive, diplomatic, etc.) so the AI reaction isn't too out of line with their plans. That way if a player has war declared on them and still hasn't logged in to respond by the end of the turn, the AI reacts in the best way it can considering it's preset behavior (amp up military production, recall all ships to defend planets/facilities, request military aid from allies, etc.)  How about linking a phone app/sms/email in? That way a player is notified that he is now at war, with whom, and when the end of turn will roll around. Maybe even have a few options for how he would like the AI to react if he can't login himself."
4Xgaming,39ca7a,kwidem,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:04:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the concept is hard for the aggressor, and I got already complaints about it. This has to be changed, but i do not yet have a good solution.    Three ship hulls are at the moment implemented: scout, corvette and frigate. Movement points per turn depend on the implemented ship modules, but ships designed for warfare will most likely gain something like +5 (scout), +4 (corvette) , +2.7 (frigate).    The values are summed up for five turns. That is rather essential, so that players are not forced to login multiple times per day. And it also lets players do more during their online time.    On the other hand, this does allow the aggressor to quickly move into the space ""owned"" by the defender. Distance between solar systems is about 6 fields, if the border is in the mid between two of these, the aggressor might easily reach multiple colonies of the defender.    One thing makes it even more complicated: there will be guys out there who wait until shortly before a turn summary which takes place in the night (e.g. 23.50). They declare war, move their ships, gain new movement points at 24.00, move even further into enemy territory. And there will even be players who stay awake until 04.00 am to continue with the advance. The concept of an AI and auto-movement would solve that problem, but only to a degree.  As the developer of the game , I would appreciate that much dedication. As the loosing party, it would be a bit harsh to log in the next morning, and to see that the game is lost.    As mentioned before, I have yet to implement borders and space ownership, and I will probably slow down ships in enemy space. It is unrealistic that spacecrafts are slower in enemy space, but games do not have to be absolutely realistic. And one could explain slower movement rates with possible mine fields, dangerous supply routes and such things.    A ship would then loose one turn worth of movements points per field traveled. The outer colonies might be lost, but the star systems further away would be safe.    The need to besiege colonies instead of just assimilating them would also slow down aggressors.    I don't mind AI-controlled player units, but I dont see that this feature would get implemented soon - the list of planned features  is just too long..."

4Xgaming,39a9bc,Elliptical_Tangent,2,Wed Jun 10 22:40:10 2015 UTC,"It was and it wasn't. Mechanically speaking, they were the same but SMAC differed in Civ:BE on a few core things already: one, each faction was truly unique not due to nationality, but due to ideology. None of the faction leaders have the same personality as that backstabbing, ideological witch Miriam or corporate money-hungry Morgan, as an example. I am glad to see that they're expanding on affinities as multiple ideologies is what set SMAC apart.   The aliens are also lacklustre in BE compared to SMAC. The aliens in SMAC were nightmare fuel and a legitimate challenge the entire game. You really did not want to piss off the Planet with eco-damage as it would piss off the Gaians and/or the Cult AND you'd have swarms of angry planetlife at your city steps.  And lastly, the lore. SMAC's lore was just... so good. My only criticism with SMAC's lore is the Manifold aliens. Hated them, but so did many others.   In any event, I feel like Civ:BE will definitely become better with expansions and it will become a good game, but it'll always be in SMAC's shadow."

4Xgaming,39a9bc,driir,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:45:03 2015 UTC,"BE isn't just ""civ 5 with different textures"". There are certain mechanics that have been changed a lot. For better:   you have wider choice in what techs to follow. In civ 5 the optimum path was almost always to research techs that increased your science. In CBE, those percentage increases from science buildings are smaller (15% or so) and the extra bulbs from science buildings are smaller as well (2 or 3 bulbs from laboratories for example). This generally means you have a bit more freedom. aliens (barbs) are actually tough, and have an 'attitude' towards you. If you fight them constantly, they'll attack you. Leave them alone and get a nest in your borders, and they'll completely ignore you. Espionage is completely different. I'm not going to say it's much more complicated. At high affinity levels and with high intrigue (that is, when there's been a lot of spying going on in the city) you can do things like set off a dirty bomb or get siege worms called into the city. Still, most of the time you'll be stealing gold and science, with the occasional bit of defector recruiting. It's a bit of a shame. there are expeditions that your scouts can mount. They spend 5-10 turns digging something up, and after that you get a reward (one population point, an affinity level, some culture). You have to protect your scout from aliens though - this provides and interesting little set of choices early on. virtues are a wee bit more interesting than social policies. In civ 5, you couldn't really dip around in half a dozen different policy trees. This is however perfectly doable in CBE - you can get benefits from choosing a lot of policies in one tree, but also from choosing policies in all four. the affinity victories actually are quite interesting, if a bit unbalanced. It is kind of fun to send troops back to earth to liberate the earthlings (from their bodies). a few other things are different. But unfortunately, they're not too different. The quest system, for example, is a bit underdeveloped.   But:   Health/happiness is much less important. Fighting a war while unhappy in civ 5 knocked a huge % of your combat strength, and crippled your growth. Lots of people on the CBE sub say that this means that your best strategy is to ignore health and just build cities. This is unfun, because it removes a balancing act you have to attend to while playing Leaders don't really have personalities. Shaka Zulu is pretty well defined - he likes to expand and wage war, but he's loyal. For the ones in CBE, we don't really have historical personalities to compare them to, so we don't know them very well. And anyway they're kind of bland. This makes emergent storytelling less likely. Some of the quests are unbalanced.  Quests can provide rewards sometimes that can completely bork you in multiplayer. If an opponent gets a free level up in an affinity - well, his troops are now 40% stronger and heal more quickly. You must also wait a random amount of time after finishing a building to get the quest for it. For example, if you finish the ultrasonic fence, you'll get a choice between keeping aliens 3 tiles from your city instead of two, or having your trade routes protected from alien attacks. If you have to wait 20 turns for this, your economy can be crippled. the wonders are expensive, bland and terrible. I've no idea what half of them even do.   Some of these things (leader personalities for eg) will be fixed in the forthcoming expansion. Others (wonders, quests) might be fixed in the 2.0 version coming later on.  The good thing is that a lot of this stuff is either balance issues (easy to patch) or AI diplomacy (doesn't matter for multiplayer). The bad news is that it'll require a lot of public (or semi public) beta testing to fix these issues  I've played a grand total of 2 hours of GalCiv so can't really comment on it. Seems ok so far."

More armor, more speed, heavier weapons, ect ect. Yes you can buy gold bullets with credits. To actually ""use"" gold bullets in a match, you'd spend more credits on ammo than you'd actually gain in a given match."
4Xgaming,3958zr,Terkala,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:45:15 2015 UTC,"Then why are gold tanks never used in pro games? I haven't followed the scene for a while, but last I did, it was dominated by tanks like T32, AMX 50 100, AMX 13 90 and IS-3. None of which are premium.  Gold nuggets , while having higher penetration across the board, have both advantages and disadvantages to normal shells.   HEAT for example, is useless against spaced armor and has a much slower shell velocity. Furthermore, HEAT doesn't have any normalization, so they're a lot more prone to bouncing. On the plus side it has a lot stronger penetration, and doesn't lose penetration strength over long distances.  APCR is actually used as standard ammo in some high tier mediums, but is a premium shell for many lower tier vehicles and some high tier heavies. IIRC APCR has a faster velocity, but loses more penetration over distance, and has a lower normalization value than AP.  HESH is just stupid. It's like HE but with higher penetration, so every shot is guaranteed to do damage, but sometimes where an AP would do 1150 damage, a HESH will sometimes only do 600 damage. If you hit a weakspot, however, you'll kill half the crew and severely cripple your enemy, or outright one-shot an enemy. Note that my knowledge of HESH was based on the 183 tier TD, because it's, like, the only tank in the game where you'd want to use HESH."

Gold tanks only exist so you can pay-to-win your way through the early content.  You're also highly delusional if you think that pro players aren't dropping a lot of money to buy their way into more tank selections and more loadouts.  Anyway, I'm not here to debate a pay-to-win model with a clear fanboy. You'll never be convinced by anything I say, because no evidence will ever be enough for you.

You're also highly delusional if you think that pro players aren't dropping a lot of money to buy their way into more tank selections and more loadouts.   I never said that they don't do that, but I'd bet that most pros always keep some regular AP, because gold nuggets aren't viable in every situation.

I mean, I want an update but part of the reason I adored MOO2 was the relatively unique UI.  You could move population, reallocate population jobs, spend gold to accelerate production,  and access the production queue directly. It made managing a huge empire EASY, the only 4X game to do that. I also expect that they'll still have space lanes, which I also loathe.

4Xgaming,38z3sn,qsagi,5,Mon Jun 8 01:41:59 2015 UTC,"1: Combat is unfortunately neccessary no matter what victory condition you're going for. These are the alternative victory conditions (other than domination):  Seals victory is a king of the hill type game where you have to capture a location and hold it for some time. This earns you points every turn, and you'll earn more points if you have more than one seal. Once you reach a set number of points, you win. When you do capture a Seal, this usually means instant war with everyone and you'll have to defend yourself.  Unifier victory is arguably the most peaceful one, where you'll diplomatically annex (Read: Do quests for AI independent cities or buy them outright) independent cities to make sure you gather a lot of racial points (Races don't like it if you declare war on their cities). Once you've gathered enough points with a particular race, you can build a unifier beacon. Once you have a specific number of beacons, you win the game. Unfortunately, making the beacons is really expensive, and you'll have to defend yourself against powerful independent stacks intent on not letting you build it should you attempt to. Also, if you only have one beacon left, the AI players are likely to dogpile on you as with the seals victory.  2: Age of Wonders 3 actually stuffs a lot of features into free patches rather than expansions, so even if you were to only get he vanilla base game, you'll still have a lot of new stuff going for you, like the ability to have Vassals and the racial happiness overhaul. All that being said, the new victory conditions are locked behind Golden Realms and Eternal Lords for seals and unifier victories respectievely. In addition, there's three races, one class, and three specializations locked behind the expansions, as well as unique map locations, empire quests which gives you unique side missions to compete for, and cosmic events which shakes the gameplay up a little. There are a lot to the expansions, and I'd definitely say they're worth it if you enjoy the base game.  One thing I'd like to add about the expansions is that in Multiplayer, even if you are the only one to have the expansions, the others will still be able to play with you if you host the game. In  addition, if you're the host, your friends will be able to enjoy all the expansion content even if they do not own the expansion. The only difference is that they will not be able to use the new races, specializations, or the necromancer class.  3: Others have already said what's needed on this, but I figure I could link you a few things.  This is a handy infographic which lists stuff like amount of unique units in the game, which is kind of neat. If you ignore the classes which feature minute changes to a specific unit, that's well over 200 units: http://ageofwonders.com/the-age-of-wonders-series-in-numbers/  On complexity and depth, I'd say it probably the deepest combat system in any 4x game. You have resistances, spells, buffs and debuffs, flanking, flying, ranged abilities, units leveling up, units with bonuses against certain units, heroes... As for cover, unit abilities always hit, but damage can be mitigated by a lot by hiding behind obstacles, though some unit abilites and a certain buff makes the projectiles ignore cover. The combat system is not repetitive at all, and there are a lot of strategies to explore. here's a handy beginners guide(text and pictures) which feature some combat: http://ageofwonders.com/beginners-strategy-guide/  4: I don't have any experience with 4-5 people multiplayer, but at least for 2-3 people it's rock solid. Age of Wonders has always had a thriving multiplayer community, so multiplayer is really important. I don't think you'll have any problems with desync."
4Xgaming,38z3sn,DigiAirship,2,Mon Jun 8 12:41:31 2015 UTC,"Hey there! As someone who has played AoW3 with a large amount of regularity (I'm about 300+ hours in), I can probably answer some of these questions to..  1.) Out of the 4x's, AoW3 (and the series in general) is undoubtedly about extermination. Despite that, the recent expansion Eternal Lords added a diplomatic means of victory. However, you still need to have a fairly decent army to attempt this as the unification victory is going to draw your opponent's ire and the ire of NPC armies made up of racial units that want to destroy your unity beacons. The reason being is that you're basically attempting to unify the races of the world under your banner and folks don't really like that. The other means to victory that was introduced in the last xpac is a King of the Hill-esque victory with the Seals. There are usually six seals on the map and by holding one, you gain one point every turn. If you have two, you gain two, etc. The first to gain the required amount of points for a Seal victory basically ascends to a higher plane of existence and wipes out everyone else.  2.) Yes. The first expansion added a few map additions, new units, Halflings, Seal victory, etc. The second expansion added Frostling race, Tigran race, Necromancer class, and basically so many things that I can't summarize.  3.) The game's combat system is in depth. Be prepared to lose units, just like in XCOM. There's a lot of options in fights, based on what class you're playing (and by extension, what kind of empire you are). I can go into more detail about this if you'd like with the individual classes and what their strengths are as I play online with some regularity. Terrain effects unit morale and, if your unit is standing behind rocks for example, arrows aren't going to do anything unless the archer unit has the Seeker modification (like Goblin Swarm Darters do).   4.) The multiplayer is slow. I generally only do fast 1v1's and even those can generally take awhile. Otherwise, with 4-5 people, you're better off doing PbEM (which was introduced in the last xpac) where each of you take your turns when you get an email notification to do so. The multiplayer is fairly stable though, in my experience.  If you have any specific questions, let me know. There's a lot of depth to AoW3 and I highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of fantasy 4x."
4Xgaming,38z3sn,paradoxpancake,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:51:18 2015 UTC,"It is more combat oriented than, say, Civ, if only because the ""empire management"" portion is somewhat light in terms of what decisions you need to make. That said, if you have the newest expansion and go the peaceful route, it is less combat-centric. Yes, you need them. They change it from a mediocre game to a really great one. Tons of units, all with special abilities, plus combat spells, summoned units, etc. Huge variety. Not at ALL like Xcom in execution, but fun and the tactical AI is decent, if not genius.  Haven't tried MP, so can't say."
4Xgaming,38z3sn,hbgk10,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's very focused on combat. I'd say at the very least 50% of your time playing will be spent in combat. The combat is fun though and pretty deep so it's got that going for it. The alternative paths to victory are really pretty dull in my opinion, and the diplomacy might as well be non existent.  I don't think the expansions change as much of the core game as the Civ expansions did, but I do think they are well worth getting if you enjoy the game. I'd either buy it all if it's on sale or just try the vanilla game first. I'd say the game is about equally as deep as XCOM. The lesser parts are you fight on 2D maps and there is no chance to miss shots or anything (although there are crits and such) but there are far, far more abilities than in XCOM and there are also spells, plus way more unit types. Unfortunately I've never tried multiplayer"
4Xgaming,38z3sn,danielrhymer,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:14:12 2015 UTC,"About 3, other than the spells that you can cast on the battlefield, it's much the same than XCOM. Sure, XCom only has ranged combat where AoW has Melee/Ranged/Magic. But magic works much in the same way that ranged does, and a fantasy setting without melee would be silly. AoW doesn't have XCom's miss chances, but counterbalances it with a set of resistances/weaknesses to specific types of attacks instead.  It's different, but the way the player needs to analyze and play is very similar. If you're good at one, you're good at the other. Liking it is very subjective, but they're both objectively well made combat systems."
4Xgaming,38ybr5,MacBadoo,11,Sun Jun 7 21:52:31 2015 UTC,good question. most 4x games feel like mop up in the late game just to eek the win screen.  generally it seems to work best when there is a different challenge at the end. like moo2.

4Xgaming,38ybr5,Dillinur,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"Warlock II was interesting- you play against some other empires, but you're reallying trying to hop to a penultimate zone, cut your way through a mass of semi-horrible dragons, siege some emplacements, & unlocks a portal to some valhallah like place filled with terribly wicked sorcerers that rip your army to bits.  It was fun going from thinking about the other empires, to trying to get a footing in this hellscape plane. I thought I was finally cranking out some pretty godlike amped up units, but man, the final zone (AFAIK) really tore me up and I didn't bother grinding it through. The NPC units don't seem to respawn, so it would've just been cranking out armies for a decade and sending them into the meat-grinder. In spite of not bothering to finish, I still feel like there was enough of a change of pace that it's an interesting exception to the normal late-game 4X blues- there was at least some handoff out of one mode of play, that as the conventional 4X tug of war ran out the game switched into another, interesting stage of play."
4Xgaming,38ybr5,Waervyn,2,Mon Jun 8 20:09:51 2015 UTC,"I also found that Warlock's end game was just ""Make more max tier units than the other guy"", with little regard to strategy or unit counters."

My favorite mod in Civ 4 to play; by the time you get through the tech tree the world has typically consolidated into a few major power blocs who challenge you, especially if you go for a military victory. Only downside is when you and your enemies are each sitting on 200+ cities, turn processing times are 3-5 minutes, so I usually have a book I read while I play!"

4Xgaming,38ybr5,domainsofascension,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:04:37 2015 UTC,Can't think of a single game that is very good late game. Unless you play with other humans you will be snowballing by the late game. By then the decisions you are making are growing less and less relevant. The gains you make grow proportionally trivial and so on.
4Xgaming,38ybr5,the_biz,3,Mon Jun 8 00:53:09 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with playing with humans is that, to do well, you end up having to ""game"" the system, e.g. do stuff due to quirks in the rules that really don't make sense in the immersion fo things.  One thing I do in single player games is I set myself certain limits, e.g. ""Never start a war of aggression"" in MoO2 or Civ. Usually I'll have plenty enough folks attacking me that I can retaliate and grab what turf is is needed, but it does allow some other empires to hang around a lot longer than they normally would."
4Xgaming,38ybr5,jimmahdean,2,Mon Jun 8 01:54:53 2015 UTC,Rigt! Humans will solve stable games. A new game sort of emerges when we find an optimal path. The design intent and the emerging gameplay can be disconnected or they can even work against each other.  Playing with other humans can totally exacerbate this stuff. The basic problem is always there I guess.

I tried around a bit, but didn't want to figure everything out by myself. I tried it again several times, but nothing improved and the desura forums weren't really a big help, so I finally uninstalled it."

And I've played literally thousands of older obscure games (via Home of the Underdogs and a whole lot of free time).  This is the full text on ""Research Stations""   Research stations are different from colonies as they orbit around gas giants and are mainly used for research. Gas extraction modules can also be build on stations and they provide some income based on the gas being extracted. Main purpose of gas giant stations is research, there stations can have modules that greatly amplify your military strength. A fleet can be many times more powerful if you have research stations providing research. However they are expensive to maintain, so it is advisable that you have sufficient income before building them."

4Xgaming,382wmi,jebjev,3,Tue Jun 2 21:46:46 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand why this game isn't being talked about more.  Sorcerer King is the freshest take on fantasy 4X that I've seen. Already 50+ hours in and I plan to play much, much more. If you haven't played it recently, give it a shot. The most recent beta is a lot of fun."
4Xgaming,382wmi,Herxheim,4,Tue Jun 2 11:30:29 2015 UTC,"Well done interview.  I appreciate how Scott put himself out there and at times just said 'I don't know' or 'We aren't planning that...'  I'd rather the honesty than a PR generated answer which puts everything else said in the interview into question...  That said, as a longtime Stardock supporter, I've had a hard time pulling the trigger on Sorcerer King.  I'm one of the early Elemental adopters who got free content from Stardock.  While this was great, I've watched your let's play of Sorcerer King and its hard to shake the thought that this is still the same old engine but with tons of polish.  The artwork looks fantastic but all that does is make me think 'Why wasn't this amount of effort put into Fallen Enchantress??'  I've had tons of fun with that game but the graphics are very rough in spots.    Thanks again, you guys are doing some great work.  Keep it up."

There's no systems (the map just has a bunch of asteroids and is otherwise empty), no wormholes, no Shrike, no construction robots (other than a one-time upgrade for your shipyards), a bunch of pretty well-defined races, and you always played as the human TetraCorp.  That said, FA is still a pretty damn good game and I can heartily recommend it."

4Xgaming,37vsj3,AgentAutism,6,Sat May 30 20:32:58 2015 UTC,"The devs behind AI War adressed this once, let me paraphrase it:  4x games often take a long time to complete, often 6 hours and more. It's not uncommon that you have to play in multiple sessions to actually finish a game.  So, you don't only need another player for the next hour or two, but probably multiple opponents for a longer game, probably spanning days and if one of those opponents has to leave, the others have to stop playing, too.  So a matchmaking service to accomodate this would need to have a lot of information to successfully find people who can schedule games at the same times you can. Posting in a forum is probably easier for everyone involved, including the devs.  So, to summarise: Matchmaking systems tend to work well for games where you can finish one game in one sitting within a well defined timespan, because you know you have to commit that time. For longer games, like the 4x genre, it wouldn't work."
4Xgaming,37vsj3,Cheet4h,3,Sat May 30 20:56:44 2015 UTC,There is also a half-forgotten alternative in the form of PBEM.
4Xgaming,37vsj3,MilitaryDivination,3,Sun May 31 07:58:56 2015 UTC,"At least in the case of sequential turn based 4X games, online multiplayer involves a lot of waiting for your opponent. The more players there are the more turns to wait through before you get to go. As a result there tend to be fewer players of 4X games online or people opt for alternative solutions like play by email. There is nothing to prohibit a matchmaking system perse but if you are going to play a game, possibly over many weeks, I think most people prefer to play with someone they know.   That all said I think there are some solutions.    Design faster paced 4X games Use simultaneous turns to minimize downtime Provide things to do during other player's turns that don't block turn progression   I'm also not sure that there are no 4X games out there with matchmaking."

4Xgaming,37vsj3,NeptunesNookGames,1 point,Sun May 31 08:40:29 2015 UTC,You might take a look at sots1 mp. It's not ranked but it has a drop in drop out system that is kinda cool.  But yeah 4x mp is niche and generally means you have to play with friends. Is also elimination and long which is a hard mechanic to do well in a mp game.  Sins is likely best in class for this as the games can be fast but I don't think there is a ranking system.  Cheating is also an issue in these games when playing against strangers or any pvp game that takes a long time to play.  Best to know the people you play against.

4Xgaming,37qsd9,MilitaryDivination,1 point,Fri May 29 18:11:46 2015 UTC,"Look into military techs, there are massive bonuses to both ship size (titan hulls) and weapon damage available, which the AI tends to pick up rather often. The weapons themselves aren't that special, but the titan bonus makes much larger ships feasible."
4Xgaming,37qsd9,jimmahdean,-2,Fri May 29 18:28:13 2015 UTC,"I guess I don't really have any advice, I played one game and got annoyed with the planet mechanics, but I didn't have issues with my ships being too weak.

4Xgaming,37qsd9,Schmidtzy,5,Fri May 29 18:14:03 2015 UTC,When it comes to SR2 you want to SLASH AND BURN when it comes to war. Build a ship with nothing but a powerful Graviton condenser. build one and target a neighbours star. when the star reaches zero health the star will go supernova and destroy the star system.

4Xgaming,37qsd9,mainichi,3,Sat May 30 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"The ship design feature is really straightforward, and just copying the pre-designed ships and giving them a bigger size and some modifications to the design; like adding researched modules etc, works pretty well. You can design some stupidly efficient ships in there though, so mess around with it for 15mins and you'll have the hang of it.  The AI is quick to build a size 500ish ship or two, and you can do the same by taking one of the designs, adding some armor and upping to size to 600ish and then use the drydocks to get it built out even if you're too low on budget as you can finance the big ship over several cycles.  No way to better see the diplomatic statuses afaik, but the diplomatic relationships rarely change."
4Xgaming,37ou0w,jebjev,6,Fri May 29 05:53:58 2015 UTC,"While designing Star Ruler 2, we actually considered incorporating some elements from Mafia/Werewolf. That didn't end up going anywhere, really, but it did have some influence on the diplomacy system.  If it had gone somewhere, we were going to have hidden plans (but probably not role abilities), with a variety of tools available to the empires that had both potentially positive and negative effects to aid other players' suspicion. I certainly think it could be done in the context of any 4X game, fantasy, historical, or sci-fi."
4Xgaming,37ou0w,ThyReaper2,1 point,Fri May 29 06:35:20 2015 UTC,"GalCiv 2 had some of this. You could outright purchase ""influence"" from other factions.

4Xgaming,37ou0w,Terkala,1 point,Fri May 29 19:26:37 2015 UTC,"I traced back how influence points work in GalCiv 2, and it looks like resources still indrectly affects it by means of infrastructures, this means powerful colonies just gets more powerful, and weaker ones just gets weaker.   The idea with the voting system was to give weaker players a bit of a leverage, with the help of an entity that is not affected by anything other than player votes."

However, if you haven't purchased it yet and you buy through Matrix Games you get a standalone installer from them and you can also redeem the serial number you receive for a Steam key.. So basically you get ""more"" than buying from Steam since you also get another installer that you can save so you don't have to install from Steam.   Note, I purchased from the Matrix site yesterday and there were problems downloading the standalone installer (which has since been resolved) but the process to redeem the serial number for a Steam key went very smoothly (though a bit tedious to have to sign up for yet another website) and I was able to install the game through Steam with no problem."

4Xgaming,37m6of,JSoppenheimer,11,Thu May 28 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"GalCiv 3 is well balanced, tactical play against a decent AI.  Distant Worlds is a detailed simulation of a galaxy and all the empires in it. It's much more of a simulation of a detailed universe and the ships within it, than a wargame. Of course you can still play it like a wargame.  GalCiv3: Buy it if you want a challenge.  DW: Buy it if you want a simulation of a living galaxy."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Terkala,12,Thu May 28 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"I would say: Buy GalCiv 3 if you like Civ 5.  (it's slower and more boardgame-y.) Go Distant Worlds if you love stuff like EU4 and other Paradox titles.   GalCiv 3 is a nicely polished game, but it is also a bit shallow. Build for further expansions coming the next years.  DW:U is a finished game and gigantic in scope."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Stranger371,4,Thu May 28 22:49:48 2015 UTC,"You mention Paradox titles. Do I understand correctly if it means that Distant Worlds is perfectly playable with just letting things happen and sort ""role-play"" and not focused on getting a win state by min-maxing?"
4Xgaming,37m6of,Stranger371,3,Fri May 29 08:37:43 2015 UTC,"You can play it as an ""emperor"" or as the person that gets shit done. So yes, you can automate everything and think about the ""big picture"" or micro everything yourself with zero automation."
4Xgaming,37m6of,amaturelawyer,2,Fri May 29 12:18:42 2015 UTC,"This is the biggest draw of DW for me. I automate pretty much everything to ""ask me first"" and play as a ruler, not the guy who's writing out the individual orders to send out.  It's the difference between ""I will move each of my pieces to colonize/invade/destroy that place"" and ""I want that place colonized/invaded/destroyed, see that it happens""."
4Xgaming,37m6of,emmanuelvr,1 point,Fri May 29 15:04:14 2015 UTC,"Worth mentioning you can be anywhere in the middle with almost any aspect of it too.   You really hate that one state? Fuck it, take command of previously almost-automated army and strategize to fuck them over while the rest works itself out.  You can even automate everything except a single ship and role play as an explorer.  Good stuff."

4Xgaming,37m6of,Therosfire,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:20:44 2015 UTC,"The universe also feels lived in compared to other space games. Since its a real time, and all merchant ships are automated. So you have your escort and frigates flying around patrolling. They will automatically start escorting merchant ships around your empire if you automate them.  Then you have the dozens and dozens and eventually hundreds of merchant transports, passenger ships and mining ships that will fly around your empire delivering goods automatically. You cannot control them, but the AI will buy them from your ship docks giving you money. Its a little thing, but it really makes the universe feel lived in."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Beanchilla,3,Sat May 30 07:27:30 2015 UTC,"As a person who owns both you summed it up perfectly. Gal Civ is far more gamey, which isn't a bad thing. I really enjoy both but DW has eaten up about 300 hours of my time already.  I highly suggest both."
4Xgaming,37m6of,ludwigericsson,1 point,Fri May 29 02:23:50 2015 UTC,Is this Gal Civ 3 or 2 you're mentioning?
4Xgaming,37m6of,Beanchilla,1 point,Fri May 29 08:11:34 2015 UTC,3! I should have clarified. 2 is a great game as well though but 3 has been my go to lately.
4Xgaming,37m6of,JSoppenheimer,2,Fri May 29 08:17:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answers, seems that they both are different enough that it warrants getting both sooner or later. Picked up Distant Worlds for now because it most likely isn't getting cheaper any time soon, already excited to try it later today when I come home from work."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Terkala,2,Fri May 29 04:30:35 2015 UTC,"Enjoy. And remember the primary rule of DW: Don't worry about it.  The game is hugely complex, but it comes with the best automation systems in any game ever. You can have your AI design ships for you, and they'll be decent. You can have your AI ""suggest"" planets to colonize, or suggest which wars to take or which allies to make.  So just play along for a game, make some decisions here and there, fly a big warfleet around stomping on pirates. Just get used to the game and how it works before trying to micromanage everything."
4Xgaming,37m6of,ZenAnonymous,7,Fri May 29 04:46:12 2015 UTC,"This game is extremely detailed but not terribly polished.  So keep that in mind.  If you're into that kind of thing, this is a good deal, as this game rarely goes on sale."
4Xgaming,37m6of,balanceofpower,3,Thu May 28 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"Can you go into some detail on its lack of polish? Does it like... have a lot of ""moving parts"" but many of them don't have any purpose? (that's what I think of when I think of lack of polish)."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Darchseraph,4,Thu May 28 17:43:15 2015 UTC,"Well the graphics look like something out of early 2000s instead of a modern title. The UI takes some getting used to and could have been laid out better.  Endgame can get stuttery on larger galaxies but that's not really anyone's fault as much as craptonnes of ships.  Overall game is a fantastic galaxy/empire simulator with a lot of strategic depth, would definitely recommend with above caveats."
4Xgaming,37m6of,arquebus_x,4,Thu May 28 23:01:25 2015 UTC,"If ""polish"" means UI and UI responsiveness, then in lacks polish. But that doesn't mean its unplayable, it just means you have to get used to the UI.  If ""polish"" means gameplay, then it lacks polish because most new players assume they have to micromanage everything, which is not true, and it's not easy to discover this up front.  Apart from that... DW:U is phenomenal."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Stranger371,0,Thu May 28 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"For an 4x it is exactly as polished as the other games in the genre. But it is more complicated and harder to play because it is a giant piece of game.  It is not something for the ""casual"" players. Also the modding community is very active."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Tainlorr,4,Thu May 28 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"Have you played Endless Space or Endless Legends? Or even Civ 5? Those are the definitions of ""polish."" This game is very far from graphical and UI polish.   Despite that, of course, the gameplay is phenomenal and deep. It's just not nearly as polished as most of the other big names in the genre."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Stranger371,2,Fri May 29 05:01:26 2015 UTC,"I call these games ""meh"", at least for me. They offer not enough depth imho.    Endless Legends has a really shitty combat system that ruins it for me, everything else is great. Especially the art style and lore.    Civ 5 is polished, sure, but it also is what I call ""streamlined"" because every person can play it and it is really hard to lose. Also it had much more people behind it. DW is, afaik, made by one guy.   I like to really think while playing 4x games, imho nothing comes close to DW:U. It has the right complexity and mechanics for me and the gameplay rocks, too. That's why I always gush so much about it."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Tainlorr,2,Fri May 29 12:17:37 2015 UTC,I agree! I was just talking about polish from a graphical/UI sense.
4Xgaming,37m6of,Stranger371,1 point,Fri May 29 15:01:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no arguments there. But there are a couple of mods for DW:U that make the UI a little bit better."

4Xgaming,37m6of,Lorini,-3,Fri May 29 08:13:03 2015 UTC,It's at least as polished as any other space strategy game not named Starcraft.

4Xgaming,37m6of,Draakon0,0,Fri May 29 15:02:36 2015 UTC,"Besides the somewhat bad font being used, I personally don't have major complaints about the UI. Sure it's large and needs some time to get used to it, but that's to be expect for the scale the game has."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Lorini,-2,Fri May 29 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"I see no particular polish in Endless Space over DW. And AI Wars might have more controls, but its look is awful."
4Xgaming,37m6of,Tainlorr,4,Fri May 29 12:13:34 2015 UTC,"Endless Space and Endles Legends both have incredibly manageable UIs. DW bombards you with hundreds of ugly buttons, hard to read text, and choppy UI. Hell, you cant even drag a window around without screen tearing!"

4Xgaming,37m6of,Tainlorr,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:32:25 2015 UTC,Really? The UI and the general graphics were by far the best part of those games for me. I love how they both used the same UI and general concepts so that you could jump between them without much of a learning curve.

The UI is smooth, I read everything fine (and I don't have the best vision) and I've never seen screen tearing, dragging or no. Perhaps you need an upgrade? As Endless Space in particular doesn't show much on the screen anyway. That doesn't equal 'polish' it's more like 'too simple'."

4Xgaming,37nrhd,Cassius999,9,Fri May 29 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"I've been playing on Genius and so far it seems like it's exactly the same AI as GC2. The downside is that it doesn't know how to use the tile system. Which is the only complaint below that doesn't already apply to GC2.    It will place buildings in entirely stupid areas (I've seen deuterium manufacturing boosters placed in single tiles with no possible adjacent construction yards). Which is a 10% construction boost for 3x the cost of a factory and uses a unique resource. When a factory gives a 30% construction boost. If buildings are ever placed for their adjeaceny bonuses, it's likely an accident more than anything else. Also, they don't specialize any worlds. Every world is a combination production/research/econ world. They trade techs like idiots. One turn they'll offer to sell a tech to you for 75 credits. The next turn, they'll offer to buy a same-tier tech from you for 1,000 credits. They can't use the unit designer creatively. I built literally nothing but missiles, and despite that the AI would continue to build wide-spectrum defense ships even though we'd been at war for 20+ turns. The AI doesn't go to war intelligently. They'll throw small fleets at you in a trickle based on when they fill up. They'll never maneuver multiple fleets to take out a more powerful fleet, aside from pure chance if they have multiple fleets to begin with."
4Xgaming,37nrhd,Terkala,1 point,Fri May 29 03:44:23 2015 UTC,"Ill give the AI that, if it knows what techs you have from diplomacy it knows it would take little effort to redesign your ship if the AI would put everything on shields. But still you have like 7 or 8 fleets probably carving the AI ships apart with little losses of your own, at least it should build an equal amount of specialized ships to counter the deployed ones. The poor use of the ship designer is the reason I am able to steamroll a vastly larger AI fleet frequently. Also they use far less troop transports. When I go in I take lots of transports with me. When the AIs are at war all you have to do is gang up on the weaker one, let the AI clear out most of the fleet then you take over with your troop transports. Only fix they had for that is the AI surrendering to a faction other than you.  I dont understand why there cant be routines built in in diplomacy for example to make the AI more reluctant to sell warships if relations are sour or we have been at war in the past. Or why would the AI sell an influence Starbase that covers its own planet, cant it be written to look at things like that?  You have discovered Barren worlds but did not get around to colonize them yet? Dont trade barren worlds colonization."
4Xgaming,37nrhd,Terkala,1 point,Fri May 29 10:08:38 2015 UTC,"In this example, I was 8 techs deep into missiles, with nothing but ""able to build lasers/cannons"" level tech. I also had nothing but ships with missiles on them. Literally nothing else.  Also, if you have a soldiering bonus, the AI is mostly incapable of invading your worlds. They'll throw transports at worlds with a 0% success chance, one at a time."
4Xgaming,37nrhd,Terkala,2,Fri May 29 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"Getting less interested in this game. I was kinda hoping with the grafics not changed that much they would have completely reworked the AI, but it seems not to be the case."

4Xgaming,37fvxp,MiracleWhippit,2,Wed May 27 15:58:09 2015 UTC,"I thought it was fun. Never played Dominions, but this seems like a simpler version. Basically conquer towns/cities/resources, use the income to build armies, and fight the other civs and independants. There are lots of twists, like some races have their own unique resource and can't use gold for instance. Some races get free units, some races can only summon units with wizards and it slowly drives the wizard insane, some races have no access to magic. The wide variety of races/empires was the stand out feature to me. It looks like they are adding tactical turn based battles, which I'm not sure how I feel about. The last game had 100% automated battles that you could watch or skip, which I think helped with the pace of the game. Battles would get pretty huge late game, I would have some that were like 50 vs 50 units. That would take forever if it were turn based."

I doubt op wants to have that or he could play any game he liked with friends and have epic diplomacy.  I can't think of a currently existing game with solid diplomacy, either in peace or in war. I am working on a game with diplomacy and politics but since its not a space game, I cannot really recommend it to OP. Galciv3 or maybe like, The Last Federation are probably his best bet. But the scale and difficulty of TLF is not the same as a standard 4x."

4Xgaming,37fk2n,domainsofascension,2,Mon Jun 8 05:02:34 2015 UTC,"My research on GC3 says its not that much more diplo/poli focused than most other space 4x. My current project isn't released yet, but I'd call it like, Vicky2ish/Dom4ish combo if I had to use a comparison.  It has a lot of uncommon stuff but for the purpose of this discussion the treaty/agreement interface is probably what matters. Unlike a Paradox game where you have a limited number of peace treaty options and a couple diplo menu options, treaties are unconnected with war, but you can apply a truce to a treaty as a component which will end a war with a given truce timer.  Truce wise, DDRJake famously referred to truces in EU4 as ""just a piece of paper."" In my version all AI that have any nation party to a treaty as a recognize state will keep a record of any broken treaty and how soon, and they will use that to evaluate their trust of you. Moreover if you break a lot of treaties they will apply less harsh penalties to people who break a truce with you, and for a given truce and various other agreements of a treaty, you will have to give more for the same result or just be very scary so that they'll agree just to stop you from stomping them.  That kind of complexity, too soon in testing to say if its depth, is involved in most major game features/systems. Also various treaty options include things like hostages and marriages for opinion and safety, fostering of nobility among both vassals and other states, two way negotiating so you can exchange provinces or something, license to trade in nation or study at a given national university and so forth. Each AI keeps a record of all actions between states to decide how to deal with you. And the culture/foreign policy of a nation is also involved. For instance nations that support free trade or international research cooperation will have opinion bonuses towards your requests if you also support, by action not words, these policies.  Now there is also a much more complex system of trade and production, but I'm fiddling with modular rulesets. So if having to gather materials to build buildings and supply balanced diets, basically what would normally be the domain of city building games, is not your thing, you would be able to hit a checkbox and have that abstracted out. That feature is just in the contemplation stage though and may not make it into the final product.  Also you may be paying a steep Dominions style graphics penalty so I can spend my precious dev time on mechanics/features/systems. Also had to make game turn based and not real time to deal with the cpu/ram processing load of so many things going on."
4Xgaming,37fk2n,domainsofascension,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:16:16 2015 UTC,"I suppose I like GC3's system of diplomacy. I can make long lasting friends and good trade deals without feeling the AI is being overly cautious.  You'll have to keep me posted on your development. The game you are creating sound pretty fantastic. I have always felt trade/production has been lazy in most 4X's. And as long as the interface is clean and not overly cluttered, a graphics penalty is more than worth it for good features."
4Xgaming,37fk2n,Daimonin_123,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:53:29 2015 UTC,"Well, the issue with having a high information game is always about the interface, well and performance. Consider the hassle it is to see all the information in a Paradox game. So many pages of interfaces. The ledger alone is a disaster waiting to happen.  As far as trade and production, I'm intending to use an almost city builder style system, minus the actual placement of buildings on a map, the abstraction assumes ideal placement like most 4x building systems do. You will need to manage both food and materials for building things and supplying troops and feeding population. Trade involves all those materials plus other stuff like rights to borrow from national universities and private collections and crap. We'll see how much I can jam in there without overloading the interface and watering down the significance of individual decisions. Ideally any decision you make will be more important than +5% production bonus or some crap."
4Xgaming,37fk2n,domainsofascension,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:07:44 2015 UTC,I will be first in line (online queue?) to get your game. This is turning into a dream. The city building aspect combined with 4X is such a great idea. I really can't wait for whatever you're creating.
4Xgaming,37fk2n,Daimonin_123,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:53:27 2015 UTC,"Hehe, well be warned of the fate of my last project, an RTS/CB game with extra RPG stuff in there. I gave it up for this project because it seemed more feasible. The limitations of size in RTS makes empire/kingdom building an issue.  Also my shitty minimum wage job sucks life out of me.  The main hurdles I'll have will be performance and AI related I expect. Non-real life issues I mean. Having turns take a long time due to many calculations and also much AI thinking could be a huge issue. And since many features rely on my AI working well this could be an issue.  I am pretty sure I can handle decently written code for everything but the AI, that's where shit gets real, after all most large pro studios famously have AI that has to cheat to compete.  Well and I have the whole UI issue. UI is both boring, tedious, and extremely difficult to optimize.  On top of all that are the REALLY experimental features like the turn time limit. I worked out a system to try and deal with blobbing and its quite unlike anything you've used and there is a medium chance it will piss off players even if, or in fact because, it works really well. The go to thing will be people saying the interface isn't good enough rather than admit they lack the capability to manage a massive empire cleverly to get around the time limit."

4Xgaming,37fk2n,Familion,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:16:37 2015 UTC,"I think the important part for player diplomacy is not having a limiting system.

At the same time, conquest is the only real option for victory and battles can be quite epic. And it's real time, which probably would be a plus considering you mentioned Sins.  Overall the game is one of the few that really dares to innovate substantially and pulls it off quite nicely.   Although a word of caution: Strategy and fleet composition is much more important than in-battle tactics, which you might miss when coming from Sins. At the same time, I don't think you can get Sins-like combat (or even close) in any other 4x..."

4Xgaming,37aq0n,darkarchon11,5,Tue May 26 10:36:58 2015 UTC,I'd simplify it down to meaningful decisions throughout the game. It's no fun when an early mistake fucks you over for an entire 5+ hour game.
4Xgaming,37aq0n,Jaxck,6,Tue May 26 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that, although I would not downplay the decisions made at the beginning of the game. They need to have an impact later in the game, or else the decision was quite meaningless."
4Xgaming,37aq0n,darkarchon11,0,Tue May 26 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"No it wasn't. An ancient age decision should have effectively zero effect on your empire in the space age. Decisions should carry weight based on their relative circumstance, not based on hugely long term strategies. An early game decision should provide some early benefit, not define a 5 hour strategy. This is why time-relative victory conditions are so necessary to discourage all-in strategies."
4Xgaming,37aq0n,Jaxck,3,Tue May 26 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"Well disregard the ancient age and space age stuff, just think in strategies. What you are describing are not strategies, but tactical maneuvers.   Let's take an example with AI War: Fleet Command. The game utilizes AI progress to determine the fury and ""strength"" of the AI counterplayer. Every planet you take raises the AI progress by at least 20 - that's not that much, but it's not nothing either. Taking a planet can be a very easy undertaking and tactically easy to do. But should you take it? (you don't need to take over the galaxy to win in this game) Do you really need to take that planet and raise the progress by 20? Maybe, in the end game, you need that 20 progress to not pass a specific threshold (e.g. every 100 progress the AI gets new units, around 230 progress the AI starts using higher level units, then around 540 etc.)   In this case this is a strategic decision made by you very early which can tremendously impact your mid- and end game play, since taking planets later in the game gets increasingly difficult and the AI gives you a very hard time, especially with the AI progress skyrocketed. You have carefully to explore and decide what planets you actually have to take to progress well against the AI.   It's like you're playing with a scalpel. Doing the wrong cuts at the start won't help you at the end when you actually have to do the tricky part!"
4Xgaming,37aq0n,darkarchon11,3,Tue May 26 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"This..   A sense of progression throughout the game is important, I love seeing a small empire grow larger and more complex over time (Distant Worlds probably the best example)  Multiple ways to interact with the core gameplay elements (For an example an economic model having trade, taxes, a marketplace, research choices, espionage, etc).  When a game has more than a few important game-play mechanics which can potentially interact with one another.  This is what gives the player a true sense of decision-making!  (Civ 5 probably the best example)  Unique effective strategies to play the same game, whether through faction/starting choices, multiple victory conditions, etc.  Basically re playability.

If I go to the trouble of building up a fleet of doom I want to watch the pretty pewpew when I use it and maneuver out of tight fights tactically if needed.  Good automation: Downfall of a lot of Space Empire Builders is that the game becomes very tedious to micromanage at around your 8th colony as you have too much to do.   Good Economics: Valuable strategic resources, a commodity market, freight shipping and trade lanes that must be protected, etc.  Real Population: The populace makes somewhat intelligent choices that fit the tempo of your empire.  Large Galaxy and Big Fleets: Self explanatory. Automation is a must in an empire of 100+ worlds though.  Complex and meaningful research tree leading into different weapon types, economic facilities, etc. And upgrades for those facilities.

4Xgaming,37aq0n,Darchseraph,6,Thu May 28 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"4x genre is naturally interesting because of the inbuilt dynamic gameplay that comes from switching between the 4 x's.   That being said, it's important that you develop the 4 x's in equal measures:   Explore: don't make it relevant for the first part of the game only. I lost count of the games I restarted because exploration ended mid-game and the rest was just going through the motions. Expand: avoid infinite sprawl, land grabs, etc. but don't be heavy-handed. Things like happiness caps and hidden hits to production are lame. The effects of thinning out your population or risking life in hostile territory should be simple and obvious. Exploit: this is already done to death. The only pitfall here is micromanagement failing to scale when expanding too much, but there are already some good solutions out there.  Exterminate: Don't skimp out on tactics element, it provides the switch in gameplay these games sorely need. MoO2 did it right and that's why it's the best. This means a decent AI is important: skimp on that and your game is utter shit: few people like playing against a simpleton AI, fewer will judge a 4x by how good the multiplayer is."

To me, a 4x should center around being able to achieve victory though any one of the 4 x's, and not require ALL 4.  Having said that, I think all other conventions are on the table.  Truthfully, as much as I want 4x games for everybody, there's been a glut of new games lately, and they're all stumbling over each other sharing features.  I think making a 4x game with the same features as every other 4x game is a mistake.  MoO was colossal because of what it brought to the table.  Rather than see another MoO clone, I want to play the game that is the next genre-definer.  As a fellow developer, I say don't be afraid to do something different and fresh.  Every feature you want to add, ask yourself what purpose it serves, and what value it provides.  Detailed shipbuilding can be a cool feature, for example, but if there's no discernible advantage to doing it, or the game allows auto-built ships that are just as strong, don't add the feature and don't waste the time on development.  Avoid the temptation to add something that is filler.  ""Mini-games"" are never a good choice, and players never like them.  The card battle system in Endless Space comes to mind; it reduces combat to a multi-variable game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.  Also, don't be afraid to tell players they're wrong.  Have a vision, believe in it, and stick to it.  If every player had their way, every game that came out would be an FPS zombie survival crafting CCG game.  Barf."

4Xgaming,37aq0n,Zap0,1 point,Tue May 26 17:05:29 2015 UTC,"besides the basic stuff of a 4x, the 4x's, what generally clinches a 4x is the gamey portion of it. That part of the game that falls out side of the 4x's.  A pure 4x becomes a yawner real fast unless its a MP 4x.   most 4x's have a flavor or gimmick that makes them special to me.  sots has a variable tech tree and multi warp tech plus configurable ship hull and somewhat sectional damage. cool.  master of magic had the ability to create magical items and cast those overland spells. plus cool death knights that were unbalanced as all hell. and multi dimensions.  stardrive had ship construction that was unparalleled wrapped up nicely in a smooth RTS. game could have been better but conceptually awesome  moo2 had the galactic counsel.   there is just something that must be there outside of the basic 4x's  otherwise 4x is generally about exploring a world and dominating and conquering its inhabitants.   i feel the more gamey bits outside the 4x the better. the 4x is a wrapper  or a frame work that a bunch other cool stuff hangs off it."
4Xgaming,37aq0n,CrunchyGremlin,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:41:24 2015 UTC,"In my mind there are three things that make a 4x.  1) Randomized/Procedural Maps to give different challenges each game.  2) Options other than elimination of the opponent as a means of diplomacy and victory.  3) A level of scale that reflects management of an entire empire, race, or similar division."

4Xgaming,37aq0n,Waervyn,0,Thu Jun 4 11:41:16 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in real-time, try something that works, or something that will be interesting to play.  Usually turn-based works the best, try balancing it - day-by-day turns in a game that spans millenias is just awful, while also going multiple years in one turn can sometimes be either good, or bad. World-building. Spend as much time as you can no this, hire talented people (like me :D ) to do it for you if you need help. If your world is not believable, easy to comprehend, you're gonna have a bad time. Decide on a scale. Usually 4Xs start as a tribe, and gradually evolve into planetary/galactic civilization, and you can imagine there is some serious micro-management in tribe cultures, while larger societies rely more on macro-management. As players progresses through various eras, you simply cannot expect them to manage thousands of cities on one planet, and then move on to another planet, managing for an hour one turn. Employ a concept, that will help players, but not take fun and responsibility from them. As I'm sure others will say - war isn't the only solution. At least the violent one. You can have trade wars, brands liquidating other, smaller brands, buying your competition, forming alliances, etc. Reforms. Change is the way progress is made. Read a bit about various companies, and how they changed throughout centuries (e.g. Nokia). It's nice to start as a tribe of warriors, but two millenias after that it's probably better to concentrate as a haven for science, and a millenium after that players might want to change their course towards culture, or warmongering. Make decisions matter. If your civilization builds a beautiful temple in year 1000, and it's destroyed by another culture in year 1500, it would be nice to recover some part of it in year 2000 as archaeological site. Players also love to see their decisions and progress, so if they build a district in a city, make them see it, let them change courses of rivers by building dams, drying neighbours farms. Most of current 4X games doesn't deal with global climate changes, make this happen. Some long time ago Mediterranean sea wasn't there, and people were driven out of this nice valley, because Atlantic violently poured in. Early settlers could walk from France to England, etc. Heroes are very nice to have, but what's strange for me is, how can they live through centuries? Make a concept that will suit you, like heritage, immortality, or short-lived overpowered heroes, that can change civilization in their ten turns. Victory conditions. Make them simple to understand, hard to achieve. Let players choose what type of victory they want, and don't deny them this choice during playthrough. eXplore/eXpand/eXterminate/eXploit - that's what 4Xs are about, players should have an opportunity to win by exploring new continent, or exploiting their surroundings. Usually 4Xs could be called 2Xs, because they concentrate on extermination and expansion, but we can all agree Vatican is rather small, and still has considerable and powerful say in world's decisions."

4Xgaming,37aq0n,Herxheim,-1,Tue May 26 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"4X means turn based, long term (3-5hr min), and expansive gameplay. Each stage of the game should feel unique and encourage a different set of strategies. Decisions should be meaningfully strong tradeoffs, with increasing significance throughout the game. Multiplayer is a must. Catchup mechanics are mandatory so as to maintain competition with the long pace of the game. Exploration should be necessary throughout the whole game. Expansion should always be a viable option. Exploitation should be hard, with no single optimal set up (no dominant strategies. Dominated strategies are inevitable, better to make your game not broken rather than totally fair). Extermination should be satisfying, not a drag. Victory should not be the result of a final score, but rather cumulative over the pace of the game (England is very clearly the most successful civilisation in history, despite the fact that America has been the dominant power for almost 80 years. Did America ""win"" the real life game of civ or did Britain?). Map randomisation is not necessary for a good game, provided strategies are diverse enough (indeed less randomisation means higher competitiveness which can improve multiplayer dramatically). Interaction is fun and what more interactive way to win is there than war? Victory conditions need to be highly interactive and competitive, not just ""build more [blank] before the other guy""."

4Xgaming,36y8bo,readitour,19,Sat May 23 04:51:29 2015 UTC,"I have to go with the classic: Master of Orion 2. Granted, it's dated now, and there were some balance issues (the game just screams for the ability to mad it, but alas!). For multiplayer, it's  hard to go wrong with Space Empires IV or even V, but for single player, the AI is pretty weak.   Distant Worlds isn't a bad game, but to me, it feels very much like a sandbox where you micro-manage everything to death, or, if you turn on some of the automation, just end up frustrated as heck. It's cool, despite it being real time, but somehow it just feels a bit...empty. Cant' exactly put my finger on why, but it does.  GalCiv II is good, and has it's own flavor. Can't speak for III, as I've not gotten it yet.  A lot of the recent 4X space games have left me flat. Endless Space seems cool, but too many things that look like choices really just aren't once you realize how the game works. Lords of the Black Sun has, to me, a very annoying interface. Star Drive 2 is 80% MoO2, but with a wonky ground tactical layer. Horizon is, well, meh. Havent' tried Star Ruler 2, though it sounds interesting, primarily because I don't at all care for RTS.  As usual, your mileage may vary, everyone has different tastes, etc. But for me, nothing has yet to supplant MoO2 as the all time best."

4Xgaming,36y8bo,Kyuutai,15,Thu May 28 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"Master of Orion 2. Fun, well-made if you are okay with some of the quirks and poor balance... Space combats were the most fun of all space games, in my opinion - simple and detailed at the same time. Planet terraforming was loads of fun. Antarans too were so much fun - when they send tiny ships which could destroy your fleets at the start of the game and you gradually teched up to become just as a powerful... Games still try to copy MOO2 (StarDrive2 being the most prominent example). If GalCiv3 was more polished and had better AI and good mods, it would be on par or better than MOO2, but so far it isn't. Developers say they'll improve it, but we'll see.  Also don't know if you consider it a space game, but Alpha Centauri was amazing. Civilization in which tiles had elevations (i.e. there were real mountains), which played an economic role, affected climate or even a strategic role: I played an archipelago game once, and was on an island, and on a neighboring island there was a rival faction. One turn they declared war on me and completed terraforming the land so that our islands were now connected by land, then send troops to conquer me without the need of transports. Also, it had really fun future technologies, and the factions were divided by ideology rather than nation. It also had its quirks, for example, as I discovered later, many cool movies for scientific projects were fragments of the movie Baraka. (which is a cool movie, though, truth be told)  Too bad MOO2 and Alpha Centauri are old games and not that good to look at anymore ;_;"

4Xgaming,36y8bo,arquebus_x,2,Sat May 23 06:51:56 2015 UTC,"Just me with a problem or is there actually a lot to learn.   A bit of both. Mostly the latter. But:   It's like I'm anticipating massive micro.   You can get around this. DW allows you to automate virtually anything you want, and the AI is decent at running your empire unattended. If you go into the Options screen you can turn on/off any automation you want. You can even set a switch to have your ""advisers"" suggest decisions for you, or alert you when things need to get done. You can also automate every single ship in the game if you want, and just set some priorities (like when military ships are allowed to engage enemies).  So starting out, for example, you might want to automate things like ship design, troop building and facility building, while turning on suggestions for fleet building, research, colonization and construction. There are a whole lot of options you can adjust.  Another thing you can do is ""play"" an hour or so of the game on full automation, and watch what your AI does. It will give you a feel for the flow of the game. Then you can turn off automation one by one, or start over with a partially automated empire.  I will say that it took me a few tries before I really started to like DW. And now I'm addicted to it. I have a bunch of games running, some on nearly full auto, some where I micromanage everything. Depending on my mood when I'm playing I'll pick the style I want. I even have a saved game where the only thing I do is follow one fleet around and explore and beat up aliens, while the AI manages the rest of my empire. Every once in a while I send the fleet back to base to see what new research has been concocted, and to retrofit my ships. Then I'm out in the universe again, letting my AI governor handle the rest."

And by that I mean I really enjoy GalCiv III which I got recently but am curious about some of the ones you've mentioned.  Namely Star Ruler 2 and Distant Worlds Universe.  I've looked at Star Ruler a bit and don't seem to understand what makes it different from GalCiv besides a different art style maybe.  Distant Worlds though, that intrigues me greatly. I've looked up a bunch of information about it but am still confused. I understand there's a great deal of detail with a great deal of automation as well, but I'm more interested in the details, which no one seems to talk about.  Just how detailed is all of it? Is it like Victoria in space? Are the populations detailed and impactful? Do cultures change, a la dwarf fortresses having group memories of important events or shifts in the people of civilizations? Is espionage a big part of it, as it should? Can I sabotage my opponents through covert means? Is the AI intelligent, or at least, semi-logical?"
4Xgaming,36y8bo,djtopicality,5,Sat May 23 05:24:22 2015 UTC,"I've played through a few games of DW, and especially after the final DW: Universe expandalone, its always a huge favorite. I'll assume you already know all the basics (pausable real-time, planets, exploring, whatnot) and give you a few of my favorite details.  * Every ship you design is made up of several hundred components, chosen from a list of every buildable version of 30-odd different parts, some specialized like ECM or cloaks, some always required, like reactors, life support, and crew quarters. Then of course you have your 7 or 8 (from memory) kinds of weapons, all with their own armor damage rating, shield penetration, etc. Each component also has its own cost in both cash and which of the 20 different strategic resource types in the game are required. Half the fun of the management side of the game is making sure you're putting resource stockpiles on the right planets in the right strategic parts of your empire or building forward refueling points for your far-flung missions. Sounds intimidating at first, and I think it was my 6th attempt at the game (also my first full play-through) that I started tinkering with the AI's automatically built ship designs, mostly to add more fuel-pods and the like.   As you explore the galaxy (build exploration ships and set them to auto-explore or pick your targets, but this rapidly becomes impossible on even medium-sized maps) you'll stumble across not only other empires, but minor races which can evolve into full empires if they go unconquered long enough. There are also hidden pirate bases for the many pirate factions which you can pay off or fight, and if those pirates raid a world often enough eventually they can build facilities to establish a permanent presence there, then take over the planetary government, then start their own empires! Playing as a pirate faction: also apparently a blast, but god the early game sounds like a struggle so I cant say myself. Each system maybe has planets, each planet maybe has resources, among the 20 or so strategic ones (right kind of crystal for lasers, only the right kind of gas (hydrogen helium, crypton, argon) for the type of reactor tech you've decided to run, etc). Also there are another 40 or so luxury resources which you can tap for trade benefits and the float your approval and allowable tax rates. Then there are tourist locations, either on planets, or around Neutron Stars or Black Holes where you find them, which you can build resort bases on for a steady cashflow!   It really has all the details covered, if that's what you're looking for, but if not, again, just hit the boxes to automate exploration, base-building, and starship design, and you only need to worry about keeping pirates off the bases the AI builds for you, generally in smart places."

4Xgaming,36y8bo,arquebus_x,6,Thu May 28 13:01:55 2015 UTC,"Just how detailed is [Distant Worlds]? Is it like Victoria in space?   Not quite, but it's as close as you get in a space 4X. I'd say it's more in line with Europa Universalis IV in terms of complexity. The resource and economic model of the game is fairly complex (dozens of different resources that you have to be mining and transporting in order to build stuff). There is a civilian layer of freighters and transporters (which you can't control) that you occasionally have to protect with escort fleets, and its the civilians' job to shuttle all the resources and people around. So if you build a gas mine on a gas giant planet, the civilian layer will build some freighters to go mine and collect the resources and bring them back to your various ports. If you run out of a resource you can always pay pirates to smuggle it in for you.   Are the populations detailed and impactful?   They really only are detailed on the issue of ""happiness."" But that ties back into the economic model. Luxury goods and luxury resort facilities (and entertainment centers on star bases) are all part of it, and you have control over their production, but there's no detail beyond that. If there is one area where DW is simplified, it's at the planet surface level. There are only a few facilities you build, and you don't manage worker output.  I played a game recently where I was about 15 minutes into the start of it and there was a revolt on one of my colonies. I couldn't suppress it in time (I didn't have any troop transports yet), and the revolt spread to my capital planet. There was a coup. A new emperor was brought it. My loyalists fought back. We lost. Game over. Best 30 minutes of DW I ever played, no joke.   Do cultures change, a la dwarf fortresses having group memories of important events or shifts in the people of civilizations?   Sadly, no. I wish they did. The primary personal changes are in the leaders: they gain or lose positive or negative traits over time, based on their performance and the events that occur in your empire. If that's the sort of thing you like, I'd recommend selecting a race that has a high rate of leaders appearing. (Some races rarely get any.) Leaders can be colonial governors, empire leaders, fleet admirals, ship captains, researchers, spies and ambassadors. They all gain or lose traits based on what's going on around them, and you can move them around based on where they fit best for your needs.   Is espionage a big part of it, as it should?   Yes, it's a big part, especially if you are playing a race that gets a lot of spy leaders. You can assign them to different tasks in different empires, for different lengths of time. Things like stealing tech, inciting riots, sabotaging facilities, etc.   Is the AI intelligent, or at least, semi-logical?   The AI is intelligent but there is room for improvement. There is an excellent mod for DWU that greatly improves it. (This is largely the reason I recommend Universe over any of the other iterations of the game, since Universe was designed for modding.)  One of my favorite aspects of DW is the way the map works. There is no ""instancing"" like there is in StarDrive or Endless Space or pretty much most other space 4X's. So you can zoom all the way down to your solar system level, then zoom all the way back out to galactic level, and it's all the same map. Battles take place on the map. All travel takes place on the map. Placement of structures (mines, stations, defensive platforms, fleets, etc.) takes place on the map. Planets orbit their stars over time. You can build colonies on moons, which orbit their planets, which orbit their stars. If you build a defensive base to one side of your planet, the other side is less protected. But if you build the base right on top of your planet, the enemy can get closer before being fired upon. The map is everything.  And it's all in real time, no turns. So in mid-game you could easily wind up frantically watching over a dozen different fleet engagements, sliding your map view around to keep an eye on each battle as it unfolds in parallel with all the others. (You can pause the game and perform any actions you want to queue up, so it's not super frantic like an RTS.)  I'd recommend a couple Let's Plays:  Extreme Survival. He sets all the settings to brutal and tries not to die.  Collaborative. A few players running a single save game in serial (there's no multiplayer in DW, unfortunately)."

4Xgaming,36y8bo,arquebus_x,2,Thu May 28 21:10:03 2015 UTC,"Wow! Great!  I would recommend going to the DW forums and looking into the UI mods and the Extended Universe mods (there are a few different flavors). The UI mods make the interface look a bit nicer (more ""modern"") and the Extended Universe mods add dozens of playable races. There are also mods that combine these together with AI improvements (and tweaks to the research tree)."
4Xgaming,36y8bo,LOLBastardSword,2,Thu May 28 21:39:36 2015 UTC,"Star Ruler 2 is significantly different from GC3, namely because it's real-time instead of turn-based, but it also employs vastly different game mechanics. I couldn't possibly write enough here to explain it, but why not read this: http://explorminate4x.com/2015/03/27/star-ruler-2/"
4Xgaming,36y8bo,ti0tr,2,Sat May 23 11:07:02 2015 UTC,"One thing about DW that sets it apart from other 4x games is the absolute scale of the game. The maps are massive, the scope of all of the moving parts is massive (this is where competent automation actually makes the game playable) and the wars are absolutely ridiculous. A fleet in your typical 4x game is what 6-10 ships at most, that shit's child's play compared to DW I am approving build orders for 20-30 capital ships at a clip, and a horde of support ships, escort ships, scouts and other assorted crap. I remember one game where I was playing as some silly ass space rat clan. These rats were super good at making money, as in I had more goddamn money than the rest of the galaxy put together. I would pay exorbitant sums of money to start massive proxy wars just as if I was ordering a cup of coffee.   That's not the awesome part though, the awesome part was my fleet. I opted to design a bunch of heavily armored, cheap as hell ships with mediocre at best firepower.  I had something like 300 capital ships, and hundreds upon hundreds of escort, support vessels, troop carriers and other crap. When someone pissed me off, or threatened to embargo my ass I would just send in the clowns. I took on the 2nd largest military power, and the 3rd largest military power who formed an alliance at some point at the same time. The end result was about 2 hours real time worth of stupidly large fleet engagements. If wars were won based only on killing stuff, than I got my ass kicked because a single one of their capital ships could kill like 5 of mine pretty easily. My losses were horrific, but who cares the only thing that could match my financial reserves, was my unrivaled manufacturing capacity. Well that war didn't go well for them, or the other idiots that decided to pile on me, because there is no way in hell a bunch of stupid space rats can take on half of the galaxy right?  It's not a good idea to get in a war of attrition with the guy who can throw an entire fleet away for giggles. The economy of the Anti-Rat Bastard Coalition eventually imploded, I further exploited this by forcing them to extremely harsh peace settlements, and periodically would sweep through their systems and blow up infrastructure at random. It's an awesome game, a bit rough around the edges, but the narrative is so strong."

4Xgaming,36y8bo,CrunchyGremlin,1 point,Thu May 28 13:08:38 2015 UTC,Best at what? what do you like in 4x? For full TBS galaxy view and combat... I dunno. I dont much like these games anymore. Galactic civ 2 is good. Many of those old games are good. its old though. Not ugly old but old. GalCiv3 is coming. You know TBS... uhg. I just dont want to play anymore TBS games. Lots of people think TBS is the only way to play 4x games but... Thats not my opinion. I can play Moo2 anymore. Not for long. It just make me wish it was a modern game.  For Very light rts 4x Sins is excellent. Fast or long. Multiplayer.  For a full blown 4x tbs/rts SOTS1 is pretty much best. MP designed  for drop in drop out and pickup. Variable race specific tech tree. Race specific warp drives. Been out for a long time. Very bug free and feature filled. Somewhat positional damage model and ship construction. Its a good game.   For full blown 4x pure RTS. Distant worlds is pretty good. but its on the heavy side and the graphics show its age. Its way cheaper on steam than it used to be so it should be in the library but... you got to learn it and some folks dont like that nor the graphics but... OMG options and detail. save for combat. The combat detail is old school but full rts.   I know people hate SD1. But if you can get it on sale for 8 bucks or so... Use it to benchmark where other games should be going. IMHO. Full RTS 4x with highly detailed combat and damage. There is just very little like it. Star ruler might fall into that category but i did not like the ship construction in star ruler as much as sd1.  Ideally there should be mix of sd1 and sots1 ship design or even more spore like. But not everyone likes that detail.   So it really makes a difference in what you like in a 4x.

It seems difficult for a game that has such few bugs that it can be patched in 2 months to receive such scathing reviews on launch. Generally, if even the optimistic gamers who ""want to like it"" consider it a buggy mess, it'll take a while to be fixed. But MegaGrubby's strategy is the best.  Arr.

I'm sorry that I can't tell you right now, but I'm not the one playing it from our team.   It matters, most likely, what you're looking for in a 4X. If you're looking for a straight port of MoM with all of its ""retro charm"" in a somewhat-more-modern package, you might like it. If you're looking for a more modern game, with all of the mechanics you've possibly grown to appreciate, then it's probably not for you.  However, I'm not super qualified to say any of this.

It contains fixes and enhancements to the basic game while trying to keep the game as close to vanilla as possible. Ideally you would be hard pressed to tell the difference between regular stardrive and blackbox stardrive but... things might work better in black. Might have more controls. freighters might behave more like expected. might experience less crashes. might have better game performance. And there might not be any ""might"" about it. it does a lot of these things and more. Mods can be run all from the mod directory. right click enemy planets to land troops, from troop carriers too. Fighters will return to carriers when out of ammo or badly damaged. and more.  I do a lot of work on it but im not the only one. we nixed most of the out of memory issues too. but there are still a lot of things to do before this version of the mod is ""done""  Should also check out the mod superpacks that go along with it. These are vanilla mods reformatted to work with blackbox. So you dont have to go through the hassel of installing mods manually which can be a bear. you can also switch between mods without uninstalling them and all that jazz.   small list of things... General Game Things Larger Maps. Many many crash fixes. troop management improvements. troops will autoland on planets you send them to. orbit a planet with a shift right click.  planets will auto resupply troop ships. solar system info expansion will show special resource marker and player troop counts. Large Access Aware exe to reduce out of memory issues.  money based on population rather than production. Much better ship targeting code. Reduced volume when warping and launching troops. Performance increases. more multi threading. AI ship count limiter allows the game to have more ships for the AI and adjust the ship performance load for your system. AI improvements AI will chose techs by what it needs and will choose ship techs that it can use and give it the best ship. AI will manage its troops better. AI will use more diverse fleets. AI can use carrier designs. Fighters will return to carrier when out of ammo. Fighters will more effectively return to carrier when warping. Fleets will stay together when formation warping.

4Xgaming,36ohdx,nanomage,4,Wed May 20 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"It would be nice if you could add some more information on the campaign page to increase confidence:   what state is the game in at the moment (concept, pre-alpha, alpha, beta,...) ? are you the only person working on the game full time ? how complex is the game going to be ? You say these are ""fruits of [your] labour for the past half year"" and promise delivery in December 2015 - that's not a lot of time for one person to develop a true 4X (or in your words ""it's a pretty massive undertaking for a single developer""). Have you limited the scope of the game to compensate for that ? how are you financing the rest of the game ? I can't imagine 7.500$ (assuming you only hit your goal) will get you a lot of artwork, and you will have to make a living, too. Do you have reserves/a plan for when (don't take it personal, but considering everything I have seen of game design this is when, not if) development takes longer than expected ?   This is usually the stuff I would expect to be answered in the ""Risks and Challenges"" section, and sorry but after several kickstarter disappointments ""Determination and passion can carry any project."" is not sufficient to convince me to put down money. Also, you forgot the payment fees in your budget graphs (see for example https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-in-canada)"
4Xgaming,36ohdx,csheldondante,2,Thu May 21 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"First and foremost: thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed critique.  I'll address all of your concerns:   what state is the game in at the moment...   I would describe it as pre-alpha quickly heading towards alpha.  A lot of the core features of the game, especially those relating to the espionage and battle system, are implemented (though not fully expanded).  The biggest hurdle left to be tackled is AI, as I didn't want to focus my efforts on an AI playing a still changing game.   are you the only person working on the game...   Yes and no.  I do the coding but contract out the art.   how complex is the game going to be...   I'm not entirely sure how to answer this one -- the game is certainly going to be complex, but the vast majority of complexity in 4X games comes from mathematical synergy and not from code heavy portions like complex pathfinding or advanced rendering techniques.  Clicking to move units or building structures through UI, from a coding perspective, is very straight forward.  The delivery estimate for the backer rewards is based on when I feel I can have a competent beta of the game with the backer rewards implemented, and not necessarily a perfect final release.   how are you financing the rest of the game...   This is one of the reasons I chose space as the theme.  I've been quoted $250-450 per 3D ship model because they lack the advanced rigging and animations that humanoid models require.  I've also received over forty quotes from 2D artists for the portraits and structure images, and again, they are cheaper because of the lack of animations.  As for a living wage, I have my partner of six years paying the rent while I spend my savings on this.   you forgot the payment fees in your budget graphs...   This is a fair point, but I've already paid for some of the items such as the planet UI and character concepts, so I didn't want to convolute the graph too much.  I'll see if I can come up with a better way to account for the payment processing fees.  I will definitely expand on the Risks and Challenges section.  Thank you again for taking the time."
4Xgaming,36ohdx,csheldondante,3,Thu May 21 20:47:31 2015 UTC,Hey this looks cool.   I really like the mock-up of your planet interface.  Are you doing this on your own?  Where'd you get the art for your planet structures and characters?
4Xgaming,36ohdx,csheldondante,2,Wed May 20 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"I am doing this on my own but am contracting out artists.

4Xgaming,36ohdx,DigiAirship,2,Thu May 21 03:00:24 2015 UTC,"Hello, congrats on your Kickstarter and Greenlight. The game looks very promising, and I especially like what the Espionage agents sounds like it's going to be. Hope that becomes a big, developed feature of the gameplay!   Taking place in a pre-warp era, a single planetary system is available for exploration. Each celestial body is procedurally generated but stems from seven basic types: volcanic, terrestrial, oceanic, rocky, icy, barren or jovian.   My question is: looking at this, I'm reading that the entire game will take place within 1 system, and I assume that the different factions (or whatever name they'll have) will then occupy the different planets in the system. How many planets are we looking at then, on average?"
4Xgaming,36ohdx,UnGauchoCualquiera,3,Thu May 21 03:00:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words.  Very appreciated.  The espionage system will absolutely be a deep and complex aspect of the game.  One of my favourite 4X games growing up was Star Wars Rebellion, where you could recruit Thrawn to lead your fleet or send Noval Garaint to assassinate Mon Mothma.  I'm taking inspiration from that system and amping it up.  As for your concerns about the size of the system, make sure you're including moons and asteroids in your mental image.  The size of the system is completely user defined and not all factions rely on being in the habitable zone.  Picture 4-12 planets each with 0-6 moons and dozens of asteroids lingering around the system at Lagrange points or along the outer rim.  Imagine something like Jupiter, where a few moons all look ripe for exploiting and everyone's competing for them.  So the potential for 100+ celestial bodies is absolutely playable.  With that in mind, I am trying to emphasize a smaller scale than most space 4X games, one where you emotionally attach to your colonies, ships and agents.  I've never really cared about Missile Carrier #315 being destroyed resulting in Star #97 being lost... but I care every time I lose a city in Civ."
4Xgaming,36ohdx,mainichi,2,Thu May 21 04:28:18 2015 UTC,"That's a great philosophy, I've always preferred tighter smaller maps where the macro doesn't get out of control. Good stuff!"

4Xgaming,36pr5n,hbgk10,4,Thu May 21 03:37:42 2015 UTC,"Since the vanilla launch, i've put maybe 10 hours into the game with out a single noticeable bug. I think there's still a few techs and perks that don't work as intended, and a lot of spelling mistakes, but I haven't seen anything gamebreaking since beta 6. Apparently multiplayer is still super buggy, though, but I have'nt tried it yet. If you meet the minimum requirements, and only plan on playing single player for a while, you should be fine."
4Xgaming,36pr5n,Tainlorr,2,Thu May 21 10:49:48 2015 UTC,"I have the Steam version and I managed to finish the campaign and one sandbox game on medium size galaxy.  With the campaign I had no problems, not a single crash. However, at some point in my sandbox game I was requesting constructors like crazy to a million starbases and the game kept crashing until I scaled down on the constructors. I managed to finish the game after that."
4Xgaming,36pr5n,Wojtek242,2,Thu May 21 11:32:24 2015 UTC,"Good game, very good game.  But there are balance issues. Ironically I modded the weapons XML file to change costs/strengths and they've actually made the exact same changes I did in many areas, interesting that one (There's a thread on the GC3 forums about it).  The game is Starbase mental, in part due to the addition of limited resources such as Thulium or Elerium. In GC2, mining resources were static and limited, and asteroids were mined directly (no bases), resulting in an explosion in Starbase numbers, and a reduction in performance - because now the game is dealing with 10x the number of bases it did previously in addition to everything else.  Solution? Increase starbase area of effect, or scale it with map size. Less starbases."
4Xgaming,36pr5n,iamgory,2,Thu May 21 12:08:37 2015 UTC,"increased area of effect means you must increase the min distance between star bases. once you upgrade range to +6 you can fit 12 starbases near a planet to buff it to max production. make range bigger and you will see superplanets lined with starbases  to the point you cant tell what planet is the superplanet. economic starbase stacking is what leads me to spamming starbases more than mining starbases. it would be easier in my mind to limit planets to one eco starbase a planet but hell, thats nothing to synthetic+patrotic+malevolent morale on invasion 25 planets taken over in a insane map and none of my planets are close to being under 100% approval spamming 4 pop per turn."
4Xgaming,36pr5n,AjCheeze,1 point,Tue May 26 09:19:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, though I should clarify that when I said ""increase area of effect"" I also meant ""increase starbase minimum distance separation"".  You can actually edit this in the GalCiv3Defs.xml file easily enough.  I've been working through a complete weapon & combat overhaul, modifying rates of fire, weapon damage, weapon range, combat speed, initial combat spacing, defence values & usefulness, etc. It's been quite interesting."
4Xgaming,36pr5n,iamgory,2,Tue May 26 11:17:55 2015 UTC,Yea its buggy. I've been playing for a month and each patch brings a ton of fixes and balances but I did not think the game was ready for release.

4Xgaming,36iprg,nmhunate,8,Tue May 19 18:03:50 2015 UTC,"Distant Worlds is probably my favorite 4x game of all time. Super deep real time gameplay. Can be automated. It's definitely highly regarded so check it out.  Also, if you like GalCiv then I do suggest GalCiv III but there are many on here who might disagree. I have been enjoying it immensely."
4Xgaming,36iprg,Beanchilla,3,Wed May 20 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"GalCiv III is quite good, bit for the moment it is incomplete. It was released without an espionage system (to come in dlc), a puny three mission campaign, and.... Well, it was rushed. I'd give it another few months before deciding on a reccomendation."

4Xgaming,36iprg,Byrnhildr_Sedai,1 point,Tue May 19 23:56:44 2015 UTC,What does it add? What makes it a strong choice for me?
4Xgaming,36iprg,Terkala,7,Tue May 19 23:49:27 2015 UTC,"Quite a few things. Keep in mind that SR2 is not ""an empire building simulator"". It is a war game, with war and conquest as the #1 goal of the game. The empire building mechanics are there, but the combat system is much more robust in comparison.  It's one of only two real-time-4x games (Sins of a Solar Empire being the only other one).  It has diverse warp mechanics that are really integral to gameplay. Some races have traditional jump drives. Other races have stargates. Other races have ""fling"" gates that can send ships any distance, but you have to be near the gate to start the jump. Other races have dedicated wormhole-opening-ships that leave open temporary two-way gates.  It has an interesting diplomacy system. Basically, you can generate diplo points that get you ""cards"" that you can spend on doing specific things. Like declaring an embargo on a world, or forcing a diplomatic annexation of a planet. It won't stop a military oriented race from still stomping all over you, but it gives a tangible benefit to pursuing diplomacy resources.  The ship designer is really complex, but in a good way. You can build ships any way you want, but you don't have to spend a ton of time on it if you don't want to. The ships also scale up or down as far as you'd like. You can build swarms of tiny beamships if you want, or you can get to the mid-game and decide that you want to have a few huge support-beamships, and just dial the ""tiny beamship"" design up to size 100.  Planets and asteroids are not stationary hunks of rock as in most games. You can actually haul asteroids and planets around. Some races can even throw planets from one starsystem to another using their warp tech. This opens up a whole new level of strategy in terms of protecting your systems. I've seen MP games where people declare war just to steal profitable asteroids away with tractor ships.  And finally, the whole game can be played in a 3 hour sitting. Which is not something any other 4x game (other than Sins) can do."
4Xgaming,36iprg,Beanchilla,6,Wed May 20 01:08:58 2015 UTC,Distant Worlds is also a real time 4x space game and it has a much larger scope than Star Ruler or Sins.
4Xgaming,36iprg,Terkala,3,Wed May 20 03:14:36 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, I should have included a mention.  I mentally put it into another subgenre all of it on, because while it seems similar to a lot of other 4x games on the surface, it's so alive and complex that it really is more of a simulation game than a strategy game."

What I did was watch a couple of hours of basic videos just to get used to the UI and basic premise of the game.  After that, I jumped straight into one of Larry Monte's playthroughs. The key here is that he plays everything with complete manual control. Schedule a couple of afternoons/evenings and watch his main playthrough from the beginning, don't skip through anything, and everything starts to gradually make sense. After that it's easier to figure out what parts to automate if you want, but the important thing is to understand what is being automated to begin with."

4Xgaming,36iprg,Byrnhildr_Sedai,1 point,Wed May 20 22:06:54 2015 UTC,"What does the tech tree/development and empire-y building work like(roughly compared to Sins, Civ4/5, or GalCiv2).  Thanks for the right up. :) I'll add it to my steam wish list and wait till I have money again.(Totally just ordered expansion packs to Eclipse >.>)"
4Xgaming,36iprg,KaiserTom,6,Wed May 20 01:21:08 2015 UTC,"The tech tree is rather simple, you have a bunch of techs interleaved together in a web and a bunch of basic starting points on this web. All techs can take research points but a lot of techs can take an alternative resource such as money or energy (if you research with RP you will instead receive money and energy as reward). This allows you to blast through early parts of the tech tree when you get large enough in order to reach the techs that really matter at that stage.  What is really unique is the Empire management. Instead of being able to develop every planet to a high status like in other games, you instead focus your empire and it's resources into a few planets to develop them. So to get a planet from level 0 to level 1 you need to take over two other planets, one with food and one with water and export them to that first planet. Now to get it to level 2 you need another food and a level 1 resource (from a level 1 planet, which needs food and water from two level 0 planets itself), and so om and so forth until the powerhouse planets of level 5. As you may imagine you end up with a giant web of trade routes from your undeveloped food worlds through your industrial resource worlds all leading back into your main world, whatever you choose that to be. Each planet along that path becomes cruicial, if you go for the bare minimum requirements your entire empire can collapse if the enemy takes over one of your food worlds at the end of the chain (though you are given a nice buffer of time to take it back). It's a very unique mechanic only present in one other fame, Emporer of the Fading Suns, and I am glad to see it make a return.  On the subject of planetary buildings, while you can build certain imperial buildings on your planets (for a hefty maintenance cost), your main income buildings will actually come from civilians building their own buildings based on what resources you are importing into your world, the ""pressure"" mechanic. So say you have a level 5 planet with a bunch of money resources being imported into it. Those resources will generate money pressure on the planet and your civilians will build nothing but market buildings and generate money for your empire. Or you can pump research resources into the planet and have them build a bunch of labs to generate RP for you. Or any combination of the 5 resources and have them build a variety of buildings. Very unique and very deep strategy without it being heavy on the micro management like Gal Civ or MoO2 could be."
4Xgaming,36iprg,Terkala,3,Wed May 20 04:35:17 2015 UTC,"The tech tree is relatively simple. Get enough points and you can queue up research for +20% ship health or +500 credits per budget cycle (basically income). There are also component unlocks.  So R&D is pretty similar to Sins. But it's certainly the weakest point of the game overall since it is mostly a bunch of passive buffs between the key R&D techs that really change gameplay (artificial planets, self destruct devices, liquid armor, ect).  Empire building is setting up a tech chain. Tier 0 worlds produce resources (food/water) that you can export to other worlds. Tier 1 worlds require two resources (food and water) to produce their tier 1 good. Tier 2 worlds require a tier 1 world's resource and more food to produce their resource. And so on.  No worlds produce anything Tier 4 and Tier 5 though, those are simply worlds with a lot of stuff exported to them that become huge centers of your economy.  You can also sacrifice income in exchange for more food/water (by building hydroponics farms and water condensers). This lets you get more high tier resources, in exchange for less net income. Helpful if you don't have a good distribution of food/water worlds.  You can also build structures on the worlds. Mostly these are a way to specialize your world into heavier production or bump up the number of resources the planet can utilize. It's all tile based though. So I'd say it's a vastly simplified form of city building similar to GalCiv, Don't expect to spend a lot of time setting up colony screens. Most can be queued up in 10-20 seconds."

4Xgaming,36h264,Dozed12,4,Tue May 19 11:48:14 2015 UTC,"of the fairly recent offerings:  galactic civ 3 fits most of what you're looking for: turn based, multiple victory conditions, nice graphics.  not much in tactics though.  space battles are cinematic.  it's all strategy.  star ruler 2, you give up turns and multiple victory conditions but get some minor tactics in exchange.  also good if you enjoy spending hours creating ship designs and testing them in an arena.  star drive 2, you give up multiple victory conditions, but get minor tactical control (but real time space battles) and an awful turn based ground combat.  i hear good things about distant worlds, but don't know much about it.  for an older title, i believe endless space fits all of your criteria: turn based, multiple victory conditions, nice graphics and space battles in 3 phases where you select (rock/paper/scissors like) tactic for each phase."
4Xgaming,36h264,tomassavage,1 point,Tue May 19 17:50:23 2015 UTC,"Distant Worlds is probably the grandest 4x game I have ever played, so massive it's actually intimidating. The map/galaxy/universe has hundreds if not thousands star systems, each with multiple planets, some even have moons and asteroid belts. Hundreds of resources that actually affect certain functions. Dozens of factions to compete against, and I might be wrong but I think this is the game where minor factions grow into major factions if left unchecked. So many different types of leaders -'fleet admirals, ground generals, governors, ambassadors, scientists, agents, all with numerous skills.   This, more than any other game, made me feel like the emperor of a massive, space-faring civilization. I was blown away by the scale of this game  However, one big note to the OP: it is real time, although you can pause it any time you like, and the graphics aren't exactly stellar.

4Xgaming,36h264,MegaGrubby,2,Tue May 19 14:20:51 2015 UTC,Copy and paste since a very similar question was asked yesterday....  I believe overall ratings from steam reviews are about the best source. These 3 games were recently released...   a bit under 76% like Star Ruler 2 a bit under 74% like Galactic Civilizations III 68% like StarDrive 2   GC3 is dropping a percent or two a day so it may be a while until the ratings settle...  SR2 is real time and the other two are turn based. SR2 may fit your request because it is more of a high level game (fleet battles instead of ship to ship battles as an example)

The races were very different and would get different tech trees generated for them every game. The battles are small real time tactics engagements, but you can auto complete too. You design your own ships and it takes some actual thought to put together a functional fleet. There are also unique galactic 'unknown menace' events that come up and force all the empires to react. Something like a super powerful AI ship will show up and start attacking everyone and you have to either sacrifice dozens of ships to fight it or wait and hope someone else deals with it."

As a sidenote, it's all 2D sprites so they haven't aged as poorly as early 3D.  Also, MOO2 has more space combat micro / detail than many 4x games in the current era."

4Xgaming,36eehy,tomassavage,1 point,Tue May 19 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"Pretty soon we will be showing more of the 4X features in the game but we would like to wait for our beta launch so we can do so with videos or gifs.  What about the cards puts you off of the game? I know without playing it's difficult to say but anything you can think of would help. There are also going to be different aspects from most card games, for instance instead of random packs of cards there will be pre-set expansion sets you can get. For example maybe a pack of stealth mechanics, or sector cards, that cuts out the randomness that I know some people dislike when getting into card games."
4Xgaming,36eehy,MayhemMike,2,Tue May 19 20:44:39 2015 UTC,"the specific reason is that i'm not a fan of the genre.  don't like the pack sorting, hunting for rare cards, the randomness, microtransactions, etc.  every 'card' game i've tried i only load up once and never again.  the only card-type game i've enjoyed and come back to was acromage."
4Xgaming,36eehy,GalaRaz,2,Wed May 20 00:06:30 2015 UTC,Same here. For me every card game feels like an incomplete experience. Either because of the limited deck size (imagine playing any 4x game with just a 10th of its content) or because 1/3 of the complete game idea was packed into separate dlc packs instead of delivering the full thing and THEN trying to expand on it.
4Xgaming,36eehy,tomassavage,1 point,Wed May 20 08:43:12 2015 UTC,"Fair enough however this game won't have any random card hunting, it is an expandable game, not a collectible one. A better compare would be the LCG line from FFG if you are familiar?"

So before the game you pick everything you want in your deck and your side (tech) pool (Deck Construction). Then over the course of a game you can acquire cards from your side (tech) pool (Deck Building).  Edit - Also, we do have quite a bit of inspiration from many games, where would we be if we weren't fans ourselves :)"

How do you think we are doing so far? We would love to hear from the 4X fans on how it's progressing
4Xgaming,36eehy,JohnLeafback,1 point,Mon May 18 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"Although there's many things to be wary(as in, that it might not be as great as expected) of when a developer mentions he's combining 4X with deck building, I think I'm a bit more wary that the homepage shows a tablet.  Does this mean it's going to be a mobile game? Not saying that's bad, but if you look into Civilization: Starships, you'll know that many might be wary of that.  But then again, I'm thinking that card games aren't bad on tablets, so I kinda hope they balance each other out. I think I'll wait to see where this goes, before getting my hype all smashed up :D"

4Xgaming,36df69,Eraser1024,9,Mon May 18 14:34:49 2015 UTC,The Firaxis business model.  I've learned the hard way (Civ 5) not to buy their games until after a couple of expansions and a deep discount. Shameful marketing.
4Xgaming,36df69,PseudoElite,7,Mon May 18 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, CiV was pretty awful at release, but at least it was very different from Civ 4 (well, okay, at the time that was a bad thing).  It was short on interesting systems but the main problem was just the balance and oversimplification.  Civ:BE had no excuse, though.  It had access to an engine that had been developed on for years, and therefore needed way less actual work done compared to vanilla civ.  So, there should've been enough development time to implement loads of interesting features,  regardless of whether the end product still ended up feeling stale.  Even with the features proposed in this expansion, it's still going to fall pretty short of being much more than a mod."
4Xgaming,36df69,cerzi,9,Mon May 18 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"I am not disagreeing with you at all, you're completely right.  I personally never fell in love with Civ 5 no matter how hard I tried (over 100 hours played on all expansions). It's a decent game, but it never made me fall in love like Civ 4.   I won't bother with Civ: BE at all unless something extraordinary happens, and this is coming from a huge alpha centauri fan."
4Xgaming,36df69,PseudoElite,6,Mon May 18 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"While you are waiting, try Age of Wonders 3. I recently bought it and I love it.

4Xgaming,36df69,thiosk,2,Sun May 24 15:32:24 2015 UTC,"http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=253775  You might wanna give this mod a go in the meantime for Civ4. It's a Total Conversion mod, bringing the gameplay of Civ4 into Alpha Centuri/Beyond Earth style of lore. And unlike Beyond Earth, factions in Planetfall feel unique. For example, one faction from the beginning is able to build cities on water (and thus improvments as well). No other faction can do that from the start unless they research the required tech (mid to late game). Also, instead of the barbarian style of aliens in BE, Planetfall has this fauna looking aliens that are not easy to get rid of. IIRC, if you go full industrial/trying to harm the planet route, there might be an instance where if you have a very large empire (your Capital is like very deep in the central part of the empire), random fauna spawns can happen next to your capital city itself."
4Xgaming,36df69,Draakon0,1 point,Mon May 18 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"Civ V was a game with a huge amount of heart - that feeling of popping those first ruins, the woosh of uncovering new land, the dozens of interesting and unique units.  Civ BE promised a lot, quoting sci-fi, landing on a new planet, a great opening video. But the short clips of text that actually showed you this new universe (the ""wonders"" that are bonuses with a meaningless picture don't do any of that) were underwhelming. Choose an art style for your units and go with it. Yay."
4Xgaming,36df69,CptBigglesworth,0,Tue May 19 08:01:05 2015 UTC,"Civ:BE had no excuse, though.   It had every excuse. It wasn't made by the same people -- they just inherited stuff.   It feels like the Civ franchise is being used as a spawning pool for Firaxis, maybe in search of new talent. They seem to prefer newbies to design their games instead of veterans.   As a consequence, games are extremely lacking on release but get a couple of new ideas which may or may not work. Then they call the veterans to clean up the mess with expansions.  And this is the best I can assume. The worst is they're milking it for all it's got."
4Xgaming,36df69,crasher_pt,9,Mon May 18 21:36:48 2015 UTC,"""Rising Tide""  The name led me to think - could it possibly mean that they're going to finally implement climate change, like Alpha Centauri did once? That would be so fun!  Of course not."

4Xgaming,36df69,Kirkus23,17,Sun May 24 15:34:17 2015 UTC,"I played Civ:BE on the free weekend a little while ago, and about 2-3 hours into it on Sunday, I said ""screw it"" and I just played Alpha Centauri and it was glorious. It was amazing how forgettable everything was about it.    The factions were flavorless.  I can't remember the bland units.  The ""alien"" aspect just kind of felt like Starship troopers.   In contrast AC had   Memorable, Idologically unique factions with deep backstories. Insanely configurable units (Orbital drop troops? Submersible aircraft carriers that lauched helicopters?) Mind worms were nightmare fuel."

4Xgaming,36df69,thiosk,4,Tue May 19 00:22:23 2015 UTC,"I think there's still some measure of untapped potential with BE. Hopefully, they'll tap it with this and maybe a few other DLC's. BE did capture my interest in the first few hours of me playing it. There was something about that initial touchdown on the planet and then going from there. If they can really just go back to what made AC great, they can do something with BE. Expanding on affinities is definitely the right direction."

4Xgaming,36df69,Etnos,4,Mon May 18 17:06:03 2015 UTC,"Its interesting because people really want this game to be SMAC (understandably) yet the developers are really going in another direction. The leaders in SMAC already knew what they wanted humanities' future to look like, that was part of their personalities, but that wouldn't work with the affinity system. For instance, it just wouldn't make sense for Gaia's Stepdaughters to be anything besides harmony. BE wants you to be able to customize every aspect of your civilization, with the side effect that every civilization feels the same. Hopefully the new deplomancey system will allow the player and AI's to develop interesting personalities for thier leaders as the game goes on."

It features the save/load ability you're looking for.  And as long as the universe you generate isn't obnoxiously huge, you shouldn't have any issues.  I've heard plenty of people state that the game can become sluggish with large amounts of people or in particularly large galaxies, but I've never had a problem with extended 4-player sessions.  In fact, played plenty of them.  Great 4x game, and depending on the skill of the players, you should probably expect a game to take around 1-2 hours."
4Xgaming,36e7oh,Ophidios,1 point,Mon May 18 18:45:34 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah I've played SoSE and really liked it but it's harder to sell my friends on it compared to SotS since SotS seems more similar to what they've played, and is cheaper on sales ($2 vs $10)."
4Xgaming,36e7oh,Terkala,2,Mon May 18 19:57:09 2015 UTC,"SotS is ""really"" long in multiplayer. You can have games that take over 20 hours in multiplayer.  Sins of a solar empire multiplayer can be completed in a single long afternoon."
4Xgaming,36e7oh,MilitaryDivination,2,Tue May 19 01:15:37 2015 UTC,"How stable/bug-free is the online multiplayer in SotS1 for ~4 people?   Perfectly functional. Do keep in mind that you can only use direct connect though, since the original service is defunct.   does the game lend itself well to multiplayer?    It does, although one of its best features is the combat, and you'll be autoresolving a LOT of combat with 4 player multi.   For example, is there an option to save and load the game later?    Yes, and you can take over computer players and replace any number of human players with AI when you load, too.   How long does a game of SotS last?   Anywhere between a few to a few hundred hours, depending on map size and shape, starting settings, and whether or not someone triggers a machine rebellion. With ""standard"" settings for 4 human players only on a small-ish map and fairly decisive battles, you're looking at a few dozen hours.  Star Ruler 2 is completely different beast to Civ. It's real time, for one, and the mechanics yield themselves to quick expansion and conflict, since you need to continuously expand to gain resources required to grow your colonies."
4Xgaming,36e7oh,MilitaryDivination,1 point,Mon May 18 19:09:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the info, that sounds pretty good! Can the combat be spectated? Although it's not a big deal, it would be a plus for us if 2 players could spectate while the other 2 are fighting."

4Xgaming,36bw8w,old_and_lame,4,Mon May 18 03:21:25 2015 UTC,Do you like war? Paradox's Europa series would work. What about the political dynasties? Alliances and assassination? Crusader kings.  Fantasy? Age of wonders 3 is good. Space? Galactic civ or the stars. Playing online multiplayer is really what you probably need though. AI only gets you so far.
4Xgaming,36bw8w,bobniborg,2,Mon May 18 04:38:45 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I'm mostly OK with the limitations of AI. My preference for 40-hour matches limits the multiplayer potential. Plus I tend to play ""part-time"" - study or workout for 15 minutes, then play for 15 minutes, ad nauseum.  Crusader Kings was the game I was looking into the most due to it being referenced around reddit so much, but decided against. I don't think the internal, dynastic focus would hold my attention. I prefer the more external go-forth-and-explore/conquer concept.  EU IV is one I should probably look at closer, next. Haven't done much more than go through its media on the Steam store. I'm assuming it'll be a static map, but I could be swayed if there is decent diplomatic and military interplay. That is a scary-big chunk of DLC for it... Humble Bundle is doing a Paradox bundle currently, might be worth it as a ""sampler pack"" even with most of the extras missing.  Thanks for your input!"
4Xgaming,36bw8w,Familion,3,Mon May 18 07:01:34 2015 UTC,"I'd second EU IV since it offers massive diversity in gameplay. But there is one potentially major caveat: You can't really win. Both EU IV and CK 2 are essentially big sandboxes where much of the enjoyment comes from expanding your realm and ""breaking history"". So like with every sandbox you won't have the satisfaction of a victory screen, you're totally dependent on achieving self-imposed goals.  Btw, don't get intimidated by the amount of DLC. Most of it is fluff like portraits which adds flavour but has no bearing on gameplay."
4Xgaming,36bw8w,bobniborg,1 point,Mon May 18 14:38:42 2015 UTC,"Good to hear about the DLC. I thought it might in a similar boat as Civ: ""You could choose to play the base game, but you could also choose to hit your thumb with a hammer, and neither seems like a great idea.""  I watched an ""Intro to EU IV"" type video, and while I don't think it will scratch my exact itch, it does seem to have other bonuses: I ended up cruising wikipedia articles about a few kings."
4Xgaming,36bw8w,Flater420,2,Mon May 18 17:40:26 2015 UTC,I never really got into EU4.  It sites on my HD until I can properly learn to play it.  My kids eat up too much time LOL so I go for the simpler now.  Most diplomacy I have seen is less than ideal on wargames because it can usually be easily manipulated.  You might want to find a good play by email game.  People send the turn back and forth as they can.  Games go on forever but you can have multiple ones going at once.
4Xgaming,36bw8w,Xerberus886,2,Mon May 18 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"Fantasy? Age of wonders 3 is good.   IMHO, Endless Legend is better. The only thing AoW has on EL is its more complex tactical battles. If you don't mind having less control over the battlefield during conflicts (since OP comes from Civ, I'm assuming he's indifferent since Civ doesn't have it), I'd suggest EL. AoW has lineage, and while AoW 3 isn't particularly bad, it feels older (and clunkier IMO) than it should."

4Xgaming,36bw8w,MilitaryDivination,2,Mon May 18 07:21:11 2015 UTC,Be warned that DW:U is as much a simulation as it is a player driven game. Uncontrollable AI takes priority in many scenarios.  Also...age spanning - no (pre faster than light is pretty much a gimmick...no stages after that); many map options - yes; multiple win conditions - yes (military and research?); best at everything possible - yes; difficult the entire game - yes; wonky AI diplomacy - yes.
4Xgaming,36bw8w,MegaGrubby,1 point,Mon May 18 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"Uncontrollable AI takes priority   Over what? The private sector is the private sector, everything else can be set to manual and the game enforces it well, unless you dun goof and overlook a setting. It's only a simulation if you let it play itself.   wonky AI diplomacy - yes   Yes, though it becomes less baffling when you get to know how each race tends to act based on their traits and cycles."
4Xgaming,36bw8w,Azkik,1 point,Mon May 18 16:21:41 2015 UTC,"Over what you choose to do and what you set via the game options. Fleet movements, building things on planets, upgrading ships, etc...pretty much everywhere. Full manual is the only way you can avoid a LOT of AI overrides.  My full review here"
4Xgaming,36bw8w,MilitaryDivination,2,Mon May 18 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"I've not encountered any of those problems since turning off automation of nearly everything (except ship design) about 80 hours in.

4Xgaming,36bw8w,MegaGrubby,1 point,Mon May 18 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what full manual means."
4Xgaming,36bw8w,MilitaryDivination,0,Mon May 18 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"Considering the fact that a HUGE selling point of this game is ""play it your way"" when in reality, full manual is the only way to ""play your way"",  people need to be warned. A full manual game will take hundreds of hours and is more detail than a lot of people seek in a game."
4Xgaming,36bw8w,MegaGrubby,1 point,Mon May 18 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"It really isn't.  You'll find that approaching the game from full manual (which is a good learning approach as well) and then automating what you want yields exactly the expected result. Trying to control the game manually when the automation AI is running does not.   A full manual game will take hundreds of hours   So can a fully automated game. Game length is a function of map settings, difficulty (including the number of opponents), and the player's familiarity with the interface and mechanics. I can play a game to completion in ten hours on full manual, I can also play a week-long campaign on mostly (or even full) auto."
4Xgaming,36bw8w,MilitaryDivination,-2,Mon May 18 18:46:39 2015 UTC,Now your fanboy is showing through. There is no way a completely manual game is anywhere close to as quick as one that has some parts automated. I have a shitload of time into the game. I understand it and my perspective is fair and factual.
4Xgaming,36bw8w,MegaGrubby,1 point,Mon May 18 19:13:29 2015 UTC,"Now your fanboy is showing through. There is no way a completely manual game is anywhere close to as quick as one that has some parts automated.   Again, automation has little to to with game length. Having a thousand more star systems is going to add more length to a game than removing or increasing automation.   I have a shitload of time into the game. I understand it    If you have tons of hours into the game, you do understand that you can play it much more efficiently on manual, effectively cutting down the game length with (among other things) quicker expansion and more decisive wars."
4Xgaming,36bw8w,Dozed12,-2,Mon May 18 19:16:50 2015 UTC,"You are full of crap.

I watched an introductory ""Let's Play"" vid, and it seems to avoid my biggest Civ gripes. I.e., it looks like you need to focus on specific technologies, rather than researching every tech, every game. Also, the different races seem to have significant gameplay differences, such as different resource focus.  Does that pan out in actual gameplay? Or is it a case of ""Well, you could research different techs, but this one set of techs is best regardless of race or desired victory condition?"""
4Xgaming,36bw8w,mjquigley,2,Mon May 18 17:56:16 2015 UTC,"There is a distinct 'build order' of techs and improvements at the very beginning, but it gets pretty open as you go along, depending mostly on the map and other factions.  And yes, the different races are very different from each other. More so than you would expect. One faction doesn't eat. Another needs to kill to expand. Another uses magic. Another can only ever have one city. They also each get a quest which explains their plot, introduces their key gameplay elements, and can be brought to completion for a faction-specific victory.  Endless Legend is very strong in its themes, and has well done mechanics to boot. Its problems come from wonky combat and a prety, but not fantastically ergonomic UI design."

4Xgaming,369ov2,Cheese_slamwich,8,Sun May 17 17:29:17 2015 UTC,I'm finishing my second game.  Feels like Civilization 4. Could be better with some addons and technical problems are obvious but it's best entry into the series so far.
4Xgaming,369ov2,Ilitarist,5,Sun May 17 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"I just bought it a few days before release, and I'm really enjoying it. However, I have no interest in MP and I understand there are shortcomings to MP that are troublesome. For starters, not being able to use custom civs and few public games.   As far as SP goes, there are still some issues that hopefully will be addressed. Considering the long and public beta, it's disappointing that they haven't been. For example, sometimes when you hover over your fleet or individual units it won't show you how many moves are left. It will show you a popup with info, and sometimes the moves are there - but sometimes they are not.  Other weird little quirks like that that aren't really a big deal but are annoying in a big project like this.  Still would recommend, if GCII is any indication there'll be years of growth and improvement for it."
4Xgaming,369ov2,pdxsean,2,Sun May 17 17:43:58 2015 UTC,I believe overall ratings from steam reviews are about the best source.    a bit over 76% like GC3 a bit under 76% like SR2 68% like SD2   I'd give it more time before the overall number for GC3 is right   edit: GC3 is now under 75%...

The only thing I dislike is that after I eliminate all pirates near my planet, I don't have anything to fight and there is no diplomatic tensions at the moment at all.  So I try to fix this problem by creating 3 super aggressive AI custom races and add to my universe, I hope they will bring some excitement to my game now."
4Xgaming,369ov2,Silent-Viper,1 point,Mon May 18 01:19:02 2015 UTC,Pirates spawn again. You probably have to expand quicker or set smaller maps.  In my last game pirates destroyed 2 of my colonizers. Argh those pirates.
4Xgaming,369ov2,Ilitarist,2,Mon May 18 08:02:18 2015 UTC,"Played two games so far (a small and medium) and am loving it - but there are some glaring balance issues, and the late-game feels a bit bland in terms of awesome planet-crushing tech.    Also there's a load of information missing from the UI that feels like it really ought to be there (like not showing the number of moves a fleet has remaining)."
4Xgaming,369ov2,cerzi,2,Mon May 18 15:34:21 2015 UTC,"I'm loving it so far. Unlike the way I normally play, I tried my first game without building a military beyond a few small sentry ships to deal with pirates so far. My military power seems to be around the level of a minor race, but my economy is #1.  I've made an alliance with the local big kid on the block and made a bunch of trade routes, as well as an economic treaty to make sure they never turn on me. So far nothing bad has happened to me, and I'm very advanced as well, because I keep decent relations with other races and buy techs from them often with my powerhouse economy."
4Xgaming,369ov2,ti0tr,4,Tue May 19 10:32:05 2015 UTC,"I like it, but too many concepts are unexplained (even in the manual). It's just a dumbed down version of galciv 2, which was great. I'm not really enjoying it.  Unlike everyone else my performance has been great."
4Xgaming,369ov2,readitour,3,Sun May 17 21:55:37 2015 UTC,Why do you say it's dumbed down? It's more complex in every way except they didn't add espionage.

I like the tech trees, I think diplomacy is really well thought out. Finding a great planet and racing to colonize it feels great every time.  I do think combat is pretty plain, it's mostly just checking stats and smashing stacked fleets against one another. The battle viewer I find better than most but it's still something I'll skip most of the time.  Campaign's story is straight forward so far but it's a great introduction, definitely helped me get more comfortable in the sandbox mode.   I've been bouncing between Distant worlds and Age of Wonders for a while, this game definitely doesn't out do either but stands on it's own which is good. I really enjoy it.   I thought the ""range"" mechanics were going to drive me crazy but now that I'm playing it I think that's the only way to make them work without everyone stomping on each other early on.  The only drawback is I am starting to feel like I've seen most of the surprises this game holds and that's too bad. Still, very solid and a lot of fun."
4Xgaming,369ov2,Beanchilla,1 point,Tue May 19 01:50:20 2015 UTC,"A lot of people gripe about the diplomacy which I can understand, it's hard to tell if it's completely broken, or just needs some tuning.  I managed to hit another civ hard, took out almost their entire military, blew up all of their shipyards and managed to take their home planet. I didn't want to wipe them out as I had expended a lot of effort and resources and wanted to shift my focus back to building up infrastructure and research as the early aggression put me in a rather precarious position. I offer them a peace deal, try to get some tech, a contested mining base, and a colony...nope. Ok how about I take some tech and the mining base...nope. You guys do realize I can literally erase you from existence in the next few turns so how about you just give me the mining base...nope! You have next to no military, and I have two massive fleets parked in your final system, you do realize this war is over so how about we just settle on the peace deal...nope! It reminded me a lot of the awful diplomatic AI Civ 5 had where you would wipe out another civs entire army, take several key cities and they still had the nerve to demand that you gave up several of your cities to end a war they had no chance in hell at winning.  So I wiped the petulant fuckers out, they gave me no choice. It was stupid, and it was frustrating. I realize that if I can just stave off another war long enough to tech up and strengthen my position I could become the scourge of the galaxy in short order...apparently the AI realized this too and the two largest civs declared war and crippled my empire forcing me to retire the game. So the AI was smart enough to realize that I would quickly become a problem, but not smart enough to realize that fighting an unwinnable war would lead to certain doom, I don't get it."

4Xgaming,364udo,datlurkerdude,5,Sat May 16 03:51:17 2015 UTC,One important thing to remember is that the more stationary fleet will always be at a disadvantage. This is because more of the moving fleet will be in range for initial volleys. And the moving fleet will all be facing the correct direction toward the stationary fleet.  Try it yourself. Two identical fleets. The one that is moving toward the other will almost always (95%) win.

This is a good thing in some ways, since II was one of the best 4x games of all time, but extremely frustrating in others (constructor grinding? still a bitch. the same music? somehow, yes) The maps can get HUGE. Like, 'no way can my laptop play this past turn 50' huge.  Combat now includes an optional Endless Space-style cinematic view, which looks nice but seems kind of inconsequential. The battles are still based on the same rock/paper/scissors formula.  I love the new planet types and resources, which give the galaxy a lot more flavor. Star names are still incredibly stupid, and have gotten even dumber thanks to player submissions. It crashes a lot. HOWEVER, I'm willing to blame that on my computer, which is on the very low end of PCs that meet the minimum requirements. I haven't heard any widespread outcry about this, which makes me think you'll be fine if you have a better computer than I do.   Overall, I'd say it depends on how much you liked GalCiv II. I have zero regrets even with the issues above, but if you're less willing to overlook the negatives, you may want to wait."
4Xgaming,35ys6b,ronyseikaly,5,Fri May 15 02:01:04 2015 UTC,"Does it still have a decent amount of humor.  One of my favorite things about GalCiv II was the clever text on many of the technologies and diplomacy interactions, is it similar in this game?"

Make sure to read the reports on the new minor races you run into - they're easy to miss but surprisingly interesting and funny."
4Xgaming,35ys6b,ronyseikaly,3,Fri May 15 07:56:41 2015 UTC,"It's very humorous so far. I've seen a few shots at Civilization. The gibberish before you get Universal Translator is still there. Some of the buildings are obviously cheesy on purpose such as the ""preparedness center."""

As long as I don't have to produce them through the ship yard and route them, I'm fine."
4Xgaming,35ys6b,EasymodeX,9,Mon May 18 15:10:59 2015 UTC,"My impression so far: it's very similar to GalCiv 2 overall, but I haven't played nearly enough to know exactly how much has changed in practice. Every change I've noticed so far has been an improvement, and I'm enjoying the game a ton. So the short answer is yes, I think it's worth the asking price.  The adjacency bonus mechanic for planetary improvements is a relatively simple but awesome and impactful change IMO - in GalCiv2 it took a single glance at a new planet to know exactly how I wanted to build it, and pretty much all my worlds were either high pop worlds with income/approval/food buildings, pure production worlds with all factories, or pure research worlds with all research labs (and 1-2 factories early-midgame until they're built up enough and/or have enough starbase support to keep my labs up to date without them). Maybe I'm just still a scrub, but I find myself tempted to build more complex hybrid worlds in GalCiv 3 - when I find a 300% bonus tile for a building type I normally wouldn't want on a planet that size, I'm tempted to build 2-3 more of those buildings nearby to stack adjacency bonuses. Add in random planetwide bonuses/maluses and some new/altered building choices (TBH it's been too long since I played GalCiv 2 for me to be sure exactly what's new and what's the same but it ""feels"" like a fair amount is new or different), and the builder side of the game seems to call for a bit more thought, which is certainly a good thing. All because building a farm next to a farm makes them both slightly better... Who'd'a thunk?  I also really like the orbital shipyards that can be sponsored by multiple planets, with a fairly wide range (but with some production lost in transit for faraway planets). The most obvious effect is that you don't have to build pure factory worlds to be able to build big ships in a reasonable amount of time - you can have moderate productive output from five different planets routed to a single shipyard to build one ship at a time instead of building five ships at a time but taking forever to finish any of them. This is a problem that even the venerable Civ series suffered from - building units the same way you build static 'buildings' feels kind of awkward and artificial. Shipyards are an elegant solution. What makes them even cooler is that, later on in the game, it means you can attack enemy shipyards to try and stall their military production, and you have to defend your own shipyards from attack. I like that this part of warfare is now separate from taking over planets. Shipyards can move (albeit slowly), which adds another layer to the strategy and tactics of warfare. You can even move them closer to the front lines when invading enemy territory, although the distance penalties make it a costly option.  Two of the biggest new features have nothing to do with the game mechanics per se: multiplayer and mod support. Haven't touched either yet, but they're the reason I'm already pretty much convinced I'll get more value and enjoyment out of this purchase than I did out of its predecessor. I played GalCiv2 obsessively for a year or two, but without the enormous mod scenes of other popular 4Xes and without human opponents to present new challenges, it eventually got old. If GC3 has a healthy community for mods and MP, it could be my go-to 4X for years to come."
4Xgaming,35ys6b,solistus,1 point,Fri May 15 05:02:26 2015 UTC,"All because building a farm next to a farm makes them both slightly better... Who'd'a thunk?   Yeah I didn't play prior GalCivs, but the adjacency mechanic is definitely interesting.  It seems like the tech tree gets subdivided between ""core"" structures (e.g. Factory upgrades into bigger badder Factory) and then supplemental structures and their own line (e.g. Solar Plant 1-per-colony Factory that seems to have higher multipliers at certain tech levels).  The adjacency mechanic makes terraforming choices fairly interesting and the use of the ""capitol tiles"" interesting as well.  If the planet is a research planet, it seems best to dump all the research labs away from the capitol, and use the capitol tiles for supplemental buildings (farms, entertainment center, factory), since those tiles do not buff the capitol tile itself -- the bonus is only ""one-way""."

I'm about to fire it up to see what changes and features they've implemented since beta 6, and I'm so damn excited to get into a game.

4Xgaming,35ys6b,MiracleWhippit,4,Sat May 16 22:16:47 2015 UTC,I played for a few hours tonight.  My review so far is simple: Addicting!
4Xgaming,35ys6b,dhivuri,1 point,Fri May 15 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of GalCiv 3's map. There isn't much to do with it. Exploration is limited to go system to system and maybe find anomalies. Exploitation is limited to 5 types of resources. Asteroids and nebula serve little purpose.  I feel like the map altogether lacks character, somehow. The systems are all the same (and the silly star names!), the planets too.  However this is only one part of the game and I can't really judge the rest yet."
4Xgaming,35ys6b,EasymodeX,1 point,Thu May 14 23:23:37 2015 UTC,"Asteroids and nebula serve little purpose.   Asteroids are like mountains and nebula are like water.  Geographical blocks to inhibit enemy ships from beelining your territory.  Also makes for soft chokepoints.  Aside from that I agree that the overall map layout is lacking ... something.  Probably would help to make each star system more clear on the map.  Currently the map seems like a ""wall of text"", and by text I mean random scattered space objects (stars/planets/terrain/anomalies).  There's not enough organization in its presentation."
4Xgaming,35ys6b,dhivuri,1 point,Mon May 18 15:05:02 2015 UTC,"There are too few asteroids and nebulas for their purpose, though. Maybe I should increase their frequency in the options.  Maybe more structure to the systems, ie orbital lines, would go a long way to give the map more charm. Then again though, it's space, so it's hard to find something to put there!"
4Xgaming,35ys6b,EasymodeX,1 point,Mon May 18 16:19:02 2015 UTC,"There are too few asteroids and nebulas for their purpose, though. Maybe I should increase their frequency in the options.   I played a game last night on a small map with otherwise default options -- it seemed fine and helped narrow down enemy approach vectors, although it's RNG so /shrug.   Maybe more structure to the systems, ie orbital lines, would go a long way to give the map more charm. Then again though, it's space, so it's hard to find something to put there!   Yeah I made a QoL suggestions post on the official forums but I couldn't think of a good suggestion for that particular topic.  The only thing that occured to me is to simply add more space, e.g. empty space, between each solar system in the map generator.  Any visual indicator of ""which solar system is which"" would simply make the map more congested than it currently is.  But if the solar systems were simply further away from each other ... things would be clearer for sure.  That would have other gameplay impacts though so ... not likely to happen, but maybe."

4Xgaming,35y863,mainichi,2,Thu May 14 14:43:30 2015 UTC,So should I be getting Star Ruler 2 or Gal Civ 3?
4Xgaming,35y863,FalseTautology,2,Thu May 14 22:54:30 2015 UTC,"Two really different ways of doing things, even within the same genre.  The ideal answer would be both :D But if you were picking one, I'd say look through some let's plays, (Quill18, for example, has videos on both) and decide on the style you're into :D  Personal answer: GalCiv 3 has more of a stable, tried-and-tested, traditional feel; Star Ruler 2 more edgy, but nonetheless deep and engaging gameplay systems."
4Xgaming,35y863,FalseTautology,2,Fri May 15 00:13:53 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go with Gal Civ 3 because I put at least 100 hrs into GC2.  I have SR1 but I don't think I liked it much, I'll get 2 it on Winter Sale.  I thought it was on sale right now for 40% off or something but that's Star Drive 2.  I keep getting them confused."
4Xgaming,35y863,midnight_toker22,2,Fri May 15 00:22:34 2015 UTC,"If you're into philanthropy, SR2's developer could really use the support now. Last I heard, they were on he verge of having to shut down the studio because of low sales due to a lack of visibility.   Which is a real shame, because it's a great product, and the most innovative 4x game I've played in a long time. And this is the kind of studio that gamers dream of, great at taking feedback and giving players what they want, and allowing avenues for user-generated content. Just super involved in the community.   They even seem to be regular readers of this subreddit. Shout out to ThyReaper and Firgof."

I'm a bit weary of just not having enough time to devote to learn another deep 4x game.   In SR2 you can build ships using hex squares, but does this visually alter the ship in combat besides weapon systems?"

When you zoom in, your fleets switch to 3D models the of individual ships, and you can select which model the ship is represented by in the design window from a drop down menu."
4Xgaming,35y863,MegaGrubby,1 point,Sat May 16 03:42:28 2015 UTC,For $15...SR2 is the way better value.  Many of the GC3 reviews in this subreddit have made it sound like it was not ready for release. I was shocked when it was getting 90s from reviewers and 9s from users over on metacritic. Pretty sure I am going to ignore metacritic from now on.
4Xgaming,35y863,DoomyDoom,1 point,Fri May 15 14:30:21 2015 UTC,I actually liked the first Star Ruler more. The tech tree in SR2 feels weird and tiny and limited. Planet development like this feels like it belongs more in a turn based game. I just want to build badass ships and smash them together.
4Xgaming,35xk5z,daveyg2611,12,Thu May 14 10:27:03 2015 UTC,"So as a novice who has followed the genre more than actually played it, I find some things concerning.   Yet in spite of [starbase's] strength and military potential, they just won’t ever really factor into play beyond a few boosts that they grant to ships within their area of influence.    Everything I've read seems to criticize starbases as an extra mechanic that doesn't really add anything to the game but the frustration of having to keep building construction ships. Having put minimal time into the Early Access I have to say I felt they only served to artificially slow down gameplay.    Sadly, diplomacy doesn’t seem to work all that well either....While some features such as espionage were never slated for the base game, I would like to see diplomacy fleshed out with a little more depth than it currently has.   This whole section bothers me. I thought GalCiv 2 was hailed as having some of, if not the, best diplomacy to be found in 4X games. How has GalCiv 3 fallen so short in that regard?  I've read a lot that GalCiv 3 doesn't really add enough to give it value over 2 but it seems like things that were added don't really improve on 2 and seem to even take steps back."
4Xgaming,35xk5z,specter800,12,Thu May 14 12:56:53 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of the games that people should avoid while it launches and buy it in two+ years when there are a couple of expansions.   I mean I played it since the beta, I experienced the ups and downs. They made progress with the last version but the game is nowhere near to be a ""great"" game.  I still see no reason to play GalCiv 3 instead of DW:U for example."
4Xgaming,35xk5z,Stranger371,6,Thu May 14 13:08:47 2015 UTC,"I tend to favor turn-based games since I can easily find a stopping point and it gives me time to think and plan vs a real-time game.

But this is the difference between those games: Everything GalCiv 3 tries to do DW:U does much better +adds MORE stuff to do. It's like...do you want a smartphone game or something that needs a 200 page manual? For me this is an easy answer.     I like my games meaty and with a shitload of content and stuff to do.  GalCiv 3 feels like a ""solid"" foundation for stuff to come."
4Xgaming,35xk5z,Stranger371,5,Thu May 14 13:32:27 2015 UTC,"Again, I disagree here. GC3 has quite a bit here and can in NO WAY be compared to a ""smartphone game"". There's a lot of depth here that I don't think you see. I'm not trying to sell people on this game, but your opinions here border on the absurd.   DW:U is a great game. So is GC3. They're both great and I will sell my soul to the gods if GC3 is not a better vanilla experience than Distant Worlds was.   Bottom line: just because it's maybe not for you does not mean there's not a lot to like here for other people. Especially those who prefer turn-based games."
4Xgaming,35xk5z,Stranger371,-2,Thu May 14 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"It is a bit on the light side concerning mechanics/gameplay. It's an easy game with not that much tactical depth. Or strategic one. But this will surely change. It is a solid foundation for stuff to come.    So my comparison to a smartphone game in terms of 4x is sadly true. Maybe I should not have called it smartphone and more ""a more streamlined 4x for newer players.""     here's a lot of depth here that I don't think you see.    Ah sure...sorry, that isn't the case. ; )   Bottom line: just because it's maybe not for you does not mean there's not a lot to like here for other people. Especially those who prefer turn-based games.   GalCiv 2 has much more to offer for example, why would I pick GalCiv 3? Because it looks better? Has LESS content? Costs more?    This will not be the case in two-three years, of course. GalCiv 3 is a solid foundation for great stuff to come."

4Xgaming,35xk5z,specter800,6,Thu May 14 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"Again, I disagree that either MOO or SotS has greater strategical depth. Definitely Aurora, but the barrier of entry for that title is WAY HIGHER than GCIII.   Again...just not feeling your arguments here."

I know it might sound snarky but it's a serious question."
4Xgaming,35xk5z,SirCabbage,4,Thu May 14 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"The thing is Stardock wants to introduce GalCiv3 as a new platform. GalCiv2 was supported for close to 9 years with new content, they plan to do this again for GalCiv3 (I think their CEO said 7 years during one of their streams but don't quote me on that). Basically the release version is the foundation for a lot of expansion to come that will flesh out the gameplay more and focus on one aspect at a time (ie diplomacy). So right now it's mostly about getting the game out, gathering feedback, getting a stable base game going.   Personally I'm waiting for a bundle deal too because I don't want to pay 45€ for the base game and then probably 5-20€ for each expansion pack when you can get it cheaper in a bundled deal sometime later while also receiving a superior product."

4Xgaming,35xk5z,KaiserTom,2,Thu May 14 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"It's a Stardock thing and the way it goes with most games like that.  Expansions need time, so do re-designs of some core mechanics.  Games like GalCiv 3 need time to grow, there is no doubt that it will be a better game in two years.  The next months will be filled with patches and after that they will, sure as hell, release a expansion that will fix some of the complaints."

4Xgaming,35xk5z,Ryan_Fitz94,2,Sun May 17 06:40:52 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm having a blast with GC3 now that it's actually finished and I've had far more enjoyment out of it than I've ever gotten from DW:U which felt more like an interactive screensaver in terms of  how immersive it was.
4Xgaming,35xk5z,Maqata,1 point,Thu May 14 17:46:37 2015 UTC,"Of course your opinion is subjective.   I believe that GalCiv 3 is a pretty good game. Sure, it'll get better in the next couple years, but it's a very solid vanilla release. They probably played it a little too safe with it, but to suggest someone ""avoid it while it launches"" is pretty ridiculous in my humble opinion.   Read the review. It's a pretty good game."
4Xgaming,35xk5z,Ryan_Fitz94,3,Thu May 14 15:19:30 2015 UTC,"Diplomacy doesn't feel as integral to the experience as it did with GC2. It's not that the stuff you're looking for isn't there (i.e. all the options a 4X player would normally want), it's just that in its current state, it's only necessary on occasion to barter for things you want, and less about feeling fluid or important.   The starbases are much better handled this time around than with GC2. I'll disagree with the reviewer here and say that they're quite important in a few victory conditions and they're absolutely required to obtain the strategic resources required to build special ships, which makes them ""factor in to play"" a lot more than suggested.   I personally don't think either of these complaints - or concerns - by the reviewer necessarily warrants too much caution. If you like 4X games with empire management as their focus and like the space setting, only Distant Worlds would compare to GCIII in its scope and playability (again, IMHO). It's an easy recommendation from me, despite its flaws."

4Xgaming,35xk5z,Jellye,0,Thu May 14 18:25:14 2015 UTC,Galactic Civilizations 3. Or even 2. I don't really know why you're asking this...
4Xgaming,35xk5z,jaythewise,0,Fri May 15 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"Idk man everything I've seen about gal civ 3 is that you should hold off for a couple years until it's actually finished with some dlc.  Played a good bit of gal civ 2,never was a big fan either. I'm looking for basically the space equivalent of the Total War series."
4Xgaming,35xk5z,Jellye,2,Fri May 15 11:20:53 2015 UTC,There is no such game. Closest might be sins of a solar empire.  Also if you do not like Galciv2 the 4X space genre is not for you.
4Xgaming,35xk5z,Maqata,1 point,Fri May 15 15:51:25 2015 UTC,I just don't like gal civ 2 for how dated it is and the lack of RTS space battles. My perfect game is a mix between 4x and RTS.  hence my undying love for total war which imo meshes the two genres flawlessly.

4Xgaming,35x3xm,LEGO-BUG,9,Thu May 14 06:14:10 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it may not be going as badly as you think.  4x games are hard, but if you stick it out to the bitter end you may end up winning, and will definitely learn some new tricks.  Running out of money isn't so bad, except it keeps you from buying the new things you want right now.  Money is supposed to be a limited resource; as long as you invest in the most important things, you're spending resources wisely.  You may just need to wait a few turns to accrue some more.  Look for ways to convert one resource to another.  If you're always out of gold but have lots of metal, use the metal to build a bank.  Or build soldiers and ships to conquer nearby, gold-producing colonies.  The board will fill up.  Go to war!  Maybe try to gang up on someone, attack somebody who's already at war and can't give you all their attention.  If they stomp you, you probably didn't invest in the right things earlier.  But expect to take losses, even if you win.  If he sends a powerful army to take your city, he probably left his other cities poorly defended; let him have your city, and take 2 of his (maybe, depends).  If you can't defend your city, consider pulling out your army and destroying buildings so he can't use them.  4x games are hard, each map is different and you'll always face new challenges and find new solutions.  Look at what's going wrong, and prioritise a solution.  Some examples:  Are you getting decimated by enemy cavalry?  Get pikemen to defend against them, and start building your own cavalry to do the same thing to them!    Are they killing your city's population with spells or bombs?  Find a government or power that resists that. OR, just stack up population bonuses to overcome it.  OR, use magic to summon / capture units instead of building them.  Then you don't need population, and he'll stop bombing you when you take all his cities nearby cities."
4Xgaming,35x3xm,MeepleTugger,3,Thu May 14 08:09:27 2015 UTC,"Pretty much spot on.  All I can say is take your time, most 4X games are turn-based for a reason."
4Xgaming,35x3xm,Dozed12,4,Thu May 14 12:50:08 2015 UTC,"To echo a small part of what MeepleTugger said (his advice is great), I want to put emphasis on the economic side of things, also.  It's fun to feel rich and have a ton of money in the bank (it's how most people measure success in the real world), but in 4x games, money is worthless unless it's spent.  If you're rich, it means you either better have developed as much as you're able, or you're not investing enough in your planets/empire/infrastructure, etc.  Unspent money doesn't defend your planets, and it doesn't produce research.  If you're saving up for a particular thing, that's one thing.  But if your coffers are near to empty, that's good.  Squeeze the lemons, friend.  Get every last ounce of juice out of them.  That's how I play 4x games, and even similar board games (like Eclipse)."

4Xgaming,35x3xm,Fapstronaut123,1 point,Fri May 22 14:50:27 2015 UTC,"The best way to win at 4x games is by losing a lot. Okay, sorry for the cryptic bullshit, I'm talking about trial and error. But more specifically, I have found that resource allocation in the early game will set you up for success or failure for the rest of the game, so it's easy to wipe the slate clean and start over without losing too much time invested in a particular game.  Like you, I was always inclined to focus on expansion and research in the early phase. But I found that expanding to quickly, too early, always put me in a financial hole that was difficult to climb out of. And the benefits of research are usually only tangible in over time, it's not very often that they grant immediate benefits to your empire.   So then after going broke all the time and being unable to defend myself against invaders, I started making my early game focus on population growth and economic development. Economic development is self-explanatory: you make more money so you can buy more things. And with population growth comes increases to everything else: territory, income, production, research, culture, influence, etc. (some games may not have all those mechanics though). I discovered that, with larger, wealthier empires, I had a lot more capacity to to the things that I wanted to next: technological advancement, fortification and conquest/expansion.   Although there is one exception to this general rule: if there are things that you can research or build that give flat bonuses to important stats (pop. growth, income, production, research), take those as soon as feasibly possible and you will reap the benefits over a longer period of time."
4Xgaming,35x3xm,midnight_toker22,1 point,Thu May 14 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"The most fun 4x games (for me) do not feel like puzzles; where once solved (perfect build order etc) just becomes a race to build things in the perfect order at the right time.  So to get better at 4x games you need to learn how to analyze your situation. 4x games usually have reports built in where you can measure your strength and acquisition of territory, resources, military strength etc. Usually games with a built in scoring system are a very poor way to measure yourself, stick to the reports.  Then you have to analyze your tactical situation. Is there an important resource your missing? How can you get it. Can you afford to purchase or trade for it? Need to go to war over it? Are your neighbors aggressive or weak? What victory conditions are your opponents going for and what do you think they will do or what can you do to them to slow or stop them from achieving it?  Basically every turn, try to figure out the best possible moves to make using the information available to you. Sometimes you have to gamble on an outcome or decision.   Don't expect to learn everything about the game in one or two games. I'll get into a game and scour Google, reddit, game developer forums, steam guides, etc and learn some tricks and tip and best practices before my second game."

How is the combat? Shallow? Can you design ships? How is the planetary management? IS there the possibility to play a custom race?"
4Xgaming,35rc9f,MilitaryDivination,5,Wed May 13 10:36:44 2015 UTC,"If you want scale, this is THE space game for it. You can build planets, ringworlds, ships the size of entire systems. You can destroy stars or siphon them for industry.  It uses non-standard mechanics based on resource import and industrial chains. On a basic level, your colonies export resources which you send to your shipyards or other 'hub' planets to develop them further and allow for increased production, population, and defense. For example, you would import food and water to a colony to 'level it up' and allow it to exploit its native... say, titanium, which you would then export to an industrial word so it 'levels up' in turn and gains more industry and population capacity.  On a more advanced level, there's 40+ resources, each does a different thing, and each requires specific conditions to exploit.  The maximum map size is 'whatever your computer can run', so the maximum game length and scale is probably more than a sane human being can handle. Years are a possibility.  The combat mechanics are perfunctory, and the combat is decided in your design labs and shipyards.  You can design ships, and the design mechanics are very flexible, though there aren't many components.  Planetary management is basic: build shit on the surface for various effects. There's a planet devlopment mechanic to keep you from covering the surface immediately: building on 'developed' tiles results in cheaper buildings. Your civillians also build stuff, depending on what resources and what pressure is present.  Yes, you can select a government type (mostly a starting bonus), FTL type (decisive in both expansion and warfare), and type of life (this alters your core mechanics to varying degrees, from simple things like the ability to build orbital temples to completely changing the gameplay by, for example, not allowing you to settle planets at all.)"

I get to the point where I've clearly won and then just can't be bothered to actually finish off the game. It's a gigantic slog.  Capturing planets takes a good bit of supply so your fleets can only take so many before they need to restock. Then all the planets you're getting either need to be integrated into your economy (which takes time and possibly/probably money), left to drain your resources, or abandoned for the opponent to recolonize shortly.  It's been suggested to me that the diplomatic options are helpful here, but in my most recent game I was watching out for that and there's nowhere near enough annex system (or even planets) cards to really help.  So uh... yeah. I enjoy the build-up and then once there it's just sort of a complete let down and you're stuck either just abandoning the game or slogging through the end-game just to finish things off for at least as much time as you spent building up and actually winning."

I mean there was zero reason to play this instead of GalCiv 2, which runs better, or all the other great 4x games that are out there. Honestly, if people liked it before they just do not know all the other games out there. I thought it would become the second ""Elemental"" from Stardock.   Now it runs pretty good, much of the bad stuff got fixed. Sure, combat still sucks, but with the ""roles"" there is a little more depth to it.  It's still not going to kill the big guys in the genre, but it's a decent game now.   The one thing that bothers me the most is the bad map. Having a big empire is a pain in the ass. We should be able to ""paint"" zones and name them (like in Skylines) and just every symbol needs to be more easily recognizable. It can get hard to spot the difference between ships, space stations and planets when you zoom out.   Dunno, feels like a spilled box of fruit loops."

At the rate that they are going, I think the launch will actually be pretty solid. And it can only get better after that.  Give Galcivs 3 like two years or so, and it should be among the best in the genre."
4Xgaming,35khdd,Tainlorr,2,Mon May 11 07:32:53 2015 UTC,"Give Galcivs 3 like two years or so, and it should be among the best in the genre.   This is something I can relate to. At the moment it is an okay-ish 4x game. Gal Civ 2 might be slightly outdated at the moment, but it holds much more content. But I see great potential in Gal Civ 3, and it wouldn't suprise me if it's one of the best 4x out there in one or two years."
4Xgaming,35khdd,Karlnauters,1 point,Wed May 13 12:38:34 2015 UTC,"Right. The engine in Galcivs 3 apparently allows for a TON of cool stuff to be added with time. The potential is incredible, although it will take a good while before the game is fully realized."
4Xgaming,35khdd,Tainlorr,3,Wed May 13 21:00:47 2015 UTC,What was so wrong with Beta 5 that they fixed in Beta 6?   The one thing that bothers me the most is the bad map. Having a big empire is a pain in the ass.    From what I have seen it does not look much different from GalCiv 2 in that respect beyond looking graphically better and having a hex map instead of squares.  I'v been really looking forward to GalCiv 3 as it looks very much like GalCiv 2 but with the modifications and improvements I would expect from the next game in a series.

What you should do instead is ""complexity"". And perhaps ""balance of complexity"".  Does the game has tactical battles? If yes then complexity has skyrocketed. Separate planetary battles? Even more! How big and complicated is economy? How big empires tend to be? How much micromanagement can you do, like customizing your armies or placing buildings around your cities?  I don't think anyone wants the game with specific feature like ""planetary battles"" or ""complex trade"". People who want those things usually just want more micromanagement, fine-tuning and depth to their game. For others, like me, balance of those features is important."

4Xgaming,35e85i,MilitaryDivination,2,Sat May 9 14:58:18 2015 UTC,"Excellent mechanics, soul, and an efficient, well designed UI. In that order. Everything else really is secondary.  I like mechanics that support the game's 'spirit'. Consider, say, AI War: everything you do reinforces the idea of being an insignificant speck on a huge, oppressive machine. You limit your expansion, you limit your exploration, capturing a planet often feels like a transgression against some vast and hostile being, and even the final stages of the game force you to restrain yourself and be careful, often using raid and distraction tactics in the final assault. This feeling is built and maintained entirely via mechanics, since the game conveys very little of its flavour through conventional means.  Hence, I'd say a good way to proceed would be to think about what you want the player to feel and think as they play, then use mechanics and balance to reinforce that. For example, if you want a feeling of wonder and discovery, give them lots of stuff to find, tons of races, large maps, slow travel, and a sense of history in the universe.  And for the sake of Space Jesus, don't put any mechanics in 'because they have to be in a 4x game'."

4Xgaming,35e85i,Azkik,1 point,Sat May 9 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate rule sets that allow stories to unfold with the raw gameplay. Like in Distant Worlds, MoO, or Civ, there are game mechanic signals and certain amounts of flavor in descriptions regarding what people are doing at a certain place and why, so a certain verisimilitude develops as I reason why people might be doing a certain thing. This is something that Endless Space and Galactic Civilizations really seemed to lack, so I didn't like them."
4Xgaming,35e85i,TheAbraxis,1 point,Mon May 11 18:46:29 2015 UTC,"Significant choices with short and long-term consequences.  More involved strategic depth, rather than simply 'steamroll their bases'     for example find ways to leave power exposed around the map to create secondary objectives, supply lines, trade routes, limited strategic resource deposits, ect.  Primary objectives should be difficult enough to necessitate focusing on secondaries.  AI should also be tuned to appreciate this.  Also, learn calculus, because calculus is magic.  Balancing and expressing elements around simpler mathematical relationships just doesn't cut it anymore.  Only through the sorcery of calculus can you create a dynamic system of interrelated subsystems with any meaningful depth without losing control and ending up with limited optimal route(s)."
4Xgaming,35e85i,csheldondante,1 point,Sat May 16 16:14:16 2015 UTC,I'm also making a 4-X and I think your approach to making your game fun is good.  I agree with the items on your list.  I will add:   Plotting an efficient path through task space to achieve some objective.  (i.e. capture this strategic resource and research these two technologies so I can build bombers A.S.A.P.) Having many such concurrent task sequences so that any given time when one task completes I still have other tasks in progress to keep me playing. Using images or text to give flavor to the locations and units and make the world interesting to explore.

4Xgaming,35e85i,ADeist22,1 point,Sat May 9 19:00:59 2015 UTC,"Immersion. I love playing a 4X that has me completely immersed in its universe. The best part of a 4X game, in my opinion, is when you really feel like you are some sort of galactic emperor, peaceful politician, or a warmongering warlord. When the game begins to consume me and I get into all the lore, characters, etc. I begin to make a little story of my current game. That's what I like about a 4X-story and immersion.  Complex Gameplay. What I love more than story is gameplay, which is a crucial element that influences my first reason-immersion. I don't want some kind of simple game where the combat mechanics are dull, the tech trees are not unique, and the diplomacy system lacks any real depth. Just because the game has a great universe to play in, does not mean anything if I can not do anything interesting in it."
4Xgaming,35e85i,Mythrell,2,Sun May 10 06:17:44 2015 UTC,"I fall into this camp as well. Immersion and complexity of game play are my priorities when I choose a game to play. Immersion to me isn't always things like lore or stories, it's sometimes just game mechanics which make sense and a universe which is full of awe and wonder.   Also, I would add exploration as my favorite part. If I get huge galaxy with a lot of interesting stuff to explore and a huge research tree which is more immersive than ""laser 1, laser 2, laser 3"", I'm quite happy.  Games like Distant Worlds, Aurora 4x and even the ancient Stars! are few of my favorite games in this class.   From simpler 4x games, Endless Space was quite fun experience. With a proper combat system it could've been a lot better.   I would say that graphics are least of my worries. What ever kind of a 4x game you end up doing, even stuff like background music goes above graphics as long as the graphics are functional in my books."

4Xgaming,35cjbx,Lorini,3,Sat May 9 03:34:22 2015 UTC,"What do you think of Star Ruler 2's economy, if you've tried it?  If you haven't tried it, basically civilian buildings grow automatically when ""pressure"" is applied to the world. ""Pressure"" comes from the import or naturally occurrence of resources, and governs what kind of civilian buildings emerge. Eg. 'money resources' like textiles generate pressure for civilian buildings that generate money. At the end of it all, you still have some say in world-building by you yourself building ""federal buildings"" like research complexes.  I think it's an excellent way to do things, but it frequently opens up the game up to the criticism of ""you don't end up caring much for any of your planets."" (But then the question becomes, with the traditional build order, do you care that much for each of your planets if they all follow the same build order?)"
4Xgaming,35cjbx,mainichi,5,Sat May 9 04:49:31 2015 UTC,"I'd also add that the ""caring"" criticism can be countered by the fact that you care in accordance to the importance of the planet, notably the level in SR2. You have a bunch of L1 food producing planets, but as space emperor, do you care? Not really. You DO care VERY much about that L5 powerhouse that you invested a lot of federal buildings into."
4Xgaming,35cjbx,Kirkus23,2,Sat May 9 05:35:10 2015 UTC,"I suspect there is only so much a player is even capable of truly caring about in a 4X game anyway (probably in the lower single digits). If all the things one might care about are roughly equally important, that limit is reached quickly and one either has to stop expanding there, or end up caring less and less about more and more.  A system such as the planet levels of SR2 you describe seems to be a good way to limit the number things the player cares about deeply without boxing them in."
4Xgaming,35cjbx,CaptainToes,2,Sat May 9 07:48:12 2015 UTC,"What if it was like the game Democracy 3? You have issues and you pick edicts to correct them. So let's say you have an agricultural town that ships to your main city and then the crop fails. Then it would become crisis management. You would have to choose between feeding your capital or the town. Then town would then resent you for stealing their grain or their economy might tank because they could only support themselves and could not export. Then your pressure system can come in the form of edicts that have positives and negatives associated with them but shape your city. You can apply pressure in your small agricultural town to try and diversify their economy by spending their profits on culture and arts or you can double down on agriculture which provides more food but if those bugs come and kill your crops it is a larger population that will die within the town. Then the town hits rock bottom and progress is stalled.  Crisis strikes the empire.    Governors can shape the town and the type of town can shape the governors applying pressure in both directions. If you create these wealthy towns you will create governors that study philosophy or are mad with power, etc. The farm Town would bring a different set of qualities to the governor. All of this would be played out as you sit in your seat of power in the Capital and manage your steadily growing empire. As you expand too far too quickly you are drawing from too small a pool of capable leaders from your own culture. This will be a balast against Imperial ambition and would require a balancing of governance. If the town is culturally different than yours, then the governor being their culture might bring benefits to order but negatives to growth and your influence over its direction of growth. If you plant your cultures governor there would be resentment but more influence and factional benefits.  The overall idea is to create a fluid growth of cities that wouldn't have the player picking the buildings but guiding the vision of the towns. As issues arize the player is forced to make decisions that effect the enitre globe. The increased price of bread in A increases the GDP of B which increases immigration from C to B which causes C to have a brain drain but also causes B to lose its balance it held previously. Unless of course the whole situation was well managed. I like the idea of the fluidity and global complexity.  I feel like refined versions of these mechanics would decrease the ""spreadsheeting"" of the game because it is really all about how the third/fourth/fifth person affected reacts.  I imagine the balancing would be tough and the AI but in my head it sure sounds nice.  As I am thinking this through I am imagining a Civ or Total War type experience overall with those Democracy 3 traits and Offworld Trading's dynamic economy. It'd be great if you let me know what you think. It's just a bunch of spit balled ideas that I jumped from one to another with."
4Xgaming,35cjbx,CaptainToes,1 point,Sat May 9 08:04:14 2015 UTC,"I like where your brainstorming is going. I have always found the Democracy 3 system to be a little lacking in context (if all I do is keeping a number of circles in balance it doesn't really engage me), but your genre ""mash-up"" provides plenty of context and the system of interconnected policies and edicts may work very well if I have a whole empire to manage with it.  I also have a soft spot for offworld trading company, which is one of the few games that feature an actual market that allows various forms of market manipulation. I think that a ""real"" system such as a market goes a long way in providing meaning to otherwise isolated game mechanics. Usually in 4X markets and resources bring a flat bonus and money only ever lets you hurry production, but a market with intricacies of its own allows for much more varied gameplay. An economic strategy is no more about merely accruing money to quickly buy fleets (which, at the end of the day, is just a different path to a military strategy anyway), but about manipulating the market in clever ways to tank an opponents economy without ever firing a shot."
4Xgaming,35cjbx,KaiserTom,2,Sat May 9 08:26:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. I loved the first few playthroughs of democracy but it lost meaning quickly. It feels like a great mini-game for a larger overall game. If I had to manage my Democracy while fighting a cold war with the Russians I would feel something. It'd be great to wage the Vietnam War while dealing with public opinion at home with the Democracy mini game constantly around. That's where it would shine to me.   But for my imaginary game, the approval bars of each group could become what the city caters to. At a certain level of Militarism unit x becomes recruitable but because the player rushed certain edicts through to get that unit available the feng shui of the city is off. The city might not have enough manpower to build an army because it was developed too quickly and the population never caught up. Then the city might need to import civilians from the player's other city that might not have the military disciple of the militaristic city. It might still be rifleman but they were all born with silver spoons in the wealthy city and can't find the end to fire from.   This would make a lot of different strategies viable especially multiplayer if it was balanced. A slow steady build that is stable or these boom towns that serve a single purpose and create a house of cards that might working really well early and allow that advanced military unit but create a complicated global situation.  Dynamic global economies that make sense would be great in a game. Offworld's concept brought in and added as another mini-game aspect would be great. The combination of Democracy decision making and an Offworld dynamic economy with some actually context of war to make me care about it all."

4Xgaming,35cjbx,Mezmorki,3,Sat May 9 07:14:45 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, the build order trope, at least as we know it, is tried. I still think there should exist a build order function, but it shouldn't be the only thing. I definitely believe civilians should have more ""say"" on what is done and built in an empire builder. In fact, I rather like SR2's economy because of this, since it relied more on your citizens choosing to build building in relation to how much pressure they receive from resources.  In an empire builder I want to feel like th leader, not the leader plus the manager of every little thing in between. I have more pressing matters to concern myself with, like the growing military mation to the South, or convincing the north to trade with me, not whether this city builds a granary or not."
4Xgaming,35cjbx,FiveDogNight,3,Sat May 9 07:36:31 2015 UTC,"You are right, as others have already suggested, I ought to try SR2.

I get that, in ancient history, a granary is a big deal, but in modern times no national leader is concerned with building every individual granary, library or lighthouse. Likewise, no sci-fi star empire's government is concerned with building individual rover bays, nightclubs or hydroponic farms."
4Xgaming,35cjbx,DWR2k3,2,Sat May 9 08:04:28 2015 UTC,"We do need some changes for sure. Maybe more natural development  areas. I also hate like in civ were you put your flag down and basically that is the city. Id love for it to be changed from city to areas of habitation that could eventually evolve into counties states and what not.  Smaller cities and towns spawn in a more natural way. You should be ale to go to that center of habitation it will give you an over lay of the area you can develop (which is based on technology and your development level of your civ) and it will show you what would be best per area like this area best for farming, this area best for mining, look a river this area be good for industry or a water source and what not. Let them develop naturally or set limits yourself if you dont wanna exploit some areas or whatever your motive is.  I want populations to grow more naturally and even have limits you could set for immigration and emigration. Do you allow the natives or bandits to join you?  Maybe even rules for different races. Allow a caste system among your people or do you let them try equality? I want combat to be more like Total war in real life. Even go deeper and allow players to change the looks of weapons uniforms their troops wear and even make up of basic units. Id like finte resources as an option and like some later civis do resources matter. But I want more resources and the ability to save some. So just becasue you have no oil supply capped you still have some saved up for later on. Id like to see units get lost and then come back. Maybe you send a ship out over the horizon into the unknown and it gets lost. Then suddenly reappears with tales of the new world. I want the game to expand from a single planet into space. Take the same ideas out their. Sigh dreams."
4Xgaming,35cjbx,FiveDogNight,2,Sat May 9 12:57:01 2015 UTC,"I agree, and think the issue stems from a few factors.   First - for most games, city/colony development is by and large a huge optimization puzzle.  It's ""solve for X"" when X might be maximizing production, or research, or food output, etc.  I don't like complex/deep build orders, personally, because once the decision is made it's largely a tedious exercise seeing it through.  Occasionally you need to make a shift, but no so often, and there is rarely ever a consequence to shifting gears.    Second - part of the of the problem is that there are not enough constraints on what you develop, such that long term, and especially against the AI, you just end up building everything everywhere.  Part of this is that production is so often a ""free resource"" - your workers are always providing production and you are probably best off always putting it to use building things, especially when a game doesn't give you a way to direct excess production towards something else."
4Xgaming,35cjbx,DWR2k3,1 point,Mon May 11 00:40:58 2015 UTC,"Other games have solved this already.  Sots got rid of building space malls on all your planets a decade ago.  A few other games ditched it too, but it still shows up occasionally."

4Xgaming,35cjbx,csheldondante,2,Sat May 9 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"I suppose if you mean that you can build up to 4 starbases if the planet is big enough, giving general bonuses.  Thats not really the same thing as ""build factory, then farms, then library, then bank, then everything else"" on EVERY planet.  I only mentioned sots because you really only had three things that affected output: planet hazard (how much it costs to terraform), infrastructure, and population.  You weren't tied down with the trope of building the same 20 buildings on each planet as OP suggested.  It boiled colony development down the the essential important decisions without repetitive building ""space farms"" and ""space factories"" over and over again."

4Xgaming,35cjbx,Ilitarist,1 point,Sun May 10 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"The game I'm working on does things completely differently.  Instead of customizing colonies by micro-managing their build orders, you choose the specialization of each colony when you found it.  For example:   Founding a mining colony on a rich ore deposit earn you strategic resource income.    Founding a military base intercepts enemies that come too close. Founding a research facility allows you to choose a new technology to unlock   The colonies automatically grow and improve their infrastructure over time.  This increases the bonus of the colony and causes a variety of other gameplay related changes when interacting with planets.  P.S.  The site has not been updated in a while but we are going to be post a new video showing colonization, resource accumulation, technology research and ship upgrades sometime before the 15th."

4Xgaming,35c0ad,Introscopia,2,Sat May 9 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"To me most 4xs are already knee-deep in card-game mechanics. Like when you build a factory and it gives ""+1 production per population unit"". How? how does a factory help people work more efficiently? If you didn't have any factories prior I assume people were hand-crafting your spaceships up to this point, but now you have a factory. is everyone on the planet working a this gigantic factory together? Or is a secret part of the factory's production, which is beyond your control, to be devoted to creating tools for people to work? none of it means anything anyways, its a card, a token, an abstract game piece.

4Xgaming,359hm3,POTUS_Washington,7,Fri May 8 06:56:36 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on either SD2 or SR2 as a sparknotes:  Star Drive 2: Enjoyable. It's entertaining, and there's a bunch to have fun with. Combat is definitely your go-to way of winning the game (in truth). Though balancing is a MAJOR issue currently, if they allow for some leeway in terms of the max ship limit you get, the comparison of Titans vs. Small ships, and other issues like this, it will be a lot more fun (take note, once you figure out mass drivers or artillery, the game gets fun for like a second, then boring).   Another major thing to hit is that though the planet systems are fun and fairly well developed, there's no impetus to not just SPAM ALL BUILDINGS on every planet you can. Essentially, I just spammed Titans, rail guns, and just turtled.  There's definitely some great elements that could be tweaked either via modding or actual patches, but I can see myself playing this a lot in the future, but it's a familiar Civ game that's less developed in a lot of ways than a usual Civ game.  Star Ruler 2: At first, I jumped in thinking, what the fuck is this? Took some time to understand every element, and ended up becoming fun in the sense that I was optimizing production chains, income, and research.   This game, I take, would be your ""hit or miss"" type. There's a lot to do in terms of design, combat, politics, research, energy, etc. While in truth, there are a lot of elements to consider, my frustrations with this one are: while Star Drive's combat was not balanced, it can be easily changed with a few numbers here and there.  Star Ruler's diplomacy factor trumps all. There are a lot of things like adding 1 point to your diplomacy tick rate- which sounds like a little bit, but let me tell you that it is a MASSIVE advantage. Votes seem arbitrary, and there's no real feeling of ""how do I make friends"" vs. ""fuck.""   Don't even get me started on the stupid ""Annex System/Planet"" mechanic. I could abuse the shit out of it. There's no rule book, combat is pretty flat in general, and it just feels empty.   There's only a couple things to do from start to end: send colonists to supporting planets, rake in money and throw it at the political power income. Make it your damn dream to get to level 5, then repeat. If someone starts a war with you, just rapidly build some ships, make a blockade, and the AI in general will lack the ability to really cause any damage.   Spam political power cards and buy up everything useful. If you use the annex system stuff, you pretty much win. Their homeworld + home system? It's okay, I vote that I take it. GG. No rebellion, no inefficiency issues, nothing. It just promotes constant blobbing."
4Xgaming,359hm3,runetrantor,1 point,Fri May 8 17:09:27 2015 UTC,"SR2's diplomacy system is very cool and original, it could use some more refining, but I would really like to see it being copied in other games, rather than keep the current system of Civilization like diplomacy.  but as much as I liked SR1, 2 just feels... off, somehow. I really cant stomach the planet exporting system, I even made an empty galaxy where only I was in to try it at my leisure after I discovered the 'auto import'. It's still weird and I really dont like it that much.  I mean, I LIKE the idea of it, but how it works irks me, and reminds me too much of Anno's production chains that I hated. And the ship designer seems even weirder to get into that SR1's, which took me a while to start using semi reasonably."
4Xgaming,359hm3,MilitaryDivination,7,Sat May 9 09:08:26 2015 UTC,"SD2 is a mess, and will likely stay a mess until abandoned. We went through this with the first one.  SR2 has some actually interesting mechanics, and the scale is mind boggling. The maximum map size is quite literally 'whatever your machine can handle'. You can build ships the size of planetary systems becauyse fuck physics. It lacks flavour somewhat, but the scale, visuals, and mechanics make up for it imo."
4Xgaming,358ugp,ekolis,9,Fri May 8 01:53:46 2015 UTC,It saddens me that SD2 is 10x more popular than the far superior Star Ruler 2.
4Xgaming,358ugp,Terkala,3,Fri May 8 02:14:10 2015 UTC,"I actually played Star Ruler 1 a bit, but I couldn't get over the fact that it was an RTS. Sure, you could pause, but it just didn't feel right for a 4X; I prefer my 4X's to be turn-based, at least outside of combat. Star Ruler 2 is also an RTS, right?"
4Xgaming,358ugp,Firgof,3,Fri May 8 11:24:10 2015 UTC,That is correct.  Time can be slowed down to 0.01x or sped up to 10x and it has features like 'automatically pause whenever I go to the Ship Design screen'.  We designed the game however so that you shouldn't feel the need to speed up or slow down the game's time often once you've got grips on the game's core mechanics - it plays at a relaxed pace.
4Xgaming,358ugp,Firgof,1 point,Fri May 8 12:19:32 2015 UTC,Is that the case in SR1 as well as SR2? Maybe I need to give it a second chance...
4Xgaming,358ugp,Firgof,2,Fri May 8 21:33:30 2015 UTC,Not nearly as much the case with SR1 versus SR2.
4Xgaming,358ugp,Terkala,1 point,Sat May 9 00:58:20 2015 UTC,"Care to explain that? Sounds like you're saying SR2 is somehow ""more pausable"" than SR1..."
4Xgaming,358ugp,Hambeggar,2,Tue May 12 01:12:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant to imply that    it plays at a relaxed pace.   is much more the case in 2 than 1.  Felt like you were responding to the latter portion of my response rather than the former.  Both games have effectively the same time controls, albeit 2 has one or two more advanced options for time controls (like auto-pausing when you leave the galaxy tab for instance)"
4Xgaming,358ugp,Animorganimate,2,Tue May 12 01:31:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's also an RTS. Though SR2 doesn't have much in common with SR1 in terms of any other mechanics. I personally disliked SR1, but find SR2 to be really really good."
4Xgaming,358ugp,MiracleWhippit,-1,Fri May 8 16:08:35 2015 UTC,Both are good.
4Xgaming,358ugp,Animorganimate,8,Fri May 8 04:43:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Obviously it's just my opinion, just like you have your opinion, but StarDrive 2 is nothing but a rush-fest RTS disguised as a 4X strategy game. It may be good if all you like is producing as many units as fast as possible before the next guy destroys you, but that doesn't make it a good 4X game (which it advertises itself as). StarDrive 2 is simple, one-dimensional, and outdated . . . and it doesn't deserve to be called a 4X.  Star Ruler 2 is a 4X game that not only brings new and unique ideas to the table, but even improves upon standard concepts (like diplomacy). It's fun, extremely deep, and even though eXtermination is the ultimate goal, Star Ruler 2 still gives plenty of attention to the other X's.  As far as deciding which of these two is the better 4X game, Star Ruler 2 wins, hands down. Again, it's just my opinion, but I agree with Terkala. It's sad that a vapid game like StarDrive 2 is what is thriving, while unique games like Star Ruler 2 are tanking. If this keeps up, the space-based 4X genre will become stale and less interesting to developers, meaning less good games for us."
4Xgaming,358ugp,MiracleWhippit,1 point,Fri May 8 05:08:01 2015 UTC,I'm confused... Stardrive 2 is an RTS?  I haven't played either of the sequels (but both of the originals) but I swore that stardrive 2 was TBS now and that SR2 was still RTS
4Xgaming,358ugp,Animorganimate,2,Fri May 8 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"StarDrive 2 is turn-based, with real-time space combat and terrible turn-based ground combat. But the way the game is played is more like an RTS like Star Craft or Age of Empires, where the main goal is just unit production (because in SD2 diplomacy and exploration mean nothing and are mostly broken). That's why I compared it to an RTS.  Star Ruler 2 is pausable real-time (like Crusader Kings our Europa Universalis). So even though things happen in real time, there's lots of pausing, making it feel like a grand-strategy, which to me is the modern version of turn-based."
4Xgaming,358ugp,MiracleWhippit,1 point,Fri May 8 15:41:17 2015 UTC,"It's funny... I remember SR1 being a boring spam fest without any real Diplomacy, Exploration (automated explorer spam), or even Research (exponential expansion = exponential research)  You just built huge fleets of ships and sent them after the enemies. Though back when I played it the AI was basically non-existant.  The worst part for me was the seemingly unlimited scale. You can spend forever on a single map and despite being many, many times more powerful than your opponents it still takes forever to order everything around and finish a map.  Comparing that to something like Crusader Kings... sure they're both 'grand strategy'. The difference is that with crusader kings once you get big enough nothing can really stop you.... you just steamroll everybody."
4Xgaming,358ugp,Hambeggar,2,Fri May 8 16:34:03 2015 UTC,"I certainly don't think Star Ruler is the space equivalent of a Paradox grand-strategy (that awarded goes to Distant Worlds, which is my favorite space-based 4X grand-strategy game, and the closest thing to a space-based Paradox game). I was just comparing SR2's pausable real-time to similar games. Also, SR2 is so different from its predecessor. If SR1 is keeping you from playing SR2, I think you should watch some Let's Plays and reconsider."
4Xgaming,358ugp,Terkala,2,Fri May 8 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"See... I've always loved the idea of Distant Worlds. I might have even put 50 hours into it over the years. The problem is that I just never fell in love with the actual game. I think the problem is me though.  The most recent space 4x I really liked was Sword of the Stars 1. The grand strategy wasn't great. The diplomacy was 'okay'. I loved the research and I loved the space battles.  Before that... GalCiv2 was so amazing. Even earlier... Ascendancy, MOO2, and MOO1 were like cocaine when I played them. Never could get enough.  Just for once i'd love to have a turn based game map with amazing real time space battles (like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident level amazing), and a truly asymmetric set of races and technologies. Some technologies should be shared- but everyone should have a preference to certain ones, and many should have unique techs.  But that's just a dream of mine. Good strategy and tactics combined with a truly interesting set of systems. I wish."

4Xgaming,358ugp,_tanc,0,Fri May 8 05:14:30 2015 UTC,Most of the low score for stardrive 2 was because of SD1. So how can you even use that tainted evidence that one game is better than the other?

That's not a tech, that's a pointless game-extender that can cripple your economy if you don't know which techs are useful beforehand.  It also bugs me that the upgrades are just buildings when they should represent large nations. Embassy? You mean a powerful country that has a high number of embassies! Pet peeve.  I agree with the planet specialisation thing, that is a major factor of how engaging a space civ-style 4X game is, for me at least. If the planets feel like afterthoughts and there aren't large-scale space habitats then what exactly is the player trying to achieve?  I'm confident that the perfect balance is possible, and hopefully we'll get it soon."
4Xgaming,353e66,MilitaryDivination,2,Wed May 6 20:51:36 2015 UTC,"I'd rather it not. I feel that the game being focused on space strategy is a good decision that doesn't detract from the experience, and I would rather do planet specialization through the character system. Maybe in DW 2.  The tech tree, yes, it could use some more variety, but it does create at least some decisions regarding research paths and subsequent ship design and tactics, which is already more than GalCiv does.  Now, what I'd REALLY like is a game focused on planet management, with planets colonizable by multiple factions and full planetary warfare. Basically a finished Emperor of the Fading Suns would be fantastic."
4Xgaming,353e66,Darchseraph,2,Fri May 8 16:47:53 2015 UTC,DW is excellent strategically. The only thing I want more from it is better graphics and end-game optimizing (the game can slow down to crawl on larger maps) and more meaningful tactical combat options.
4Xgaming,353e66,Mythrell,1 point,Sat May 9 11:11:18 2015 UTC,"Distant Worlds is a great game, but I think it's just a little too much geared towards micromanagement. If you leave all that to AI, you'll miss big part of the game, yet I certainly don't feel like doing a lot of it.  I agree on the tech tree, it's the biggest weakness in the game in my books. It's just ""meh"", it's just not exciting in any way.   Overall I would say that on the next DW, if there was going to be one, just polish, fine tune and refine the game. It's already great, but it could be even better.   However, it has been quite  a long time when I last played it, so I might actually need to refresh my memory.. :)"

Even that was a terrible pain because either you have to try to do something with all the new planets or suffer unending streams of colony ships. Even if you keep them and fight off the extra debt, it's still a terrible pain to try to hold your territory firm.  I really want to like this game, but the end game is just so fucking terrible. I guess I can try going the influence route, but that's even less fun than dealing with the planets directly.

4Xgaming,34vjtx,igncom1,4,Mon May 4 22:52:43 2015 UTC,"How about parsec-scale topological fine structure in spacetime that propagates between stellar-magnitude objects. The effective analogy would be that three dimensional spacetime is elongated along the starlane axis rendering travel along that structure considerably more energy efficient because absolute distance along the axis is reduced. By piloting with three-dimensional structural awareness of the interface between normal space and the starlane, the idea is to slip into the topology of the of the starlane smoothly. This traps the vessel on that topological plane and simple acceleration propels the vessel as in normal spacetime. Provided transition is smooth, the laws of physics will function normally despite effective spaghettification relative to realspace.   From outside the starlane, a spacecraft moving moving towards at 100 m/s towards the starlane ""mouth"" will suddenly vanish from our frame of reference. It becomes invisible to us from all directions but along the starlane axis itself (light emitted by the craft is likewise trapped along the starlane structure which can only be accessed through the mouth. Light can likewise be transmitted along these axes. Despite being ultimately limited by the speed of light for information transfer, starlanes can be used to achieve FTL communication over normal distance by taking advantage of this loophole: the speed of light is never violated, only the topology of spacetime is affected.    To my knowledge, this is an original interpretation of starlanes. Cheers"

4Xgaming,34r22n,Ronix_Rising,21,Sun May 3 20:39:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't read anything you wrote, I just watched the video so what you said wouldn't influence me at all.  First few seconds: RTS doesn't stand for Real Tactical and Strategic Experiences... That threw me off right away. Maybe I'm overly pedantic, but I honestly have no clue what you were trying to say here. That would be RTSE. I'm just confused.  After watching the intro a second time: A world where space games is not in the gutter? What does that even mean. I honestly have no idea. Perhaps you should redo the first couple of sentences and consult with someone about phrasing.   Then something about One game venturing into somewhere no game has gone before... Into ""our world"".  What on Earth are you going on about?  I'm guessing your team isn't that familiar with English. I highly recommend enlisting the help of someone who is because I was very confused even after pausing the video and reading everything word for word.  Moving on: Starting off you already lost me. The visuals were okay, except for the text on screen. It was oddly placed and I didn't have time to read it. The starting music was fine and the title/logo drop was cool, but it faded away too quickly.  Then after that some very jarring music starts that doesn't fit in any way with the intro. The feeling I'm sitting with is utter confusion over what I was told, trying to understand any of it, but since it's incomprehensible I simply can't and then some heavy metal starts blasting.  The logos and names flashing up I'm assuming is races or something? It looks cool, but I don't have time enough to tell anything about what I see other than that the ships have different colors. I'm only guessing that these are races, and all I really know about them is that they all used the same graphical designer to create their logos.  I get some flashes of UI in the middle of all this which was interesting, but it was gone too quickly for me to process it so it just ended up being a distraction.  Then we get some more gameplay, which is nice, but the music is going even more crazy and is honestly distracting me from whats going on on screen.  End of intro: Then the ""oh so you're a hardcore gamer"" thing starts. I guess you could call me that, but I would never describe myself that way. And no, sorry, but I'm not convinced yet. You have told me literally nothing that would convince me about this game. All I know is that it seems to be an RTS set in space, but I don't know for sure.  The announcer guy seems to be aware of this though since he expects me to watch the entire video to be convinced to back this. The problem however is that you already had your minute and a half to convince me, and what you've accomplished in that time is to confuse and annoy me.  Sure the idea of this game could be interesting, but the reason I've kept watching is because despite what this video has shown thus far; my interest in the genre kept me around. You should have grabbed me already, but your only saving grace at the moment is interesting visuals and the fact that you found a space RTS fan.   Lucky you did too since you're posting this to a 4X subreddit. Nothing about the first minute and half makes even the slightest hint at this being a 4X game.  I might post more about the rest of the video if you're interested, but since the start seems to be it's own little trailer I feel okay posting this."
4Xgaming,34r22n,Me66,9,Sun May 3 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"I've seen the rest of the video now. First off, let me say that this looks really cool. I like the idea of making my own spaceship and fighting with it. The look of the menus are great, really awesome actually. I immediately was surprised at how cool a lot of the stuff you show in the pitch looked compared to the no context space battles shown in the intro trailer.  Unfortunately however the intro trailer is working against you. The fact that you're Russian explains the questionable English at the start, but I'm sorry to say I don't feel it excuses it.   TotalBiscuit and his wife Genna has a pretty cool show (link) where they review trailers from Steam. They touch on an important thing in one of the episodes about the fact that your trailer exists to sell your game. The importance on the quality of the trailer can't be overstated. It's your one and only shot of reaching your target audience.  These days there are countless space strategy games and me as a fan of them can't keep all of them straight. If you fail to convince someone in 2 minutes then you've probably lost a potential sale or backer. The kickstarter gravy train has left and in order to be successful there these days you really need to shine.  If I were you I'd look into investing in a professional to help you make a trailer that has a clear message, communicates the features of your game and has a theme consistent with what the game is. You only get one chance to do this, make sure you do it right.  Back to the video: I noticed that the little title info cards with your teams name and other stuff is a bit small and to the side. I didn't have time to read what you're called. Do you have a logo? If so make that more prominent and obvious.  I was impressed by Vasiliy. He is articulate and well spoken and does a lot in just a few seconds to patch over the confusion caused by the intro. He is a bit out of focus though, no big deal.  D.Van. takes the stage now and I'm again impressed with the English proficiency. He talk a bit about some modules and stuff. We went from very grand and over arching ideas now and suddenly were into some very in depth systems which without the context of how the game works really doesn't mean anything to me. I'm afraid he lost me a bit here. I started just watching the cool looking menus and tried to understand what was going on and glossed over what he was saying.  I'm guessing Madscorp chose the music in the intro..? Look. I'm a huge metal fan myself. I love it and I agree with what he is saying, but there is a time and place for everything. It can take a while to get used to a metal song. Metal is very polarizing however and a lot of people hate it so it really should be used sparingly.  The showing off of how you can change the visual styles and stuff looks great and sound awesome, so I'm on board with what he has to say about this.  The in depth explanation of the combat system here I feel is communicated well and the visual representation (the 2D animation) is nice. I'm not sure if it's as big a problem in the genre as you claim it to be, but I like the idea of having a more dynamic combat system. This sound like a lot of micro though, as a primarily 4X gamer I usually don't really care that much about an individual unit.  The further explanation of shield and other systems is well put together, but the 2D graphics here aren't visible long enough for me to really understand it.  I'm afraid the Sibera joke fell a bit flat, and the delivery was a bit.. well not good. Whatever. I'd stick to game development. ;)  Then we have Pavel, CEO. CEO is a title that makes me think management dude not involved in development. Him being the CEO doesn't really communicate what he does on your team.   Anyway, he starts talking about something that confuses me a bit. He makes this sound like an Eve Online like MMO..? I thought this was a RTS? Whats going on? He makes a lot of grand claims here that makes the game sound like something completely different than what I thought it was this far into the video...  So yeah, this is starting to sound like a pipedream. I was really interested, but now this is a RTS MMO? I honestly don't really know what this game is trying to be.  MMO? Single Player RTS? Multiplayer RTS? Is there resource gathering? 4X? Nothing about it sounds like a 4X.    The guy going on about me backing the kickstarter lists a lot of things this game is trying to be and I'm on board with everything except the MMO part. Is this game still something for me then or is it an MMO to the core?  I have no idea."
4Xgaming,34r22n,Me66,8,Sun May 3 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"I've read your post now and I'll adress what you asked directly.  I realize you might not care what I have to say, since I've yet to see a response, but I really hope you take some of this to heart as it seems like you have a good core idea here that I would love to see come to fruition.  You are apparently launching the kickstarter tomorrow. If that date is set in stone, why even bother with this?  My suggestion is this: Don't. DO NOT use this video as a basis of a KS campaign.  Your questions:    Let us know what you think!     I think you should redo the trailer, delay the kickstarter and seriously reconsider what you want this game to be.   Is the Galaxy Conquest section clear enough?   No! It's not clear at all! Nothing about it is clear. It's a bunch of grandiose statements about creating the most amazing MMO ever. From a team that has serious communication issues and a fundamental misunderstanding of how to promote a game.  You will not succeed.  There is no way you'll be funded enough to create such a grand game. Your an untested team making a game in a space where you have huge competitors with vast funding and decades of experience.    Should we add anything to it?   If you are set on making an MMO you need to say that upfront. RIGHT AWAY! Not 5 minutes into the pitch video after going on in length about various systems and the ability to change colors of your ship!  I think you have the basis for an amazing 2-8 player versus space RTS or a 4X single player game with real time battles. Either something like Galactic Civilization with real time battles or something like Homeworld.  You can't be the RTS version of Eve. Seriously.   Our team wants to make sure the pitch video appeals to the intended audience, which includes fans of 4X games, RTS players and wargamers.   The intended audience is Eve Online players as far as I can tell. This is no 4X game. An MMO can't be an RTS. It can play as one while you play it, but an over arching MMO universe will have to exist as something outside of that."
4Xgaming,34r22n,Me66,2,Mon May 4 00:21:54 2015 UTC,"Hi Me66,  Thank you for providing such a thorough and well-backed response. This is the kind of feedback one always hopes to receive from fellow players!   Sorry for the slightly late reply, keep in mind that there is a big time difference between US and Russia, so I posted this around 1am and then crawled into bed ;)  Our team decided to scrap the intro with narration, thanks to your input and the comments made by fellow redditors. Our current plans are to keep the gameplay segment with metal music and add title cards summarizing some of the game’s features.   I get how you feel about the intro music, so we’ll try experimenting with sound levels, so it doesn’t sound too obtrusive.  I guess it isn't clear what we strive to achieve with Galaxy Conquest via the video alone. Our team felt that the video should provide a quick overview of the game mode and additional details can be found in the text description on the campaign's page. Hopefully, this description will answer some of your concerns.  In a nutshell, you are able to experience the galactic map with its assortment of content (resource mining, PvE missions, raids, etc.) as a strictly solo or co-op experience.   Should you want to conquer territory, expand and build outposts (more of the stuff seen in 4X games) you can do that. Only this time, you will be interacting with other players most of the time.  As a team, we like 4X games, especially some of the old-school titles. But we also know that no amount of content is enough to keep the majority of players satisfied for long.   To prevent that, we plan to allow thousands of players to meet and interact on the galactic map.   HOWEVER (and this totally isn’t obvious in the video), this will not be done in a typical RTS style. Rather, players will have a single spaceship representing their fleet on the galactic map. In addition, battles will not happen on the galactic map itself (as seen in EVE Online).   Rather, the outcome of any battle is decided via an instance-based match. The same applies when a clan attacks your base. You won’t be fighting these players all at once. Instead, a team-match will occur in a separate instance (not in the game world).   This should help prevent a typical problem in MMOs, where a large alliance dominates the map by sheer numbers.   Hopefully, this answers some of your concerns about the kind of experience we want to create in Starfall Tactics!"
4Xgaming,34r22n,Me66,2,Mon May 4 07:38:52 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you took some of what I said to heart. However, you still have a major communications problem here. I still don't understand what kind of game you're even making!  First off, I have zero hopes for this game as an MMO. Saying it has PvE stuff is irrelevant as almost all MMOs have some PvE elements. Unless I can get the full and complete game experience without any MMO aspects to it, then it's an MMO as far as I can tell.  I just don't see how your team will be able to successfully develop, release, support, market and fund such a huge project this would have to be to live up to your vague claims when you seem incapable of properly communicating the very basic premise of it.  You'll be in direct competition with Eve Online, Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, heck even games like World of Warcraft, Star Trek Online and a bunch of others. Why not focus on something smaller scale where the games performance and quality isn't dependent on your teams ability to create a thriving community where major triple A developers struggle?  I just don't get it. Perhaps you do have some amazing thing up your sleeve, but you still haven't been able to communicate this properly. Even after I've read this entire thread and painstakingly gone through every detail of the pitch video I haven't got the slightest idea of what you're planning to do with the money you're asking for.  I think you need to go back to the drawing board, rethink this entire campaign from the ground up. The way I see it you have two choices:   Redo the entire video with a focus on what the grand MMO is going to be, then go off to explain and show off the cool stuff you've already made. Don't call this an RTS. Call it a stategic space battle MMO or something. Rethink the entire game. You seem to have the basics for a pretty cool space combat game, expand on it with RTS elements to have a cool RTS or expand on it with cool universe elements to have an interesting 4X game. Get away from the MMO idea completely.   With option 1 I think you might have a chance at making an MMO, but I will not personally support it. I don't want an MMO and even if I did I just don't see how you could possibly pull it off. Not in my wildest imagination.  With option 2 I think you have a cool basis for a game which can do well as a budget space RTS of some sort. If you provide some interesting meta game around the RTS aspects, or expand on the RTS elements so it's not just shooting in space then I'd be very interested in this."

I think thats your problem right there. From the video I saw, I'm guessing your game is going to be like Gratuitous Space Battles. There's nothing wrong with Gratuitous Space Battles. This was a fine game. I had a lot of fun with it, but it was no 4x game. It wasn't even an RTS game. It was almost more like a tower defense game. But GSB it was still a great game.  However I also seem to have totally misunderstood what your game is even about. I even got the genre wrong.  You stated this game is an RTS in the first few seconds, then you started talking about 4x games. Then you started talking about MMO's. Totally different genres.  What, exactly is you game? Is it an RTS, 4x or turn based strategy, or an MMO? All I know is that it involves spaceships and heavy metal music.  You have 30 seconds, at most, to sell your game. If the first 30 seconds of your video don't grab a potential customer you're going to lose them. The longer it takes for your video to grab a new customer the more customers you lose. This means the customer has to know what kind of game this is and they have to be excited about it. The voice overs are, frankly, terrible. That, paired with the music give the whole thing an amateur vibe. Babby's first Youtube video? Not a good start. Ignoring that, the information provided to the player is minimal and misleading. If you start talking about RTS games it better be an RTS game."
4Xgaming,34r22n,Me66,1 point,Mon May 4 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"Hi Hyndis,  The game is a true hybrid of RTS and wargame genres. Mainly, we've taken the combat of wargames and mixed it with RTS style controls.   But, there is also a dash of 4X in our game :)   The core experience in Starfall Tactics is split into two main modes. First off, we have session-based PvP matches where you fight other players in Ranked Mode or Arena. This isn't any different from going for a quick game in StarCraft 2 or any other competitive RTS.   Then there is an optional galaxy conquest mode, where you explore a persistent galactic map, do PvE missions and should you wish to, fight other players for control of certain regions of the map.  Hope this clarifies some of your questions about Starfall Tactics. Us saying ""hybrid"" isn't a marketing gimmick, but a true mix of different genres, and it's honestly been a bit challenging trying to explain the different (yet, equally important) aspects of the game."
4Xgaming,34r22n,Hyndis,2,Mon May 4 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"I think you need to do more than say this. You need to show concrete examples of how this will work. I'm not saying you need to have everything developed, but you need to present the concept in a clear a easy to understand way with a specific explanation of how it will function"
4Xgaming,34r22n,geltoid,2,Mon May 4 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the KS description will help in this regard ;)   We are finally live and you can take a look at the improved video, as well as read the description on KS - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2099269382/starfall-tactics"
4Xgaming,34r22n,Mihlkaen,1 point,Mon May 4 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"I watched the updated video. I gave it a full minute to watch it. This was the part with the gameplay stuff. My reaction?:   ""What the hell is this?""   I don't even know what kind of game this is from the gameplay trailer. The minute of gameplay isn't helpful at all nor is it particularly interesting.  Then after this minute of gameplay trailer I stopped the video and went to another website. I simply lost interest. This video failed to capture my interest in any way.  Now compare that with a gameplay trailer/video done right. This one is crystal clear in describing what the game is. It also shows gameplay footage long enough so that a viewer can see what the game involved. Gratuitous Space Battles 1 trailer. This one captures the viewer's attention and successfully advertises the game. It tells the viewer what the game is, what the game looks like, and how to buy it. And most importantly, it lets the game speak for itself. The description for the trailer is as follows:    ""GSB is an indie strategy game designed for the PC, that plays like a cross between homeworld and Tower Defence. You design ships, deploy them in a fleet, give them orders and then observe a hands-off battle. You can play against fleets desigend by other players in an online challenge system, or upload your fleet to play against others.""   This is 3 sentences. Yet in 3 sentences a new viewer can understand what the game is about. These 3 sentences aren't even really needed due to the clarity of the video, but they're provided anyways. Its clear, its concise, and its informative. Its very information dense yet presented in a simple to understand way.  In your gameplay video the game still fails to speak for itself. What is the game? I don't know. You don't show much of it. All of those quick cuts don't allow any gameplay to play out.  Also, the reason why I picked the Gratuitous Space Battles trailer to compare yours to (other than GSB being an awesome game) is that based upon your trailer, this is what I understand your game to be similar to. If I'm way off mark on this one its the fault of the gameplay trailer for not explaining this."
4Xgaming,34r22n,Trucidar,7,Mon May 4 19:24:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the video is a huge turnoff. The opening minute and a half is so laughably terrible, I had to make sure it wasn't a joke.  In all seriousness, the voice-over and instrumental metal playing over the intro screams unprofessional. Any interest I had in checking out the game was just squashed then; so much that I couldn't take the rest of the video seriously.  Good on you guys for creating a game... although I am very confused as to anything about the game - RTS stands for ""Real Time Strategy"", in case you were confused.  Ditch the intro, and the video would be better for kickstarter.  Sorry for the harshness, I hope you appreciate constructive critism"
4Xgaming,34r22n,ice_nelis,11,Mon May 4 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the intro (and voiceover) is obnoxious and overly dramatic. I almost closed the video in the first 5 seconds. You should completely redo the intro. RTS stands for real-time strategy. You don't get to recreate the acryonym.  I did enjoy the mini-interviews and info.  Maybe show more gameplay in between them.  CHANGE THE INTRO"
4Xgaming,34r22n,MilitaryDivination,2,Sun May 3 23:23:44 2015 UTC,"No doubt. I was shocked when it transitioned to their studio. It suddenly went from amateur youtube video to game studio. The intro made it seem like this was some hobbyist's game created by some eclectic person entirely on their own. Then it scene transitioned to a studio that seemed rather professional. The Game looks much better than the intro makes it out to be. Dropping the intro outright makes this video better.  Good news is that if this flops and their 2D artist is out of a job, he can always move to America and do Monster Truck commercials."

Also you've spelled some words wrong in your example game screens, it would be worth having those looked over.  Beyond that I was interested up until you started talking about online multiplayer galaxies.  Right off the bat, you're never going to have the kind of online population you'll need to provide that kind of experience you're describing here.  This won't be an RTS Eve and designing the game like it will be is just setting yourself up for failure.  I personally like the idea of a galactic conquest mode, but I don't like the idea of being beholden to the whims of other players.  Being able to host our own servers would be nice, or play it solo, but I'm not interested in and will not fund another massively multiplayer online game that is going to die off a week after release."
4Xgaming,34r22n,UnGauchoCualquiera,2,Mon May 4 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"Right off the bat, you're never going to have the kind of online population you'll need to provide that kind of experience you're describing here. This won't be an RTS Eve and designing the game like it will be is just setting yourself up for failure.   I agree. Indie games made by small, new, or unknown studios cannot rely on multiplayer. You need a user base to attract more users. There's both a positive and also negative feedback loop in play. Got lots of people playing? More people will want to play.  It works the other way as well. No one is around to play your multiplayer only game? Well, that pretty much guts your entire game, doesn't it? Good luck getting any new buyers. They won't have anyone to play with.   Yes, its possible that this new game from a new studio might get lucky. It might be the next Minecraft. But what are the odds of that? More likely its ghost town servers.  4x players do seem to be more of the single player type. The length of time required to play out a 4x game precludes multiplayer for the most part. Its easy to find other people willing to play a 10-30 minute game with you. Its a lot harder to find people willing to play a 12 hour game with you. In the case of a 4x game with sufficient depth, 12 hours may only be scratching the surface. Some 4x games can take dozens of hours to play. Hearts of Iron and Europa Universalis are games like this."

We wanted to marry the tactical combat seen in wargames with great visuals    The visuals are ok. SotS 2, as bad as it was, had better graphics and more interesting unit design four years ago. The first one had a similar combat and ship building system with some pretty engaging choices eight years ago.   and an expansive universe populated by thousands of players.   You want to make an expansive MMORTS with an untested team and kickstarter funding? You'd get along famously with someone I know. His name's Peter.  Now, onto the video. That intro needs to go. The guy who thought up that slogan needs to be sent to Siberia. Oh wait.  The presentation is a mess. You need to write the pitch again, condense it into points and present them in order of importance after someone who speaks good English goes over the script several times. Tell me why I should part with my money to make this happen.  The footage, likewise, is a mess. If you want to present the factions, slow down and present the factions. If you want to show the UI and gameplay, show UI and gameplay. If you want to talk about the MMO aspect, concentrate for five seconds.  Delay the kickstarter, hire a copywriter, or at least someone who has passing familiarity with marketing or English, and think about what you want to do, and whether you can do it with your current resources."

Much like EWoM and Fallen Enchantress, I feel like this take on it still misses the mark for the most part. There's no character to the game... at all. It's just so generic fantasy with little bits and scraps of variation.   To be fair, I feel like most 4x fantasy games miss the mark in a similar way. It's not that we have a race here of elves with their own unique history and appearance, we just get elves.  I don't know, maybe I'm in the minority here, but when I think of amazing 4x fantasy games the first thing that comes to mind for me is Fall from Heaven 2, each faction/race was so completely fleshed out that when interacting it really developed a sense of character beyond the generic sterotypes of dwarf, elf, orc, human."

I think it's Stardock's finest product since GC2, as well.   It had this really awesome 4X-RPG-Roguelike thing going for it and I personally can't get enough of it. 45 hours or so with it already and still haven't won a game (mostly because I keep restarting due to normal beta bugs, but I've tried a couple times in earnest and lost, including my current playthrough on YouTube here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r6ic2PyBkEs)  The fact that this game isn't being talked about is a bit of a shame. It's doing some great things. Need to get support going for it so that it can fully realize its potential, but it's already very close to doing so. I think it needs some end game love in the form of a bit more variety and I know that they made a call to their fans to inform them of our top concerns/hopes from now until their likely July release, so if you've been playing it and have some suggestions, be sure to say so now!

4Xgaming,34gq10,MilesBeyond250,12,Fri May 1 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"Lifelong fan of HOMM here.   Ever since the original developers 3DO went out of business, the franchise has been an absolute mess. That really pains me, because Heroes III is probably my favorite game of all time (or at least top 5) and I really loved Heroes IV as well despite the criticism it received (the soundtrack and story telling alone make it worth a playthrough).  Heroes V was a decent clone, but it lacked the personality and charm of the previous iterations. Heroes VI was terrible, the Uplay connectivity issues, flickering mouse cursor and variety of bugs, and no city screens until a few expansions later. Both games suffered from terrible storylines as well.   These are all forgivable to an extent, but the biggest glaring flaw by far is that the developers are trying far too hard to copy the gameplay of HOMM III. They are not succeeding and their games are not really fun; and even if they did, the formula has become stale. Like I said, I love HOMM III and still play it occasionally, but it doesn't have the same hold it had on me as it did a decade ago.   The series needs a gameplay revamp badly, and instead the developers constantly rush out their games and seem underfunded. At this point after how badly they screwed up with VI, I have zero hope for the franchise. The only people who will seriously consider another sequel are the die hard fans who are becoming an increasingly small group. Watching the trailer it looks more of the same, flashy cinematics and an updated graphics engine with the same tired gameplay. I will likely not buy it as I thought Heroes VI was a complete waste of my money and I didn't play more than 10 hours total before getting fed up.   TLDR: No I don't think so. The new developers are trying too hard to recapture the former glory of HOMM III but have failed to do so due to a lack of creativity, poor financing, terribly generic storylines, and just a plain failure in execution are running the franchise into the ground. The newer games are nowhere even close to the charm of the originals, and nothing points towards that changing any time soon."
4Xgaming,34gq10,PseudoElite,3,Fri May 1 01:02:59 2015 UTC,The only thing I hate about Heroes V is that I can't alt-tab while the enemy AI is moving.

4Xgaming,34gq10,rionbull,4,Fri May 1 06:14:03 2015 UTC,"It's certainly quite a different game, but I got a lot of joy out of the King's Bounty titles, which had the wonderful tactical combat inspired by and evolved from the HOMM hex grid / army stacks.  Obviously a departure though from the empire building / macro play in favour of strictly focusing on the singular hero."

4Xgaming,34gq10,Daimonin_123,1 point,Fri May 1 02:47:06 2015 UTC,Which KB would you recommend a new player take a look at to get started in the series?
4Xgaming,34gq10,Terkala,3,Fri May 1 16:20:02 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Armored Princess. The first of the new ones (KB: The Legend) is really just their ""first attempt"" at the new style, and it wasn't until the sequel that they hit their stride.  They're on sale frequently, so I'd play that one and keep a heads up for the other ones going on sale.  Each game is essentially a map-pack of new levels and new units. But the mechanics aren't really vastly different. Which makes sense considering that they put out a new one every year or so.  /u/FalseTautology may have a different recommendation however."
4Xgaming,34gq10,Daimonin_123,2,Fri May 1 17:36:19 2015 UTC,Thanks. :) Is Crossworlds just an expanded version of AP?
4Xgaming,34gq10,Terkala,2,Fri May 1 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"Yup. Minor improvements, and extra scenarios. Plus a map editor. But for a ~$7 price increase.  If your wallet is particularly hardy, there's no reason not to start on Crossworlds. I just figured I'd give the most economical option first."
4Xgaming,34gq10,FalseTautology,1 point,Fri May 1 17:58:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, Armored Princess is definitely the 'best' of the KB games, at least the ones I've played (I realize now I missed some expansions or something at some point), but it's that old dilemma: if you play the best game in a series, will you want to go back and play the lesser ones that came before it?  I started on the first modern KB (as KB is actually a very old franchise dating back to 1990 and was actually started by the same devs, New World Computing, that made the best HOMM games) and had a blast.  As with all these games, however, I often come against a brick wall when the difficulty scales up; I've never beaten a HOMM or KB, probably never got past the first 1/4.  STILL I have fun while I play, and the first 25% is still like 20 hrs or more, ha.  Worst thing about the KB games imo is they are imperfectly translated.  The translation isn't bad, just... imperfect.  This was really noticeable in the most recent KB, the Evil one (can't remember title), which I don't really recommend for beginners as it is kinda complicated right off the bat."
4Xgaming,34gq10,Terkala,1 point,Fri May 1 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed AP, but I got frustrated with it when ""all"" of my favorite troop types were dead, and I was forced to drag really terrible troops with me because all the shops for troops that I liked had run out of troops.  So yeah, I don't think I ever got past 25% or 50% on any of them either. But it was a lot of really fun hours getting to that point."
4Xgaming,34gq10,Ilitarist,1 point,Fri May 1 22:20:21 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend to try to complete all those KB games. Take Crossworlds. If it's not enough for you then go and play newer ones.  I've completed the first one (The Legend) and then tried to work my way through Crossworlds. It's an OK game but it's more of the same. I've played through something like 1/4 of the game for couple of times and now I'm at 1/2 and I'm not gonna return even though sometimes I kinda want to. Those games are just too damn long and become a grind - especially with mechanic forcing you to go back to buy new troops after almost any battle.
4Xgaming,34gq10,ChangloriousOne,2,Wed May 13 08:01:16 2015 UTC,I've played HOMM since the shareware version of heroes I and like everyone else I played HOMM3 for many years.  But I enjoy V much more.  HOMM3 has its charm but there have been improvements that it is sorely missing.  I really wish the devs had implemented a caravan system in the HD remake of HOMM3.  And my god you still cannot load a game in battle!  HOMM5 managed to add a lot of depth and strategy to the series without taking anything away and that is very important.  Also it looks and sounds amazing.  If vii is a throwback to homm5 then I am all over it.

4Xgaming,34gq10,Pizzaspy,3,Fri May 1 06:49:08 2015 UTC,The technical issues they simply decided to ignore on VI are unforgivable IMO.
4Xgaming,34excr,Mezmorki,6,Thu Apr 30 16:09:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I do feel it could be better if you didn't cling to the podcast and the Keith Burgun's article so much, since you seem perfectly capable of supporting your own conclusions without appeal to questionable authority.  More examples are another thing that would allow you to convey your meaning better.  And, to immediately disregard my own advice, have you considered lookind at a critique (and maybe design) of 4x as a puzzle rather than a game in the strict 'simulation of conflict' definition?  Take Civ: how often does direct conflict between players shape the game, compared to said players attempting to 'piece together' their victory conditions before others?"
4Xgaming,34excr,MilitaryDivination,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:10:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Yes, examples are always good - I could've sprinkled more in there.  Feel free to poke at any specific points and I'd be happy to expand on them :)  I think the puzzle vs. game is a good question.  It's interesting - a lot of people talk about ""figuring out the game"" ... as in once they fully grok the mechanics and can consistently beat the AI on the hardest difficulty, the game is basically ""solved"" (like a puzzle) and without more variety/content there isn't much to make it replayable.  We see this in boardgames too, where if there is too little player interaction, is does become a sort of multi-player solitaire race to the finish line type of experience.   Solving the ""optimization"" puzzle  takes priority over strategizing between players, which isn't a fun situation for me.  Plenty of others like it."
4Xgaming,34excr,MilitaryDivination,7,Thu Apr 30 20:23:51 2015 UTC,"I'm talking less about the optimization puzzle that's seemingly inherent to the genre, and more about the game itself being more than zero sum in most circumstances.  There are usually enough resources for most players to achieve a victory condition, for example (the 'science' victory being the main offender here), so it becomes a question of 'who gets there first' instead of 'who defeats their opponents'.  This seems prevalent in games that aren't military-focused, and could be an inherent trait, but... what if there was a finite amount of 'science' on the map (like in AI war, only without the AI starting with ALL THE SCIENCE)? Or a finite amount of 'culture' or 'faith'? What if you had to preserve it against time, conquest and sabotage rather than just stack the points?  Another thing is that simulation vs game dichotomy you mentioned. I feel it's a false one, in that simulation complexity may both detract or enhance the decision depth, rather than inherently detracting from it. There are situations within, say, Distant Worlds (War and preparation for it) or Crusader Kings (Again war, but also succession plots), undoubtedly 'simulation'-biased games, that take the player through a series of discreet choices with transparent mechanical effect and significant consequences, often regarding conflict with another player.  Another thing is the extreme difficulty of getting AI to handle mechanics on the level of a complex 4x title without resorting to cheating (that is, the AI breaking the rules of the game as enforced on the player) or asymmetry. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I can see the genre evolving in two broad directions: refined, mechanically elegant multiplayer games and asymmetrical, complex single player titles.  EDIT: I accidentally a rant. Sorry."
4Xgaming,34excr,FalseTautology,3,Thu Apr 30 20:54:51 2015 UTC,"The lack of advancement in AI is becoming really glaring in the genre, I can't wait for someone to really address that properly."
4Xgaming,34excr,sylos,3,Fri May 1 01:13:03 2015 UTC,"AI in general is a very, very tricky thing.  AI in general, across all game genres is pretty stagnant, which is disappointing.  Hard to do right, imho :."
4Xgaming,34excr,FalseTautology,6,Fri May 1 02:36:55 2015 UTC,"I think it has come down to complacency rather than difficulty.  Graphics sell games and consoles, and it is easy to advertise them.  AI, however, makes for more difficult games (in general), something mainstream developers (who have the resources to actually advance the field) nowadays shy away from.  I read recently that FPS AI has not really advanced since FEAR.  FEAR!  That was 10 years ago!  Now that we finally have the processor power to handle decent AI we have forgotten that it's even an option.  Sad.  It'll change eventually (it's actually what I'm banking on the next big singleplayer Valve game accomplishing, if that ever happens)."
4Xgaming,34excr,sylos,1 point,Fri May 1 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a weird situation regarding AI.  It's easy to make an AI that /wins/.  You've got aim bots in Quake that have reaction times faster than any human can ever hope to achieve with accuracy in that same range.  FEAR supposedly only have scripts that faked things, it wasn't a true AI. Note: In my opinion, a true AI would be something that, when presented an interface similar to that of a human's, it would be able to play the game as such.  I.E. the AI receives no special knowledge or access to information a human does not have.    Anyways, yes.  AI has not received any attention really.  On top of that, AI in 4x games is hard due to the options presented, if the game is properly designed.  :\  I hope something good comes soon."
4Xgaming,34excr,neutronium,2,Fri May 1 03:07:57 2015 UTC,It's easy to make an AI that /wins/ It may be easy in games that rely on reflexes. It certainly isn't in 4X and strategy games.
4Xgaming,34excr,sylos,1 point,Fri May 1 04:33:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry if I didn't make that clear.  4x is hard to do properly, since the number of choices the AI can make grows exponentially(or something, I don't know).  But the day that happens...oh yes. It will be amazing."
4Xgaming,34excr,MilitaryDivination,1 point,Fri May 1 04:40:33 2015 UTC,"It is, using the same principle as an aimbot: just make it able to do things a player cannot. For 4x, that would be, for example, not paying the same maintenance, having faster research and production or bonus income, not obeying supply limits, and so on."
4Xgaming,34excr,neutronium,2,Fri May 1 09:34:40 2015 UTC,"The I in AI stands for intelligence. Yes you can make a challenging computer opponent that cheats like crazy, but calling AI is a bit of a stretch."
4Xgaming,34excr,MilitaryDivination,3,Fri May 1 10:31:21 2015 UTC,"Another thing is that simulation vs game dichotomy you mentioned. I feel it's a false one, in that simulation complexity may both detract or enhance the decision depth, rather than inherently detracting from it. There are situations within, say, Distant Worlds (War and preparation for it) or Crusader Kings (Again war, but also succession plots), undoubtedly 'simulation'-biased games, that take the player through a series of discreet choices with transparent mechanical effect and significant consequences, often regarding conflict with another player.   A large part of my complexity vs. depth argument is personal preference too - I should have been more clear there.  I acknowledge that complexity can and often does increase decision depth. But for me, I wouldn't accept a 50% increase in complexity for a 10% increase in depth (assuming these could be measured).  I think there is a diminishing returns on complexity where at some point you are just spending your time crunching numbers as a means of comparing choices, and I'll either just throw my arms up and pick one or get frustrated that the game isn't more transparent and cool off on the title.  I'd love for someone to build in reporting tools into the game.  E.G., take a planet (Star Drive 2 is a good example) and compare projected future production based on my current planets between taking Automated Rover Bays versus Xeno Mines.  Short term, roverr bays would be better in most cases, long term xeno-mines.  give me the tools to make that decision easier to compare.  SD2 is a pretty low complexity game as well in the genre, so that was perhaps a bad example."
4Xgaming,34excr,Switche,2,Fri May 1 12:56:06 2015 UTC,"There's something to be said about gameworld complexity and simulation depth not necessarily increasing game complexity for the player. That's why abstraction is such an important tool in design.   50% increase in complexity for a 10% increase in depth (assuming these could be measured)   This is what a lack of intelligently applied abstraction would lead to, along with a huge increase in autopilot tasks (as in, tasks that do not produce decision points for a player familiar with the mechanics at work).  On the other hand, an increase in simulation/gameworld complexity may provide the player with more decision points without increasing decision depth for the existing ones, but also without adding maintenance and autopilot tasks.  Taking Stardrive 2, expanding the spying system (by say, simulating double agents or intelligence networks) would do that, for example, providing more decisions within that subsystem, but not necessarily causing any shifts in overall strategy based on the existence of new options."

4Xgaming,34excr,note-to-self-bot,0,Fri May 1 15:45:43 2015 UTC,"I would have appreciated more references to specific games of the last couple years, less focus on subgenres that we all already know about anyway, an indepth analysis of why Beyond Earth sucked, and about 1000% less reference to podcasts and other articles that I never have or will listened to/read.  Also, considering that one of the major criticisms of 4x games (and modern vidya in general) is the failure to advance AI, I feel that should've taken a spotlight in the article instead of being an Honorable Mention.  Also also, despite a brief mention, King of Dragon Pass deserves a lot more space in any discussion of unique approaches to the genre, certainly above and beyond mention of the player being a character within the gameworld.  The article was nice to read but I didn't learn anything I didn't know already and feel like there were many things you either glossed over or were unaware of.    Many of the fans of 4xs have been so for decades and are very well versed in their genre of choice, which makes any discussion of the genre difficult because you are dealing with two fanbases, the casuals and the grognards (which is also one of the issues developers are coping with).  As a casual I probably would have a lot to think over after reading this article, but as a grognard I can only think of the things left out.  That said, I do appreciate the reference to boardgames, which I find (unsurprisingly) has a huge crossover with fans of the genre."
4Xgaming,34excr,FalseTautology,2,Fri May 1 01:09:31 2015 UTC,"King of Dragon Pass also does something else very right - it captures the ""flavor"" wonderfully. (For those that don't know, it was based on the world of the Runequest RPG) - you are a bronze age semi-barbarian, and the game expects you to act like one. Sometimes the ""sober, reasoned"" choices aren't really the best ones. You really need to take time to ""whoop it up"" and get drunk with the rest of the men of the clan. And be superstitious - you are expected to be. It's really quite immersive.   Note to self: Get a copy if you can find one - need to play it again. It's a real gem of a game."

The LP (http://lparchive.org/King-of-Dragon-Pass/ ) was screenshots and text, and the LPer did a fantastic job presenting the game in a way that made me NEEEEEED it.  At the time there was no legitimate way to acquire the game except Ebay so I, ahem, FOUND a copy and even set up a Win98 VM to play it.  Blew my mind.

4Xgaming,349hzz,MayhemMike,3,Wed Apr 29 11:06:07 2015 UTC,And if you want more of that they also had a similar podcast 2 years ago that focused more on individual design aspects (if I remember correctly) of the 4x genre rather than the bigger picture.  Old episode
4Xgaming,349hzz,Mezmorki,2,Wed Apr 29 11:06:52 2015 UTC,I think this was a great episode.  In ended up writing (and just posting!) a rather lengthy reply to it on my blog here:  http://www.big-game-theory.com/2015/04/a-shattered-dream-critiquing-4x-genre.html
4Xgaming,349hzz,ferriolom,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:10:37 2015 UTC,I saw your excellent written thread over at the Explorminate Steam group about the podcast a couple of days ago. I will certainly read the full comment on your blog later when I got some free time.
4Xgaming,349hzz,domainsofascension,2,Thu Apr 30 23:31:03 2015 UTC,"This is probably my favorite ""gaming"" podcast series.  Always very well thought out."
4Xgaming,348zn9,Familion,6,Wed Apr 29 06:32:08 2015 UTC,"Imo most ""mainstream"" 4x are quite similar with regard to difficulty. I'd say pick one you like thematically and in terms of focus (combat vs. empire building) and just go with it. Adjust the difficulty if you're feeling overwhelmed, no shame in exploring options gradually without getting stomped due to the need to play optimally from turn 1.  So if you liked Civ V you might want to try Endless Legend. It's a little more combat/exploration heavy than Civ but still has great empire building mechanics. Endless Space would probably be good for a space theme (or Stardrive 2, although personally I'm not too impressed with it). AoW is heavily geared towards combat but pretty good at that (think more Heroes of Might and Magic than Civ).  Apart from that there are the really complex titles like Distant Universe. In my opinion, adjusting the difficulty doesn't really help since there's just so much stuff going on. Nevertheless, they can be all the more satisfying when you finally master all the different systems."
4Xgaming,348zn9,MilitaryDivination,5,Wed Apr 29 09:18:27 2015 UTC,"Sword of the Stars is a good one to start with. It has minimal management (you control colonization, trade, taxes, and production of ships, no micro), very distinctive races (to the point of each race having different FTL propulsion) and excellent combat. The AI is also quite good, as it adapts its tactics and ships to yours. The game is rather old as well, making it easy to get the complete edition for cheap.  Endless Legend is fantastic, but there's a bit of learning involved. Age of Wonders I would recommend for its multiplayer (they finally added PBEM with the latest expansion, making it playable without setting half a day aside). The singleplayer scenarios are also quite interesting, but random maps vs AI get dull quickly."
4Xgaming,348zn9,MayhemMike,2,Wed Apr 29 07:40:11 2015 UTC,"I would recommend playing Endless Space if you like the theme. It isn't difficult to pick up, has a very streamlined and accessible UI and doesn't punish you too much for mistakes.   I recently got into Star Ruler 2 which is a bit more complicated and has its edges but it offers a really good tutorial and there is a difficulty setting that turns the AI into passive drones if you want the freedom to explore the games mechanics.  Regarding Endless Legend, I don't know if I would recommend it to a beginner. The AI can be very aggressive and unforgiving and some mechanics aren't very well explained either. But once you are more comfortable with the genre you should give it a try. It is a very unique game"
4Xgaming,348zn9,kingpool,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:47:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll give Endless Space another shot. Last time I played it, I was overwhelmed with all the menus, and not knowing how to start off."
4Xgaming,348zn9,Cats_with_Thumbs,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"Both Endless games are like that in the beginning, but once you figure things out you'll see that it is a good entry level 4X game, I recommend Endless Legend for every new 4X player since it is the newest one and they'll find more active players."
4Xgaming,348zn9,SpaceSharkUhOh,3,Sat May 2 07:53:53 2015 UTC,"I'm always worried about making a fatal mistake early on, and screwing up the rest of my game.   In my opinion it is the !FUN! part. It's fun to lose and learn from it. But of course people are different. I like Aurora 4x and Dwarf fortress :). I would not suggest Aurora 4x for you."
4Xgaming,348zn9,kingpool,2,Wed Apr 29 09:12:10 2015 UTC,I agree with this in a lot of ways. Some of the most interesting times I've had in these sorts of games are when things aren't going according to plan. Forces adaptation.

4Xgaming,347pxx,Animorganimate,12,Tue Apr 28 23:33:19 2015 UTC,"No offense to the developers of this game, as I think it looks nice and I'm all for more space 4X's . . . but I would happy if I never see another modern MoO2 clone again.  We can all agree Master of Orion 2 was a great game for its time. It was innovative, original, and defined its genre for years to come . . . a classic in every sense of the word. But MoO2 is also two decades old, and even though it's still somewhat fun to play today, I think its rehashes are becoming stale.  I think it was StarDrive 2 that finally did it for me. It's just not fun playing a pretty version of an archaic game. There's no new ideas or interesting mechanics in these Orion clones, and all the features that made MoO2 so fun to play back then are tedious today.   Like I said earlier, I love this genre and am enjoying this new resurgence in space 4X's . . . but at the same time I think it speaks volumes that most of the new games are almost exactly the same, even advertising themselves as ""Master of Orion 2 clones"". It's almost like it's a nostalgia cash-grab instead of an actual passion for the genre (especially when an uninspired game like StarDrive 2 sells well and a completely original game like Star Ruler 2 is tanking). It must also bore newcomers to the space 4X genre who think MoO2 clones (with their old one-dimensional mechanics) are all there is to offer.  I guess I almost would rather see fewer games that are truly unique and innovative (Distant Worlds, GalCiv, Star Ruler, Sword of the Stars, etc.) spaced out over a few years then an influx of games that strive to be unoriginal and antiquated.  That's all. I guess I just wanted to get that out. But I do hope these developers the best and maybe they have something totally original to bring to the table."
4Xgaming,347pxx,Familion,5,Wed Apr 29 00:40:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the principles, but I'd like to add a few of my own thoughts:  Yes, games trying to replicate MoO2 are getting stale. And I do think it's the wrong approach. If anything, ""someone"" should simply release a proper remake of MoO2 and be done with it. With this I mean a graphical update and an update of the interface to offer some ease of use options we have (rightfully) grown acustomed to. All those games trying to copy MoO2 are trying to change some aspects of it, and in my opinion are just ending up making the game worse. The changes oftentimes are simply upsetting the carefully crafted balance in MoO2, thus having a severely negative impact on the whole game. So just a straight up remake which would probably make a lot of people very happy and hopefully incentivise studios to finally move on to innovate properly (I wholeheartedly agree on Star Ruler 2 vs StarDrive 2).  I know I may seem like a diehard MoO2 fanatic. I didn't think I am, I really wish there was a space 4x game out there which made the formula even better. So far I haven't found any (I dabbled in StarDrive 2 and then disappointedly reinstalled MoO2 after several years of abstinence). But I still enjoy playing Endless Space and Star Ruler 2, and mainly because they are different and offer their own distinct experience."
4Xgaming,347pxx,Dogdays991,3,Wed Apr 29 09:40:41 2015 UTC,"This looks more like a Moo1 clone.  Seeing as I still fire that sucker up once in a while, there is still a market for one.    I think Sword of the stars nailed it personally, and I'd love to see another like it, as well as more innovation.  However there is definitely a MOO-shaped hole in my heart, and I'll buy any game that looks like it will fill it for a month or so.  (for 20 bucks that is!)"

Like I'm sending an army to this watchtower to kill spiders to complete a quest for the Orc Village.  Then a random event pops up that gives everyone a bonus against Undead for 4 days.  Do I have time for my army to go grab that tough Undead Ruin first?  Just barely, but I'll be cutting it close... Okay, i'll keep the slow infantry and trebuchets heading towards the watchtower, but pop the fast units and every nearby eagle to grab the Ruins... That means the Eagles can't escort my settler for a few turns, but that's okay... Then I should be able to conquer the ruins and get the fast units back to the watchtower with 1 turn to spare.    AoW absolutely nailed the emergent storytelling I love in a 4x.  We can all go home now."

4Xgaming,33vlgw,acidentalmispelling,4,Sun Apr 26 16:15:57 2015 UTC,"A mod I'm very slowly working on. It makes interstellar travel slower and more demanding by reducing speed and increasing energy consumption and size on drives.  Research is diversified by race, giving some races alternative propulsion (Most insectoids, for example, have access to enormous teleportation drives that take weeks to charge but allow instantaneous travel upon activation. Makes for some really nasty surprise attacks.), and access to race-specifc upgrades (Avians have some unique navigation and fighter researches, and a few ship components that make them faster and more agile, for one.).  I'm crawling my way up to full functionality, and then it's going to be quite tedious. Handcrafted galaxy, race descriptions, shipsets... urgh. I'm also at a loss as to how to make the automation AI handle the changes. So far it's barely adequate. It can run the empire, but it can't design ships or fight effectively. The enemy AI seems to do decently well, though."

Always thought the game would benefit more from slower supply chains though, too easy to zip back and forth to defend your empire."
4Xgaming,33vlgw,MilitaryDivination,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:09:26 2015 UTC,"So far the enemy AI does an adequate job. The main challenge at the point I'm in comes from expanding, and the accompanying priates and independents-turned-one planet empires. It's quite hard to establish a presence in a new system without occupying a battle fleet for a significant period of time, since each system needs to be able to defend itself from most attacks. You can't rely on on a single fleet to defend multiple sectors like in the base game. There are also less hyperdrive equipped ships available, due to logistical strains. All that means that taking a handful of cruisers plus escort away from whatever they're supposed to be doing for several years is a big deal."
4Xgaming,33vlgw,KaiserTom,2,Tue Apr 28 12:27:49 2015 UTC,"I've had this idea forever for distant worlds to just get rid of hyperdrives/having it be VERY high up on the tech tree (after the last thruster) and instead greatly increasing the max speed (and supply) on ships to really high numbers and decreasing ship acceleration to really low numbers, essentially making the game a 2D Star Ruler."
4Xgaming,33vlgw,runetrantor,2,Sun Apr 26 18:08:23 2015 UTC,"Another cool thing to have would be to make the universe be like the Sins one in how it is traversed, by lanes.  Sins is too small of a scope to really plan around chokepoints too much, but I would love to be able to grab onto a full region that has just a few connecting lanes going outwards and have those be my defended borders.  The AI Wars map generator was the best i ever saw, shame that game was not actually allowing you to colonize all."

I love lanes and how they make space games much more about strategy and holding chokepoints, rather than 'everyone can attack from anywhere' which while more realistic, is less fun to plan for.  I get a kick when in Sins I finally manage to expand to reach those planets that have only one or two connections out of your lands, so your entire empire is securely behind these chokepoints, where your entire fleet is."
4Xgaming,33vlgw,MilitaryDivination,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:48:51 2015 UTC,"I find it rather boring to only defend one or two places, to be fair.

4Xgaming,33vlgw,runetrantor,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:55:04 2015 UTC,"They are... different I guess, both lanes and no lanes have fun aspects.  To me the open space feels more fun in exploring, but less so in battles, you have to be everywhere, whereas in this scenario in Sins you can coordinate the battle at your borders, since you can be sure there is no fleet just going past your entire country to reach your capital.  I like both, tbh."

4Xgaming,33vlgw,BigBolter,4,Sun Apr 26 12:04:10 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Wow this became super long. TL:DR Aurora is cool and intricate.  I got sucked back into Aurora, and have been keeping a game going between home and work for several in-game years now. I turned off orbital movement to try to speed up time advancement. I've played it a bunch in the past and I it's something you that's nearly work to play (oh god, the battles), but no other game comes close for design and internal storytelling.  I'm not even playing as part of any grand narrative, I just sort of created a new civ with 3X the starting population, but let the game pick my techs for me, and did the same for one starting enemy. For this game I decided I wanted to use larger ships (nothing below 12,000 tons, no fighters), and every ship would have a jump engine.   My starting binary-star system had 4 other habitable planets, 2 of which had a low colony cost. I spent the early years focusing on development of my home system. A small government logistics fleet moving the initial colonists, troops, PDC components, and terraforming installations around, while a burgeoning civilian shipping sector began doing the heavy lifting of mines, infrastructure, and spoils from ruins on one of the planets. Most games I play are typically ""human"" starts, so the Terran Federation had a home planet of Earth; the three additional colonies were New Earth (Closest and first to be terraformed), New Mars, and then orbiting the primary star were the colonies of Alpha Centauri and Plymouth Rock.   Early defenses were based around missile-equipped planetary defense centers. I had two designs, the ""Et Nunc Et Semper"" class Anti-Missile bases and ""Warrior Knight"" Anti-Ship bases. Both PDCs were designed to be able to be pre-fabricated into a single 2,500 ton component for quick assembly by construction brigades on new planets, before colonists and construction facilities could be delivered. ""Et Nunc Et Semper""s were equipped with 36 Kongsberg Gruppen NASAMS-2 Batteries each capable of launching a DRDO-OFB ""Trishul-I"" Point Defense Missile (PDM) or ""Maitri-I"" Quick Response Ship-Attack Missile (QRSAM) every 5 seconds. ""Warrior Knight"" class PDCs are designed to detect and engage targets at long range, before they could threaten the planet. Their Selex ES EMPAR MR125-R100 active sensors can detect 5000 ton+ ships at over 1200 million km away. Once the enemy closes to ~500m km, the 6 International Harvester ""Honest John"" Vertical Launch Tubes can go to work, each launching a Boeing LGM-20-14 Minuteman-XX Strategic Missile every 750 seconds. The Minuteman-XX's are relatively slow drones equipped with their own short range active sensors. When they are within 1.5 million km of their target, they each release their payload of 14 Israel Aircraft Industries NIMROD AS-ESRAMs that rapidly close to the target and impact. The large number of small missiles is intended to overwhelm enemy's point defenses, although this design is vulnerable if their Anti-Missile Missiles are able to destroy the Minuteman-XXs before they release their sub munitions.  While the home system developed, humanity did not confine themselves and Sol, and began to map the local galaxy using ""Tenax Proposti-B"" class long-range explorers. An upgrade from the original ""Tenax Proposti"" hulls, the -B variants featured upgraded Geological and Gravitational sensor suites, as well as more efficient Wartsila-Sulzer ICF500-17FPH engines. This allowed an increase in crew amenities and fuel storage, providing the -B's the ability to sojourn on exploration missions of up to 3.5 years without shore leave and be able to spend over two years of that at full engine power (fuel is not used while surveying a planet or grav-survey point).  As the -B's fanned ever outward some manner of responding to a discovered threat was needed. Shipyards produced a few 4-ship Ranger fleets consisting of 2 ""Exorcist"" class Light Cruiser-Patrols and 2 ""Imperious"" class Light Cruiser-Escorts. These 18,000 ton vessels were designed to provide the most basic overwatch capability, to detect any threats and lob a few Minutemen-XX at them before retreating with any exploration ships to the safety of Sol. The ""Imperious"" escorts provided the primary point-defense abilities in the form of 7 Twin General Gynamics GAU-3 Vulcan Turrets. An on-board Ametist DB SF-8-73B Electrical-Optical Tracker would be able to detect incoming missiles at a minimum range of 8 million km and any spacecraft 50 tons+ at 73m km. Once the missile or enemy craft closed within 40,000 km the Twin Vulcans could go to work, each Vulcan able to quickly but somewhat inaccurately shoot once every second. If a missile made it past an Imperious' Vulcans and reached an Exorcist (which was basically a less-capable but mobile version of the Warrior Knight PDCs), the Exorcists each had two TsKIB-SOO A-325Vympel-C CIWS as a last-ditch effort to shoot down the incoming missile. After that it was up to the 5 layers of the Biphase Carbide armor an Exorcist is wrapped in."
4Xgaming,33vlgw,BigBolter,1 point,Thu May 7 04:59:01 2015 UTC,"Sadly that didn't prove to be enough for several Exorcists or Imerpiouses. As unexplored systems became farther and farther away, Terran command identified the need for ""outpost"" bases in key systems, to provide fuel, maintenance, and resupply services to explorers and Rangers as they explored outwards. Two systems were identified, Gilese 229 and V1581 Cygni. Both systems had a single-but-habitable planet in multi-jump point systems 4-5 jumps away from Sol. A small unmanned outpost was founded on Gilese 229-A1, serving mainly as a maintenance supply and fuel dump, and another on V1581 Cygni-A1. It was decided to turn V1581 Cygni-A1 into a full colony as many more Explorer and Ranger fleets were active in that sector, and the outpost was eventually renamed Barbados by the crews taking shore leave there. Due to the increasing population living on Barbados, cargo ships containing 3 Pre-Fabbed Et Nunc Et Semper PDCs, and 1 Pre-Fabbed Warrior Knight to serve as outpost defense. Additionally, due to the new need for ordinance transport, the Collier fleet was expanded to begin making deliveries of Minutemen-XX Strategic Missiles, Trishul PDMs, and Maitri QRSAMs to the new outpost.  Unfortunately, disaster struck. Explorers in the neighboring EG 372 system had been recording sporadic thermal contacts of unknown origin, and Barbados Ranger Fleet Able had shot down one detected unknown ship that had not responded to hails and was navigating at an Explorer. While Ranger Able was taking shore leave  at Barbados, the EMPAR sensors on the Warrior Knight active there detected an unannounced transit from the EG 372 jump point, and a giant fleet of over 35 hostile ships of sizes ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 tons jumped into V1581 Cygni.  Barbados was in a lot of danger. While all the PDCs had been successfully assembled and brought into service by Construction Brigades on the planet, the still-growing Collier fleet had only been able to make one delivery to Barbados. And while Barbados was only 4 jumps away from Sol, the distance between jump points in the 3rd system in that trip were incredibly-far apart, taking days for most ships to traverse. Fleets coming form Sol that jumped into V1581 Cygni would jump in closer to the EG327 jump point as well. To defend itself, Barbados had less than ~300 Minutemen-XX's, ~600 Maitri-I QRSAMs, and ~1800 Trishul-II PDMs. Additionally, Barbados Ranger Fleet Able had two Exorcist light cruisers each with 27 Minuteman-XX's, and two Imperious escort cruisers. An understrength Barbados Ranger Fleet Baker with another 2 Exorcists but lacking its Imperious escorts (which had been dispatched back to the Sol System for refit to upgraded -B variants) was immediately recalled from a neighboring system. A large Terraformer fleet of Nova-B's in orbit over Barbados was ordered to take refuge in the neighboring WISE 1741+2553 system that was still being surveyed, in the hopes that the hostile fleet was still unaware of that jump point.  Given the size, disposition, and movement patterns of the enemy fleet, a concentrated missile attack with a small assault wave of direct-fire ships was expected. The sheer number and size of the attacking ships meant that the limited supply of Minuteman-XX's had no hope of defeating the enemy fleet, and would have to be used selectively to weaken it enough to survive the oncoming missile barrage. With less than 2000 PDMs available, every enemy missile that exploded in its magazine was one less PDM required. Additionally, the efficacy of the Trishul-II Point Defense Missiles and Vulcan turrets had never been tested, so it was unknown how conservative point-defense plans could be.  A high-risk defense plan was put into place, where the Ranger ships would advance towards the enemy with all sensors blazing, while the sensors on the PDCs on Barbados would be turned off. Hopefully if the enemy could be convinced to launch against the Ranger ships at max range, at which point the Ranger fleets would turn and run back to the safety net of the Et Nunc Et Sempers on Barbados. Hopefully the higher speed of the Exorcists and Imperiouses would cause the retreating Ranger fleets to out-range the incoming missiles, causing them to run out of fuel and explode early. If the Rangers could return to the planet, the Trishul PDMs could attempt to shoot down any enemy missiles that reached, and the Vulcans on the Imperiouses could be tested on the initial missiles before Ranger armor was penetrated, to see how many PDMs could be saved.  Ultimately, Barbados was spared. When the last of the enemy fleet retreated through the EG 372 jump point, all Minutemen-XX had been fired (claming a handful of kills plus heavy damage to several more ships), and less than a hundred Trishul-IIs remained in the magazines of the defense bases. The cost of this victory was the entirety of the Ranger fleets, as well as a Tenax Proposti Explorer that had tried to sneak into Barbados during the battle.  Since that battle, mistakes are being corrected. A large task force is being formed around the much larger colony Barbados as become. The shipyards over Earth have been working at 100% capacity for months while the enemy has been licking their wounds. The Ranger fleets, which were never intended to have to fight a pro-longed defensive engagement, have been replaced with the newest ships Terran engineers could design. Iron Duke Missile Cruisers and Aeternum Strike Cruisers ring the planet, awaiting the arrival of Harbringer-B Fast-Attack Escort Cruisers. as well as the very latest in direct fire ships in the form of Leviathan Battleships and Urgent Fury-B Fast-Attach Destroyers. Both the Leviathan and Urgent Fury-Bs are built around the Northrop Grumman FIRESTRIKE, a massive 52cm Spinal-Mounted laser that can deal 71 penetrating damage in a single blast.  As the buildup continues around Barbados, exploration efforts have largely shifted back to the Gilese 229 sector, which has remained quiet. Gilese Outpost is quietly being converted into a manned station to provide basic services to passing ships, and is patrolled by the remaining outdated Ranger fleets who had arrived too late to the Barbados battle (coming from Sol and farther). So far, explorers have reported no strange sensor contacts, but have encountered numerous curious shipwrecks that don't match any known Terran or Barbados Alien designs. Who knows what the future holds...?"

It's more like a board game than a space sim, and that's why it is very divisive around here.  If you're just starting to get into the genre, I would recommend Civilization V or Endless Space. Both of those games are simple and very easy to get into. I'd put Galciv right above those games- slightly more complex, but still not too much going on.   Now's a good time to get into it, because the vanilla launch will still be pretty bare, so it's easy enough to learn all the mechanics.

The planet level up mechanic is also very fun to play with and makes managing large empires pretty simple. There isn't much to say about econ but its simple and I enjoyed it.  The only real con is the lack of story or setting. Not really required in my 4x but really lacking in SR2. Space combat is a little dull and the ships all look the same. Not a huge issue but I would have liked to see some more models.   Picked up Endless Legend the other day and thats super fun as well. I love the quest system for each faction and how it really feels like i'm advancing a story and raising my empire to glory. Combat doesnt' excite me but I dont dislike it either. AI sucks.   One of the down sides so far is there is no sea or air combat. Wouldn't have been hard at all to add a few water units as there is plenty of water."

4Xgaming,33hv7n,LEGO-BUG,7,Wed Apr 22 17:24:29 2015 UTC,"It's ""okay"".   It tries very hard to incorporate elements of Civ 5, but it just ends up feeling like Gal Civ II with some extra features tacked on. For example, there is an ideology tree (which is pretty cool admittedly) but it's just like the social policies from Civ 5. Adds an extra dimension to the game but not much.  Some near features include improved colony building management which is supposed to be deeper now by adding adjacent bonuses for buildings (ie: Building factories next to each other boosts manufacturing bonuses), but once you figure it out it's pretty blah and you do it on auto pilot.  The ship yards have a sponsor system instead of being planet based.   Besides that it feels like Gal Civ II all over again with a facelift. I am pretty disappointed frankly, even though I really loved Gal Civ II. That includes the good and the bad, like the same old tired starbase mechanics from Gal Civ II (which was one of my only complaints about that game) which are back in full force, sadly.   Admittedly I have not played very much, but part of the reason is that I lose interest so fast and abandon my games. Feel free to ask my any questions if you want more detail."
4Xgaming,33hv7n,PseudoElite,3,Wed Apr 22 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"I'm so disappointed reading people's experience regarding starbases. I got galciv II a couple months ago and was having a blast learning the game until I came across the starbase mechanic. I thought I was missing something/doing something wrong until I looked up.  Really bummed out about it, and eventually lost interest because you're at such a disadvantage if you don't utilise it. Sad panda"

4Xgaming,33hv7n,llN3M3515ll,4,Wed Apr 22 18:44:31 2015 UTC,"Good successor to MOO2 (borrows a lot of gameplay elements from it), fun shipbuilder, and excellent diplomacy (best AI I've ever played against in a 4X game).  You need lots of different kinds of starbases across your empire, for mining resources, artifacts, production and mining bonuses etc. Only way to build them is to build a unit called a ""constructor"" which is consumed upon building or upgrading a starbase. This means you spend way too much time building constructors and sending them to each of your starbases to upgrade. It's unbelievably tedious.  As for your last question, I don't really know. The things I listed are some of the features they are touting, but it really doesn't do much for me. The release date is in about a month, we'll have to see."

If yes, then Gal Civ 3 isn't going to impress you.  If you were looking for more of an iterative advance over Gal Civ 2 or even more of the same but in 2015, then Gal Civ 3 is going to shine for you.  I for one have enjoyed the game. The series hasn't let me down yet. But I also know what kind of game it isn't and don't expect a leopard to change it's spots.  Watch the developer videos. They aren't holding anything back. See what you think. Enjoy!"
4Xgaming,33hv7n,Susarian,4,Wed Apr 22 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"Evidently I'm in the minority here, but I really like it.  For context, I'll add that I played a lot of Gal Civ II back in the day and enjoyed that as well.  Re: colony management.  Some people have complained about the ""color wheel.""  I guess I can understand that complaint but it doesn't bother me at all.  I think it's perfectly functional and looks fine.  I also like the new colony tile system.  While you can learn general tips and tricks, I think it still feels fresh because the tile composition of planets is random, and you might make different choices because of tile or planet bonuses.  Visually, the game looks better than II.  I think the AI is already pretty decent, which is something that matters to me a lot in 4x games.  There's going to be one more beta update before release, which I believe is going to focus on further AI improvements.  I actually enjoy building starbases.  I'm not obsessed with filling my entire empire with them, though.  If you choose to do that, yeah, it's going to be pretty micromanagement-heavy.  I think that this is a choice in terms of play style.  You can configure the galaxy such that there's less incentive to play this way, imo.  To the extent that people are complaining that the combat lacks depth - OK.  If someone's preference is for more interactive combat, they will be disappointed.  I enjoy the planning that happens before I ever get to the battle - looking at what my opponents are doing and adjusting my research and fleet composition accordingly.  But here's the thing (and this is true of the starbases also) - the developers were very upfront about the fact that this aspect of the game was not going to change.  I'm not trying to criticize people's preferences, but these criticisms feel like playing in the beta for the new Battlefield and complaining that some feature isn't like how they do it in Call of Duty.  While true, there was never any reason to expect it would be different.  I enjoy the strategy aspects of 4x games more than battle tactics, so I enjoy the way this works.  Overall, I have really been enjoying it."
4Xgaming,33hv7n,PM_ME_REDPANDAS,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"The issue I have with starbases was not so much the micro, which is actually less than in 2 due to being able to request cosntructors for the stations.  My issue is how you are essentially forced to have tons of them, in 2 you had which you wanted to have, in strategic locations, plus two or three for the relics to mine.  Now you have to spam the mining rigs to mine resources so scattered around each station can at best reach two, three if RNG smiled upon you.  These new resources should be mined like asteroids are, and not like relics, which do need the starbase.  I am also bothered by how empty the maps are, star systems scattered far apart, countered by larger SoI, but it's still boring.  Like, in 2 I always had to make active decisions of what planets to prioritize colonizing or else risk letting the ai grab them.  Here, it's more of a 'maybe I will finally find a planet in this next system...' while I have two colony ships sitting around. And I played last time with common habitable planets, even in occasional GalCiv 2 had more, and I recall many moments were I got angry I lost one to the ai in the rush. Here is a frustration of dead star systems."
4Xgaming,33hv7n,runetrantor,4,Thu Apr 23 06:03:31 2015 UTC,"I bought early and left it in my Steam library and haven't touched in a while.  I picked up Endless Legend (enjoy Endless Space) and decided to try out the latest Beta for GalCiv3.  It might be due to playing EL that certain things within GC3 just irked me with the UI.  Some of the UI design decisions were to ""modernize"" but are a step backwards.  Gone are the simple sliders for Taxes/Manufacturing/Research, instead it's a color wheel picker.  It gives the illusion of more control by making the interface janky and awkward.  It would be simple for me to just type in 20/20/60, instead I need to move the slider around until the values are close to what I want... maybe.  The diplomacy screen used to include a quick status reports of the various races, and now it shows a bunch of globes.  You can even mouse wheel to alter your perspective of the globes from orthogonal view to straight over head.  Why?  I guess it looks cool?  Again it makes it feel awkward.  Modern UI concepts that could have been useful and/or borrowed from what people see each day could have been introduced but haven't.  Things like constructor spam into the Space Stations with no notifier over the Space Station to denote a ""waiting for"".  I don't know, borrow from the smart phone and put a colored icon over the station to denote ( 3 ) constructors.  And don't get me started on the Minor Races building Space Stations all across your space to mine your minerals if you don't first.  The starmap is another example of janky design choices.  There's pretty much a few set view distances, from panned out to show icons, to zoomed in to see the graphics.  There are some limbo no-man's lands settings for the zoom where it's not quite one or the other, but they're left in to give you the illusion of control but adds nothing (I had the same issue with EL where they had certain map zoom settings that were in the middle but didn't add anything, but not as many).  I still enjoy the Ship Designer, but I hate how the default builds are always added.  As I understand it there are certain requirements for those designs to remain in place for in engine quest lines, but it just adds massive clutter to the ship designer.  I hope they clean that up a lot before release (which they're targeting for next month).  Certain features like enable or disable see all ship builds required restarting the entire game.  I hope this is only temporary and not a feature within the released game.  There's polish and then there's major design choices.  It seems to me the major design choices have zigged and zagged a couple of times (maybe too many voices in their design meetings) with no singular direction for consistency."

Good analysis, agree with all of your points."

4Xgaming,33hv7n,Silent-Viper,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:06:56 2015 UTC,"It's GalCiv 2 with a few extra bits and a facelift.  I wished it had made some more deep changes, 'dont fix what's broken' is a good saying, but if we go by it, we never come up with better stuff.  I still cant figure out how the tech tree arranges itself, it now feels like a scattered bunch of techs to chose from.  Starbases cant overlap each other, which I find annoying. If I want to burn my money on building ten fortresses around my capital, let me.  Terraforming is sadly different, were before each level gave you a few tiles to improve, you now get one per tech, and the final level opens all of the tiles the first level could, but you already probably took some with the other terraforming techs which had more tiles to chose from, so you lost some due to badly advertised tech.  I dunno if it's my imagination, but the galaxy is big and empty, systems are spread out more and habitable planets are scarce like never before, even in 'common', so the colonization rush is more of a 'QUICK! Find a world you can colonize!' rather than 'Chose which planets to prioritize'. They try to hide it by making planets' influence spheres reach out further, but it still looks empty.  Overlapping stabases would not be a deal to me so much if you didnt have to dedicate so many of them to mine the special resources, single tile stuff you can mine, but need a starbase for them with the mining ring (A starbase can only have a 'ring' which is what it is dedicated to), so you end up with tons of mining starbases mining single resources scattered around, and then a few holes to place the others.  Honestly, it lacks something that I liked in GalCiv 2, I dunno what it is, but this one feels less fun.  I try to be optimistic, but it gets harder and harder to not listen to the people that say GalCiv 2 was a fluke of luck, rather than the norm of Stardock. And given the long string of Elemental games I just cant get into as much as I try, I am starting to wonder of those guys are on to something."

Good:   excellent ""civ"" style game mechanics for empire management. The pacing is excellent. awesome tech mechanics, huge tech tree. Meaningful decisions etc engrossing aesthetics. Pretty.  cool ship designing that allows you to make ships look the way you like them great sense of humor   Not so good:   the ship combat is a bit bland being somewhat similar to""civ"" games with stacking but no real tactical combat ground combat is just about watching the battle unfold. You get no real choices and basically the only thing that effects your troops success is quantity and tech. ship designing has minimal impact on combat compared to strait tech   Just my 2c hope this helps peeps decide of they like to try the game.."

4Xgaming,33iv1m,Firgof,3,Thu Apr 23 23:37:55 2015 UTC,"Us too.  I'm a bit sad that our SS review is coming after StarDrive 2 when we came out weeks before it (and sent keys out) specifically so folks could get impressions on it before SD2 released.  Granted, it's a game that requires more time to really understand (lots of whole-cloth new ideas versus tweaks/riffs on established/known formulas/interactions) - but I'm still kind of disappointed.  If it doesn't come out next then I'll be disappointed and frustrated."
4Xgaming,33iv1m,adamsolo,2,Sat Apr 25 07:45:26 2015 UTC,"I understand your point of view, and your disappointment. The two games released 2 weeks apart, and while theoretically the reviews should have come out in that order (usually between 2 to 4 weeks after official release for games of this caliber) they ended up reversed. By the way, we also received a key for StarDrive 2 before the release.  The reasons for the reversed order were the following:   a) Editorial. Etherium released a couple of days before Star Ruler 2, but more importantly I decided that Etherium would be a much simpler game to review than Star Ruler 2, so I gave instructions to the reviewer (that was going to do both) to start with Etherium and then move on to Star Ruler 2, where he needed to invest much more (by that time the other author was reviewing StarDrive 2).  b) Both reviews (StarDrive 2 and Star Ruler 2) were finishing more or less at the same time - although StarDrive 2's ended a bit sooner, so I decided to go with that one first and then give it a bit more room between the reviews to give people time to process them.  These were the reasons Firgof. I totally understand your frustration and the impact these editorial decisions can have in games. However, I think the review itself will be way more important in the long run than if they came out 1 week after or before one from the other.  The next review will be Star Ruler 2. Probably next week."
4Xgaming,33iv1m,Firgof,2,Sat Apr 25 08:45:36 2015 UTC,"It's good to have official word on it - though I don't understand why you went out of release date order if both SD's and SR2's reviews were finished at roughly the same time, given that we were already kind of 'pushed back' by Etherium (as I understand the timeline; please correct me if I'm wrong).  It's an editorial/scheduling decision which I'm sure was rooted in good cause but it feels like the deck is being stacked against us.  Trying not to be harsh or sour about it.  Just saying 'damn but nothing is going as I hoped it would'."
4Xgaming,33iv1m,adamsolo,2,Sat Apr 25 08:51:19 2015 UTC,"No problem at all, I don't think you're being harsh, I feel that you're disappointed on how the press is reacting to your game, and of course we're part of it, and you're totally entitled to feel that way. I mean, even being out 2 weeks before SD2 (another space 4X game) they already account for 8 critics reviews while you've got none yet.  In our case, I made the call to release SD2's review first because that was the one I had in my hands, ready for my own review (for the reasons I explained in my comment above). It's hard to get an ETA on reviews, and our culture in SS is not to rush reviews nor to put pressure on the reviewers when they need to deliver. They're done when they're done.  So, although I estimated that both reviews could end up being finished more or less at the same time (note that it's different from having both finished at the same time), imagine the scenario where I hold on the SD2 review and wait for the SR2 one, in order to honor the order of release. I didn't have an ETA on the SR2 review (because we don't do firm ETAs on reviews), it could be the next day or 1 week after. And in the meantime there's no content in the site. It seemed to me to be the best decision to make at that point.  Believe me, there's nothing working here against you, at least not from our part. I wish you the same luck as I wish SD2 or any other space 4X developer. Space 4X is our bread and butter and we love all you guys the same.  However, I'll be taking your comments and point of view more into consideration for future reviews, because I think they're valid, and while I wasn't taking the order of release much as a factor before perhaps I'll be putting more emphasis on that for the future and less on if the site is left without content for a week or two or not."

4Xgaming,33iv1m,Corusmaximus,2,Sat Apr 25 16:56:01 2015 UTC,This site has two giant banner ads for the game they are reviewing right there on the review. I thought that was frowned upon.
4Xgaming,33iv1m,ice_nelis,2,Thu Apr 23 00:21:12 2015 UTC,So.. they shouldn't accept ads for games of which the target group is exactly the same as their reading audience? Or should they cancel their reviews based on advertisement on their website.. How does that work?

When reviewing anything, be it food, movies, games, or whatever else there is to talk about, we tend to aim for unbiased reviewers. The person above you is pointing out that the site hosting the review is also profiting from ad revenue that is advertising the game.   For example, if a site that reviewed food brands also advertised for the brands they reviewed. It implies a monetary motivation for the reviewer to look more favorably upon one brand than those who do not pay him for advertisement. If that were to occur any person reading the reviews would have to dismiss the opinions therein, even if they are valid points ultimately, because of the conflict of interest the person reviewing can not be trusted to give an unbiased opinion."

I hope that Dan will continue to support it and bring it more content and eventually flesh out ground combat better.  My last disclaimer: I beta tested this game and was a moderator for their forums. I've since forfeited both responsibilities in order to show my desire for impartiality for the site in every way I can."

4Xgaming,33j24f,walterbarrett,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:41:33 2015 UTC,Do you have to have the newest expansion to experience this or is it the latest patch enough?  I own AoW3 and the first expansion but haven't gotten the newest edition yet.

4Xgaming,33j24f,PseudoElite,8,Sat Apr 25 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"Age of Wonders, while a war game at its core, now has a diplomatic and location-based victories, as well as a race relations system. Carefully considering your actions relating to the various races present on the map is quite rewarding now, allowing you, for example, to incite rebellions and sabotage enemy cities. You can play a political game quite effectively in AoW now, but it still is focused on war and tactical combat.  I'd recommend Endless Legend for fantasy, since it has diverse gameplay and a lot of victory conditions (including a story one for each race), while being easy on the eyes and not terribly complicated. Reign of Kings is also looking very good, though that's still in beta.  If you like space, just get Distant Worlds Universe and you're good for the rest of your life."

4Xgaming,33j24f,Twisted_Paradigm,5,Wed Apr 22 23:02:56 2015 UTC,Structure building in AoE isn't the greatest but it's good. Fe isn't better really in that regard. Early there are a bit more choices in fe but you quickly switch to specialized cities so it's kind of a wash there. I haven't played endless legend. I really enjoyed both fe and AoE and I don't think you can go wrong with any. Buy the one on sale?
4Xgaming,33j24f,bobniborg,2,Thu Apr 23 02:19:54 2015 UTC,Endless space! Like moo2 but more modern. The combats are quick but not very deep which i don't mind.
4Xgaming,33j24f,Jozrael,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"Endless Legend. Its a fantasy based empire builder. It has a few layers of complexity but it does not bog you down in the details to much. The default playable factions are all very unique and play completely differently. Graphics and music are amazing.  The Guardians expansion filled in a lot (not all) of the gaps I found were missing from the game.  This is my favorite 4x game.  Out of the games you mentioned, I also enjoy FE:Legendary Heroes. Its lacking polish, but its a solid game.  AoW3 is a great tactical combat game, the empire building aspects feel like they just threw it in just to check a box however. It feels more like solving a puzzle to get to the best units the fastest, use this build order every time. I will admit my bias. I prefer games with deeper empire building choices. So I may be more apt to notice its shortcomings in this area. However, whatever it lacks in the empire building phase it easily makes up for in the exploration and combat aspects. Also the magic/skills system is very fleshed out and  makes each race/class feel unique during gameplay."
4Xgaming,33j24f,Laladen,1 point,Fri May 1 12:31:12 2015 UTC,highly recommend sots 1 for space 4x. but its rts combat.

4Xgaming,33ec59,Azmodius_The_Warrior,24,Tue Apr 21 20:55:30 2015 UTC,"I'm glad a game like Distant Worlds doesn't bog itself down with Lego-style ship building. It would be much less immersive in my opinion. In Distant Worlds, I like that you can pick the components and fine tune the ships however you please, without having to find the right square to drop a weapon or system in. The other way doesn't make sense to me. A galactic emperor wouldn't be in a workshop building ships anyway. You have engineers who put everything together for you. It's your job to tell them their budget and what materials they can work with, and it's their job to build reliable machines so you can continue focusing on your empire.  Ship-building is okay in certain types of strategy games (of the modern 4Xs, I think Star Ruler 2's ship-building is much better than StarDrive 2's, which feels very limited to me). But I think some developers throw ship-building in to make it seem like their game has more content. It's filler, that honestly speaking, is only fun the first few times you play. Once you learn the limitations of the hulls and what works best, you build the ships the same way every time anyway. Distant Worlds just trims that fat and streamlines the whole experience. Much better in my opinion."
4Xgaming,33ec59,Animorganimate,2,Tue Apr 21 21:50:47 2015 UTC,Have you tried space engineers? It might be just up your alley.

4Xgaming,33ec59,GosuJaz,2,Wed Apr 22 16:20:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Ship building lego style is merely ""ok""  I hate the mechanic-- personally. How many engines should a ship have? how many guns should a ship have? (it seems like with most builders, you get pigeonholed-- one gun 2 engines on a fighter, or 2 guns 1 engine! Depth! )   The only mechanic I like is actually Aurora-- and that one is a game where you can truly get involved with FLEET design. Amazing."
4Xgaming,33ec59,thiosk,1 point,Sun Apr 26 11:43:50 2015 UTC,"I think the best part of DW ship designing is there are so many viable ways to build a ship.  Every time I start a game, I design ships differently than I did in the last one."

4Xgaming,33ec59,Boonaki,4,Tue Apr 21 23:18:35 2015 UTC,"It kind of does. On the other hand, the combat in Distant Worlds doesn't really need a ship designer as detail-oriented as in Stardrive.  Also, while the UI is less shiny, the design process is somewhat more  expansive, with more options and more varied results. The ability to have your capital ships carry ground troops is there, for example, as well as a plethora of auxiliary systems."

4Xgaming,33ec59,Dark-Neuron,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:35:20 2015 UTC,Im always pro choice on these issues where there are two opposing perspectives. I love micromanaging that stuff but I get that it might be tedious for some. That's why distant world's is so good. You can just turn on the ship designing automation feature. On the other hand if I wanted to micro manage it now I have the ability to control things like facing which may give me a tactical advantage I wouldn't have had otherwise. I appreciate your comment here because you aren't trying to be one of those folks that tries to block features just because you personality don't want to use it. Besides this is all hypothetical anyway since I doubt this will actually happen.

The only game I bothered with this was Star Ruler 1, where each weapon type was always the same, it just got better buffs, so it stayed relevant unless you designed it before unlocking shields or something basic like that.  And you could tweak the scale, so that nice size 100 battleship I designed ends up as the size 10.000 behemoth of destruction."

4Xgaming,33ec59,MegaGrubby,0,Wed Apr 22 17:25:11 2015 UTC,I'd say gal civ 2 was one of the more successful 4x space games. I played it A LOT. I actually never played moo series and now it's just too old for me to really bother with. Even though I love the gal civ franchise I never did like the space and ground combat that much. The thing that gal civ does really well is pacing. Personally I refuse to buy gal civ 3 on early access however.
4Xgaming,33ec59,cleantoe,2,Thu Apr 23 11:40:29 2015 UTC,Really depends on how you want to answer that question. Steam says Civ 5 (97% positive reviews). I would not trust metacritic (seems to be trolled a good bit...some games have significant disparity when compared to Steam).   Space only? Real time or turn based? Released anytime?  I am really liking Star Ruler 2. Complex and innovative. Real time. IRC is a nice community feature. My only concern is that some reviews have criticized the difficulty of the game (but you could always play multi-player). My first lengthy game would concur. I plan to increase the difficulty in my next game.
4Xgaming,33ec59,MegaGrubby,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:48:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm actually a big fan of space games. I sank sooo many hours into moo2, and I would always design a new species every time I played.  So let me ask you - which 4x game would a big fan of moo2 like the most? I want to get back into the genre, specifically in space."
4Xgaming,33ec59,zer0sumgames,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:25:04 2015 UTC,Top rated 4x space game on Steam is Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion with 95% liking the game. It's real time. I really liked the game but it would not work after I rebuilt my computer and re-installed the game (because it only works if My Documents is in the default location).  Star Ruler 2 (real time...extensive modding possibilities) and Star Drive 2 (turn based...I haven't played it) were both recently released. Star Ruler 2 is 81% positive and Star Drive 2 is 71% positive on their Steam rating.

4Xgaming,33898m,Troubleshooter11,13,Mon Apr 20 13:01:53 2015 UTC,"Sword of the Stars (one, not two, which was sadly a turd) It's basically a RTS with some very basic 4x surroundings, similar to the total war games."
4Xgaming,33898m,Sbuiko,5,Mon Apr 20 16:46:38 2015 UTC,"Seconded. It's about 8 years old now, but I would still recommend SotS as my favourite combat-focused 4X space game to date.   There's a large combat-focused research tree with dozens of diverse weapons and countermeasures. The battles take place in 3D space and are based around a physics simulation, which leads to a lot of depth and coolness. For example a mass driver projectile can realistically bounce off your armor if it hits at low angle. At the same time a larger burst of such impacts can send the ship spinning wildly, completelly messing up targeting for any large, slow to aim weapons. There's simply much more to consider than raw DPS numbers and rock-paper-scissors mechanics, which feels great.  It's a damn shame that SotS II turned the way it did."
4Xgaming,33898m,embair,3,Mon Apr 20 17:11:05 2015 UTC,I love loading up a dreadnaught with tons of mass drivers then spinning it and watching blue balls of death fly off like drops of water.
4Xgaming,33898m,SharkMolester,4,Mon Apr 20 21:12:37 2015 UTC,"Sword of the Stars 1. The tactical combat in that is still superb when it comes to space 4x. There's a huge variety of races and technologies, combat is pretty detailed (you can target specific turrets on enemy ships, for example), and it has a large set of weapons and counters in battle.  The tech tree is semi-random, with different races baised towards certain types of technologies (Liir have fragile ships, so favour advanced shields and various ecm and cloaking devices, while Hivers build giant steel bricks, tape huge guns to every inch of the surface, and call it a day because shields are for wimpy mammals). Races also have different methods of propulsion, some of them being quite interesting (Morrigi go faster in large groups, Humans move very quickly but only across predetermined paths, Hivers build stargates).  Stay at least two sectors away from the sequel at all times."

4Xgaming,33898m,redem,9,Mon Apr 20 22:23:17 2015 UTC,"No it's not. The space battles become tedious really fast, and there's barely a 4X game hidden in there. The diplomacy is terrible and barely functional, the exploration is almost non-existent (the maps are so small your opponents are right next door to you each and every time), and exploitation is boring because the only viable strategy is rushing production to make as many ships as possible. There's so many better games you can play to get your fix, including MoO2, which is still better (even though that's all StarDrive 2 is trying to be)."

4Xgaming,33898m,mmvvpp,3,Tue Apr 21 19:33:55 2015 UTC,Still not likely. The game is a rush-fest and the first attacks usually happen just a dozen turns into the game.

A lot of the patches fix one thing, but break others . . . and after 8 patches, many of the core problems have yet to be fixed. Diplomacy is still broken and useless; the AI still cheats all over the place (which are being called bugs, but I think Zero just took shortcuts and hoped no one would notice); maps are ridiculously small; ship-building becomes obsolete once you figure out the ""best"" setups; etc.; etc; etc.  I don't want more features, I just want a playable 4X game. Instead, we have a combat simulator (and not even a great one at that) that requires almost no real strategy to master.  Zero promised a lot of things the first time around as well, and even threw out a bunch of small patches for a while. Then he abandoned everything to make this game. I thought maybe he had a good reason for doing so, but now I know I was wrong."

4Xgaming,33898m,Dark-Neuron,2,Wed Apr 22 16:41:58 2015 UTC,"It is. It has mechanics from all over the place (MOO, GalCiv, and SotS being the primary 'inspirations'), plus its own ideas, and it doesn't take advantage of most of them.  It feels like the dev looked at a ton of space 4x, picked the mechanics he liked, and threw them together without much consideration on what purpose they serve or how they interact with each other. Prime examples of this are ship design and both combat modes, but also diplomacy."

4Xgaming,33898m,arquebus_x,7,Mon Apr 20 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"Was recorded before configurable ship behaviors were a thing.  Now ships will do things like put themselves in front of projectiles to block shots from hitting other assets, others will move to the back and fire long-range, others will break from the fleet and do attack runs until they run out of ammo, etc.  All the ships shown have individual hex subsystems which are individually struck by weapons fire.  Damaged systems provide less of what they do, stuff like supply storage starts hemorrhaging fuel and ammo out into space when sufficiently damaged, subsystems don't operate when their core hexes go down, and the crew all the while are running about the ship repairing the damaged parts as they're able.  Stuff like engines, if they go down, will immobilize the ship.  Weapons have firing arcs, have turrets which need to rotate to fire.  Et cetera.  There's lots of tactics going on if you get into the tactics part; not a lot of clicking micro a la StarCraft but nonetheless the directions of battles will swing according to all the above variables.  Lots of folks just switch all their ships to Cannon and just wipe their hands of it - but using your designs skillfully and setting them up with proper behaviors allows you to go up against much larger forces than you'd normally be able to and potentially come out relatively unscathed.  Then you get into the differences some races have in their ship design (Feyh start with faith-based shielding, Oko have Sinew which replaces crew and has to be entirely destroyed before the ship is destroyed where most ships detonate when all their bridges/crew quarters go down), the differences in the application of the FTL travel method, and so on. It's all optional depth and mastering all that stuff requires a lot of time - but it pays in dividends."

I have played very few other games where the positioning of components in your ships actually does make a difference.  Ironically I feel SD2 was a step back from SD1 in this regard because they made the ships much smaller and the module placing/firing arcs more restrictive.

I just really like space combat a la Weber's Honorverse and prior to SD1 the game that had the best ship construction/tactical combat model was Space Empires V.  There seems to be an unfortunate trend of games having excellent tactical combat ideas having really bad shortcomings in other areas.

4Xgaming,336e67,MilitaryDivination,2,Mon Apr 20 06:07:25 2015 UTC,"Get Distant Worlds Universe. It's quite complex, but it has automation options for everything, meaning it can play itself if you want it to.  This allows you to learn specific aspects of the game while the AI takes care of everything else, for example you can fly one ship and go explore, or take control of your empire's spies. Pretty much every aspect of the game can be set to automatic, manual, or 'suggest' (suggest makes the game offer, you guessed it, suggestions, which you can approve, deny or take a look at, much like, well, a ruler).  It's also probably the best in the genre when it comes to space and has fantastic mod support. Playing a clan of Klingon pirates is quite a blast."
4Xgaming,336e67,arquebus_x,5,Tue Apr 21 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"I primarily have experience with space-themed 4X games, so that will color my answer. That being said...  Patience is a virtue with 4X games. But if you break them down into different components you can get a lot of enjoyment out of them in their different pieces. The biggest pieces would be early game, mid-game and end-game. Typically in 4X games these three segments play very differently. In the early game you're scrambling to get a foothold in the world, reaching out to get resources, keeping up your defenses, exploring areas that will get you what you need, and dealing with other groups that might not have your best interests at heart. To get to ""love"" a 4X - and 4X in general - you really need to find a way to love the early game. Do you like the exploration side of things? Do you like building stuff? Gathering loot? Interacting with other characters? Shooting things? Find a 4X that focuses on that aspect in the early game, or tailor a 4X you're playing to let you run with the aspect you like.  That's the real advantage of a 4X in the early game. You can usually tweak and tailor your starting conditions (your race, your tribe, whatever) to focus on a style of play you enjoy. There will usually be the military group, or the research group, or the exploration group, etc., and you pick the one that suits your play style.  Now back to the fact that I'm a space-themed 4Xer. In that genre probably the easiest one to get into is Endless Space (which happens to be on sale right now on Steam). It's pretty and relatively straightforward and the interface is incredibly easy to get into. On the far side of the scale would be something like Distant Worlds. HOWEVER, Distant Worlds does have one great advantage that most other 4X games don't have. In Distant Worlds you can have the computer automate pretty much any aspect of the game that you want. (You can even automate the whole thing so you're just sort of watching a Let's Play made by the AI.) Some people automate virtually all of the game except for maybe a single fleet of ships, which they then take command of and fly around the universe exploring and trading and getting into trouble. You have a lot of options there.  TL;DR: Find a 4X game that lets you play to your particular gaming interests (one of the four Xs: eXplore, eXploit, eXpand, exterminate). Maybe start with Endless Space."

It plays very much like a board game.  Age of Wonders 3 has very good tactical combat and some light empire building and exploring. Fantasy elves and dwarves type mythos.  Endless space is light on combat and heavy on research, exploring and building. Sci-fi based.  My two favorites right now that are taking all my gaming time are Star Drive 2 and Endless Legend."
4Xgaming,3348qm,dummiesday,6,Sun Apr 19 11:24:27 2015 UTC,"Man, Seriously try Space Rangers HD: A War Apart and the King Bounty series. Both by Katauri Interactive. Space rangers is obviously Sci-fi, It sounds very much like something you are looking for and in my opinion it is one of the best gmaes ever made. And King bounty is Fantasy, it's like open-world plot-driven RPG Heroes of Might and magic. Brilliant hidden gems.  A couple words about Space Rangers:    Cool developed faction system with subfactions and enemy factions Enemies can conquer systems for you (and NPSc) to liberate. A lot of different playstyles like merchant, warrior, leader, agent. Optional planetary RTS battles where you can design your own robots. Optional totally epic, well-written and often hillarious text adventures. Probably my favourite part of the game. Optional arcade shoot-em-up battles. Totally addictive."

4Xgaming,3348qm,Alphyn_dp,2,Sun Apr 19 18:31:47 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind some learning curve, there's another cool russian game - Pirates Odyssey: To Each His Own. I think it's the best pirating simulator out there. Get yourself a cool ship, hire some oficers, sail the seas, explore islands and find treasure, board ships, do quests. The faction system is good, each faction has it's own cool quesline. I'm not sure if there's an English localization though.  There is  also Age of Pirates II: City of Abandoned Ships which has an English version. Well, it's not bad, but Pirates Odyssey started as a global mod to that game to correct it's shortcomings, so..."
4Xgaming,3348qm,FalseTautology,2,Mon Apr 20 09:48:34 2015 UTC,"Space Rangers is amazing despite the questionable translations and the HD version is really sweet; best of all is that you can skip the bonus gameplay types if you don't care for them (the hyperspace arcade arena and the RTS sequences), which I really appreciated.  The game is incredibly addictive but does take a little while to get going.  I'm not sure if there is a time limit or not.  It's a lot like a more open-universe Star Control 2 (with comparable but less awesome text).  It is turnbased though, unlike Drox Operative (which I always assumed was kinda like a space Diablo game from my limited playing and the dev's previous titles like Depths of Peril).  King's Bounty actually predates HOMM (in it's original, old school iteration) but your description is dead on.  It is not, however, much like Last Federation or Drox Operative, imo.  Still, good games; I think I have all of them."
4Xgaming,3348qm,Ilitarist,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:10:16 2015 UTC,"Nice game. Played it in Russian in ~2003, not sure if it's still as good as I remember.  Anyway what saddens me is that there's really no diplomacy there. You have 5 ""good"" factions you help to fight 3 ""bad"" factions. HD makes Pirates a faction too but I'm not sure if it works. Anyway there's implied diplomacy between good factions: each has recognizable traits and quests often tell little stories of invisible war between them but it is not seen in gameplay."
4Xgaming,3348qm,zer0sumgames,14,Mon Apr 20 08:12:53 2015 UTC,"This is a small genre but there are quite a few games made over the years.  The first that springs to mind is ""Mount & Blade: Warband"" wherein you start as a humble sellsword and can fight in a huge open world, building up your party of heroes and foot soldiers. You ride around on horseback on a big overview map, and then when you have a combat it zooms into a first/third person combat mode. It's good actually I think it's on sale right now in a bundle.  You might also want to check out X3: Terran Conflict for a similar concept in space, although it's kind of hard core in comparison. A smaller and more manageable game is an old-school game called Escape Velocity: Nova. It's a top down space game where you travel through the galaxy questing, trading, fighting, etc. You don't have as much effect on the world in this game though.   That'll probably set you in the right direction for now."

Hundreds, if not thousands, of hours has been lost to that game. The sequel, Bannerlord, is due out sometime in the near future, but I would jump on Warband right now. And don't worry about any of the expansions (Napolean, Vikings, etc). Just get the base game, get addicted, then start looking at mods. And since you like The Last Federation (I love this game also), you would like Warband. They're not exactly the same, but I've always described TLF as the closest thing to Warband in space that there is.  Also, since you like Drox Operative, have you tried Din's Curse? It's made by Soldak as well, and is considered part of the same ""franchise"" (loosely speaking). Instead of in space, Din's is a fantasy-ARPG type game. It's fun because quests and world events that are given to you actually influence the towns. NPCs (sometimes important ones) can die if you're not fast enough in killing the boss or whatever. It's fun."

It's clearly not a traditional 4x, it's more of a diplomacy simulator with turnbased combat sequences.  I love the game, even though it seems kinda hard to lose.  Conceptually it is totally bizarre and unique and I hope Arcen's next game is even weirder.  Consider, though, checking out Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space.  It's a little like Drox Operative but on a much smaller scope; it's more roguelike, or FTL, than Drox.  The next Weird Worlds game is in development (EA) right now and looks pretty good."

There is Space Empires 4(or 5), which has tile based combat, but you have to retreat from a fight to come away partially damaged and not destroyed.  Most strategy games that have you surviving combat that you lose are going to be a real-time game of some kind."
4Xgaming,3304cx,Animorganimate,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:19:32 2015 UTC,Sword of the Stars has Total War type combat.  It's very fun and has quite a bit of nuance.
4Xgaming,3304cx,valdus,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:30:13 2015 UTC,"Galactic Inheritors handles battles similarly to this, where a fleet of ships becomes a unit, and after a battle, you lose a ship or two (acting as HP in a way), the fleet retreats and you can go back in for more on the next turn. It's shaping up to be kind of like a turn-based Europa Universalis in space. The problem is Galactic Inheritors is in rough shape right now (it's still an alpha build). Unless you want to be a tester, I would hold off on it until release."
4Xgaming,3304cx,trancedellic,-8,Sat Apr 18 20:11:18 2015 UTC,Are... are you kidding right now? They quite literally used the Civ V engine to make a space game...
4Xgaming,32wt72,Furiousp,6,Fri Apr 17 11:04:40 2015 UTC,Dungeon of the Endless is awesome. Mixes tower defense with roguelike elements.
4Xgaming,32wt72,darthfodder,4,Fri Apr 17 23:44:23 2015 UTC,"Picked up Endless legend, it looks fantastic. Going to start playing it soon once exams are over.  Anyone recommend the Emperor Edition? The content seemed kind of light for the price..."
4Xgaming,32wt72,PseudoElite,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:39:20 2015 UTC,"I'd get the Emperor Edition just for the Ice Wargs alone. They are a really awesome minor. The hero is cool, too, and if you have DotE, its always fun to get some additional crossover content.  Really, though, it just comes down to how interested you are in what's available."
4Xgaming,32wt72,daveyg2611,3,Sat Apr 18 03:45:28 2015 UTC,"Aww man, love to get endless legends sometime, but I just dropped $40 on aow3. At least it should keep me busy until the next sale ;)  Been some great sales for 4x gaming lately"
4Xgaming,32wt72,Lushington,2,Sat Apr 18 05:04:10 2015 UTC,"What's worth buying?  I own Endless Space, and it's pretty fun, but how are their other games?  Most reviews are from their buggy pre-releases and earlier versions of the Early Release builds."
4Xgaming,32wt72,somehokie,8,Fri Apr 17 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"Endless Legend is better than Endless Space in my opinion. It really is an excellent fantasy-themed strategy game.  Dungeon of the Endless wasn't really that great, but I'd say it's ""$5 of entertainment""."
4Xgaming,32wt72,Terkala,9,Fri Apr 17 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"We gave Endless Legend our highest award and named it GOTY last year: http://explorminate4x.com/2014/09/17/endless-legend-review/  Here's a reeXamination after a few months, post release, for Endless Legend (keep in mind our site is currently migrating and this particular article is missing art assets): http://explorminate4x.com/2015/01/27/endless-legend-reexamination-1/  We'll be doing another ""reeXamination"" after the DLC coming in a couple weeks.

4Xgaming,32wt72,Terkala,3,Fri Apr 17 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"If you want a space 4x, Star Ruler 2 is one of the best space strategy games I've played in the last several years. I've put in 50+ hours and it's only been out a few weeks.  It's both complex enough to stay interesting, but fast-paced enough that you can play a game in 2-3 hours."

4Xgaming,32wt72,glennc1,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:05:21 2015 UTC,"Afraid not endless space shares few similarities with MOO, asides from the fact they're both about interstellar empires."

4Xgaming,32tzk8,frayuk,3,Thu Apr 16 19:05:20 2015 UTC,Right?! Exactly why I started the site!
4Xgaming,32tzk8,real_jeeger,3,Thu Apr 16 19:31:32 2015 UTC,"Holy cow! The screenshots look amazing! It looks like a mix between Civ 5 and total war. You'll see your cities and the world, and the little armies running around in the hexes. I wonder how much control you'll have over them? You can zoom right in.  Plus, I love the graphics. The city they showed looked amazing, as did the interface.  I can't wait to see more."

4Xgaming,32qjso,Magnnus,17,Wed Apr 15 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"While I'm not saying it's a bad game, but seeing stardrive2 selling a lot of copies, then star rules 2 not so many is just unfair and sad. You'd have a hard case arguing stardrive 1 or 2 is a better game than star ruler. Excluding personal preference ofc."
4Xgaming,32qjso,Zaranazer,8,Wed Apr 15 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"SR2 did self publishing, had little marketing and apparently no PR: http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/star-ruler-2   Although there are exceptions, it isn't true that a good product just sells itself. There is this unknown minimal amount of people that need to know about your game in order to get the mouth to mouth advertising going, and I think the only way to achieve this is if you have a good marketing plan that includes advertising, social media and PR."
4Xgaming,32qjso,ice_nelis,11,Thu Apr 16 12:22:06 2015 UTC,"I've sent out keys to about 40 different websites, 12 popular let's players, and included folks from magazines and those who run popular podcasts.  We bought ads on google, reddit, somethingawful, and some popular hubs for 4X/Space games.  We're on Twitter, I'm on forums like SomethingAwful, Bay12, Facepunch, etc.  We sit in the IRC, we answer questions on the forums.  I even put out a press release on launch.  I don't know how much more we could put ourselves and the game out there with the budget we have for marketing.  The issue is there is seemingly an enormous mountain of apathy versus our product. We had a marketing plan - but it only works if at least one popular, established, outlet picks us up and none of them did.  Iceberg Interactive (publisher of SD2) has connections and money we just don't have access to.  (Also on that Metacritic user review score - some guy voted the game down 5 times using 5 different accounts and then not helpful'd all the currently available positive reviews.  Dunno who it was but all the votes came in at the same time so I'm pretty sure it was just one guy with a big ax to grind.)"
4Xgaming,32qjso,Firgof,6,Thu Apr 16 16:49:31 2015 UTC,Perhaps you can bring the review activity to the attention of metacritic. Seems all the positive reviews are being actively downvoted. Saw one positive review disappear while I was checking them out.  edit: created a metacritic account...helping as much as one voter can...
4Xgaming,32qjso,MegaGrubby,2,Thu Apr 16 17:53:32 2015 UTC,"i was thinking of sitting this one out and waiting for a 4x space opera i can really get behind (which will probably never come), but i would hate to see your company go.  i think there is great potential for sr3.  when is the planned expansion coming out?  i think i'll buy them together."
4Xgaming,32qjso,tomassavage,3,Thu Apr 16 17:49:29 2015 UTC,Can't promise any hard or fixed dates.  Will be probably at the tail-end of the year for the expansion.
4Xgaming,32qjso,Firgof,2,Thu Apr 16 17:53:54 2015 UTC,I remember when Star Ruler 2 first came out in beta there was one guy who just absolutely hated the game and the devs. Spent all his time shitting on the game and complaining about how he thought you sold out and started pandering to casuals. Apparently he was a fan of Star Ruler 1. I wouldn't be surprised if he's the one that fucked up the metacritic score.
4Xgaming,32qjso,Dark-Neuron,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:18:20 2015 UTC,"SR2 is a better game than SD2. But SD2 looks prettier, and that is what a lot of people go for.  I really appreciate what you've tried to do with SR2: Making a game about the high level empire management. You've tried and succeeded IMO.  I think a video from TotalBiscuit is on the way.

4Xgaming,32qjso,Kailvin,-6,Fri Apr 24 00:25:34 2015 UTC,12 popular let's players  We had a marketing plan   Well I found a massive hole your in marketing plan. Your walking into this thinking you have influence. When you don't. You need to build that. Large youtubers/streamers will not touch your game because its not proven and they are making a business decision. You need to look down first. The taste makers are the hobby channels.   I run my own channel. I have over 12K subs. If I did a video on your game. I could get 1-3K eyes on it. Heck. I just was in contact with my good friend /u/Marbozir he runs a channel of 45K subs (Who could put easily 5k+ eyes on your game) and on about march 9th he sent you a nice PR email to try and check out your game and you gave him the cold shoulder. I bet there were other youtubers/streamers too who did the same but you scoffed them off cuz they were not the massive break you were looking for.  Its not a mountain in front of you. Just a 20ft tall hill with a really long ramp on one side (Starting by offering it to smaller channels to build momentum up) and a cliff (Just send it to the big guys and roll the dice) you chose the cliff in your own arrogance.  You screwed up. Fire whoever made your marketing plan. The worst part is? Its post release at this point. Its too late to fix it either. 90% of channels only do games pre/on/very soon after release. Most of your target audience will now be un-reachable. I'm sure this reddit thread that made it to /r/games will help. But its damaged you too. If you go on to make another game. When youtubers check reddit to gauge hype levels.(Which we do by the way.) They will see this. Which will just hurt your chances more.
4Xgaming,32qjso,willfe42,7,Thu Apr 16 20:08:01 2015 UTC,"Large youtubers/streamers will not touch your game because its not proven and they are making a business decision.   Nonsense.

I run my own channel. I have over 12K subs. If I did a video on your game. I could get 1-3K eyes on it.   Whoopty-doo. Why would they want to waste time on a channel with numbers this low? This isn't even remotely approaching ""influential"" territory.  I have about 2k subs on my channel, and yet I won't even pretend to wield any kind of influence over what gamers buy.   on about march 9th he sent you a nice PR email to try and check out your game and you gave him the cold shoulder.   ""You overlooked an email a friend of mine (who you've never heard of) looking for a free game once, so I'm going to lecture you about PR and tell you how much you suck.""   you chose the cliff in your own arrogance.   They released a video game and marketed it. What a bunch of bastards, eh?   You screwed up. Fire whoever made your marketing plan.   Which game(s) have you released lately? How did your marketing work out? Do you have a marketing degree? Are you even remotely qualified to offer an opinion on this, or are you just talking out of your arse?   90% of channels only do games pre/on/very soon after release.   What the hell are you talking about? Streamers & gaming channels play whatever they feel like playing, which isn't always ""Shiny New Game 2015TM!""   Most of your target audience will now be un-reachable.   Why? Does the game mysteriously vanish from the Steam storefront a week after release?

If he sent an e-mail to us it didn't get sent to the right address or it just failed to reach us somehow.  I've sent many keys to LPers who aren't as popular as the 12 I sent to in particular - but we expected that they wouldn't cover us either (they didn't).  We've got folks who are as small as 5 subscribers who we gave a key to (though those were the exception, not the rule).  I sent keys out well in advance of our launch because I know folks tend to have tight scheduling for LPs and all that.  Mind that we've also gotten a lot of key-scammers (folks who claim to be LPers and et cetera just so that they can get free copies of the game) so we don't hand out keys to just anyone.  First we verify that they are who they say they are and then we make sure they didn't just create a channel or something hours/days ago for the intent of scamming us.  If someone with 45k subs and content on their channel came to us asking for a key, we would've given it to them as soon as we could verify it was actually the person running that channel.  If he's still interested, have him contact me at firgof[at]blind-mind[dot]com and I'll make sure he gets a key."

However I will give you the benefit of the doubt here and say it got caught in the spam filter or something silly. (Should get that checked)  But to further my point not only did he not hear from you. He was on the recommended channels list of quill. (Who did a let's try so I assume you sent him a key) and hes one of the most prominent and known civ5 players. If you missed him and he was interested? You missed big time. Heck. Looking at your game? Id give it a 50/50 shot on my channel depending on the mood I was in when I read you email. There are multiple lists across the internet of emails for channels. I understand not wanting to be spammy. So why not use a pr company like evolve? Heck. Going to /r/letsplay and offering keys there would be a great idea too. There is lots of things you did not try.  Just checked with another friend of mine in the paradox community who has over 70k subs and would like to remain anonymous. He said he sent an email and got no response.  I think your spam filter is either really screwed up. Or you really screwed up in identifying real channels.

You're the worst kind of gaming Youtuber. You're full of yourself, convinced you know everything about the industry, believe others give a rat's ass what you have to say and feel entitled to freebies because you play video games and upload them to Youtube.

I have few viewers and only about 2k subscribers, and I suffer no illusions that I'm doing the developers a ""favor"" by playing their game on my mighty channel. I do it for fun, and because it looks like a fun game to play, not because I want to look down my nose at the people who make the games we play with my hand out begging for freebies."
4Xgaming,32qjso,Kailvin,-5,Thu Apr 16 21:45:31 2015 UTC,"Jesus christ, man, you spend two long-winded comments scolding these guys for failing to include you, Mighty Youtuber with 12k Subscribers, in their marketing plans and then have the balls to say    Wha? I don't give a shit if they included me in their contact list. They are free to ignore me. You are really trying to make this about me arnt you?   you might grace their game with your attention (only if they sent you a free copy, of course)?   Yeah pretty much. Have you seen how many games there are on steam? Hell. Id be fine paying for most of the games. The crux is in order to do release day stuff I need to get it pre-release. Which means getting a code from the developer directly. If I have to choose between free early game and paid for late game to do on my channel. I will choose free/early. Thats not me being high and mighty. Thats me being... Well. Smart.   You're the worst kind of gaming Youtuber.    Thanks! You too!   You're full of yourself, convinced you know everything about the industry, believe others give a rat's ass what you have to say and    Do I know everything? No. But iv been doing this fairly successfully for 3 years. So I have some experience. Iv seen games both rise and fall. And Iv been running the things im saying past a guy whos worked in marketing for 10 years. Im not saying things baselessly.   feel entitled to freebies because you play video games and upload them to Youtube.   No. Not really. Heck paradox development studios who I do lots of videos for I pay for most of their games because they 99% of the time send out codes hours after release. Its more of a time thing then a free thing."
4Xgaming,32qjso,willfe42,7,Thu Apr 16 22:14:53 2015 UTC,"You are really trying to make this about me arnt you?   Your entire comment oozes ""listen to me, I'm a Very Important Youtube Personality!"" Don't pretend you weren't talking down to them as if they were ""beneath"" you, especially given:   Yeah pretty much. Have you seen how many games there are on steam? Hell. Id be fine paying for most of the games. The crux is in order to do release day stuff I need to get it pre-release. Which means getting a code from the developer directly.   Nobody's asked you to ""do release day stuff"" for this game. Your attitude tells me this is as it should be.   Thats not me being high and mighty. Thats me being... Well. Smart.   No, that's you being stingy.   But iv been doing this fairly successfully for 3 years.   12k subscribers in 3 years is a very loose definition of ""fairly successfully.""   And Iv been running the things im saying past a guy whos worked in marketing for 10 years.   Oh well that makes all the difference! The devs better just hang it up -- some random Youtuber thinks you goofed and he ran it by his friend who works in marketing before he said so.  So in other words, no, you're not even remotely qualified to offer this ""advice"" (which, incidentally, amounts to nothing more than ""you done goofed!"").   Its more of a time thing then a free thing.   Right. You only make time for games people give you for free. Like I said, you're the worst kind of gaming Youtuber. Ever heard of Payola? It's alive and well thanks to people like you."
4Xgaming,32qjso,Firgof,2,Thu Apr 16 22:27:54 2015 UTC,"I sent a request to quill18 three times actually - none of those got responses.  He did e-mail us though eventually and we got him a key then.   hes one of the most prominent and known civ5 players   Unfortunately, I haven't heard of him.   There are multiple lists across the internet of emails for channels.   I asked our community who they'd like to see and I looked up anybody who did footage for SR1.  I also tried to check out lists of LPers who people said they were interested in but there are many such lists and much disagreement over them.  Unfortunately, as my responsibilities extend well beyond just marketing the game I don't have the time or energy to look in to everything - I just do what I can.  We're 3 guys making a big game, after all, and I'm responsible for a large chunk of it (portraits, gui art, playtesting, mechanics creation, PR, BR, sales projections, particle system creation and optimization, marketing, marketing assets, video creation and editing, the lore of the game, the design of the interface, the manager for the contracted musicians and artist, it goes on and on ...)   Going to /r/letsplay and offering keys there would be a great idea too.   Might've been.  Haven't heard of that subreddit until now.   I understand not wanting to be spammy. So why not use a pr company like evolve?   Because that's also spammy and I don't know any pr companies - and wouldn't know which are good ones besides.  Also, we don't have a lot of money to just throw about.   Just checked with another friend of mine in the paradox community who has over 70k subs and would like to remain anonymous.   If that's true, something in our mail system is screwed up - we wouldn't have passed up such opportunities when most of the folks who e-mailed us and we approved were in the 12-20k range at best in subscriber counts.  We do get tons of e-mails all the time though so I'm not sure what's going on there.  All I can offer is my apologies for somehow missing their e-mails.  We'll be looking into that today as, if all that's true, we might be missing a large amount of e-mails that should've been delivered.  For the time being, I recommend everyone mail me at firgof[dot]umbra[at]gmail[dot]com if they've sent a request for a key and were ignored."

On the upside, Quill has nearly 245k and is making the LP thanks to requests from subscribers, so that's something. I might be one of those who pick up the game if I like it enough (I have a big backlog and mostly buy on deals because of the economy here, so no promises).  Sorry, he only did a let's try. I'll go and look at some other LPs. Sorry about that. Ruler does look like it could be more interesting, at least it's not the same thing over again.  Good luck, either way."

I don't think you understand how PR companies work in this instance. I understand the not throwing money around but. We opt into the lists and go through selecting various catagories of interest. I have never once felt ""spammed"" by a PR company iv opted into recieving emails from (Heck im lucky to get 2 a month from the same) if we felt like they were spamming us. We would just get ourselves removed from the list. Im not joking when i say its 3 button clicks to do it (Iv had to do it because I changed emails once) I think your casting your definition too wide if you think that its spammy to use PR companies."
4Xgaming,32qjso,Firgof,2,Thu Apr 16 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"You're correct, I do not.  I know only what I knew of them - which is that they're spammy.  Whether that was an incorrect perception or not at the time is immaterial though it is good to know that it was incorrect.  Regardless, I wouldn't have considered it because at the time that is what I thought."
4Xgaming,32qjso,Kailvin,-3,Fri Apr 17 00:11:24 2015 UTC,Now. I apologies if I came off abrasive in my first post but I am trying to drive the point home that what you did was no where near enough unfortunetly there are so many games released all the time that you do need to either spend lots of time or some money to get noticed.  Some resources for you in the future: http://www.gamespress.com/ this has lists of... Well everything.  Also the most probably well known PR company (and one of the best from the emails iv gotten IMO) http://www.evolve-pr.com/  Unfortunetly my point in the first post that its too late is still quite probably true. But if you do make a third game. I can at least try to help you there.
4Xgaming,32qjso,Firgof,6,Thu Apr 16 21:48:13 2015 UTC,"What is your 'driving the point home' meant to do?  What do you mean 'in the future'?  I really don't even understand why you're debating these things.  Did you read at all what the OP linked to?  Are you offering me a job?  This studio is dead unless the sales pick up for this title.  There won't be 'a future'.  There won't be a Blind Mind Studios much less a 'Star Ruler 3'.  There'll be an expansion, yes, but beyond that we don't have the money to risk starting up a new title if the trend continues - even with potential sales from the expansion.   either spend lots of time or some money to get noticed   We didn't have lots of time or much money.  Or expertise.  We spent what money we had and I used all the time, knowledge, and contacts I had.  Your posts aren't just abrasive from your attitude (you come off as quite arrogant) - they're abrasive because I can't even see the real point of them.  Hindsight is 20/20 sure but stuff like this:   There is lots of things you did not try.   Is literally just rubbing salt in the wound to rub salt in the wound especially when you say ""it's already too late, give up"" to paraphrase.  Well if it's already too late it doesn't matter what we didn't try, does it?  In that context, all you're doing is gloating, dancing on our soon-to-be corpse while saying 'well I could've done better and you should be fired!  Why weren't you me, Firgof?  Why weren't you me.  God, you're awful at everything - you deserve this'.  Regardless of your intent, that is how you're coming off.  Now I imagine that's not what you wanted to intone, and that's not the message you wanted to send, but here we are and I'm trying very hard to not take you the wrong way.  I'm not out of faith that the gaming community can't turn this around, despite your loud reservations and observations, and I don't think it's 'too late'.  I think we're close - but we're not dead yet - but in any case lampooning our past decisions and lack of expertise/money does nothing useful for us or the game.  If we're going to have this talk, I'd at least like it to be productive - so try to keep the above in mind.  Also, checked our spam: Nothing there either.  Definitely something going wrong with the mail server.  Please contact your friends and let them know we're sorry for the technical difficulties, that keys are available if they want them, and they can contact me directly via the e-mail address above."
4Xgaming,32qjso,Kailvin,-1,Thu Apr 16 23:55:10 2015 UTC,Again I would like to apologies. I have been less then helpful even though that was my intent. I tend to be overly pessimistic (Also had no idea you had an expansion) but your right. Your not dead yet. Let me give you every bit of helpful advice I can because you are clearly passionate about your work. So I hope you succeed. (Its always nice to see more stratagy games too.)   Cast a WIDE net. If its a channel with 100+ subs who might like the game?. Give them a copy. If its 10k+ Offer them say an extra 5 copies for a giveaway. Get creative. Heres an example. A fairly popular streamer called Cohhcarnage lets developers donate copies of their games to be put into a raffle live on the channel. He usually has 3-6K viewers depending on the time of day. For a few copies of the game you could potentially get lots of people to hear the name. Which is what you are after. I know Dansgaming does something similar but more personalized. I can't stress this enough. But more give-aways. You have a peak of 360 people on steam playing. I have never even heard of star ruler until today. Thats your problem. People need to hear about it and often. The best way to get attention? Free things. It may be tempting to look at them as lost sales. But lets be real here. Theres about 100m active steam users. Youd be hoping to get 0.1% of all steam users to buy your game. Enough to net you roughly 2mil. The odds of you actually losing a sale as a result of a give-away is extremely low. But you get someone who might play and like it. Then talk about it. Word of mouth is power. Get it into peoples hands. Get the name into their minds. Market to streamers/youtubers. They are people too and tactics work on them too. Heres some example: Magicka: Wizard wars hosted a pre-release press exclusive weekend. Where there was only PR/Developer/LPer/Streamers. Darkest dungeon had a week of torment where youtubers and streamers were encouraged to put stuff out. Its far easier to do this then marketing to the wide public (Say google ads like you tried) as people are un-attentive for the most part while youtubers/streamers are constantly being vigilant for new things. They can be easier to influence if done right. Multiplayer and collabs. We eat that up. Tell youtubers that you will give a copy to any other channel they wanna do a collab with. Even ask them to contact you if they want their name to be added to a list you can give out to people who wanna do collabs. Which you can give out to people. Play cupid and set people up. Nonstandard social media. Like reddit. We talked about this before with things like /r/letsplay and some of the assosiated subreddits (There I believe is one spesificly for indie devs to give codes away to LPers) Heck. Try /r/pcmasterrace if you can frame your giveaway right. Could work.   I hope these 6 ideas will help you market the expansion. I stuck to cheap hopefully not too time consuming tasks. Remember the main point though. Get people playing it. A good game sells itself. Your job is to get people to know it exists and hear about it enough to check it out.  I can't really give you advice for dealing with websites and publishing outlets as I lack experience in that field. Sorry the best I can do is help with youtube/twitch stuff.  Finally I would like to again apologies for my bad attitude. (Figured out I am canadian yet?) It was wrong of me and I hope you can find something useful from my more. Optimisitc advice.

4Xgaming,32qjso,Firgof,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:16:39 2015 UTC,"We didn't ignore Marbozir.  If he sent an e-mail, it didn't arrive. We have no explanation for why it didn't - it should've told him when he sent it there was a server error at the least - or he just plain sent it to the wrong address which, if the image posted is accurate, isn't possible either.  Beyond that I already told the guy above that if he - or anyone else the guy knows - did in fact send a request for a key to re-send it to the address I provided and we'd look into getting them a key.  Kailivin even knows that Marbozir knows that we saw that image - which means he also knows the offer is open.  I don't see any e-mails sitting in my inbox - so I'm not sure what to take away from all this but regardless: Whatever happened, it wasn't because we ignored him or anyone else.  The only possible explanation we can even think of is that they're mailing from a domain or subdomain that's been blacklisted because it's being used by spam bots or something - and so the message got filtered before it even got to our inbox - or some sort of arcane network glitch where the mail is sitting in a server somewhere which decided to not forward it to its destination or something like that."

4Xgaming,32qjso,Eviljim,2,Thu Apr 16 16:22:12 2015 UTC,The first Stardrive was RTS/4x and it was the best done portion of the game I think.  Stardrive 2 is turn based with real-time combat.    So maybe I am splitting hairs a bit.

4Xgaming,32qjso,Kermit-Batman,3,Thu Apr 16 14:01:07 2015 UTC,Star drive 2 has the advantage of playing it safe and putting a new face on MOO2. Style is cheaper than innovation.

To me it seems like it takes some risks, has good mod support and in my opinion is much better then stardrive 2.   I'd maybe recommend it as a alternative to distant worlds.   Anybody with a passing interest In space games should give it a shot. As Magnnus said, losing this developer would be a shame."
4Xgaming,32qjso,jimmahdean,5,Wed Apr 15 22:58:29 2015 UTC,It's pretty clear that when looking for turn-based 4X people (in general not necessarily anyone here) just want to play MOO2 over and over again. Innovative 4x games with mechanics that vary too much from the standard model tend to fail pretty badly.
4Xgaming,32qjso,roboczar,-10,Thu Apr 16 01:30:37 2015 UTC,"Then it's pretty clear that MOO2 did something very, very right, and 4x developers need to follow that example instead of take the risks and try to reinvent the wheel."

Star Ruler 2 (never played the original) is a great and innovative game, a very worthy contribution to the 4x genre. If I didn't already have it, I'd buy it just to support them.

4Xgaming,32qjso,daguito81,6,Thu Apr 16 23:52:30 2015 UTC,That's correct.  We MIGHT shut down if our sales do not reverse trend and significantly increase.  It's not definite yet - it's just looking very likely unless something in the near future changes our visibility and sales dramatically - which is still possible if unlikely.

I doubt Eternal lords will be discounted much more than it is in the collector's edition right now. Perhaps the summer sale will list the DLC's at 50% off instead of the 33 they are at now, but all in all that's not really that much. Perhaps $7-8 cheaper if you wait until summer? Obviously this is all speculation, might be that we get the exact same deal.  I'd say get it now, but I'm heavily biased by thinking the game is too awesome to pass up at the current price.  EDIT: To put into perspective: Since I originally bought AoW3 on GoG, I have to buy the expansions there as well. On GoG, this was 20 USD, which I happily paid because I really enjoy the game. So for just 16 dollars more, you'll be getting the expansion I paid 20 for, in addition to the base game, the first expansion, and the deluxe DLC. I'd say that's worth it :)"

4Xgaming,32l2pj,Familion,2,Wed Apr 15 01:00:41 2015 UTC,Thanks! Also what about the campaigns vs scenarios vs random maps?
4Xgaming,32l2pj,Familion,3,Wed Apr 15 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Campaign is the story mode of the game. Here you will follow the game's plot on fixed maps, and the objectives of each map can vary a lot from map to map. You will play as a specific leader and race, and once you complete a map in the campaign, that leader (and other non-leader but important side characters) will carry over their levels and items into the next map in the campaign.  There are a total of four campaign to play: 2 from the original game (Elves and Humans), 1 from Golden Realms(Halflings), and 1 from Eternal Lords (Frostlings). If you're interested in campaigns, The Elven Court is the best place to start, and this will even teach you a bit about the game during the early missions.   Next up are Scenarios. These are constructed fixed maps just like the campaigns, but they are completely standalone, have no real story to them, and function like any random map. You start off with one or more cities, a leader, etc. You are not restricted to only one race/class like in the campaigns, but rather are presented a choice of what's available in that specific scenario (For example, there might be a scenario pitting Tigrans vs Frostlings, and you'll be able to play as any one of them.)   Lastly, there are the random maps. This is the meat of the game, in my opinion (In any 4x, really). Unlike in Scenarios, here the map generator will generate a map for you, and you can play as any race and class combination you want. You can also customize the generator before the game starts, to affect how the terrain will be like, starting resources, number of heroes, etc. 95% of my time in AoW3 has been spent on random maps."
4Xgaming,32l1tz,LordArchibald,3,Tue Apr 14 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of time decisions in games like GalCiv come down to a good/evil choice, with varying degrees between. I'm kind of bored of that. Maybe make the choices pit different worlds in your empire against each other? Make you pick who gets emergency supplies and who faces starvation, which in turn raises loyalty in one world but make rebellion more likely on the other? Another idea might be to have the audience choices affect factions within your empire. Some decision might carry an awesome bonus, but if you pick it a rival faction will gain influence over a world and be in better position to threaten you."
4Xgaming,32l1tz,Smurph269,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good/evil does not make much sense for a ruler (if you are too soft hearted & don't make the population do their obligations (taxes, military service) the empire will fall and aliens will enslave/eat the whole population; so which one is good and which is evil kind of does not make sense here)."
4Xgaming,32l1tz,POTUS_Washington,2,Tue Apr 14 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"Just throwing this out here:  What if the game mechanic is that while there is whole fair of races pros/cons, what if those decisions are prompted by every 10 turns (but the player can perform certain actions to speed it up)- and each of those decisions have wider effects on the game- like a slow crawl toward a number of governments. If you choose the science based choices throughout the options, you'll have a lot more benefits in science as a technocracy, but you'll give up certain aspects rather than allowing the player to just be any government.  Hell, you could make it crawl toward democracy which would be interesting too.  Essentially, the player will always start as an Empire- but rather than forcing the player to have traditions based on the past, the player can create traditions based on ongoing events.  Also,  I do love the idea that you're given certain perks and traits from the options though. This is just an extension of that idea."
4Xgaming,32l1tz,POTUS_Washington,1 point,Wed Apr 15 02:53:59 2015 UTC,"Traditions... Sounds nice.   I was thinking of ""values"": respect, terror, justice, liberty/freedom, order, benevolence, dignity, honour, wisdom, bureaucracy, efficiency, initiative, invention. These represent how people see you as the emperor. But maybe traditions of the whole empire is better...  How these could work? Like if you accumulate a lot of ""Economy tradition points"" it would make your people more productive?"
4Xgaming,32l1tz,POTUS_Washington,2,Sat Apr 18 18:49:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Like while most 4x games let you tech a certain path, but most end with a domination victory. This adds a bit to the 4x formula in the sense that if you're spending a good portion of the game just industrializing and optimizing, your empire may have a lot of tradition in being industrious, but compared to a person who spent the early days raiding, your ships are just going to be weaker.   If you're diplomatic, then perhaps you have new powerful options when it comes to diplomacy. I like the idea of how people see you as the emperor- and then you could do another bit on traditions of the empire as a whole. It would seem like it has a more custom ""this is my empire- and my playstyle"" kind of game."
4Xgaming,32l1tz,MilitaryDivination,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:28:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe there should be two kind of stats: imperial traditions and how people see the emperor (especially respect)?   Traditions being: militaristic, industrious, justice, liberty, order/law, commerce, knowledge (need better names for these).  Emperor's stats being: respect, dignity, charisma, popularity (same as charisma?), honour, benevelence.  And during audience you are asked to ressolve some petty disputes (like farmers vs bankers), which affects which tradition goes up and which goes down. Also, you need to pay with your personal starts (respect, dignity) if you want to make a needed change which is unpopular/cheap (like reducing funding for the palace reduces your dignity which affects how alien ambassadors see you)."

4Xgaming,32icuc,nolok,3,Tue Apr 14 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"I am genuinely curious as to how you found meaningful enjoyment of of Endless Space. I was involved in the G2G project from the start, but when push comes to shove that series falls into many more harmful traps than Stardrive. The diplomacy was nonsensical, the ship design was oversimplified and the strategic depth was non-existent. Expansion was for its own sake, and state on state warfare was the unending spam of meaningless fleets in an empty universe that felt devoid of life.   I think Endless Legend went some way to a better option, but at least Star Drive manages to have a personality and provides an infinitely more engaging combat system. I think when we finally get some means with which we can compare ourselves to rival empires, get value tweaks on the diplomatic system and a refinement (well basically removal, as it is pretty poor) of the ground combat system (which is totally circumnavigable and ill admit is a pile of pish), then you might be approaching Galciv levels of fun."

If you are really into huge, expansive games with lots of calculated strategy, then it doesn't really fit the bill.

The game is as close as you can get to real-time in terms of a turn-based title, and so expect encounters with other races early on and often."

I want it to feel like, say, I'm playing real humanity in our galaxy and trying to design spaceships to fight battles against aliens while colonizing the stars. There better be more stars etc than in galactic civilizations 2, cause in that game, depite the good things about it, the galaxies were so small i couldn't play it. Why can't people make good space 4 x games?   Also its too late cause I've already bought it, cheaper since I got the first game, which I can't remember why I stopped playing."
4Xgaming,32icuc,Mouon,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:17:10 2015 UTC,"Well Distant Worlds has 1400 stars with thousands of planets and moons and asteroids (and people wonder why it's a laggy game), Star Ruler 1 and 2 can let you play on 10,000 star galaxies, if you're that demented.  And I think SoTS lets you play with a bunch of stars."
4Xgaming,32icuc,daveyg2611,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"Number of stars isn't the only factor though, I like being able to design your own ships and customize your faction, and Stardrive 2 seems good for that."

4Xgaming,32icuc,daveyg2611,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:43:10 2015 UTC,"So I've read your review and watched quill18's ""Let's try"", and my one question is: Why should I play this over MoO2?  This is not meant to be hostile, I'm genuinely wondering. My impression without having played it myself is that it's basically trying to be a remake of MoO2. And apart from real time combat (which probably is a matter of preference) I don't see a reason to prefer this one. Am I missing something?"
4Xgaming,32icuc,Familion,2,Wed Apr 15 09:12:20 2015 UTC,"Nope, it really is a MoO2 remake. They both certainly have different strengths/weaknesses, but the dev was always clear that it was his clear inspiration and the games are hugely similar.  For me, its the updated feel and gameplay that make it worth it. It also, unlike MoO2, has the potential for expansion and the dev is open to ideas & player feedback, so that is a plus.  In short, if you're die-hard on MoO2 and you're not really looking for something like it, then no, I wouldn't necessarily say it stands out. I'd try Star Ruler 2 if you're looking for something more unique with mechanics/gameplay"
4Xgaming,32icuc,TartanZergling,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:44:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that was very helpful! Guess I will wait and see how the game develops, then :)  And yeah, Star Ruler 2 is also on my list - unfortunately I have quite a backlog to work through..."
4Xgaming,32icuc,daveyg2611,0,Wed Apr 15 16:53:36 2015 UTC,"I think if Zero gives it the adoration is deserves, and runs Galciv style expansions that further differentiate races then Stardrive really could become the industry standard. It does have a number of very fundamental and easy to fix bugs with some combat, diplomatic and economic values. If you have Zero's contact details then I'd say advocate for change! With these small development teams, a well reasoned list of tweaks or ideas can have a big impact."
4Xgaming,32icuc,Rocenax,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:47:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that it has a ton of potential. Zero is very open to feedback, so I hope we'll see some great changes and additions in the future."

4Xgaming,32fovi,MiracleWhippit,4,Mon Apr 13 18:11:47 2015 UTC,I put so many hours into SotS. Designing the ships and the combat was just so fun.
4Xgaming,32fovi,Commodorez,4,Tue Apr 14 01:16:07 2015 UTC,"The only thing I really disliked about SotS was the cleanup phase. Once you have these massive fleets and you're guaranteed to win it just takes... forever to mop up the galaxy.  Ship customization was somewhat limited (forced into mission sections was a limitation I hoped they would change in SotS2... instead of the abomination they spawned) but the limits helped streamline the process. The variety of weapons and mission sections encouraged you to specialize which was awesome.  I loved the space battles. Seeing all the different weapon types, specifically targeting weapons or sections to disable enemy ships... it had so many flaws but I still enjoyed it so much. The limited amount of ships in battle at once meant that even a smaller force stood a chance against an armada of ships.  The game had my favorite research setup. It was somewhat hard to learn early on but with every expansion they added new tech that was really enjoyable to discover while playing.   Yep... lots of fond memories of SotS1"
4Xgaming,32fovi,MiracleWhippit,5,Tue Apr 14 12:37:49 2015 UTC,"I for one liked the mission sections.  It was another subtle way each race was different from each other in that game.  If it was completely open like building everything like legos, the whole system would be too vulnerable to min-maxing and all the races would just be different skins of the same things."
4Xgaming,32fovi,FiveDogNight,3,Tue Apr 14 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"Does it take much to be better than Endless Space though? It was a good game initially but the longer you play, you realise that the game has no substance, no depth."
4Xgaming,32fovi,Hambeggar,4,Thu Apr 16 05:14:37 2015 UTC,"I just think everyone needs to stop bringing up MOO2 like its the end all be all.    Yes it was amazing for its time and was a benchmark, but we deserve more than what a game from the mid-nineties can provide.  So many important innovations have happened in 4x genre since then."
4Xgaming,32fovi,FiveDogNight,2,Tue Apr 14 22:51:39 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to nostalgia.  Lots of us started PC gaming in the 90s. It was a whole new idea for us then, and now everything is just another rehash.  I look at something like EverQuest, Anarchy Online, or vanilla WoW and think nothing has lived up to those experiences for me, even though a lot of the newer MMOs have more everything. I don't think there will be another MMO that will ever compare.  On top of that... there's the whole time thing. Those of us from that generation either have kids, a full time job, a house, or something else pulling us away from computer games. I'm lucky to play 5 hours a week. I've put basically no time into games like Age of Wonders 3, Dominions 4, Endless Legend, EU4, The Last Federation, Massive Chalice, Civ 5, Civ: BE, Warlock + Warlock 2, and Wargame: Red Dragon. My backlog is basically a hundred games long.  Anyway... that's me."
4Xgaming,32fovi,MiracleWhippit,2,Tue Apr 14 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"moo2 is actually an old benchmark.  if a modern game gets compared unfavorably to moo2 consistently, then we can conclude that it sucks."
4Xgaming,32fovi,tomassavage,3,Wed Apr 15 17:21:07 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I guess what I was really getting at is the old moo2 game mechanics just don't cut it anymore (for me).  I just wish people stopped trying to remake that game or expect developers to remake it.  However you've convinced me that it is still relevant as a benchmark.
4Xgaming,32fovi,FiveDogNight,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:49:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially in the game's current state.  After a good three games (two restarted pretty quickly) I won't be touching SD2 until the modders finish the game (yet again) for Zero.  Diplomacy, ground combat, research, and after the last play-through, space combat all need major balancing and overhauls.  Research tree is just ill thought out, requiring tech-trading with nations you are warring with for most of the game.  Every 4x game I play is beat by full domination, Its how I play.  However, I enjoy having different flavors of gameplay during my world conquest, and after conquering 80% of the galaxy on Hard, the only way to play this game is militarily.  Diplomacy is just bad.  I won't be funneling funds into enemies of my enemy (at war) to further drain an empire.  I don't have grand coalitions putting a stop to my unfettered fleet conquering everything in its path.  And dear god do I wish autoresolve AI wasn't atrocious.  The space battles have become just tedious with very little actual tactical play.  Don't get me started on the 'random events' that are scripted to happen EXACTLY the same EVERY game on a specific turn.  Just blah.  The metacritic userscore is a 5.4 and there have been a total of three reviews for this game in over a week.  5.4 is where i'd rate this game.  The next best 4x (what this review implies). Yea the hell right.  Distant Worlds: U, SWoTS, Endless Space, and GalCiv 2 absolutely trump SD2, by millions of miles."

4Xgaming,32fovi,Laxxium,7,Mon Apr 13 15:21:08 2015 UTC,"I like designing the ships. It gives a level of tactical planning and importance of fleet composition most 4x games lacks. For example, you can design artillery frigates with poor armor to hang back and batter the enemy while tough ships with little weaponry occupy them."
4Xgaming,32fovi,FargoFinch,4,Mon Apr 13 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"Yah I can understand the appeal. It just doesn't appeal to me. I'm more interested in managing systems, politics and conquering then  building the ships."
4Xgaming,32fovi,Laxxium,3,Mon Apr 13 19:22:48 2015 UTC,"I am torn. I don't like making ships piece by piece like in this game, but I don't mind in some games like Distant Worlds or MOO2.   Even then DW sometimes goes to far, especially when the research churn means spending as much time in the ship builder as doing almost anything else. The AI in DW is quite good, but still if you don't research the correct tech for your race you could be using crappy guns because the AI thinks you are a beam focused race while you have been researching missiles because you missed that single line in the race description.  For the most part I don't care where in the ship a component goes but I like to specify a load-out in a general sense. If I could just setup a ""class"" of ship and let the game do the hard work for me that would be great."
4Xgaming,32fovi,ValiantElectron,4,Mon Apr 13 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"For the most part I don't care where in the ship a component goes but I like to specify a load-out in a general sense.    Me too, it's starting to get annoying in Star Ruler 2.  I really don't give a crap about the exact placement of 128 hexes worth of equipment, it makes ship design a huge pain in the dick.    I think SR2 would be much better served with a SPAZ type damage system- shields for the whole ship, four armor sectors, four hull integrity sectors.  Or even a Battletech/Aerospace system for critical hits.  If someone could make a mod that scraps the whole thing, that'd be great.   The AI in DW is quite good, but still if you don't research the correct tech for your race you could be using crappy guns because the AI thinks you are a beam focused race while you have been researching missiles because you missed that single line in the race description.   If you make a design with only laser weapons and hit 'upgrade' on that design every time you get new laser weapons it will upgrade to those lasers.  Same for every component.  I assume you're using the auto design/upgrade system?"
4Xgaming,32fovi,SharkMolester,3,Mon Apr 13 23:31:30 2015 UTC,"If you make a design with only laser weapons and hit 'upgrade' on that design every time you get new laser weapons it will upgrade to those lasers. Same for every component. I assume you're using the auto design/upgrade system?   It's been awhile, but if I remember correctly the issue I was having was in the early game where I would: 1) get a new system (say shields or hyper drive) 2)hit upgrade and not see the MK change 3) Get frustrated and take over. It was not too hard, DW has enough else going for it that it didn't bother me too much. I only mention it because the topic is ship design.  My ideal ship design might look something like sliders or triangle sliders for things like Speed/Maneuver/Armor then for Shields/Fire Power/Life Support then Beam/Rail/Missle and so on. Have tech give bigger pools of points being divvied up or have a multiplier where for example 'shields 2' gives a 1.5x or 2x bonus. So for awhile you would have better shields then everyone else for less power trade-off. Or use a MoO2 model of not letting people get every tech, so if you bypass better shields you have to makeup for it in power or maneuver to get the same 'shield points'.   I have not really thought that through though so there are probably a ton of reasons why that might not be fun or end up too 'game-able'"

There are a few people around here that defend this to the death and try and glaze over the facts but the dev really fucked up.

4Xgaming,32fcgu,karmakut,9,Mon Apr 13 09:51:17 2015 UTC,"Star Ruler 2 is really doing it for me. The economic system is pretty radical in terms of a traditional 4x ""build these ten things on most every planet"". But once you get used to it it's pretty deep and satisfying to build up certain planets and manage the entire empire as a whole.  The graphics are pretty good even close up, and there's no limit to the number of ships in each fleet (as far as I know), so fleet-fleet battles easily go into hundreds, and probably even thousands of ships, each with individual firing lasers, projectiles etc.  Of your list I've tried Endless Space, Star Ruler 2, Sins, and have played the older version of Homeworld. Endless Space was good, but the combat sequences were not as satisfying. Sins is good but maybe more of a play a session that's fun and then it's over with.  The only thing is Star Ruler 2's interface and system take a little while to learn all the information you need to control more and more of your empire.  Edit: If you like diplomacy and manipulating other empires etc. Galactic Civilizations II was good for that, but maybe Gal Civ III will be good too (it's still in beta.)"

As for star ruler 2, the issue I have with it is the entire concept of diplomacy- or at least the part where you can annex entire systems. I was able to beat a full map with just spamming the ""Annex System"" card over and over again due to my extremely high amount of money going over to influence followed by extremely powerful defense stations.  If you like combat and action, I'd say Star Drive 2.

It has ship customisation as well and generally pretty interesting game mechanics.   I don't really rate Sins of a Solar Empire that highly. Homeworld Remastered is RTS, not 4X, if that matters to you.  Edit: I haven't played any of the other three, how do they compare to Endless Space?"

It does have excellent, clear mechanics, a great aesthetic and a well designed interface, however.   Star Drive II   Not really, not in its current state.   Distant Worlds   You'll need some gear for the learning cliff, but the game is fantastic. You can also automate everything in it, so if you don't feel like being Emperor, you can just control one ship and explore strange new worlds filled with stuff that wants to kill you and fuck the corpse. Great mods, too, but the interface will eat you alive.   Star Ruler 2   The game is meh, but you can build ships bigger than your galaxy.   Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion   Sloooooow for an rts, a bit too simple for a 4x. One thing to keep in kind is it's almost entirely focused on multiplayer. A multiplayer that requires you to set an entire day apart to play a game or two.   Homeworlds Remastered   Get this. It's a cult classic for a reason. HOWEVER, don't play the remastered campaign for homeworld one. It uses the sequel's engine, resulting in half the things not working right.

4Xgaming,32dulw,leadpoisoned,18,Sun Apr 12 23:47:14 2015 UTC,"You could try a mod like Realism Invictus for Civ 4. It has a more historical slant and it's possible to play fairly peacefully. IIRC there are more diplomacy options to facilitate this.  Also, you could look into some of the Paradox Games, like Europa Universalis 4, Victoria 2 or Crusader Kings 2.   Not strictly 4X in the classic sense, but they might be more geared to what you want. It's possible to play these games more peacefully than most other strategy games. Victoria 2 in particular is all about economic and political management, so while you might occasionally get dragged into war or put down a revolt, it's not the main focus of the game. While a game will inevitably have diversions from actual history, Paradox are pretty good at building a reasonably accurate historical starting point.  They are a step up in complexity from your average 4X game, though."
4Xgaming,32dulw,ceeker,5,Mon Apr 13 01:18:13 2015 UTC,"I was going to suggest the Paradox GSGs too cause I still consider them 4x, though they go about the 4 x's in different ways.  Darkest Hour is a good one as well, and the Kaiserreich mod is a good reason to get it."
4Xgaming,32dulw,templeflesh,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:21:29 2015 UTC,"Darkest Hour is absolutely fantastic and my personal favourite, especially with KR or the NWO mod. But it's primarily conflict based, which is why I didn't suggest it."
4Xgaming,32dulw,ceeker,7,Mon Apr 13 02:53:30 2015 UTC,"You will absolutely dislike Age of Wonders 3, because it's 90% combat and 10% everything else.  I would suggest Galactic Civilizations 2 (not 1 or 3). It has a smart AI (one of the best in the genre) and a good empire building mechanic. It's also entirely possible to win without ever having gone to war. Though you may have to build a military as a deterrent from other people going to war with you.  Paradox games would also be a great fit. Specifically Crusader Kings 2, because it is really more of a diplomacy and courtly-drama simulator than an actual empire-building game. But watch some LetsPlays of it, because I've vastly under-sold how complex and interesting this game is."
4Xgaming,32dulw,Terkala,5,Mon Apr 13 03:22:52 2015 UTC,"I actually think OP might like AoW 3. I have a similar approach to 4X games as him, and I absolutely love the AoW series. Why?  First, since AoW is focused almost entirely on combat, my brain ends up focusing there as well. If AoW had cultural or economic victory conditions, I'm sure I'd be trying to go for those, but it doesn't (which is a good thing IMHO), so instead I play the game for what it is, and end up having a ton of fun with it.  Second, Civ IV and V (and Civ in general, I guess) have got absolutely atrocious combat. AoW, on the other hand, has got arguably the best combat of any 4X I've played. I sometimes wonder if half the reason why I'm such a pacifist in civ games is because war is such a PITA. I have no problem with conquering people in AoW because war is, you know, actually fun. Hell, the tactical combat is by far the greatest strength of AoW in general and AoW 3 in particular.   All of this is to say that they're two very different games and the fact that he dislikes warring in Civ doesn't necessarily mean that he won't enjoy Age of Wonders (or Endless Legend, or Heroes of Might and Magic, or whatever other 4X game that revolves mostly around combat - curiously enough, most of which are fantasy)"
4Xgaming,32dulw,MilesBeyond250,2,Mon Apr 13 18:16:40 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that GalCivs III is set to leave beta in about a month. While OP should absolutely start with II for price reasons, III is shaping up very nicely."
4Xgaming,32dulw,Tainlorr,3,Mon Apr 13 12:12:14 2015 UTC,"Everything I've heard about 3 is ""Exactly like 2, but flashier"". So until that changes, it makes more sense to recommend the 2nd one because the price is so much less."
4Xgaming,32dulw,Terkala,2,Mon Apr 13 16:06:47 2015 UTC,Yep! I totally agree.
4Xgaming,32dulw,Tainlorr,4,Mon Apr 13 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I would say Civ is the series that provides the most opportunity for peacefully building up an empire. Others have mentioned Paradox games, and yeah that's definitely a possibility, but they do tend to be pretty war-heavy as well. Victoria 2 might be the best option here, as it's the game where IMHO economic, industrial, and cultural development are the most emphasized. It's also a fair bit more complex than EU or CK, so be warned.  That being said, you might actually really enjoy Age of Wonders. I'm kind of similar to you in that I prefer to play peacefully in games like Civ and GalCiv, but ironically I absolutely love the AoW series and might actually rank it as my favourite 4X series.   Why? Because when economic and cultural development aren't paths to victory, the part of my brain that wants to go after those things just switches off.  Plus, Civ IV and V both have got absolutely atrocious combat, whereas IMHO AoW 3 has the best combat of any 4X I've ever played, and its predecessors aren't too far behind it. In AoW games I actually want to go to war, just because fighting battles is the most enjoyable part of the game, whereas in Civ wars feel like a distraction from what I actually want to do."
4Xgaming,32dulw,MilesBeyond250,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:35:44 2015 UTC,"See, that's what I'd like to hear in regard to AoW. How similar is the combat to Heroes of Might and Magic? And is the exploration and diplomacy at the least serviceable?"
4Xgaming,32dulw,MilesBeyond250,2,Mon Apr 13 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"Fairly similar to HoMM. In terms of the actual combat, the systems have a lot alike. AoW 3 tends to have a lot more to it there, I think, in between larger battlefields and a lot more unit abilities. Also, units can move independently - i.e. you don't need to have a hero shepherding them around.  Exploration IMHO is great. AoW 3 has far and away the best RMG in the series, and it makes the random maps really interesting to explore. There's all sorts of interesting location sites to ferret out (or ignore). Plus AoW 3 really diversifies the different concealment options, as well as movement penalties and bonuses.  Diplomacy... Yeah. It's not AoW's strength, hahaha. That being said, the new expansion coming out - tomorrow, actually. Anyway, it's done a lot to make diplomacy more interesting. Independent cities in the game now function a bit more like city-states from Civ V, there's been a reworking of how your actions impact your relations with certain races (e.g. you can't go around burning down all the Goblin cities then expect other Goblin players or your own Goblin soldiers to like you), and there's a few more options for diplomacy with other players, as well.  I mention this because when the expansion drops, all of those changes are getting patched into the base game, as well, even if you don't own the expansion.  So to answer your question, diplomacy isn't the series forte, but it's certainly got more of a presence than, say, in Heroes, or in Civ 1 or 2."
4Xgaming,32dulw,MilesBeyond250,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:16:25 2015 UTC,"I think AoW 3 is one of those games where I'll wait until the ""final release"", i.e. until all the expansions are released. Got enough on my plate already with Chaos Reborn and freeware roguelikes and Total War and yeah.  Having said that, do you think I should skip AoW 2 like most people say and go straight to AoW 1 and AoW SM?"
4Xgaming,32dulw,MilesBeyond250,2,Mon Apr 13 06:20:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely skip AoW 2. SM is an expansion pack for 2. It's a standalone expansion, but an expansion nonetheless. Playing AoW 2 instead of SM is like playing Starcraft 1 without Brood War."

4Xgaming,32dulw,Ilitarist,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:05:53 2015 UTC,"It's not that AoW 2 is a bad game so much as AoW SM is literally just AoW2 with more and better stuff. More units, more abilities, more races, much better spellcasting system, more buildings, etc etc. More importantly, it's a much better balanced game. The big problem with AoW 2 is that the balance was atrocious, with four races being reasonable, four races being hilariously overpowered, and four races being absolutely awful. SM fixes all those issues and more.  Literally the only possible reason for buying AoW 2 is the campaign, which some people prefer to SM's.  Let me put it this way: Imagine Civ 5 BNW was a standalone expansion pack. Even if you don't own Civ 5, you can buy BNW and play it and it'd be the exact same experience as if you own Civ 5 and upgraded it to BNW. If that were the case, why would anyone ever buy Civ 5?  AoW 1, on the other hand, is a different story. It plays completely different from later games in the series, and IMHO it's worth picking up. It's definitely got more of a Warlords feel to it, if you ever played those games, in the sense that empire-building stuff is incredibly basic and the game is almost entirely focused on combat."
4Xgaming,32dulw,Ilitarist,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:23:04 2015 UTC,"Alright, then I'll join the hive mind consensus and get AoW 1 and SM. I've been trying Master of Magic on and off over the past few weeks, and I just can't do it. I'm usually no graphics whore, I love the simple sprites of NES classics and Heroes of Might and Magic released shortly after is very pleasing on the eyes, sadly MoM is a little too retro for me. I've read that AoW is basically MoM with tighter design and better graphics, so I think I'll enjoy myself with the series.  EDIT: Another question, is there a pressing need to buy AoW 3 yet? I'm content with being patient until all the expansions are out and there's a sale. I could play the game a decade from right now, no sweat off my back. But what of the multiplayer element? I can see that being a reason to jump on the bandwagon earlier. Do many people play? For that matter, do many people play AoW SM anymore? I don't typically consider 4X a good candidate for multiplayer, though with AoW's play-by-email feature I would make an exception."

I'd recommend Anno series to you (1404 is historical, 2070 is futuristic). It's realtime and combat is a very small part of those games.  There's also Colonization. It's very similar to Civ4 but combat only happens in finale and before that it's all about economics.  Of course there are also Paradox games like Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4. Wars are inevitable there but they're much more easy to control and mostly defined by your economy and politics."

4Xgaming,32dulw,VineFynn,2,Fri Apr 17 04:05:12 2015 UTC,"The Civ 5 expansions go a long way toward balancing conquest against other paths to victory.  I'm not sure how deep you've gone in 30 hours (most games, that's enough to ""complete"" the main game, but in Civ 5 that might only be one game at all) but combat dynamics change quite a bit in the modern era.  Also, though there is a difference of opinion on this, I much prefer Civ 5's tactics vs. stacking up an unstoppable horde on a single tile."

4Xgaming,32dulw,VineFynn,2,Mon Apr 13 14:57:12 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy 4x in a Fantasy setting, you'll definitely enjoy Endless Legend. The combat takes a back seat to story telling and diplomacy, and there's plenty of ways to win without ever fighting anyone."
4Xgaming,32dulw,boredatworkbasically,2,Mon Apr 13 18:03:50 2015 UTC,"Hard to tell. Only really know if you try them. I don't really like GalCiv and don't play Civ much outside of the Fall from Heaven mod for Civ 4 either, but I love other 4x games like Distant Worlds, Endless Legend, Dominions 4, etc."

Civ V is honestly the best all-rounder I've played... although that's only after Brave New World, that really ups the diplomacy game"
4Xgaming,32dulw,HotWaterAgent,3,Mon Apr 13 12:59:36 2015 UTC,"Civ is probably one of the simplest and most unrealistic 4X series. Practically every other 4X, with the notable exception of Age of Wonders or Total War, has more depth.

In fact civ 5 has a civ that can only win peacefully since they (Venice) can only have 1 city rendering domination impossible and conquest useless but their ability to dominate trade and thus manipulate the ai civs makes them hands down one of the most powerful civs in the game. However to win peacefully requires you to understand how the diplomacy systems work and how to manipulate the ai for you own gain. I'm not saying you are wrong to dislike the game still though just trying to express that your dislike of the game prevented you from seeing all the depth that it indeed does have.
4Xgaming,32dulw,andreasn2,3,Mon Apr 13 03:41:00 2015 UTC,Venice still puppets. You can win domination quite handily with them.

4Xgaming,32dulw,Mouon,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:50:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the fourth X is ""exterminate"", so it will be difficult to find a 4X game that's not pressuring you to build an army. As others have suggested, games like Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings place the focus more on diplomacy and intrigue than traditional 4X games do.  That said, there are a few 4X games that allow you to win a peaceful victory. You might have noticed that Civ has a variety of victory conditions not involving extermination of your foes. In Space Empires IV, you can enable a variety of alternate victory conditions at game setup. For instance, there's a ""galaxy at peace"" victory condition which requires all empires to form a grand alliance, though practically speaking that means you'll probably have to get a bunch of empires to form an alliance and wipe out everyone who's not in your alliance! (You can of course sit back from the fighting and just support your allies economically, however...) There's also a score victory, which makes expansion the name of the game - build up your colonies, research all the techs, that sort of thing."

I also dislike the new terraforming system, where you get a grand total of ONE tile per tech, even though it looks like you get a ton, and since the higher tiers of it dont differentiate the types of terraformable tiles, when you get the 'get all soil enhancement tiles' tech, you wasted some extra spaces with the other higher terraformers.  So sad to see the tech descriptions are so bland, I was expecting the sass and snark of the GalCiv 2 ones.  I want GLaDOS to mock me for cheering that I got lasers or something."

4Xgaming,328v5u,_tpyo,44,Sat Apr 11 17:05:39 2015 UTC,"EU4, along with CK2, HOI3, Vic2, and a few other games are considered to be Grand Strategy Games. They're not focussed on expanding into empty space, except Vic2, or on exploring except Eu4, they're focussed very heavily on expanding into other AIs. The massive presence of hundreds of AIs rather than maybe dozens if you're being very generous in a 4X game makes them very different, hence the title Grand. There's a lot of overlap between 4X and Grand Strategy, but they're not considered to be one and the same."

There was a kickstarter level that included dlc so they are certainly planning dlc. I wanted to support new studios getting into the 4x market, but they are going to have to step up their game if they want to be around for a while."
4Xgaming,324r1i,LordArchibald,4,Fri Apr 10 15:55:55 2015 UTC,"Instead of thinking about it like a progression mechanic, maybe instead consider it like a collectors mechanic? As in, you can go around collecting items, and then ""socket them"" on planets for varying effects.   For inspiration, see Ark Upgrades in Anno 2070.  This gives the player a strategy for changing their artifact exploitation on the fly.  I would forsee that you could change a ship artifact by a refit.  Single-planet artifacts might be bind on equip, one equip only, so you'd have to destroy the first artifact to replace it.  Late game you could have synergistic effects built in that give extra bonuses when you are running multiple artifacts of the same (amplify promethian artifacts within 5 parsecs).  Lastly, I might suggest that installing artifacts on planets or ships should require extensive power or resource consumption. edit: because it always seems like you have so much ""stuff"" at the end of games of this type, and literally nothing to do with it except build terror stars and blow up all the planets.  Cheers"
4Xgaming,324r1i,thiosk,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, collection mechanic is usually a good one...  But the Ark upgrades in Anno 2070 seems so weak to me. Also ""socket item on a planet"" is so intiutive and unthematic. I like the idea of collector's mechanic, but, I don't know, not in this form I guess?"
4Xgaming,324r1i,thiosk,2,Sat Apr 11 19:21:46 2015 UTC,"Certainly. I think you'd have to flesh it out, im just using it as an analogy.  The way I think of it, artifacts should be vast, arcane engines~ our best science can neither determine their true purpose, or use them to their full potential. However, their power can be harnessed and slaved to our own diabolical purpose. The economy of the entire world devoted to the singular task of producing energy to power the device Decades to excavate, decades to study, expensive to install, but able to function for millenia  Or for a ship: you could discover an artifact that let you create a stable wormhole that enabled an entire fleet to create a wormhole and pass through it. Was the device designed to do this? who knows? Our scientists merely slaved the application to the opportunity, an d of course, lack the knowledge to replicate the effect.  I look for inspiration in the Warhammer 40k lore. Imperial scientists posess artifacts from all manner of cosmic epochs-- ancient necron devices evacuated from tomb worlds before they were overrun. They run decades-long research projects to find out how the item works and what it is for, and then use it to do something entirely different (before creating a new hazard that ultimately destroys the planet its on)  The mechanic should be utterly simplistic, but the framework around the mechanic can be as deep as you desire."
4Xgaming,324r1i,thiosk,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:03:58 2015 UTC,"So, first you find out where the ruins are, then you excavate these ruins (chance of artifact discovery), then you get these artifacts home (or keep on the planet if huge) and start research to try and understand how these works?  There would be three archeological resources involved then. Some survey team that look for ruins, archeologists that go down and excavate stuff and academics that sit in a comfortable lab and stare at the artifact for years :) And the player need some way to allocate these resources (like telling which artifact they should try to understand first)."

I'm looking for more of a sim-city/anno with a total war aspect to it (because lets face it, whats the point of civilizations if you can't bombard things)  Im just trying to give you an idea about what I think an artifact represents for a race. What does it mean to uncover a massive artifact? How will that change society?   Whether its something like i describe, or more like a found-tech, thats something that really depends on your game design decisions.   I am completely over the Sid Meier's Civilization model.

4Xgaming,324r1i,crasher_pt,6,Mon Apr 13 06:22:01 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could take some inspiration from Distant Worlds?   You can make ruins explorable by science ships, which spends a set amount of time at the planet to unlock the ruin bonus for the player. Ruins can also give hints/coordinates for the location of another site or two, so the player can follow a branching trail until the end. The science ships also has to be protected from pirates/empires/whatever while they investigate the ruins. Maybe several empires can be allowed to follow the same trail, which could make for some interesting encounters, stand-offs or battles as they compete over the same ruins.  I think this mechanic could make exploration more fun, as the player has to follow a goal and prepare an expedition. Usually in 4x games discovered worlds just kind of sit there until someone colonize them, but with incentive like what I am suggesting you can make the frontier a lot more interactive and important."
4Xgaming,324r1i,crasher_pt,3,Fri Apr 10 17:21:57 2015 UTC,"Have the effectiveness of the survey for ruins be dependent on the current knowledge of a particular type. Additionally, place a cost in the exploration (opportunity, economic, other) so that selecting to dig is actually a choice. From these emerges that he will see more of the type of ruin he chooses to explore."
4Xgaming,324r1i,crasher_pt,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:00:26 2015 UTC,So... basicly the player would have on average more ruins than ever possible to excavate and the bottleneck would be the archeologists capacity?
4Xgaming,324r1i,Hetzer,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, you don't need to have ruins just standing there waiting in order to get what you want. But if you cannot see them it's as if they didn't exist and therefore the efect of topography is less pronounced.  Say ruins from civ A are 4x more abundant above the equator while civ B it's the opposite. Assuming the number of ruins on both hemispheres is the same, you will be 4x more likely to find a civ A on a survey done in the north. But if the result also depended on the knowledge of said civ, this might bring down the relative odds in spite of the topological dependency.  The limiting factor is the survey ability."
4Xgaming,324r1i,CFGX,1 point,Sat Apr 11 06:54:07 2015 UTC,"There are two things:   1) you need to find out there are some ruins available for exacavation (random chance upon exploration, colonization, passage of time)  2) you excavate these to discover some goodies (accumulate knowledge of the ancient race)  I'm not sure what you mean, does the knowledge affect the chance of discovering the ruins exist or the chance of a successful excavation?"
4Xgaming,324r1i,Jaxck,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:28:20 2015 UTC,The first.
4Xgaming,324r1i,Jaxck,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe like this:  Around 20% of planets have some ruins, race A more likely on top and race B more on the bottom (just as you described). You have some setting ""focus on ancient race X"", it affects the chance of finding ruins of that race. Each turn your archeologists make ""ruins discovery checks"", it's per ancient race, not per planet. So if you focus you have a better chance to uncover where are the nearest ruins of that race (like if you found a new lead in ancient texts). Let's say you only discover up to 5 systems away from your most frontier planet.  In addition, if you have the planet colonized you get an additional free check (chance that local pops stumble upon these ruins), it disregards race/knowledge/etc."
4Xgaming,324r1i,Jaxck,1 point,Sun Apr 12 07:45:00 2015 UTC,Looks good :) good luck
4Xgaming,324r1i,csheldondante,2,Sun Apr 12 08:47:32 2015 UTC,"Why don't you change it so that ruins can be known to exist without being colonized?  Have the player do something (research a tech, construct a unit, etc) that reveals the location and type of ruins for a section of the map.  Then they can choose which planet(s) to colonize partly based on what ruins are available."
4Xgaming,324r1i,ran88dom99,2,Fri Apr 10 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe come up with some sort of espionage ability to smuggle research teams into ruins on the planets of other empires, to get the tech tree you want?"
4Xgaming,324r1i,ran88dom99,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:24:32 2015 UTC,"I guess that would make sense... While the player is limited by strategic constrains what/where to colonize, exploration is free from such limiters. So, choosing ruins excavation from everywhere on the map is logical from game design perspective... This would also allow ""excavation treaties"" (primitive aliens granting you the right to excavate ruins on their planets)  But there must be some inconvenience, like you can excavate ruins up to level/depth 3 (out of 9 levels possible) if not on an owned planet (each ruin can be excavated up to 9 times, each excavation having a chance of a discovery)."
4Xgaming,324r1i,teapotchampion,2,Fri Apr 10 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"It amazes me that so many sci-fi 4X games have a binary exploration system for planets. We've been studying Earth for thousands of years and we don't even know close to everything about our planet. You could have a whole spectrum of exploration levels, with more exploration meaning more ruins discovered faster, with potentially larger benefits. I'd also balance the game such that it is challenging and extremely expensive to colonize a whole planet, while small outposts are cheap. Archaeology would thus become a cheap way to gain value out of planets under your control. Making colonization more difficult also means that there are more planets to access per player, and thus higher likelihood of gaining access to all three ancient civs."

However, the rumors about ground combat seem to be true.   I like how the research and tech affects the ground combat, but it's just a bit of a pain in the ass to play it. I feel like a simpler, and faster ground combat would serve the game better. I get the feeling that the developer underestimated how much work it takes to have a proper X-COM style tactical combat game. It feels kind of tacked-on rather than fully fleshed out.  Either make ground combat simpler and faster (more abstract), or take another year to make such a game system properly imo."

4Xgaming,3235g3,Adalah217,8,Fri Apr 10 09:58:46 2015 UTC,"I'm liking it a lot, huge improvement over the first Stardrive in every way, except one... Ground combat!! While it's an interesting take and fun the first battle or two, right now it's just way too wonky and unpolished, it brings down the whole game in my opinion. The ground combat needs some serious upgrades to the UI and to performance in general, since it tends to hang when I make my units move or shoot, and I haven't experienced this performance issue anywhere else.  Other than that, combat is fun and feels more grounded in reality than the first game (no more light and ultra-fast Titans that can run circles around frigates and decimate entire fleets with disintegrators, as fun as that was), the colony management is much more interesting and meaningful, and I love the graphics and art style. I haven't messed with espionage much yet, but I do agree with others that diplomacy is a little limited. I also wish I could tell how other races feel about me, the first Stardrive had different meters for like trust and fear and stuff, but that's totally missing here from what I've seen.  One last thing, although this might just be me... I can't figure out how to beat the game!! I read something about a story victory with the portals that randomly appear, so far I've destroyed every fleet that's come out of the portals, studied two of the portals through research, but nothing happens when I take a fleet to the portals themselves. The only other option I can think of is conquest victory like in the first game (can't make federations I think), but that's going to take quite a while...  TL;DR: Overall awesome, a few minor things keep it from being equivalent to a major AAA title, but for an independent game this thing is beast. Worth the price on its own, even more so if you owned (and liked) the original game. If you're one of those people that's sore about the first game being incomplete or whatever (I more than got my money's worth out of the original, personally), watch some lets plays and see what you think."

4Xgaming,3235g3,ohfuckreddit,8,Mon Apr 20 18:30:56 2015 UTC,"The potential is there but my overall experience is best described as ""meh"". A nice effort, but ultimately just a mishmash of semi-polished game concepts that blend somewhat well.   Too many bugs or features missing, ground assault is so generic it's tedious, shipyard designs is completely borked and keeps the list from previous games (wtf?) coupled with rock-paper-scissor tech tree that doesn't gradually upgrades: No gradual computer upgrades for targeting, ECM and whatnot, too few engine techs, shields, etc. Can't rotate weapons forwards or backwards when placed in port or starboard, you have to use spinal mounts (again, wtf?). In terms of ship design, it's a slight level above Gratuitous Space Battles...  Colony management can become tedious as well, bad GUI that doesn't lend itself to fast navigation and queuing. The same tediousness from Moo2 is there, managing colonists in each areas, building structures ad nauseam. Colonies don't revert to building goods when not producing anything. (a feature that will be added soon I presume)  Hard cap of ground units directly linked to structures on planet. If your empire is small you pretty much have to bomb them out and recolonize, which further impedes your gains. Why not assign command points to ground units with the same mechanics as fleet? Decreased command points when garrisoned, pay a lot more when you cross over the CP limit. I'm pretty sure a hard limit of spaceships based on starbases would piss off players.  Audio is fucked as well, GNN is max loudness no matter what, random annoying noises. Again, this will probably get fixed with patches.  In its current state, I can't arse myself to finish a game, even in Endless Space I finished my games. I can't wait for the modding community to go active on this game, hell I'll mod it myself if I see the potential."

4Xgaming,3235g3,Und_Prob,6,Wed Apr 15 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"It needs a lot of work. There's potential for greatness, but right now there are too many random enemy events in the early game that you can't customize at all, so the entire experience is just annoying.  Also the AI is incredibly aggressive and completely ignores fleet limits, so you eventually just get steamrolled."
4Xgaming,3235g3,Stranger371,3,Fri Apr 10 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"I'm really liking Star drive 2.    The graphics/UI are the first thing that stands out, it's done well. The new CP (unit cap) that is expandible has a nice early game strategy to it. By the time endgame comes around you don't really care bout the CP price or have unlocked enough to be under the limit. That said it seems more balanced for Opteris than it does for the Vulfin with smaller ships ... gives you the feeling that you don't have a choice to play as the ""swarm"" type.    I enjoy killing everything and tend to ignore diplomacy so I can't really speak up about that part. The one time I did try to barter with someone I was fully disgusted (within reason: starting traits negative, killed millions of their race, ect). I didn't even have enough reputation to gift the guy money to ease relations, he wouldn't accept it. Most races do seem pretty quick to attack without negotiating, and spy the hell out of you even if your allies. I don't like how the spy missions work. It just feels like i'm bleeding free technology out to all of my enemies and I have no say in the matter. Diplomacy is cool but Id rather research only be attained by researching it yourself, and stop AI from trading it with eachother. There is something very fun about having shield tech before everyone else and rubbing it in their face.  The ship combat really feels like it matters, and even more so how you design your ships. The ships weapons and the exploding of ships is entertaining to watch. The directional shielding reflecting is a nice touch. I like how each ship has 5 compartments but I'm a bit confused about how armor works. Does it matter where you place armor or is it just counted as a whole for the section? Do shots break through armor and then on to components?    The sound options don't allow you to turn down the annoying robot broadcaster and the random ambient sounds. They don't seem to be tied to the game music or SFX.    The colony management... dear god. Early game is ok.. but there is no ""buy all"" or ""automate"" button or option anywhere. If you have 10+ colonies be prepared to click the same damn ""rush buy .. are you sure?"" buttons a million times. Not fun. Id much rather just have a ""automatically build everything"" option or a ""buyout if possible always"" button. So I can colonize a planet and then set it and forget it late game.   I wish there was an option to turn off the Masters portals, seems gimmicky when you're trying to have a legitimate war against another race.    There is quite a bit of lag when you get 20+ ships with drones and a bit of random GUI issues. 98% of the time I haven't had an issue with performance or bugs though.   No endgame statistics page or VICTORY is a huge let down."
4Xgaming,3235g3,Eviljim,5,Tue Apr 14 02:56:16 2015 UTC,"Its just as unfinished as the first, just in a different manner.  While having more features, nearly all of them are inconsequential, tedious, or incomplete.  Diplomacy is a complete and utter joke, with the factions joining along with it.  I have no memorable connection with any faction I've played against as an ally (which don't exist) or enemy.  Ghandi decided to nuke the world (a-historical connection) in Civ5, the Necrophages won't stop consuming everything around them in Endless Legend, and fuck the Yor for Gal Civ 2.  Oh, diplomacy is a joke.  Ground combat should have just been left out or handled like EU4.  One thing is for certain after playing SD2s Ground game, holy shit is Xcom: Enemy Within amazing.  Space combat is... I guess ok?  I feel I enjoyed SD1's Blackbox combat more so far (a lot more).  The ship builder has been neutered to where you nearly just designing what kind of weapons platform you want the ship to use, which then makes it a bit more tedious than nearly any other ship builder I've played before (From Distant Worlds to the entirety of the GalCiv series).  The map is TINY for a 4x game.  100 stars? Maybe 10 terran planets?  The map is absolutely packed for a filled AI game well before halfway through the game (on its largest setting).  Compared to Civ, Distant Worlds, Endless Legend... just a spec on one of their maps.  Empire management is just barebones as can get, with the combat being lackluster at best, glad I was gifted a copy.  Absolutely not worth 30$.  Would say it is on par with SM's Starships, which is only 15$ on steam.  Doesn't have the depth of Star Ruler 2 which is cheaper, and considers itself a RTS hybrid, unlike Star Drive 2 which clamors to a full fledged 4x title.  Gal Civ 2 UE with mods, DW: U, and Star Ruler 2 far better scratch the 4x itch, with DW:U being the only one which costs more."

I never liked GalCiv 2/3, for me it is like a shallow game that has nothing to offer. I should check out Star Ruler 2, too.   So far I like SD2, it scratches my ""build starships"" itch like no other 4x game. I feel like the designs here really matter and have impact on the game. I do not think SD2 is a ""great"" game right now, it's solid, but for 30 bucks...who cares. Will play it 100h and then go back to DW:U/Aurora."

Sorry I don't worship Reddit beyond some of these indie video games I've tried?  Update on SD2: needed several more QA passes.  Have run into numerous bugs in my playtime.  From colonies being unresponsive to ships just not working.  Will say hopefully the modding team behind SD1 can work with SD2, with Unity and their devotion, SD2 can easily become an amazing experience."
4Xgaming,3235g3,bingcognito,3,Sun Apr 12 19:56:18 2015 UTC,It is basically Master of Orion 2 updated here and there and enriched by ideas from other 4x games. Strategic resource system comes from Endless Space for example. Ground combat needs work though. I haven't played enough to see the endgame so I don't know if it is good in there too. The early game feels very much like MoO 2 which is good.

It all depends on how the netcode in Civ 5 is implemented. The game could be very sensitive to even the simplest of actions and go out of desync real quickly. Especially if you have simultaneous turns turned on. And mods, mods also (if badly coded) increase the changes of desync."

A lot of the mechanics simply don't hold up.  Multiplayer is ""best"", in my experience, when you can finish a game in a single session. I've rarely been able to finish a multi-session MP game. When I do, it's certainly more rewarding, but also much more rare."

4Xgaming,31uxlu,TBB51,3,Thu Apr 9 15:07:13 2015 UTC,"Looks like land battles are far less 'shit' than SD1. They still don't look good. I don't see how a turn based ground combat makes sense with real time ship combat.  Bad research UI. Haven't we already figure out that a tree is better than... this? I would have killed for a SotS style research setup.  Bad auto battle results UI (needs more details)  On the plus side.... ship customization looks better than ever. The customization was half of the reason why I bought the first game's alpha.  I think the turn based strategy map is better for the ship battles. It lets you focus on the real time ship battles where you get to play with your lego ships... which is the other reason why I bought the first game.  Anyway, that's what I took from that review. It's really too bad he still hasn't found something good for ground combat. The research UI can be easily fixed (come on... just show us a tree..) but the ground combat isn't likely to change before Stardrive 3 or a major expansion."
4Xgaming,31uxlu,MiracleWhippit,4,Wed Apr 8 23:46:43 2015 UTC,apparently the research concept is direct from moo but i honestly dont remember the research in moo. sots research system has been the best i have seen in a long time. I dont like trees either. Its not a realistic approach to research. but sots1 did a pretty good job at it.
4Xgaming,31uxlu,CrunchyGremlin,2,Thu Apr 9 00:14:25 2015 UTC,"I played a lot more MOO1 than MOO2.  In MOO1 you could choose from several research options from each category of research. With weapons this would let you research later weapons while skipping 1-2 earlier ones. It was a great system for it's day. It's just outdated now.  I really liked the Sword of the Stars 1 research tree. You had hidden unlocks until you get them... random chance for most skills depending on race and a handful of 'mandatory' technologies.  So you had a high tech race that had weak ship hulls but had a much higher chance at getting the best laser weaponry, a low tech race with high health cheap ships with higher chance to unlock things like mass drivers and other projectile weapons. It really added more flavor than a set of generic weapons that everyone can research every time.  The SotS way might not be the best 'balanced' system like what they have in Civilization but symmetrical balance is boring. There's any number of ways research could be done in one of these games... but just a flat clone of MOO is meh.  Anyway, I guess my main gripe is the fact that the whole research thing exists as two UIs. One to pick a research option and one to show all the potential options. This is 2015... we all have wide screen monitors. At least put the choices on the left and make it so when you mouse over or click a category it shows you details for it on the right."
4Xgaming,31uxlu,MiracleWhippit,2,Thu Apr 9 13:21:11 2015 UTC,I have seen the extra research screen but i did not really find any need for it in sd2.  i have some ideas for a research method. I dont know if you all are aware of the blackbox mod for sd1 but i basically have the source to the game thanks from a lot of help.  my programming skills are not great but made some significant improvements to the ai and such. not all by me. about 30%  or so of the code is mine. but anyway... i digress.   have you seen the BBC show connections with james burke. you know... research isnt linear. it jumps around by need and ability. in reality that is.  so i had this idea that if i ever get the skills and time i want to try to try and represent this.  some thing along the idea of a bunch of puzzle pieces that drop into a pool of possibilities that fit together in multiple way. and build the tree by fitting these pieces together. no idea how it would actually work. likely like crap but it would be interesting to try.
4Xgaming,31uxlu,CrunchyGremlin,2,Fri Apr 10 00:18:34 2015 UTC,"I'm entirely okay with some aspects being abstracted. Ground combat being an abstract thing where you have units automatically slugging it out purely based on math is fine. It lets the player focus on other, more important things.  The supreme commander of an empire spanning multiple star systems shouldn't worry much about the details of ground combat. That is what your generals are for.  MOO3 and Distant Worlds both handled ground combat the same way. You would deploy armies to a planet, and the armies would automatically fight it out. Warfare was a slow thing, taking a long time to complete. Conquering an entire planet is a lengthy affair. This allowed plenty of time for reinforcements on both sides to arrive as the battle raged on below.  Because ground combat was abstracted the player didn't need to micromanage anything. The player will be busy with other things anyways.  A planet could be garrisoned by stationing units on a planet. When stationed there, the ground units would defend the planet automatically.  This sort of hands-off approach is also done with Hearts of Iron and Europa Universalis. Its a good system for large scale strategy games."
4Xgaming,31uxlu,Hyndis,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:00:59 2015 UTC,I'm right there with you with ground combat being something you shouldn't need to micromanage.   Having the ground combat take days lets you get more space combat in too. You can have a whole dynamic around troop transports and escorts having to defend them to get troops to the planet.  Not having conquering happen in a single turn unless you bring overwhelming firepower just gives so many strategic opportunities. Against a slightly more powerful opponent you can feign attack a system and then a turn or two later bring a real assault to a different flank etc.  Aaaand now i'm all excited about something that doesn't exist. thanks :P
4Xgaming,31uxlu,MiracleWhippit,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:17:25 2015 UTC,"Distant Worlds has combat like this.   Depending on how many troops are involved ground combat can take ages. Ground combat can rage on a planet long enough for fleets to drop off troops, go home to pick up more troops, and drop them off again. Entire fleets can be destroyed and rebuilt while a planet is still being contested on the ground.  Planets are big places. In Earth's history, no one has yet conquered the planet and not for lack of trying. Throughout history, empire after empire has tried to conquer the planet. These campaigns were long, drawn out affairs that lasted years or decades. Conquering a planet should never be an easy or quick thing.   Of course if one side is so massively more powerful than the other, then yes, ground combat is over quickly. You'll get this kind of instant conquering on newly settled fringe colonies, but on a homeworld you're in for a fight.   There are different troop types with different specialties. It is best to use combined arms as you get substantial bonuses for using combined arms rather than trying to zerg rush in only the same exact kind of unit. You can also assign generals to troop transports, and these generals will land on the planet with their troops. A good general can mean all the difference in the world.  But in order to land troops you do need space superiority. You can try to land troops without first securing space around the planet, but some of your transports will likely be shot down. This means the loss of any troops on these transports. Was your 5-star general on one of these transports that just got blown to bits? That was unfortunate."
4Xgaming,31uxlu,Hyndis,2,Fri Apr 10 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"I've played Distant Worlds off and on for ages. I've never gotten into it enough to understand every level of it (I don't think i've ever built my ships from scratch, for instance.) I've never understood the entire ground combat aspect of it at all.   If distant worlds was turn based I would have spent a lot more time with it."
4Xgaming,31uxlu,MiracleWhippit,5,Fri Apr 10 18:54:25 2015 UTC,I'm tempted to give SD2 a go just because of the continued low-grade hyperventillation over SD1 that seems to overcome so many.
4Xgaming,31uxlu,thiosk,-5,Wed Apr 8 16:23:43 2015 UTC,Just do it. No matter how good or bad the game is it ultimately supports the genre. Money keeps developers interested.
4Xgaming,31uxlu,MiracleWhippit,13,Wed Apr 8 23:38:34 2015 UTC,"You could instead buy a game from literally any other developer. It's not a crowded genre, but there are certainly a few recent releases that deserve the money far more.  Giving money to the most toxic, least honest gaming developer in the 4x genre just to ""support the medium"" is actually the worst way you could spend your money."

The infamous ""I don't want to hear it"" post was bad, no denying it, but it isn't representative of the entirety of his character (nor does the entirety of all blog posts, for that matter.) Even within that post, one can see emotional fatigue surrounding the launch and thus more likely explains the blunt defensive-ness. At the same time, I wouldn't write off the legitmate complaints people had with SD1.  I would say this about the dev: he has a legitmate love of the genre, he has more experience developing (which has the potential, not the certainty to translate into a more solid game), and he makes hardline decisions without fear of controversy."
4Xgaming,31uxlu,Strongeststraw,4,Fri Apr 10 02:18:50 2015 UTC,"I admit it is a bit of hyperbole. He's no Phil Fish, that's for sure.  That being said, I honestly don't understand his fanboys.

I seen a few devs and public figures that respond the same way to criticism. Part of it is the overwhelming number of messages, all with the identical text and pressed urgency. The figure tries to be engaged, fails, then has to pull back (usually in a terrible fashion).  As someone with a social science degree, I find that the climate around kickstarted/early access games defined SD more than the game's failings. The act of hearing one's own belief echoed by many others intensifies the belief. In my exerience, I just shelved the game till a year after launch. I came back to a more stable game with plenty of mods and a community to shore up some weaker areas. It'd be easy to label either side as an echo chamber, which just demonstrates how the battle line beliefs are irrational/beholden to social context. I wouldn't say either side is wrong or dishonest either.  Disclaimer; I stayed up till 4am last night playing SD2. I was about to hit the hay at 2am, then one more turn happened."

Despite the fact Stardrive was a good game despite the technical issues.   An opinion, and not one widely shared. ""Good despite technical issues"" is a terrible description anyway.

4Xgaming,31uxlu,Thexare,2,Wed Apr 8 20:06:28 2015 UTC,"A majority of this subreddit has a kneejerk reaction against SD1 and its developer... with understandable reason. The first game was unfinished and was plagued by technical issues. The majority of these issues were fixed or at least ameliorated by user mods such BlackBox. I have spent a lot of time in SD1 since and have found the experience enjoyable: I've always liked tactical combat in 4x games and SD1 is one of the few where ship design is actually significantly meaningful.  But from various preview videos SD2 looks pretty good and at $20 for an SD1 owner, the price isn't all that steep. I have bought it and will give it a try. I will probably withhold judgment until I have completed a game or two and have tried tinkering with the modding interface (which makes or break any 4x space game in my eyes. Good modding support opens the way for players to customize or fix developer mistakes or oversights)."

4Xgaming,31uxlu,Terkala,-4,Wed Apr 8 20:54:52 2015 UTC,many of the negative metacritic reviews have little to do with the technical aspect of the game. most of the negativity is based on ideas thought to be promised but not in the game a good month before release.  its a shame and skews the usefulness of the medium to actually review the game.  a bunch of people were upset specifically about multiplayer which the game was never listed on steam as having. only people that bought the pre-release version of the game would know that it was ever touted as going to have multiplayer and those guys would also now that a month prior to release it was removed from the feature list and did not have it. To expect it to magically get multiplayer after release is understandable but not realistic.  it would be interesting to compare the metacritic score prior to the drop in support. it surely was much higher.
4Xgaming,31uxlu,CrunchyGremlin,5,Thu Apr 9 00:10:36 2015 UTC,"The release day reviews were just as negative as the early access reviews. The overwhelming majority of people also have reviewed the game in a negative light.

To expect it to magically get multiplayer after release is understandable but not realistic.   The developer himself promised it as a major feature of his kickstarter campaign. It had 3 paragraphs with details. But this point is completely irrelevant.

My scheming derailing of your negativity is  not something i had put much thought into.  yes the kick starter for 20 grand for a 4x space game with nice graphics, multi player, and completely bug free. realism. It is hard to imagine that any game could be built for 20 grand and not have the dev work for free.  you know what.... i was thinking of user reviews. I think you are right about the professional reviews.  the game is a niche game though. niche of a niche. 4x rts. not going to appeal to the vast number of gamers.  disliking the game is one thing. you can do that. but not liking it about multiplayer as a cause of it being unfinished is something else.   there is a lot of disinformation about the game. which is a shame.  the promise in the kickstarter was that multiplayer would have happen after release.  something like that. still a poor reason to not like the game because you dont like the dev. You know what i mean? its a shame."

I dislike the game because it's unfinished, buggy, and really not fun to play. The AI is garbage, and can't even handle the most basic of mechanics of the game (it'll bankrupt itself if left alone).  I dislike the developer because he is a jerk to his community. He would rather scrub all discussion of the game and say ""I disagree with you and no amount of posting will change my mind"" than actually produce the game that he sold people."

They aren't seen as just mistakes, medical professionals cannot make mistakes at all and generally pay very expensive insurance policies just to get covered from liabilities.  Not only that but depending on the severity of the case they can face from revokation of their license to criminal prosecution.  If anything that is the worst example you could've picked."

I agree that it was probably a dumb comparison, but /u/tomassavage was the one who made it.  There is a huge difference between losing a patient during surgery and a developer of entertainment software deciding to move on to a new project."
4Xgaming,31uxlu,AdmiralCrackbar,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:05:25 2015 UTC,"Of course there is a huge difference, I wasn't arguing for the comparison between them I was just talking about medical professionals.  They do make mistakes as all humans do but since any mistake can be deadly there is little to no tolerance for them they just aren't supposed to make mistakes.  It's the same with pilots, it's a must that they don't but sometimes it happens and when they do it's with terrible results.  Medical insurance and liabilities are a huge reason medical costs are exorbitantly high in the US. Doctors don't just insure to cover mistakes but also to cover the legal expenses of false claims that can take a while to resolve and are usually very expensive since usually experts from both sides are involved to prove that there is an error or negligence.  Also this is one of the reasons there is need for a tort reform since punitive damages can go into the millions."
4Xgaming,31uxlu,UnGauchoCualquiera,3,Thu Apr 9 13:10:20 2015 UTC,They do make mistakes once in a while. They just don't get a free pass. It is because of this doctors are very aware that a single mistake can ruin their careers and they don't take it lightly.

The reddit page for Stardrive 2 is dead and it launches in a day.  Compared to games like Cities and Pillars of Eternity which are both niche games before launch, its hilarious.  To the scum defenders, it has not so much to do with Zero's piece of shit game, and everything to do with how he handled his piece of shit game post-launch.  He removed features listed on the Steam Store page after the game was live.  He deleted (posts), berated, and banned customers calling him out on it, posting anything negative, even constructive criticism via the only outlet for the game (Steam).  He stopped supporting his game, which is still selling for 29.99$, six months after launch, after taking a month long vacation.  He made promises, then denied ever making them.  If he did it a different way, say: did everything in his power to try and fix the game (not go on a month vacation right after launch), have hundreds of patches (which the game is in dire need of) during post-launch, was humble and took the (positive) feedback the community was more than willing to give, and still came to the conclusion of what StarDrive 1 is: a piece of shit; then the community would be more forgiving.  Alas he did the former and in this day and age, just not a bright decision for a genre that is niche (space/scifi 4x) and saturated with terrible ""the next Moo2 / AC"" successor."

Higher end research would be on the outside of that ring. As you research towards the outside of one area of the ring, the other area opposite to it would either become much more expensive or even impossible at all to obtain. That would make a nice dynamic tech tree where you have the ability to go everywhere, while still being forced into specialization in the end game (become a diplomatic, militaristic, production focused or trade focused nation for example.

I would have liked to see the game launch delayed by about a month because i know sd2 wont be treated the same as other games. Every single bug in sd2 is going to get a lot of attention. But like i said.. Its functionally not too bad.  I put a lot of work into blackbox. I know pretty well that stardrive1 had issues.

4Xgaming,319gj0,CrunchyGremlin,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:59:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same here; I put a few 100 hours into the game despite the crashes (and shelving it for a time). Vanilla SD definitely got better later on. My only other gripe with SD1 was the tech tree, but that was fixed with modds. SD2 has a much better tech tree this time.  As for the hate, I find SD 1 an interesting case study. When compared to other poor releases or ports, Dark Souls (1) comes to mind, SD developed quite the loathing community. When multiplayer was pulled and no fix-all patch arrived, moving the complaints on the forums to a catch all thread was seen as censorship and only vindicated animosity. I don't blame Zero for it; his reasons for the mega thread were ok, he just failed to consider how the move would be interpreted (especially when people have been primed to see kickstarted games as rip offs).

Our Store Page is now live, and we have T-Minus one week until launch. I want to address a few anticipated questions here.   33% Discount for StarDrive 1 Owners Everyone who owns a copy of StarDrive 1 on launch day will be eligible for a 33% Discount on StarDrive 2 - both the regular version and the digital deluxe version. This should appear automatically on the StarDrive 2 store page for you. I belive that Valve will also be sending a direct message to owners of StarDrive 1 informing you of the discount.   Digital Deluxe Version The digital deluxe version is a lot of fun, and I hope you'll consider spending a few extra bucks to get some of the great extras I've put together for you. I think the real gem of the pack is the Paint Job pack, which allows you to change the skins on your ships in-game. It's purely cosmetic but I think it adds a lot of fun to be able to get a few really unique looks.   Also included is a Design Journal. When I made StarDrive 1 & 2, I used a big Portrait Sketchbook that I bought at an art store to hold all my design notes. For the deluxe version, I went through and photograpphed every page and made a nice digital version for you to check out. It's an interesting artifact of development.   We've also included an artbook that showcases the art design of StarDrive 2, with my own commentary added on how and why we made various art decisions.   Finally, we've got a great selection of musical tracks from both StarDrive 1 and StarDrive 2 that I think you'll enjoy both in and out of the game!   Allrighty then. One week!"

But it has tried to increase the game speed by reducing micro management. Other notable differences are: * Multiple types of attack and damage (physical, psychological etc) * Cloaking plays a more important role * Introduction of strategic resources * Introduction of culture that informally controls space * Players are normally aligned to one of the ancient races"

4Xgaming,314rd0,GalaBrandon,3,Thu Apr 2 00:08:40 2015 UTC,"I think this is too ""form over function"" for a strategy game. It is beautiful, but doesn't seem to be too practical.  The star map is barely readable against the bright background. It is not immediately obvious what is a discard pile and what is the deck (and even that they are these things at all, I think the discard pile also generally is located below the library, not above it). I think it would also be preferable for the color of the top right strip to be visible without hovering over the cards (that is something like color in Magic, right? If so, that should definitely be visible at the first glance).  In general, there seems to be way to little stuff on the screen. Even Hearthstone which is on the lower end of card game complexity spectrum generally has more information on screen (I'm now talking primarily about lack of things on the ""board"")."
4Xgaming,314rd0,klaxxxon,2,Thu Apr 2 06:42:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  As for the star map part, we are going to have three different zoom levels, so things will be a little more readable as we start to develop and show those aspects. Also the top right strip is a placeholder for a faction icon, the cost are on the left side.  All other things I will be sure to note and get those to the proper person, if you read the blog you can see a few things are still planned for the UI to get information at a glance.  When your playing a card game/strategy game what information do you personally like to see at a glance?"
4Xgaming,314rd0,klaxxxon,3,Thu Apr 2 07:11:24 2015 UTC,"When your playing a card game/strategy game what information do you personally like to see at a glance?    Key public information about me and my opponent (life, available resources, number of cards in hand, library size, size of discard pile if relevant)   Board state. Don't know how board works in your game, but it surely shows too litle information. If you look at any space 4x game, you will see that the galaxy map shows you information about each of the planets/stars - colony size, resources, production, present fleets etc...    And about the cards:   Way to instantly recognize which card it is even if I don't know them 100% by heart (I would love to see both card name and art). Is there nay reason why the cards overlap like that in your game? There is plenty of space on the screen. In most card games the cards only start overlapping if the game runs out of space ont he screen. And why do you have card name in middle of the card... Color/faction. Generally, those are expressed by the entire border of the card, which is something you don't use to carry any information at all. Card type (single use action vs. permanent effect, what kind). This may also be expressed using the shape of the card border (Heartstone) Resource cost Stats of creatures/ships whatever.  Any status effects   What I don't need to see is the rules text. In you case, considering you are a digital card game, you might be able to contract the card vertically when it is in hand (but not hovered on), so that the top half of the card is shown along with the bottom row with stats, without showing the part with rules text.  Also, even though Magic Online has generally crappy UI, it has quite good card display, especially considering how complex can Magic cards get. Look at this screenshot - it makes the cards quite small, but blows up font size of important parts disproportionately, so that they remain readable."

4Xgaming,314rd0,BasenjiMaster,1 point,Thu Apr 2 08:28:48 2015 UTC,"Hi Klaxxxon, sorry for the slow reply, tons going on.  Let me try to get to some of your comments:  Board state: This is the far-zoom so there is intentionally little informaiton, the closer zooms will have a lot more board info.  overlap: It is possible with less cards they won't overlap as much as they do in this concept. Hand sizes could easily swing up to 6 to 10 cards in hand so the overlap is there for when the hand gets full.  color/faction: we experimented with that a bit but thus far we are sticking with the top-right corner being for the faction. Will keep this in mind though.  card type: yes we have border variations here for this, will be more clear as we reveal more card types.  rules: enlarged cards will have a full ""rules"" description. Operations and Developments have some ""text"" on the card but ships and other cards don't actually need a lot of text on them, instead we are using an icon ""module"" system (that has yet to be fully explained...)  font sizes: we are aware that some of the font colors and boldness still need adjusting. We've also gotten the feedback that the development text wrap is a bit odd and we will be fixing this.  Thanks for your feedback! I will loop this all back with the designers/team, very helpful.  Kindly, Sebastian."

4Xgaming,30yrc7,waspinat0r,10,Tue Mar 31 20:07:30 2015 UTC,"Generally most 4x games have a plot as simple as ""Your species has just discovered faster than light travel. You're the emperor of this race. Build an empire that conquers the galaxy"". You're exploring in order to get a more powerful empire. You're exterminating your enemies so that you can take over their areas and become more powerful.  Nothing stops the CPU from progressing as fast or faster than you. The CPU is playing the same game you are though, using the same rules. So the challenge in the game comes from out smarting the CPU. Like a very long and very complex game of chess."
4Xgaming,30yrc7,Terkala,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:48:34 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply :) do the allies/enemies/neutral allegiances lie where the story places them or is that randomized? Part of my issue is that I don't understand when and why another faction would decide whether to or not to attack or just be an ally if it's not pre determined.
4Xgaming,30yrc7,AdmiralCrackbar,3,Tue Mar 31 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"That is often defined by a number of factors that the AI will balance.  Have you had good relations in the past, are you massing units near its border, are you sitting on a number of valuable resources that it needs for whatever reason, are you currently at war with one of its allies.  The 'content' of the game is generally 'procedurally' generated based on the map (which is quite often random), your placement (also random) and your actions.  Some games contain set maps and scripted events when certain things occur, but these are generally not the norm for the genre and are often framed more as a tutorial before going on to the main event, the randomized game.  4x games do not provide a puzzle to be solved.  You might have a favorite early strategy but often this will change depending on the specific circumstances of the map you're on and the actions of the nearby AI nations."
4Xgaming,30yrc7,Terkala,3,Tue Mar 31 21:27:32 2015 UTC,"Most 4x games don't have ""stories"" other than the ones you make yourself (notable exceptions are Alpha Centauri and Galactic Civilizations).  Often the different races have a ""personality"". Some races may be more likely to go to war, some may want peace, some are on the spectrum between those two points. It really depends on the game in question.  I'm generalizing here, because each game has it's own AI. But for example in Space Empires, the AI takes into account how strong your military is relative to theirs, how much they would benefit from taking your planets, and how likely that race is to go to war. If it's above a certain value (usually if you have a lot of valuable planets and a terrible army) then they'll go to war with you. Or if they make an alliance with someone and suddenly have a much bigger combined army than you. Or anything else like that."
4Xgaming,30yrc7,ekolis,2,Wed Apr 1 00:22:12 2015 UTC,"As others have said, allegiances are typically determined through the course of gameplay - if I choose to attack one AI empire, that AI will decide to be less friendly, while if an AI empire covets some resource that I own, it will decide to be more friendly. However some games (the first Master of Orion, in particular) have ""racial biases"" which cause some empires to like or dislike each other for whatever reason regardless of the game situation - say, the Mrrshans (a cat race) and the Alkari (a bird race) dislike each other because cats and birds don't get along!"
4Xgaming,30yrc7,breaking3po,5,Wed Apr 1 02:54:52 2015 UTC,"This is entirely too weird a question.  Why fighting games, guys?"
4Xgaming,30yrc7,abcdthc,3,Wed Apr 1 14:33:32 2015 UTC,"Ill take a stab at this,  First off some 4x games are turn based, some are real time but pausable.  Because I'm more familiar with turn based, for the purpose of these questions we'll assume a turn based 4x game.  Why am I 4x'ing  Your goal is to win (one way or the other).  In order to win you're goin to need resources.  In order to find resources you need to first explore the map and see where they are.  You then need to expand your reach to those resources so you can claim them (or harvest them or whatever)  Other factions also want those resources, so you may want to exterminate them. (That X is a little off as some 4x games have victory conditions that require no exterminiating)  Also, nuetral enemies may be guarding said resources, so you may need to exterminate them as well.  Now that you have resources, you need to exploit them in order to achieve your victory conditions.    For the build a rocket ship victory you need to be more specific about what game it is.  Sounds like you need to do a bunch of research though.  What keeps the CPU from progressing as fast as me  Well, sort of nothing, and sort of everything.  First off AI in any 4x game IS NOWHERE NEAR ever defeating a human player (who is well versed in the game)    For an adept player to even be challenged by AI in a 4x game the AI must be given MAJOR advantages, the AI must cheat.  That being said the AI will match your performance for a short while.  However as the game progress the massive amount of possibilities and planning needed to perform optimally is well beyond what AI can do.  You have to remember computers cant ""think"" they just run every possible scenario and choose the best.  After awhile there are just way to many ways a game can go in order for an AI to compete against a thinking person with out a handicap.  The stratigic experience is all about deciding what type of victory you will go for, what race you will use and what resources you will need.  Along the way you will need to overcome numerous obsticals to achieve this, if not completley change your victory condition.  For me to go any deeper id need to know what game you are trying to play.  Everyone has its own unique mechanics and victory conditions.  Playing Civ is not the same as playing endless legend, even though the core game is very similar.  Hope that helps, feel free if you have more questions."
4Xgaming,30yrc7,abcdthc,2,Tue Mar 31 21:56:38 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you very much for the detailed reply, it is very helpful.  The rocket analogy wasn't pointed towards any particular game, just used as an example of a victory condition in maybe a science victory.  Honestly the big thing for me right now is the decision between reall delving into 4X just poking around clicking randomly. I'm considering picking up EL tomorrow."
4Xgaming,30yrc7,abcdthc,2,Tue Mar 31 22:09:42 2015 UTC,"El is kind of the gold standard for fantasy 4x right now.  Its a very pretty game, has unique races with unique mechanics and decent diplomacy.  Its a fun game but you wont figure it out immediatly.  There is a lot of nuance.  You need to understand though its intentional and it adds replay value.    Combat is pretty hands off.  Much like ES you equip your units with armor, weapons, trinkets etc and send them into battle.  You can choose who attacks who but most of the time its pretty moot and the AI will pick whats best anyway.  You basicly just watch it unfold.  Personally im fine with this.  Its stressing macro mgmt more than micro.  Im old, i suck at micro, its why i play TBS games and 4x.  No dexterity required.  The strategy is what units you build and what you equip them with (which also lead to what resources you need and what tech you need to build said items.)  To me its all about what you send into battle, not how well you can click and hot key.  I think theres really only one game that does real time battle right and that total war. (because its extremley slow and pausable)"
4Xgaming,30yrc7,abcdthc,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:43:45 2015 UTC,So in essence is the major goal of a 4x campaign to control the entire map whether by diplomacy or war?
4Xgaming,30yrc7,abcdthc,2,Wed Apr 1 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"Well, sort of.  In one scenario where you're going for a military or expantion victory, yes.  Controlling the map completely IS the victory condition.  But for something like tech or diplomacy victory, controlling all of the map is not needed.  Just the portion where your cities and resources you need are.    I think the major goal of 4x is to thrive.  Not all factions/victory conditions require map control to do that."
4Xgaming,30yrc7,Ilitarist,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:44:05 2015 UTC,"I see, thank you. I guess most of my confusion comes from just not knowing what to do at any point. For instance, I started up a couple of games of Endless Legend today -- I never was attacked by other factions, nor had anything that would make me want to hurry up any specific thing, so i basically was just sitting around researching and searching ruins. It wasn't exactly a nerve wracking experience -- but i'm hoping I was just playing wrong. Like, literally nothing except searching ruins and researching...that's it. I didn't really have any real direction to see me to do anything different."
4Xgaming,30yrc7,andreasn2,2,Wed Apr 1 22:25:15 2015 UTC,Well there are minor factions that you should work to conquer or assimilate (or both).  They add extra pop to your cities and can give you bonus as well as a new unit.  Also you should be working on your 2nd and third cities.  The early game is normally done alone.

Add onto that a great diplomatic system, fun espionage, a dynamic setting with unique lore and procedural elements, and great modding capabilities . . . what you're left with is one of the greatest PC games of all time. I'm usually a sucker for turn-based strategy games, but it took Distant Worlds to show me that a proper space grand-strategy game needs to be real-time with pause.  Fantasy: This is a tough one, because I have a history with so many great fantasy strategy games that I almost feel like I'm betraying someone when I pick Endless Legend. In the end though, I haven't had quite as much fun with a fantasy game that incorporates all the true elements of a 4X game as I have with Endless Legend. It's also hard to admit when a Civilization-clone seems to have done more things right than even Civilization itself. Its definitely a 4X triumph.  Historical: This is a no-brainer, because even though there are a plethora of historical strategy games, not many of them can be considered true 4X games. That's why I have to stick the tried and true Civilization series, with Civilization V: Brave New World as my current favorite. Hopefully we see more true historical 4X strategy games in the future though. Endless Legend has shown that other developers can make something as good (if not better) than Civilization. I have my eye on At The Gates."

4Xgaming,30sk61,Laladen,4,Mon Mar 30 23:31:49 2015 UTC,"Fantasy: Fallen Enchantress:LH but Endless Legend is slowly winning me over  Sci-fi: Star Ruler 2. Just officially released. I avoided the beta so I wouldn't be burnt out before release. I think it is going to be special.  Historical: EU4 (I know its not a true 4x, more like a historical simulator, but it scratches the same itch sometimes) Civ V with all DLC is a close second only because its not as stressful =p I have had recommended to me in another thread that Total War 2 Rome is a nice game."
4Xgaming,30sk61,Laladen,3,Mon Mar 30 23:27:35 2015 UTC,"Fantasy: For a really long time, it was the Heroes of Might & Magic series (II, then IV), but Endless Legend is making a serious run at that crown. I always liked the aesthetic and the atmostphere of HOMM much more than the gameplay, and Endless Legend does a fantastic job with both. Admittedly, this is the category I've played the least.  Sci-Fi: Even though the endgame isn't perfect and they never quite nailed down the AI, Galactic Civilizations II (+ expansions) is still a goddamn masterpiece. The exploration and expansion phases are maybe the most fun I've had in the genre, and the expansion packs did a great job of making most of the races feel alien and unique. So many games try to include a ship-builder (or something like it) and fall flat, but this is the only game I can think of that really hit that feature out of the park.   Historical: Civ III edges out Civ V as my all-time favorite, but it's definitely close. If Civ V had actually nailed down diplomacy, it would probably be #1...but a few years after release it's still a glaring weakness in a game that's otherwise very polished. Civ III's diplomacy system wasn't THAT much better, but it never felt broken...which V's still does. IMO, both were good-but-not-great games at release that became classics thanks to excellent expansions.  Much as I love that series, it kills me that Rise of Nations never got a true sequel - the Conquer the World game mode had so much potential. I haven't found any other games that combined RTS and turn-based action so well, and it's surprising that so few have tried."
4Xgaming,30sk61,MikeTysonsLifeCoach,5,Mon Mar 30 17:43:49 2015 UTC,Galactic Civilizations II   The interface seems so cartoonish and limiting. I could never get into it despite hundreds of people saying it's the best thing since Jesus.

Warlock and Endless Legend also gets an honorary note here as I can't decide which is actually better than the other; they all offer about the same joy, but fail at different parts. Sci-fi: EVE wins this straight up; it has everything a good 4x should have, it's just very hard to reach it. For a more ""casual"" 4x I'd say MOO2 even if it gets a little annoying at the endgame with management.

It's a joy to play and a good game, but not a great strategy game, I feel. Warlock 2 felt more promising but I haven't returned to it. It's weird, there have been so many Fantasy 4X games that came out, but none of them have been as remotely good as Civilization from an overall replayability and strategic standpoint.  Historical: Civ V takes the cake when it comes to traditional 4X. However if you count Paradox Games as 4X then Crusader Kings 2 is by far the best game out there... although not really for the 4X reasons (it's more like The Sims)"

Sorry if that's a boring answer but every gameplay element connects and gels so well together that I still play a game or two every so often. A lot of 4X sci-fi games just tend to add more crap, over-complicate and over-detail without thinking of how it affects the rest of the game.  Not even MOO2 came close, it was tedious at the end-game and/or when you had big empires. The worst offender was Ascendancy where you had to build every single structure on a planet on each square and that was monstrously tedious.  Historical: Rome: Total War, more specifically the Europa Barbarorum mod. The game did a lot of things right without over-complicating things but what made it shine was the tactical combat. Again here the mantra is simplicity with depth.  But the original game was too easy and that's where Europa Barbarorum comes in. If you still have RTW download the mod, it's well worth the time you'll put in.  I never played any fantasy 4X but I'm going to put Heart or Iron 2 in a new category, WWII era which I play much more. Although I prefer turn-based game, HoI2 stood out and I enjoyed it a lot.  Minor pet-peeve: I have no idea where people got the idea that Sins was a 4X game. It's just your typical RTS with planets as resource bases instead of structures on a map. It's a very good game but not like any 4X I use to play. It's like saying Star Trek Armada is a 4X game because it has planets... that's just weird.  Edit: I completely forgot about Dominions 3. That would fit in the Fantasy category."

4Xgaming,30sk61,SecondTalon,2,Mon Mar 30 16:15:29 2015 UTC,Don't both Total War and HoI 2 kind of lack one of the X's? Explore that is. And some of the others (like Exploit) are kind of out of focus too.  Just wondering why you consider those 4X but Sins not.
4Xgaming,30sk61,Avohaj,0,Mon Mar 30 13:09:24 2015 UTC,"I've always considered 4X games more focused on empire building and management above all other gameplay elements. Meaning if you're terrible at properly managing your empire, whether it be developing planets/cities, science, diplomacy etc. you will lose the game.  As for the explore aspect, you can't disregard games without a random map generator. That's basically what I understood from your comment."
4Xgaming,30sk61,ohfuckreddit,2,Mon Mar 30 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah but in both TW and HoI the empire building is just means to an end. Of tactical battles in TW and planning and executing a WWII strategy for the country of your choosing in HoI.   What makes the difference to Sins? Or while we're there Age of Empires or Starcraft? Is it the pace? Solely the lack of diplomacy? You still research, expand your empire tall and wide, sometimes even explore, you most certainly exterminate your enemies and definitely exploit resources (actually adding a 5th X: exhaust). And all this you have to do or your empire will crumble.  Sudden epiphany. Is is just the presentation? Is it the borders? Because that would explain why I've seen Rise of Nations called 4X. It has borders. RTW, HoI all have borders. Sins didn't iirc. Mind=blown. It's all about the influence borders."
4Xgaming,30sk61,Avohaj,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:17:26 2015 UTC,"I don't consider an RTS with strong economy gameplay as a 4X. These games give off a very specific feel, there are more facets and depth to the games that creates its own story, the story of your empire. You're the emperor, the great empire builder on a massive scale managing cities and planets, conducting diplomacy, spying, and trade. Your enemy might become your friend if it suits your needs, expanding somewhere might turn an alliance against you and lead to your demise.   An RTS doesn't have that feel. It's you, your enemies and combat. Whether you apply the very definition of those 4X to a game doesn't make it so.  This is getting pedantic..."
4Xgaming,30sk61,ohfuckreddit,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:40:56 2015 UTC,"So you'd say it's the diplomacy aspect that makes a 4X?

4Xgaming,30sk61,Avohaj,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:51:51 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't engage in a genre definiton discussion if you're not prepared for pedanticism :P   Fair enough.  Diplomacy is definitely an important gameplay element. Pacing is also very important like you said. Management on a grander scale is also pretty important in my view. 4X games are more about calculated decision making instead of reacting on muscle memory from previous games. You're not just upgrading stuff as you go along, you're growing your empire. Each combat has a purpose to further advance your empire. In RTS games, each combat is the purpose. I don't know how to explain this better.  Having the option of customizing your race or designing your units/ships also helps create a unique sense of identity with each game. Unique tech trees or randomized tech availability also helps.  Edit: Having different victory conditions also helps tremendously."

4Xgaming,30sk61,jimmahdean,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:23:47 2015 UTC,"So you'd say it's the lack of diplomacy and thus inherent and inevitable aggressiveness of those games that makes them not 4X?

4Xgaming,30sk61,Avohaj,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:30:18 2015 UTC,"No, I pretty much completely ignore diplomacy in most 4x games. I'd say it's because you don't spend any sort of significant time expanding throughout the game world, whereas in, say, SEV, you spend the first main portion of the game expanding your empire up to the enemys' borders."
4Xgaming,30sk61,jimmahdean,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with jimmahdean, that the expand portion is lacking in RTS's such as Starcraft or AoE. But my view of it is that expanding in those games is solely out of necessity. There is really no reward for expanding, nor is it a matter of choice or involving choices. The one who expands the fastest has an advantage, but it's not the choices you make that make the difference it is how fast you spot resources and how fast you react and click."

If you want deep diplomacy and empire building then you can't also have deep tactics. Otherwise you have to teach a player 4 or 5 entirely different complex systems just to play a game.

The tech tree, planet maintenance and construction are just perfect.  The combat is simplified (in comparison to other 4x games like MOO2, but vastly more interesting that Civ5, where you basically bump two units together and see who gets damaged).  The expansion makes the combat significantly more interesting (long range kinetics, short range missiles, fighters, bombers).

It has a very simple and easy to exploit economy system (which I find is often the hardest part of 4x games), and a real-time combat system that is both easy to get into, and satisfyingly complicated for the grognards among us. It's probably got the best UI I've seen in a 4x games as well, in that everything is nicely streamlined and it's obvious what everything does.

4Xgaming,30l5hd,herpington,5,Sat Mar 28 09:57:28 2015 UTC,"If you hated vanilla Civ V, chances are you're not going to enjoy it with the expansions either.  Yes, they definitely make for a better game, but at the core it's still the same."
4Xgaming,30l5hd,PseudoElite,4,Sat Mar 28 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed with this.  Civ 5 with the expansions is a lot better than vanilla and it isn't a bad game at all. For newcomers to the 4X genre, it's probably one of the best.  But I still highly prefer Civ 4 over Civ 5 in terms of depth. Even with the expansions, Civ 5 has too little city/empire management, 1UPT make invasions a chore, along with pretty poor diplomacy/war AI for my taste. Multiplayer is supposed to be decent. To each his own."
4Xgaming,30l5hd,G-ZeuZ,3,Sat Mar 28 22:50:53 2015 UTC,"I can mirror this in my own experience, I played TONS of Civ4, especially with mods like 'Rise of Mankind: A New Dawn' and in epic speed.  Civ5 was a disappointment for me in vanilla, tried to get back to it, but it just seemed... empty and plain for me.  Switched over to EU3/4, and that at least have enough depth and complexity for me."
4Xgaming,30l5hd,herpington,2,Sat Mar 28 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"Yup, you really nailed it for me.  Civ 5 is more of a tactical game in terms of combat which isn't a bad thing, but I miss the micromanagement options available in previous iterations that enabled you to push things a little further."
4Xgaming,30l5hd,Journeyman42,2,Tue Mar 31 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"It is amazing with the expansions, they really do add a lot.  I also thought Civ5 vanilla was a huge step back from Civ4, but now the gameplay is better than ever."
4Xgaming,30l5hd,Einzbern,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:35:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm, tried it and it's a completelly different game with expansions.  I don't know about combat, but if you play peacefully (cultural victory and the like) it's quite a decent game now."
4Xgaming,30l5hd,jeremyhoffman,0,Mon Mar 30 17:53:45 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy Civ 5(287 hours clocked through steam), especially with the expansions. I don't remember particularly disliking vanilla though.  At the same time, Civ 5 was my first Civ game. I had only play 4 for maybe 15 mins beforehand."
4Xgaming,30l5hd,cwilsons,0,Sat Mar 28 14:59:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't hate vanilla, but I did get frustrated because so much was lacking. But with the expansions it's my favorite game of all time."

4Xgaming,30h6ya,Cheet4h,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:04:54 2015 UTC,Im really on the fence with this one.  How is combat compared to endless space?  I heard its somewhat hands off.  How long does an average game take to finish? How often will a new player lose?
4Xgaming,30h6ya,Azkik,2,Tue Mar 31 02:21:41 2015 UTC,"It's definitely more hands on than Endless Space. The review explains it pretty well, but the TL;DR is that you can design your own ships and your fleets are comprised of dozens of different fighters surrounding flagships that you can assign behaviors to."
4Xgaming,30h6ya,Giacomand,7,Tue Mar 31 15:33:13 2015 UTC,"So, I didn't really like the first game in this series, mostly because of three aspects:   Exploring star systems was trivial: You could just produce 50 scouts and after a couple of minutes the 50 closest systems were explored. Then, once you colonized a couple of systems and have more of an economy, build scouts for the remaining systems. They will be automatically explored.  The second was with the expand phase: The planets seemed interchangeable. Sure,  they had traits, but I never had to choose wether to colonise a planet or not. There were no real drawbacks for colonising more planets, except that you had to manage more stuff. Sometimes you would have to hold back for a while to let your economy get back up, but that was it.  Last, managing the systems. There was no good way to make sure a system is well defended. I normally built a couple of defense stations, but had to manually replace them after an attack. I had several fleets, but most inter system movement would be too slow to respond fast enough. Having local defense fleets in every system was not really an option, because it would be a nightmare for my economy and to manage, since replacing every loss would be extremely tiresome.  That said, have some of these aspects been improved in SR2?"
4Xgaming,30h6ya,KaiserTom,8,Fri Mar 27 14:00:54 2015 UTC,"Check the review out.  It goes over all those things.  But yes, all of those are significantly improved - we even have a Defense resource which automatically hardens planets/systems of your choice for you by putting support ships in orbit of planets you own.  You can still build Defense Platforms and such too of course.  The exploration is probably the least changed between the two titles - but there are multiple levels of exploration now with Anomalies and Scouts are still dirt cheap - but expensive to have a bunch of them.  Also the Nebula system can't be fully scouted with automation (or, well, it could - but you'd need a ship the size of a large star to do it)."
4Xgaming,30h6ya,jenjenregen,3,Fri Mar 27 14:05:29 2015 UTC,"Hm, I read the review but I found my specific points not really covered. Exploration goes mostly over the travel forms and states that there can be several different planets in a system, but not if these planets differ in a meaningfull way. I guess they can hold different resources but are they different in other ways, for example needing better tech to colonize volcanic planets or something else that substantially sets them apart?  I couldn't find much in the wiki about anomalies - only a mention in the article about asteroids. Can you elaborate on this?  Also, I don't really mind automatic exploration - I make extensive use of this feature in other games, for example in Distant Worlds. My main gripe is that exploration in the first game felt ... cheap? Exploring was trivially easy and there wasn't much that set systems apart, just the number of planets and small features like asteroids. In the end, every system was worthwhile to settle down in and most choice where to expand boiled down to either ""Which system is the closest"" or ""Which system has the most planets and is close"".  The defense mechanic sounds pretty interesting.  One feature I really liked in StarDrive was the fleet manager - One could set up a design for a fleet and after a battle you could quickly assess how much of your fleet was damaged, how much destroyed. Filling up the ranks amounted to a button which put the ships in production queues and automatically let them join the fleet once they were done. This made fleet managed much less of a chore. Any chance to get a similar mechanic in this game?"
4Xgaming,30h6ya,Firgof,5,Fri Mar 27 14:44:39 2015 UTC,"are they different in other ways, for example needing better tech to colonize volcanic planets or something else that substantially sets them apart?   They have varying attributes and in large galaxies by default some planets can be barren (and thus produce nothing) - but we don't prevent colonization, no.  The types of the planets matter for imperial constructions (some buildings are cheaper to build on some terrain types rather than others) and what native resources they start with.  There are over 50 native resources for planets and most have varying special effects.  Planets also can have attributes such as having a moon (which allows for the construction of a moon base), or attributes such as a Noxious atmosphere, ancient defenses which can be reactivated, and so on.  Level 0 planets, however, do cost money to maintain and going into debt hurts your global population growth rate as well as, eventually, your military strength across all fleets.  So it is reckless to colonize with abandon.   Can you elaborate on this?   Sure.  Anomalies like debris fields are scattered throughout the galaxy and must be scanned to enable interaction (all ships have the capability to scan things and one of the races even has a long-range, multi-system, anomaly scanner).  There are a variety of anomalies, each with their own options and little stories, and they produce a wide range of effects from forging permanent wormholes between systems to spawning new anomalies to providing permanent bonuses, subsystem unlocks, providing new influence cards, and so forth.  They can also be dangerous - some anomalies have the chance to make something bad happen like triggering the defenses of a derelict station or causing one of your researchers to go insane and go raid your systems in a brand new pirate ship.  Though we always provide the option to either ignore or destroy a potentially hostile anomaly.  That said, regarding your views on automatic exploration: I imagine you'll find the same opinion you had with Distant Worlds with Star Ruler 2 on that mechanic then.  We do not make exploration difficult, though choosing where to expand is important - as well as choosing which planets should become the icons of your empire.   One feature I really liked in StarDrive was the fleet manager - One could set up a design for a fleet and after a battle you could quickly assess how much of your fleet was damaged, how much destroyed. Filling up the ranks amounted to a button which put the ships in production queues and automatically let them join the fleet once they were done. This made fleet managed much less of a chore. Any chance to get a similar mechanic in this game?   From the description you've given, you can expect a nearly identical mechanic.  Though we don't save 'templates' of support ships on the design itself, we do much the same thing with the Manage Supports interface.  By your command, a fleet will even automatically clear their dead and fill themselves with what's available in friendly systems if you let them - or only rebuy their dead - or do neither and let you do it all manually."
4Xgaming,30h6ya,Giacomand,2,Fri Mar 27 15:09:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thorough explanation. This sounds really promising and I'll definitely pick this up next month!  Regarding the last thing, I don't expect something like this, but this was one of the easiest implementations of this system I've seen until now. The biggest flaw was that one had to edit the fleet design every time a design was upgraded. The fleet automation of Distant Worlds was a lighter implementation and often didn't work, but still made fleet management easier. SR2's implementation sounds like it would also lift some of the burden, and that's mostly what I'm looking for :)  Edit: Sorry for the confusing last paragraph, I misread something in your paragraph about the fleets >_< Yep, that sounds like I would like it!"

4Xgaming,30h6ya,marlowe221,5,Fri Mar 27 11:20:36 2015 UTC,"Ignoring all the major gameplay changes from the first, I think the most important thing about SR2 is how nice the UI is in functionality and looks. Especially the use of browser tabs for the UI, it's simple, functional, and familiar to most everyone, it's quite genius. Certain tasks have been made much simpler to accomplish but without sacrificing the complexity behind the decision, something more devs big and small need to take note of. Yes you can make your game more accessible without dumbing down the game.  I've said this before but you guys have really made something out of Star Ruler. You are probably used to it by now with SR1 but you probably won't have many sales at first for various reasons. Give it time, word of mouth takes time, but once it starts, it doesn't stop."

4Xgaming,30h6ya,Terkala,2,Fri Mar 27 13:06:56 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the type of play you like in 4X, but I do think Star Ruler 2 will still suck you in. I'm actually normally much more a fan of detail-heavy, micro-management and I didn't think I would like this game. SR2 works really well, I think, because the detail is certainly there, but the scope is different and I found it quite refreshing."
4Xgaming,30h6ya,Azkik,2,Sat Mar 28 06:12:28 2015 UTC,Wellp. There goes my afternoon. :)

4Xgaming,30h6ya,FargoFinch,2,Fri Mar 27 19:19:00 2015 UTC,Steam still says Early Access. Any idea when this will change? Will there be a sale associated with the Steam release as well?'  edit: I do see that version 1.0 was released 3/23/15. Strange they haven't removed the Early Access tag...  edit: Also found the prior article that said release is 3/27/15 and the price went up $5 one week prior to release...
4Xgaming,30h6ya,pocketknifeMT,4,Fri Mar 27 16:22:49 2015 UTC,Any idea when this will change?   In just a few moments.  When we press this big button right over here.  Which the boss' finger is over right at this moment.  Edit: Game will be launched in 4 minutes.

That was probably my biggest problem with the game as well.  The new features seem pretty exciting though. Particularly the artifacts, dual resource systems, and the new diplomacy system."
4Xgaming,30h6ya,lapin0u,2,Fri Mar 27 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not advantageous to colonize every planet you come across. You can actually cripple your economy if you do so.  Also, there are a lot of improvements you can do to planets that definitely make them more valuable than other planets. As well as certain planet modifiers making some plants vastly more valuable than others (like a tier 3 resource planet with 2x moons, which makes a prime-quality production world).  But it is true that a lot of planets are best left as level 0 ""base resource exporter"" planets. Which sort of makes sense. If you want to fit 50 billion people on a planet, you'd better have a garden world somewhere that can grow enough food for them."
4Xgaming,30h6ya,SharkMolester,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:11:14 2015 UTC,Then it sounds like there has been a good amount of improvement on that side of the issue. Excellent. That mainly leaves the pacing of the game.
4Xgaming,30h6ya,lapin0u,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:15:56 2015 UTC,The pacing is pretty fast by 4x standards. Which I personally like (because it means I can finish a multiplayer game in a single session).   But I can totally understand people who like having epic 8-24 hour games (such as can happen with Sins of a Solar Empire or many turn based 4x games).
4Xgaming,30h6ya,IfinallyhaveaReddit,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:57:27 2015 UTC,Seems like the game to draw me into 4x again. Haven't played a proper 4x in a while.

Similar in function to Battlestar Galactica’s jump drive, hyperdrives allow fleets to move from one system to another with a small warm-up time, as long as sufficient energy (FTL energy) is available.   Ummm...Battlestar Galactica had skip drive, not Hyperdrive. Hyperdrive is like like Star Trek or Star Wars. It moves in a linear fashion at greater than c. The Galactica makes jumps from A to B."

The distinct alien race gameplay, the nifty economic mechanics, the terraforming, and the diplomacy stand out to make a unique experience and a game that deserves your money and support.   Stay tuned for our full review on the 27th (hint: we liked it a lot)"
4Xgaming,2zz2ak,Terkala,3,Mon Mar 23 03:19:08 2015 UTC,"Is SR2 more of a multiplayer focus, or a singleplayer focus?  Do the different game mechanics work well together? I remember SR1 being a big bundle of ""great ideas, poorly implemented"".  Edit: I just purchased it myself on your recommendation. Explorminate does know 4x games, and I find myself mostly in agreement with your reviews in the past. Plus, they did give good support for the first game, so it's a developer that I feel is trustworthy."
4Xgaming,2zz2ak,bandwidthoracle,4,Mon Mar 23 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of worried this will get abandoned like SR1.  Edit: /u/Terkala is right, I have mixed Up Star Ruler with Star Drive, Star Ruler had great support."
4Xgaming,2zz2ak,Terkala,7,Mon Mar 23 05:05:25 2015 UTC,"No, no, that's Star Drive that got abandoned. Star Ruler actually had good post-release support (over a year of patches)."

4Xgaming,2zrr80,PseudoElite,17,Sat Mar 21 04:23:16 2015 UTC,"what about all the stories of the abandoned support for the first Stardrive? Should that be a major concern.   Well, the dev has admitted its a broken game that he will never support, yet continues to sell it (full price) while being sure to scrub the forums clean, especially before sales days. Beyond this he hasn't even given the code over to modders who actually are trying to make it a stable game still.  So while the dev and cwilsons here (the only guy posting Stardrive stuff in this sub) insist Dicicco has learned his lesson (an actual apology would be an admission of guilt), his actions so far paint a different picture.  Maybe it will be a good game. Who knows? Unity will certainly play ball with most systems right out of the gate for most things. That hardly means anything though in the grand scheme of how does a game perform. Besides, turn based strategy game tend to run on a different basis than your average game. 3D graphical power mean almost nothing. It's all about database transactions, something I doubt unity is optimized for. Beyond this, it usually balloons in size as the game goes on over a period of hours. This makes practical testing hard.  A FPS/open world with horrendous pop-in and frame drops is considered unfit for purpose, while civ5 was praised despite have the same problems (with even less of an excuse graphical power limit wise).  The criteria by which 4X games are judged are different.  UI needs to be good, have good mechanics, and it needs to be stable late game at least on a nice machine.  Being stable late game is the tallest order, and it will be hard to test until the game comes out and he gets guinea pigs.   All we know is that if it did turn out to be a mess, everyone who bought had better hope it takes him less than 6 months to sort it out or it's Stardrive 1 time again.  So to those who buy, I hope it works out for you, but I will totally be here to laugh and point if it doesn't. He will 100% cut and run at the first sign of trouble, but also continue to sell his mess. We know because he is currently doing this."

But I'm so desperate for a legitimate MoO2 successor that I'm willing to brave a potential catastrophe. Likely I'll get burned again but here's to hoping..."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,TBB51,3,Sun Mar 22 00:59:07 2015 UTC,"well the real-time aspects means its not a MOO2 successor in my book.  There are a few games around the corner that want to claim that title, Predestination and M.O.R.E. come to mind.   I haven't played either one yet, so who knows if they are any good."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,Corusmaximus,-1,Fri Mar 27 01:53:19 2015 UTC,A successor need not be a clone. And going from turn-based tactical battles to real-time battles is a welcome change.

4Xgaming,2zrr80,Corusmaximus,2,Fri Mar 27 11:50:25 2015 UTC,"Well sd2 isn't available for early access. There are no promised features that you should expect some time after release.   It's a much safer bet than buying something early access. If the game comes out and reviews are bad, that's what the game is."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,ducksaws,2,Thu Mar 26 22:14:23 2015 UTC,"The dev has been hands-off on moderating the steam forum for a good long while: https://steamcommunity.com/app/220660/discussions/0/37470847980070313/  I don't think you're working with the best information. I just spoke to one of the head modders of the first game who said that the mod team is working with the source code with the dev's blessing.  As far as my posting of stardrive stuff to this subreddit- I feel like sharing info about a project that I've given a small part of my time to. I'm one of about 7 guys who can answer questions people have about the game, and I'm quite happy to do so. You seem to shadow me on this sub and paint me as a suspicious character, but it doesn't get any more suspicious than what I've stated already.  I get that you've been pissed at the dev ever since your thread was deleted on the steam forum, and I agree with you that it was a bad thing for the dev to do. I think it's important to keep perspective though. The dev has given out steam keys to press and youtubers/streamers way ahead of release day. No-one will have to rely just on either of our opinions of the dev/game. There's going to be plenty of independent info out there for people to base their decisions on, and that's good for everybody."

4Xgaming,2zrr80,thiosk,5,Sun Apr 5 21:21:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't get involved with it, but I have been involved in complex multi-person projects before. If your project has deep structural problems and difficulties, sometimes it needs to be abandoned and you need to start over fresh.  Thats why I don't fault the maker for SD1. This is the risk with the early access model, and its a distributed version of risk that the traditional publisher model assumes. However, under the old system, we'd never have really seen  SD 1 or SD2, so I value the opportunity to pick projects that appeal to me and support them through early access."

I get why people who bought in are annoyed, I'm simply stating that I understand how and why projects fail and when we choose to partake in early access, I really feel like we're buying into ideas, rather than products, so we need to be really selective about which ones we choose to back.   If SD2 yields the right product that SD1 never could, i'm willing to overlook it. Its not like people are getting a buggati out of this, they're keeping the lights on.   /end impassioned defense of early access as a concept, not a defense of anyone in particular"
4Xgaming,2zrr80,MiracleWhippit,3,Sun Mar 22 00:51:47 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that stardrive 1 was almost entirely worked on by a single developer, the guy selling the game.   from the iceberg interactive's faq page of stardrive:   Please understand that ZeroSum is an incredibly small development team consisting of one programmer, with additional outsourced art. It does not have the capacity or tempo of a larger studio for developing regular additional content and pushing out fixes. Additionally, Iceberg and ZeroSum’s commitment to deliver StarDrive 2 places a considerable demand on the developer’s available time.   If there were a falling out of a group of people I would totally understand the difficulty... I don't know much about SD2's development team (as to if it has more than one person working on it) but SD1 was abandoned by the one guy at the head of his company."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,thiosk,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:03:33 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really change my argument much, though. If my project is a mess of spaghetti code and opposing design principles, it doesn't make sense to carry that particular code base forward,  and it may make more sense to take ideas and strategies that work and put them together in a new way from the bottom up. Up til now I've generally avoided commenting on this whole stardrive fiasco, since I didn't contribute, didn't participate in the forum, and have no skin in the game, nor can I evaluate stardrive 1 as a 4x entry."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,MiracleWhippit,8,Sun Mar 22 02:10:42 2015 UTC,"He started talking about a ""new unity project"" less than six months post release and was going on in interviews about how he wouldn't drop support for SD1 until SD2 was under development.  The guy released an incomplete game promising many features, took a vacation, fixed a bunch of crash bugs... and moved on.  I bought in a little over a month before the game was slated to release and the attitudes were that it would come out with most of the features and that he would patch in some stuff.  In april 2013 right before the release people begged him on the forums to wait... that it was still needing a few more months in the oven. His response...    I'm going to basically half-time StarDrive indefinitely post-release. I need to also change gears a bit so I will be working on something totally different in the rest of my time.   Later in the thread he goes on to talk about how he's been eating pancakes for two years and hopes that the release will give him enough money to hire a guy he knows.  The whole thing just leaves me feeling like the guy took my money and ran. He promised a lot of things and just threw them out the window... now he's got another shiny thing that looks like it's 'almost there' ready for us to line up and give him money...  Fool me once, shame on you."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,thiosk,3,Sun Mar 22 02:40:51 2015 UTC,"And to those of you who think I'm some sort of shill for StarDrive, you'll see some rather impassioned pleas from me (DevilDogFF) in that thread to hold off on release and I even speak of my disappointment of his decision.   And I'm still ready to let it all go."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,ExcelMN,0,Sun Mar 22 10:30:22 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm simply not rendering judgement here. Projects fail, and thats a challenge with the early access model. It is unfortunate that tthe practices of this dev turned so many in the small community against him. All i can say is if project zomboid were to flop and be unable to produce the functionality those devs promised, but then they came back and got a functional sequel to work, I'd buy in, because its about getting games for niche audiences that large scale publishers have avoided.  If the SD dev pissed you off, seriously don't buy into SD2, i really have nothing further to add."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,MiracleWhippit,-4,Sun Mar 22 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"It's always going to be a personal decision. There were definite issues with the dev's first game release. He most certainly needs to earn back the trust of part of his audience, and I'd say he's fully aware of that.  He's said here that he's set aside 6 months of post-release support for the game, even if it's a total flop sales-wise. If it is successful though, he wants the game to be a platform for much more expansion. Comparable to how Paradox grand strategy titles are supported.  He made the decision not to go early access because of his desire to only allow people to purchase once the product is solid. He's also not opening the steam store until the eve of release for similar reasons.  He's also giving players of the first game 30% off this one as a ""thank you"". And the game will only be $30RRP to begin with.  So, in my opinion, I'd say he's moving in the right direction. But, again, it's always going to be a personal decision whether you feel it satisfies your concerns."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,pocketknifeMT,8,Sat Mar 21 04:37:31 2015 UTC,He's also giving players of the first game 30% off    That is just not even close to good enough.

4Xgaming,2zrr80,thiosk,2,Sat Mar 21 03:27:47 2015 UTC,"He's said that mod support is really important to him. Everything's in XML. He's been expanding hooks according to the requests of the mod-savvy beta testers who are tinkering around with their own mods.   He wants more feedback on what other people want as well. There's some import functionality built within the game, but again he wants to expand that further.  Edit: Oh, and the Battle Arena has its own scenario/mission editor as well."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,pocketknifeMT,5,Sat Mar 21 03:34:19 2015 UTC,"Curious.  One of the things I noted about the map was theres a revolutionary planetary\solar view, giving the impression that you'll have real territory to manage and stars as destinations.  One of the things I dream about in 4x is a ""Real Stars"" makeup-- most planets are shit, the galaxy is huge, and the distances between stars absolutely forbidding.  I'm also extraordinarily interested in different warp strategies for different races, representing the different economic makeups and development path of different empires."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,thiosk,2,Sat Mar 21 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"One of the things I dream about in 4x is a ""Real Stars"" makeup-- most planets are shit, the galaxy is huge, and the distances between stars absolutely forbidding.   Yeah, I often think about how to build a game that plays with deep time somehow. The obvious problem with a real portrayal of the scale is visualizing it in any meaningful way. Hell, even in real life, If we snap our fingers and get a fantastic hard scifi ship and fly around at .99c I guarantee the ""bridge"" graphical display uses not-to-scale representations to show occupants trip information.  Even something as small and close together as the asteroid belt effectively looks like empty vacuum at human scale.  Staring at a black screen doesn't make for an interesting game.  Beyond this, how do you keep the player engaged while their ships take literal centuries to cross any distances at all without just fucking with the time scale so it doesn't even feel slow anymore?"
4Xgaming,2zrr80,midnight_toker22,3,Sat Mar 21 23:09:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think we need to actually have real-world transit-- FTL is such an amazing idea. The problem with 4X is that FTL is easy. When you start MOO type games you begin with this amazing engine and its just ticking tech boxes to extend range. I don't even know if fuel is the right idea.  Think back to the voyages to the new world back in the 1500s. It was a big endeavor, and it took 100 years of advances in sail technology before it got really reliable, and then it took steam engines to truly bring it to the masses.   When spore got pitched, there was an idea of ""building in the solar system"" setting up mining chains, manufactories, advancing the society in a peaceful solar environment.   Imaine how amazing the first FTL transit would be for the human race. Truly pioneering. Fraught with danger. Tiny probes bringing data about the process home, for refining the next mission. Next step human trials. Decades of surveying nearyby worlds as the drive tech improves. Trying to figure out how to bunny hop to further planets in the search for a colonizable worlds.   It gets better as the tech goes on, and i love the ""deep time"" note.  Deep time only really works with a spore-like / cities skylines type mentality. When you make it competitive, and have tech trees, build orders, etc, I think you lose the ability to do that as you focus on war.  When you think about the distances involved, what motivation would two human-like civilizations at nearly the equivalent tech levels have to actually fight? Even if you wiped them out, it will be hundreds of years before you can move a million people to their world.   Anyway, I think as a building type gamer, its such an interesting space for a game."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,WolfintheShadows,0,Sun Mar 22 00:59:13 2015 UTC,"There is some wiggle room in the galaxy customizer to adjust the richness and fertility of the galaxy generated, and there's a star count slider which will adjust both size and density of the galaxy within certain margins.  I'm not knowledgeable enough about the modding side of things to be able to tell you how flexible that can be made outside of the existing ranges, though it would certainly impact on game balance when it came to movement.  In terms of the movement on the strategy map; you have free movement within your supply range (the colored borders), but your fleet will consume some of its fuel reserves moving outside that range. You can outfit your ships with additional fuel tanks to expand your fleets fuel capacity. You can build ships that only serve as tankers if you find that more effective. Ships can refuel at planets, or deep space fuel stations that you can construct.  Wormholes act as shortcuts. There are also other constructables that extend reach, and techs/exploitable resources that give movement bonuses. There's quite a few tools that you can use, really, but I think I've covered the basics."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,midnight_toker22,3,Sat Mar 21 03:52:24 2015 UTC,Thats all quite interesting. Thank you for the details.
4Xgaming,2zrr80,WolfintheShadows,1 point,Sat Mar 21 06:07:10 2015 UTC,"Have you looked into Star Ruler 2?   It has a lot of really unique features, a lot of which you mentioned: races that have various warp technologies and governmental/economic systems, really interesting mechanics for empire development / building up colonies, massive galaxies with spaced out stars whose planetary positions are only relevant when you're in the system, territory that you will have to strategically defend until your economy is large enough to produce numerous fleets. It's got a lot of other great features you didn't  mention, like a really good ship designer and a one of a kind diplomacy system. It's RTS but time can be slowed down, sped up and paused.   It's still in early access on Steam but it's full release is in a week or two - if you get it now, you'll save $5 or $10 on the retail price. I highly recommend this one."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,midnight_toker22,1 point,Sat Mar 21 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"oh i bought into it.  When I was playing it, it was more a puzzle game-- linking planets together, with 1 resource per world.  i'll give it another look at release."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,runetrantor,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:13:55 2015 UTC,"It's still kinda like that, but they improved the automation for the economy a bit.

I thought about it, and im not really looking for a 4x game, i'm looking for that game pitched 4 years before spore. I kinda want a city builder, but in space-- if I want to spend six hours pruning the biospheres on some worlds to turn them into farming paradises, I don't really want to be punished for it by my empire collapsing everywhere else. At the same time, if I'm ready for some conflict, it should be available to me."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,TBB51,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:19:02 2015 UTC,"I can see how it feels like that. The early game, especially, when you're colonizing and developing planets can start to feel like a glorified game of connect the dots.  But by mid-game when the most of the galaxy has been colonized, you'll have your territory carved out and hopefully have a stable economy. Then your focus shifts from connecting resource chains to building on individual planets and building fleets.   The resource chains add an interesting strategic element to the game, both offensively and defensively. Offensively, if you pick the right enemy planet to conquer you can send a ripple effect up the chain and cripple their economy. Similarly on defense, you have to prioritize which systems to devote defensive resources too to prevent the same thing from happening to you."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,klngarthur,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:14:32 2015 UTC,The warp tech option alone has me really excited. I wish you could set it to game wide though and not just per your faction. Being able to change such a fundamental part of the game such as movement sounds great.
4Xgaming,2zrr80,TBB51,0,Tue Apr 7 11:16:53 2015 UTC,"Do you mean having access to multiple warp techs in a single game? Because I believe that actually is possible. I know for certain that there artifacts that allow you to install another type of FTL engine on a flagship, and you might even be able to unlock another through research. Don't quote me on the last one though."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,zzerk,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:11:47 2015 UTC,"I'd thought it was only a per player tech. For example, mine uses relays, ai1 uses ftl, ai2 uses hyperdrive etc. I'd like the option to either set it to each player picks one and that's it, being able to research any of them, or picking one for everyone to use the entire game. I'm not sure if you can do all of those or only some of them. I just meant I'd like the ability to set those rules when starting a game. As that can really change a lot about how things play out."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,Shadowstalker75,0,Tue Apr 7 13:49:19 2015 UTC,"Well each race uses one tech, so in picking race, you pick an FTL. That is the standard play style.   You can also customize your race as well as the AI races, so you can set it so that every players uses the same FTL tech.   There are also artifacts that allow you to outfit flagships with additional FTL techs. For example, I chose a race that used fling beacons. After the game started, I found an artifact that let me equip like a slipstream generator or instant warp engine or something like that.   I have a vague recollection of other warp techs far out in the tech tree but I'm less certain about that.   So hopefully among all those options, you find something that suits you."

4Xgaming,2zrr80,worldnewsftw,6,Sun Mar 22 04:46:24 2015 UTC,I really pinned a lot of my MoO2-successor hopes on StarDrive and was really disappointed. I wish that wasn't tainting my view of this but it is.  That said the video looks incredible so I'm probably going to end up buying it anyway.
4Xgaming,2zrr80,topenhargen,4,Sat Mar 21 05:54:59 2015 UTC,"FWIW, SD2 should be a lot more like MoO II than SD 1 was.  Aside from the game being turn based, many of the mechanics are identical to their counterparts from MoO II, eg the tech tree, colony management, and the basic economics of the game."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,MadBroRavenas,5,Sat Mar 21 09:22:48 2015 UTC,"Yea I definitely noticed that. I also thought it amusing that this particular video reviewer kept talking about homages to great Sci fi films while ignoring the blatant MoO2   To be sure, MoO2 took a lot from established Sci Fi but idk if this guy ever played MoO2 at all. Not that there's a huge problem with that but something I noticed.  Also worth mentioning that SD2 could end up being even more complex and interesting given how random events, ship construction, etc. are handled. Fingers crossed on this one,  it's on my watchlist now."
4Xgaming,2zrr80,ran88dom99,2,Sat Mar 21 16:48:03 2015 UTC,"A game with RTS combat is never quite going to have the same feeling as MOO2, TBS combat is such a fundamental part of MOO2."

Its a full RTS like distant worlds, while close to similar combat as star drive 2 and the ship designer is similar to sd1/sd2.

4Xgaming,2zn3ar,Eraser1024,18,Thu Mar 19 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"Eventhough there were a lot of improvements with 1.0 compared to the last EA version I still probably wouldn't recommend the game. I've been playing MoM on and off since about 1995 and it's probably my favorite game but especially my favorite 4x of all time. Since then I played several other games that were similar but didn't quite satisfy the MoM itch (AoW,Elemental,Fallen Enchantress,Endless Legend) - if it was grid-based and had tactical combat I probably played it at some point.  Most of my criticism comes down to promises of a true MoM successor as well as bad execution. Here are some things that I do not enjoy about the game:   Races: most races are extremes in some way or another and while there are fewer races than in MoM they are also not as unique as in MoM. MoM had a lot of ""easy"" races that allowed newer players to learn the ropes of the game, namely High Men,Barbarians,Beastmen,Nomads,Orcs and Halflings. In WoM there's one ""easier"" race (High Men) with a glaring flaw which I will cover later on. In MoM all races looked unique,had unique traits and abilities and playstyles. It's probably why I still consider MoM to be one of the best fantasy 4x games out there, because newer games still haven't delivered on that level of diversity that translates well into differing gameplay. Unit balance: Werewolves is all I'm saying. Werewolves are roaming creatures that will start popping up at around turn 70, which is still considered early game I guess. They mitigate a flat 15 points of mundane (physical, non-magical) damage from EVERY attack. If you play High Men with their only weakness being no offensive caster units and you didn't pick offensive elemental magic schools during your faction creation you're shit out of luck. You then rely on blessing archer units and hoping they crit so that you may deal about 5 points of unmitigated damage to them. I had a playthrough where 5 werewolves roamed to my main city and attacked individually each turn. They would instantly retreat because they were outnumbered, so I had about 3 turns to deal damage to them with my archers before they successfully fled. It took a good 6-10 turns per werewolf to kill them using this method and they didn't stop spawning. At this point I just conceded the campaign and started a new one. Building balance: It feels like the costs for buildings are somewhat badly tuned. It's very easy to run into a gold deficit in this game which forces the player to expand early. It's almost impossible to play tall due to this while in MoM it was entirely possible to survive late into the game with a single city. The early expansion is also pretty costly in that you now need more units to guard your cities from roaming creatures which there are a lot of. Units: Again,somewhat lackluster when compared to the original MoM. Even the cheapest units (Spearmen) in MoM had a purpose due to their numbers but it feels like this aspect was completely left out of WoM (most units seem to be 4 figures and that's it). This issue ties in with mechanics used in the game. I highly recommend checking out the combat mechanics pages on the MoM wiki just to appreciate how intricate the system they used is (in a game that was made over 20 years ago mind you) and then compare it to modern day 4x games. Again, no real unique traits between races that are shared with all units. Hero units feel bland and useless for the most part and their in-game models are atrocious. They don't feel like unique characters like in MoM at all. Combat: WoM is one of those games where you are never sure if spells do what they say they do in the description, although the devs seem to be fixing several issues around spells with every patch. In MoM's melee combat both units attack simultaneously you get a damage roll*hit chance per figure in your unit which is then mitigated by the target's defense - so every figure that hits and isn't blocked or misses deals damage. Due to this, if you reduce the number of figures in a stack with spells or ranged attacks it also reduces the amount offensive and defensive rolls the target can do. This doesn't seem to be the case in WoM. You get hilarious events like attacking the last of the 4 figures in a 13 attack unit with your hero and being dealt 42 damage in return, instantly killing your full hp hero unit. Due to the overall state of the game at that time I'm not sure if this was just a bug or actual game mechanics though. Graphics: Graphics and animations in this game are sadly terrible and look like they come from the early 3D era. Personally I don't mind them too much because I play games (and especially 4x games) for the gameplay and not their graphics. I just think Wasteland Interactive could've chosen a different graphical style which suits their skills/capabilities better. It's highly ambitious to pull of great graphics for a game of this scale with a small (and possibly inexperienced) team.   In the end I bought the game because I really wanted a great MoM successor to sink endless hours into like I did with MoM but WoM probably won't be that game. I wouldn't recommend buying it now at full price but it's probably not a bad deal on a sale with several patches until then. WI took a lot of great ideas from MoM and tried to stay true to the game but they didn't achieve the overall level of polish and complexity/depth MoM had (and which probably made the game still relevant to its fanbase 20 years after release)."
4Xgaming,2zn3ar,SeriousDan,9,Fri Mar 20 10:43:01 2015 UTC,"Given how thoroughly you clearly understand MoM, may I ask what you consider the best of the ""spiritual successors"" that you've tried?"
4Xgaming,2zn3ar,Pitchwife,9,Fri Mar 20 12:48:51 2015 UTC,"It's probably between Fallen Enchantress,WoM and AoW (although I feel reluctant to name AoW here because it's its own franchise that is pretty much as old as MoM).FE felt kind of like MoM but in the end the customization options were also what limited the game. Different factions were mostly skin-based recolors and they didn't feel unique enough because of everything having to stay customizable. A lot of strategy and game planning also fell flat because you could just build the same units on every faction you created and for most of the time initiation was the best stat units could have so there was very little incentive to try other things (also I'm not creative enough to come up with original stuff that is also viable every time). Overall still a very enjoyable game like most Stardock games I've played.    AoW and WoM both have similar sorcerer customizations as MoM but WoM obviously tries to stay truer to the original. Out of the 3 games AoW is the most polished though."
4Xgaming,2zn3ar,SeriousDan,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"I played the 1st one (AoW) back in the day. I get what you mean about it being its own franchise by now, which leads me to ask if you happen to know if AoW 3 manages to feel like a modernized MoM at all, or has following their own path led by now to a very different game.  Thanks for taking the time to answer, by the by. I don't have the time to play a lot anymore so guidance towards the good stuff (and away from misfires) really is a benefit."
4Xgaming,2zn3ar,Pitchwife,6,Fri Mar 20 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"It feels a bit like MoM but it doesn't allow as much faction customization as WoM/MoM. You can pick your class (out of 6), race (out of 7) and 3 specialization points. Your class decides which units you can get for each race, so there are certain combinations that work better than others while the specialization allows you to specialize in magic schools or other game changing traits (improved scouting/vision, improved expansion and the like).  One of the things AoW 3 does really well is the tactical combat which is probably the most polished and satisfying out of the recent 4x games that fall into the MoM-like category. Hero units can become powerful rather quickly and the skill system reminds me of the old Warlords games if you ever played them (before the Battle Cry series).  The games share a lot of similarities that come with the genre but it's not really trying to be a spiritual successor to MoM - it's a great successor of the AoW series though and I'd highly recommend checking it out.   Thanks for the gold by the way."

4Xgaming,2zn3ar,midnight_toker22,2,Fri Mar 20 17:18:02 2015 UTC,I have high hopes for it to become better with time. When they announced the release date I was very worried with the outcome of the game because it felt rushed and the EA version at that time was nowhere near release-worthy. Between the last EA version and 1.0 a LOT was improved so I'm sure the potential is there but it remains to be seen if WI has the funds and motivation to keep improving the game without making it a DLC-fest. WI reads and responds a lot to the posts on their Steam forums page so it seems they are very open to feedback which is always a good thing.  I'm not sure if there will be modding though. I remember there being quite an uproar back with Might and Magic X: Legacy about the devs announcing mod support and people realizing they had to buy a licence for Unity that costs a shitload of money to release modded content. WoM is also a Unity engine game so there may be similar problems (I'm not sure if the free personal edition of Unity allows for modding content).

4Xgaming,2zl363,RIngan,14,Thu Mar 19 14:05:27 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree. Take XCom (all versions) for an example.  Both strategy (overall research and manufacturing goals) and tactics (squad level) are both strongly encouraged. The game accomplishes this by establishing a firm line between the two halves of the game. They're essentially two separate games, but they influence the other game strongly.   The strategy layer depends on how successful each tactical mission is. If your tactics are weak (you're unable to capture live aliens, you loose too many troops, you destroy enemy weapons/equipment during a mission) then the strategy layer of the game will be crippled.  The tactics layer depends on your strategy. If you don't manufacture the right weapons and equipment by the middle-section of the game you will find yourself hopelessly outclassed by the enemy. No amount of good tactics can make you win the game if your strategy is poor.  The top reply to his comment also mirrors my statements here by bringing up Endless Legend. That game also draws a strong line between the strategic and tactical gameplay. By having that division, you can allow the two systems to influence each other without having one that absolutely must trump the other.  Civilization is a game that does contain both strategy and tactics, but it is also a game where the tactics game is extremely shallow. It's easy to argue that tactics basically didn't exist in Civilization 1/2/3/4, and only existed in Alpha Centauri and Civ 5. This shallowness of tactics is what makes that an example of a game that doesn't strongly encourage both strategy and tactics."

I think his point is that you should have essentially two separate games, but the way Civ does combat on the strategy layer, you just end up with weak tactics in an otherwise strategy level game."
4Xgaming,2zl363,Driscon,11,Thu Mar 19 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"The problem with Civ V was that there isn't enough variability between units. A tank is just a bigger horseman, which is just a bigger spearman. In real life units have very distinct weaknesses, strengths, and roles in combat that cannot be represented with just one value. Units need to have at least three different values to minimally simulate real warfare. Soft Attack, representing a unit's ability to deal damage to light or unarmored targets.  Hard Attack, representing a unit's ability to break armour. Armour, representing a unit's ability to resist Soft Attack. Speed and LoS are natural additions which improve the simulation but don't directly affect combat. Health can be represented by a unit's armour or can be tracked separately. My preferred simulation tracks Health as Moral (representing the soldiers willingness to keep fighting) and Equipment (representing the soldiers ability to keep fighting), allowing for further depth. This very basic combat simulation now has seven stats, allowing for a huge variety of units with all sorts of different roles. Factor in cost and you have a remarkably deep combat system without very much effort. I'm extremely disappointed no Civ game has even attempted to correct this glaring flaw in the series."
4Xgaming,2zl363,Jaxck,7,Thu Mar 19 19:18:51 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of good points.  Having only Attack, Defense, and HP to define units as disparate as unarmed peasants, Panzer tanks, and mounted crossbow men is, well, too 'gamey.'  Granted, it IS a game, but giving the game a little bit more of a simulation feel could only be a good thing.  Unfortunately, the series seems more interested in 'approachability' and garnering new, younger fans than satisfying the growing needs of its established fanbase.  Personally, I no longer view Firaxis as the King of the 4x like I used to.  Endless Legend was in every single way a more satisfying game than Civilization: BE, and personally I did not care for CivV either.  The Xcom remake was a quality title but, again, felt too 'gamey' for me as opposed to the original, which felt like an alien invasion simulator.  Firaxis needs to inject a bit more 'sim' into its games (and in the case of Civ BE especially,some fucking personality) before it becomes synonymous with disappointment."
4Xgaming,2zl363,FalseTautology,2,Thu Mar 19 20:16:33 2015 UTC,most rts games perform strategy and tactics on the same layer.
4Xgaming,2zl363,tomassavage,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"XCOM solves the problem by making strategic level serve tactical. Yeah, there's all this minigame with base building but however you look at it tactical combat is the place where everything is decided. If you're idiot in strategic part you just don't progress. If you're idiot in tactical battles you lose the game, period.  Meanwhile in Civ you can be terrible at war and still win cause war is not bound to happen and even if it happens you can just defend without moving your troops and prevail thanks to culture and economy. You can go into tactics and rush everyone to death barely developing your cities. Or you could not use tactics at all and win by culture/economy/diplomacy. This is why XCOM is fundamentally different, just like Heroes of Might and Magic (arguable) or King's Bounty where strategic part only serves tactical one. Meanwhile in games like Total War (probably), Endless Legend, Age of Wonders and Civilization you can win by being great strategist OR great tactician and both parts of the game try to be in balance. It's much harder trick to pull."
4Xgaming,2zl363,Ilitarist,18,Fri Mar 20 10:49:43 2015 UTC,"Long winded drivel. There are multiple examples of both being employed successfully without one eclipsing the other.  The problem is that Civ is a bad example because the strategic game can make tactics irrelevant (e.g. tanks vs spearmen). But when the AI is incompetent the opposite becomes true (incidentally, this is why AI is so important in 4x games).   But you can make a decent game that hits both, that's not even an issue. Hell take chess for example."
4Xgaming,2zl363,crasher_pt,7,Thu Mar 19 17:45:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree with him, and have to go along with the Endless Legends example everyone is pointing out.  To add something else, part of what makes Civ great is building your own history, or rewriting history. History is full of small, outnumbered forces, defeating a larger force. Sometimes due to tech which they model fine, but also numerous times due to supreme tactical edge.  You could never relive a 2nd Punic war scenario in Civ4 simply because the Roman doomstacks would crush your inferior sized Carthage army. No Hannibal to turn it the other way."
4Xgaming,2zl363,topher_r,3,Thu Mar 19 16:05:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah but would you want that level in a game like Civ? I think that's the question that it boils down to.  I am personally okay with a 50-50 split between strategic and tactical aspects, but other people would prefer something like 90-10.  We don't have the choice within the game tho. If you want a different game balance, you'd have to play a different game."
4Xgaming,2zl363,zeph88,4,Thu Mar 19 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"I personally think tactical control is possibly too much for Civ, but some solution for these variances in wars would be nice. Perhaps stacks actually being ""armies"" you raise, with a general, cohesion, experience, legacy. These generals could have big impacts on the outcome of a battle. Perhaps they do better in deserts, or better with archers.  Thats the kind of depth I see being valuable at a strategic level, while also making wars more than an economic battle of attrition that Civ4 and prior boils down to."
4Xgaming,2zl363,topher_r,5,Thu Mar 19 17:08:26 2015 UTC,"In civ 4 and below you had stack of dooms, in civ 5 tactics is critical because you are not allowed to stack units. This was all a consequence of making a playable game where you are not allowed unitstacking.  What they should have done is look at some paradox-games and introduce attrition to discourage a stack of doom, but still allow stacking to some point to create armies.   I think Civ5 shows why you cannot have military strategy and military tactics in the same game.   You cant look at one game, and its sequels and decide all games must obey the observations you make."
4Xgaming,2zl363,MisterCooper8472,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"Great point, attrition should have been the drastic change between 5 and <=4, not the exaggerated low number of units we manage now at >=5"
4Xgaming,2zl363,pomodois,3,Thu Mar 19 23:56:22 2015 UTC,A dead-simple solution to this is to increase the number of units allowed on a tile from 1 to 3. You can even add game mechanics such as combining certain types of troops to add bonuses. I don't see why they didn't do that in Beyong Earth.
4Xgaming,2zl363,ohfuckreddit,3,Sun Mar 22 13:06:11 2015 UTC,"The reason why they didn't do that in beyond earth is (if I'm correct) because most of the code in Civ:BE is just heavily edited code from Civ 5 (I'm not 100% sure about this though). Also probably because they wanted the game to feel familiar to players of Civ 5. I think of beyond earth as kind of the same thing for civ 5 that Civ4:Col was for Civ 4. although I haven't actually played beyond earth myself, just watched a lot of videos and heard from other who have played it."
4Xgaming,2zl363,andreasn2,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:00:11 2015 UTC,"I'm still a 4 player but tried 5 and BE for a while. They both feel too similar as happened with 4 and Civ:Col, although I think BE is better optimised than 5 and needs a lower-end PC."
4Xgaming,2zl363,pomodois,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:19:31 2015 UTC,That would be a nice solution (and that's how several mods dealt with Civ4's Stacks o'Doom). Also I think the huge jump in system requirements from 4 to 5 could be influencing my opinion as I still prefer 4 rather than 5 or BE.
4Xgaming,2zl363,pomodois,3,Sun Mar 22 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's true to an extent when you are playing against AI.  The worse the AI is at either strategy or tactics, the more it ruins the other aspect of the game.  It would be amazing how much fun civ 5 could potentially be if the AI didn't such so bad at tactics."
4Xgaming,2zl363,ssJeff,3,Thu Mar 19 22:04:58 2015 UTC,"Everyone who talks about Endless Legend should set battles to auto or even deliberately give bad orders and see that tactical battles are not as important as they may seem. Strategy decides the outcome of Endless Legend, tactics are not important."
4Xgaming,2zl363,Ilitarist,3,Fri Mar 20 11:00:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that strategy is what mainly decides the outcome of the battle. But tactics do make a difference, they make the difference between if you lose 3 units in a battle or if you lose 1, or even 0."
4Xgaming,2zl363,andreasn2,3,Sun Mar 22 13:53:11 2015 UTC,"This is stupid. The only reason tactics dominate in civ5 is because the ai is fucking atrocious.   If the ai could figure out that the best way to take a city is NOT to attack amphibiously across a lake with non amphibious units surrounded on all sides by enemies, it would do a lot better."
4Xgaming,2zl363,ducksaws,2,Fri Mar 27 04:11:48 2015 UTC,"I rather liked the point someone brought up with Endless Legend later on.   I also think that a game like Sword of the Stars does both Strategic and Tactical gameplay decently well.  In both games what you can field in a single battle is limited, so you can bring all of the units you want to the field, but you can only use so many effectively. That means that one side could capitalize on choosing a battlefield advantageous to their side, use units, weapons, movement (Tactics!) to great advantage vs a numerically superior enemy.  And with the world/galaxy layer where you can mass-produce units or direct your faction to do one thing, that's your strategy, and is encouraged to be done.   So I think that you CAN strongly encourage both strategic and tactical gameplay in games. Just that it's hard to balance them, or hasn't been balanced very well in the past?"
4Xgaming,2zl363,Niarro,2,Thu Mar 19 15:49:48 2015 UTC,The idea that strategic and tactical balance are mutually exclusive is an absurd artefact of civs bizarre design philosophy.
4Xgaming,2zl363,Jaxck,2,Thu Mar 19 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"Seems true enough! I wouldn't call it a bizzare design philosophy, though. Perhaps just one more focused on the strategic/macro level?"
4Xgaming,2zl363,Niarro,4,Thu Mar 19 20:09:59 2015 UTC,"I agree somewhat but I generally do not dislike Civ 5's combat as much, because I like to micro units too. However I think it could have been done better, such as stacking units etc.  My favourite was always the way Total War handled this; against ai, yes you had the tactical advantage, because of the better decision making during combat, but there is a limit on how much bigger enemy armies can I fight and still win."
4Xgaming,2zl363,zeph88,3,Thu Mar 19 16:32:46 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree. EndlessLegend is a good example, but I'd argue that Hearts of Iron is an even better one. The ability to develop your country and successfully guide it into WWII is only half the game. The other half is the complex tactical manoeuvring needed to beat your opponent. Another example would be Starcraft. The strategy of deciding what units to produce and bring to the battle is only part of the gameplay. Micro, the RTS version of tactics, is a huge part of the game. The biggest problem with a lot of the Civ games philosophy is this idea that strategy and tactics are mutually exclusive concepts. As soon as you have a resource system and uneven distribution (usually provided by hidden information) you have strategy. Being able to handle the minutiae of a given situation in between periods of distribution (such as between the start and end of combat in a game of Magic) is tactics. One cannot exist without the other unless you are looking to make Chess."
4Xgaming,2zl363,Jaxck,2,Thu Mar 19 19:09:32 2015 UTC,"Everyone is bringing up games with both tactical and strategic maps or modes, but I don't think that's what he's getting at. In Civ5 there is only one map. Sure you can do things like plug up choke points and maybe defend from forests instead of plains, but usually if your opponent shows up with better & more units than you, you will lose. Strategy will make your tactics irrelevant. Now take a game like Hearts of Iron, where unit types, leader stats, multiple types of terrain factors, weather, time of day, and even some random battle events will affect the outcome of combat. At that point you need to have both a solid strategy and solid tactics. You could be attacking France with the very best German armor divisions and outnumbering them by a large margin, but still fail because you attacked over a river into a fortress with a bad leader and forgot to assign air cover to the area."
4Xgaming,2zl363,Smurph269,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:59:47 2015 UTC,Hearts of Iron 3 has both of those things on a single map.
4Xgaming,2zl363,Desertcyclone,2,Tue Mar 31 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. OUPT takes what has always been a great strategic game down to a tactical yet wholly unsatisfying level and ruins the entire game.  Edit: Let me be clear I don't feel that tactical combat has no place in a 4x game. In fact my favorite 4x game Space Empires 4 has a very deep tactical combat system. I just think the half-ass implementation of ""tactical"" combat in Civ5 and Civ:BE is awful. Either the game needs to be totally strategic ala Civ4 and CKII or have real tactical battles ala SE4 and Total War."
4Xgaming,2zl363,combatwombat-,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:40:58 2015 UTC,"Really? If the AI was actually aware of the strategic advantage it had, the game would have been much better. As it stands, everytime you take your elite archers and a chokepoint against the AI, it keeps moving back and forth, letting you take pot shots, or it will suddenly change its target city. There appear to be competing logic routines in the AI that fuck up what it should be recognizing: a material advantage and a horde of bodies to throw at a chokepoint until it breaks open.  Of course, all of that goes out the window if you're playing against a human opponent."
4Xgaming,2zl363,unanun,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:28:39 2015 UTC,I feel Master or Orion 2 did both well enough. The strategic supported the tactical game with new weapons tech. And the tactical game supported the strategic game by allowing you to circumvent a technologically superior opponent by being smart about ship placement and firing arcs.
4Xgaming,2zl363,couggod,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:17:05 2015 UTC,"Dominions 4 is another good one that would disagree.  Economic strategy is a HUGE part of the game, as are strategic troop movements.  Equally huge are the tactical choices you make in your army disposition.  You can not win a game of this without being good at both of these."

Scarcity Online is meant to be multiplayer ( but hoping for single player once I get to an AI ).  You will have to mine asteroids to exploit the ore. Explore around you for more asteroids. Create a balance between defending your existing asteroids, building a fleet of ships to exterminate any enemies and expanding to other asteroids to keep the ore and war machines going. Your spies should provide help with attacking others and keeping you informed of your enemies plans. Diplomatic relations, establishing defensive pacts, non-attack agreements, alliances will make your job even harder.   In the end you are an employee of a mining company which wants to expand to own all of the ore - something your competition might disagree with a wee bit."

4Xgaming,2z8k2s,real_jeeger,3,Mon Mar 16 17:05:41 2015 UTC,This game is anything but lightweight. I've played a couple dozen hours and still haven't fully wrapped my head around some mechanics.

4Xgaming,2z8k2s,crasher_pt,5,Mon Mar 16 20:30:52 2015 UTC,"The entire thing reads like an ad campaign for at-the-gates. Every bullet point is   I know you didn't like it in Civ 5. But I'm doing it differently now in a vaguely defined way.   In addition a lot of his explanation is flat out wrong. He actually didn't know that the global happiness system was widely abused to make large empires of small cities.   The problem was that happiness strongly encouraged you to stay small and the penalties for not obliging with this demand were quite harsh   Which is entirely wrong. You could make huge empires of 4 size cities, spamming them as densely as possible with a circus each. And that strategy could basically curb stomp immortal difficulty."
4Xgaming,2z8k2s,crasher_pt,2,Mon Mar 16 21:54:43 2015 UTC,"You're being sarcastic, right? He throws Civ V under the bus to make his new game look better and offers no explanation whatsoever on what went wrong. The AI section, for example, is the prime example of that."

4Xgaming,2z8k2s,arstin,0,Tue Mar 17 15:21:18 2015 UTC,"Source: reality. Lead designer is responsible for making the design decisions. While he probably didn't code the AI, he was responsible for designing a system that's hard to code in the first place. Lead designer can't simply shrug it to programmer's fault.  Maybe some designers are special super creatures with the testicular fortitude to bring down his original design when it doesn't work instead of delivering a deeply flawed product. Maybe it's not in their hands and it's the producers which held a gun to their heads. But this is a small world, with small memory and things need to be said.   What you say can be 100% true, I was just making a caveat."

If you like Starships - I do too - you may want to see if you can dig up a copy of the 1998 Interplay title Starfleet Command, which is a note-perfect implementation of the classic Starfleet Battles tactical starship combat game. I recently went back to it and found it to be just as engaging in 2015 as it was all those years ago."

Meet minor races like the Bolians or Mintakans and absorb them and their unique strengths into your empire via diplomacy or conquest. Survive occasional attacks from The Borg.  It was a wonderful game, with my only complaint being that it was made during the TNG era and therefore far too early to include lore from Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise.

4Xgaming,2z2axh,hamdingers,4,Mon Mar 16 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"It's not a 4x, and it's tied to a kinda lame linear story but an old game called Nexus: The Jupiter Incident is probably one of my favorite space games. It calls itself a tactical fleet simulator. You have a small fleet that gets bigger as the game goes on, adding different ship types. You can upgrade each module on all your ships between missions, or move them between ships. Ships take damage on individual systems, so you can do stuff like take out the engines and weapons and leave the enemy floating while you handle the rest of the mission. It's kinda like Fire Emblem in that if a ship is destroyed it's gone forever so you really need to find a way to beat each mission with zero losses. I remember the missions were really well done. You couldn't just fly straight at the enemy and fight them, you had to use stealth, set traps, etc. I haven't played it in a while but it might be what you are looking for."

4Xgaming,2z2axh,Wolff_Laarcen,0,Sun Mar 15 13:52:01 2015 UTC,"Well, no offense, but Starships has been pretty much panned as being an oversimplified tablet game masquerading as a PC 4x, so I'ma assume you don't have a huge amount of experience.  Given that, I would suggest Endless Space; it is significantly simpler than GalCivs (any of them), or Sins while still offering a complete experience.  Sins is a combination of TB and RTS and as such has a lot going on; personally I found it a bit overwhelming and prefer GalCiv2.  I can't remember what's up with Stardrive 2, I apparently don't own it and don't remember why.  I have a 50% off coupon for either the base game or Disharmony, the expansion.  If you opt for Endless Space PM me your steamname and you can have it."

I personnaly don't think that disharmony is required"

4Xgaming,2z2axh,Jaxck,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"Sins is the most polished and smoothest to play of the lot, but also ends up being extremely challenging as a result. Endless Space is an amazing deconstruction of the genre, with some really good ideas. However it lacks depth and can play very similar no matter the faction or game setup. GalCiv 3 is GalCiv 2 with a fresh coat of paint, so if you like AI which is actually responsive (and thus more interesting) then that's the game for you. However GalCiv has an unnecessary complicated tech tree and unit production system (Endless Space does it better), which makes going from something smooth like Sins a real chore. I have the least experience with Stardrive, but I feel that it falls about halfway between the overcomplex GalCiv and the calm simplicity of EndlessSpace. It's worth adding that Sins is an RTS, not a true 4X."

To me, it's really hard to come back to Civ after picking up EU4 as it just feels like mechanics are missing from the game to make it interesting enough. That being said, playing EU4 can stress me out as I'm not really all that great at it still while I have Civ5 down pretty well (I've beaten Deity a few times, know some timings, have a good sense of tech order etc) so if I'm looking for something relaxing to play or I'm drunk and don't have the capacity to deal with a game of EU4 I play some Civ"

Sure, you have your own individual character and his friends and relatives, but you also have an entire realm to work with, with its own armies and technology and economy. Plus the whole idea of external diplomacy. The role-playing aspect just adds a certain twist to your typical 4X grand strategy formula."

As a consumer, let me just say, be very careful about drift of scope! moving away from your pure strategic model to a more ""tactical"" real-space model may not mesh with what you have in mind for the game!  I'll be very clear-- a tactical combat/diplomacy oriented game is not appealing to me. Speaking for me and me alone, i'm looking for more Anno2070+SimCity meets Rome Total War empire with the original vision for spore. It doesn't exist. Ive noted that the 4x community seems to be made of a lot of individuals looking for specific jalopies like that, and its great that in recent years we're seeing some fresh ideas come across.  I do scientific research, and i think the same concepts for project selection can be applied to game development and science publishing-- make sure you have the scope well-thought-out in your own head well in advance of putting pen to paper, or else you can find yourself in a situation where you have a lot of things put together but no cohesive vision tying it together."

4Xgaming,2xpto8,Corusmaximus,3,Mon Mar 2 22:11:44 2015 UTC,Soooooo worth it if you can get past the ui.
4Xgaming,2xpto8,looks_at_lines,2,Tue Mar 3 02:07:00 2015 UTC,How is the single-player?
4Xgaming,2xpto8,Infamously_Unknown,5,Tue Mar 3 02:34:53 2015 UTC,"You can often hear that the AI is terrible and it's true. The strategic possibilities in this game are vast and the AI feels like a new player struggling with the mechanics. That's not really something very surprising in this genre though and you'll usually hear this complaint from veterans who already find the AI too simple to defeat. If you're new to the game though, it still gives you a good target practice and you still have a lot of hours ahead of you before you reach the point where you master it enough that AI stops being a satisfying opponent. You'll still get your ass kicked at first even in a fair fight and you can give it a bonus to income just like in Civilization.  Unless you're on a really tight budget, I'd say that for this price it's worth it even for SP alone. And I'm pretty sure you'll get an itch for MP along the way as well."
4Xgaming,2xpto8,Avohaj,2,Tue Mar 3 05:36:48 2015 UTC,How do the battles work? Is it more Total War or more Heroes of Might and Magic? (those two come to mind seeing the screenshots) Or completely different?
4Xgaming,2xpto8,Avohaj,1 point,Tue Mar 3 12:00:26 2015 UTC,"They are more like Total War in the way that you can see every unit in the battle, not a stack and a number. But the battles are not like any of thoses games as you give all orders before the battle starts. Then you view a replay of the battle after it has happened and you can also inspect individual units there and see how they were doing and if they managed to follow your plan."
4Xgaming,2xpto8,Infamously_Unknown,1 point,Tue Mar 3 12:42:55 2015 UTC,So it's more like Civ but with some sort of planing (like Endless Space?). I assume the replays are optional eye-candy? Can I see everything in some sort of battle report without having to watch them?
4Xgaming,2xpto8,Icapica,2,Tue Mar 3 12:50:40 2015 UTC,"It's not an eye-candy, it shows you the exact course of the battle. You don't have to watch them, you can just open a simple battle report that shows you the participating units and their losses, but different tactics with the same armies can have completely different outcomes and the battles can't really be summed up in some sort of a report. Battles here are nowhere as simple as in Civ/ES."
4Xgaming,2xpto8,SeismicRend,1 point,Tue Mar 3 15:12:11 2015 UTC,Yes. They're optional and you can just check the results by often it is good to watch at least part of the fight so you can see what went wrong or what did your opponent do.
4Xgaming,2xpto8,ran88dom99,1 point,Tue Mar 3 15:08:23 2015 UTC,"Completely different.  You determine your initial troop placement and battlefield script for each squad.  When a commander engages in battle, the computer will use your script to quickly play out the battle and determine the result.  Each individual troop is an agent in a table-top miniatures style fight.  You can then review the fight if you'd like to see how it went.  The combat has it's own charm.  Battlefield spells are satisfyingly devastating but also do not distinguish friend from foe.  Part of your military strategy will be having a plan to ensure your troops are sufficiently warded or durable enough to resist them.  Otherwise you'll end up with casualties of your own making.  It's not just limited to spells but nearly every projectile and aoe effect can be a double-edged sword.  Panicked elephants will run from battle, trampling everything in their path."

4Xgaming,2xpto8,stuman89,2,Tue Mar 3 17:12:23 2015 UTC,"Here is the official forum: http://www.desura.com/games/dominions-4-thrones-of-ascensions/forum  There is even a sub forum for nation-specific guides: http://www.desura.com/games/dominions-4-thrones-of-ascensions/forum/board/the-council-of-sages-strategy-guides  You should read the tutorial in the manual first (included in the game directory), to get a general idea of overall game mechanics. Once you have that, pick a nation that seems interesting and either try it yourself, or find a guide to follow.  Personally I find that Man/Ulm is one of the easiest to learn. They've got very traditional units (soldiers + archers + knights) with straightforward magic support classes."
4Xgaming,2xpto8,Terkala,2,Tue Mar 3 19:24:03 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks man. I've been wanting to give it a shot but I remember how difficult dominion 3 was to get into.

4Xgaming,2xo42t,cwilsons,9,Mon Mar 2 14:20:11 2015 UTC,Interesting that 4x players seem to be split on the value of tactical combat.  I'm more of a Total War player and need to have deeper tactical combat with directional modeled damage (Which is why I loved SD1 despite its flaws) and a friend of mine hates TW and tactical combat but likes strategic depth and is a CK2 player.
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Darchseraph,7,Mon Mar 2 15:21:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of mixed - for me the problem is that if the battle isn't going to be challenging, then I don't like playing it, but I feel I have to otherwise the computer will do a worse job.  In the Total War games I now actually skip most of the battles and only deal with the really exciting ones.  Weird, but there we go!"
4Xgaming,2xo42t,vampatori,4,Mon Mar 2 16:38:05 2015 UTC,Yeah the Rome2 Autoresolve was just bad and frustrating. It does get annoying when you have to fight every single battle because somehow when you overpower your opponent 3:1 you still take 40% casualties in the autoresolver when you would take maybe 10% max if you played through.  I liked Space Empires IV method of autoresolving - actually simulate the full tactical combat without rendering anything at high speed. It takes a few more seconds than a math equation but gives you more realistic results.
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Darchseraph,5,Mon Mar 2 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"It would be great if they could do something like Forza's Drivatar.  So the AI would be based on your own battlefield leadership style.  Alas, it doesn't seem like the Total War franchise is up for much in the way of innovation these days.  I feel like we're further back now than we were with Medieval 2, which is nearly 10 years old."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,vampatori,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:54:00 2015 UTC,"IIRC, Total War's auto-resolve was originally intentionally bad because they wanted you to fight the battles, since that's sort of what the franchise is about.  At least that's how it was for the first Shogun, not sure if that's still their design philosophy all these years later."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,klngarthur,2,Mon Mar 2 19:53:09 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that's the rationale they gave to avoid actually working on the autoresolve system for TW.  I mean it makes sense to fight the bigger battle but I find that most of my battles in Rome2 are hunting down stragglers of a defeated army and I have to command each one in person or my troops take 10-15% casualties across the board and have to rest for a turn.
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Darchseraph,1 point,Mon Mar 2 20:05:49 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I find it horribly tedious as well.  After all these years they really should have worked out a system where the auto-resolve can handle the cleanup battles for you, but make it so you're still handicapped if you use it for the big ones.  I don't think I've made it through to the end of a TW game in 10+ years simply because the battles eventually become so boring, despite having several hundred hours across empire/shogun 2/rome 2"
4Xgaming,2xo42t,klngarthur,2,Mon Mar 2 20:16:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah the flaw in many tactical focused 4x games is that as your empire expands, your capacity and tolerance for micromanagement... doesn't.  Distant Worlds handles this quite well with strong automation AI to manage your huge end game empire. I wish more games would adopt that approach."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Darchseraph,3,Mon Mar 2 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"As someone with zero background knowledge about the game, this looks pretty rad. (The soundtrack also reminds me of a cross between Total Annihilation and Hitchhiker's Guide, which isn't a bad thing.)"
4Xgaming,2xo42t,McSqueeb,19,Mon Mar 2 14:47:53 2015 UTC,"Be extremely wary of this developer and pre-purchasing anything from him. He does not have a good reputation on finishing games, and his previous game received poor reviews."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Terkala,9,Mon Mar 2 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"The real problem for me is that he was so obvious about it. ""Hey now that I've gotten these suckers for fall for my first game, I'll go take their money and make my real game!!"""
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Lorini,2,Mon Mar 2 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"In fairness, it's not like he's some major publisher/developer with vast resources to fall back on.  He's just one guy and his only source of income currently is that first game. By his own admission he made major mistakes coding the first game, including his decision to use XNA which is no longer supported by Microsoft.  His options shortly after SD 1 came out were to polish a turd to deliver on everything he promised or to start over and try to deliver on his initial ambitions with a clean slate.   I'd also point out that he is giving a sizable discount (33%) to owners of SD 1, which, at least for me personally, has gone a long way to restoring trust."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,klngarthur,8,Mon Mar 2 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"In fairness, it's not like he's some major publisher/developer with vast resources to fall back on.   This is irrelevant. He sold a product he then refused to support.   His options shortly after SD 1 came out were to polish a turd to deliver on everything he promised or to start over and try to deliver on his initial ambitions with a clean slate.   His choice. Now he can fucking live with it. I am still out a game I paid for and got nothing but insults and banned."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,pocketknifeMT,2,Mon Mar 2 22:19:03 2015 UTC,He should give at least half discount after the statements he's made. Did you see the interview with him on spacesector.com? That's what annoyed me.
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Lorini,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:29:13 2015 UTC,"If he made it 50%, there'd be people here saying it should be 60% or 75%. Personally, I'd have preferred beta access to any discount.  I got 100+ hours out of the first one before release, but it was definitely buggy, especially after he refactored his threading coding, so I stopped playing.  Beta access to previous buyers would have been a nice way to prove that this game was more polished.  A discount is still a nice gesture to try to make amends, though, and $10 off a $30 game is not a trivial amount.  Do you mean this interview? If so, then yes.  It's actually what started to change my mind.  Before that interview I was a pretty vocal critic, there's no way I would have bought a sequel.  While I may not agree with his assessments of certain things, I felt that he was pretty honest there.  As a developer myself, I can sympathize with some of his frustrations and understand the rational behind his decision making."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,klngarthur,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:16:59 2015 UTC,"I understand how he got in that situation. It sucks,  but that's why having your ducks in a row before charging  people money is important.   His mess is entirely his own creation.   When I fuck up with clients,  I don't get to bill for it..."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,pocketknifeMT,7,Wed Mar 4 19:15:28 2015 UTC,"Yep. StarDrive 2 will almost certainly be better than a fixed-up StarDrive would have been.

4Xgaming,2xo42t,Terkala,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:52:41 2015 UTC,"Most people mad about stardrive are mad about things they assumed would happen to the game after they bought early access. I assumed that's what you were referring to, seeing as stardrive 1 was never available for pre ordering, only early access.  Those people don't have to worry because there is no early access for stardrive 2.   Preordering is stupid in general, no more for stardrive 2 than any other game."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,ducksaws,1 point,Fri Mar 27 04:01:09 2015 UTC,"So, you came here to a month old thread to argue semantics about ""pre-order versus early access""? When I never actually made that particular statement? All I said is that the developer has a bad reputation for releasing sub-par products (and his last game was sub par by reviewer standards) and should not be trusted with pre-orders.  That's an impressive level of trolling you've got there. Maybe next time you can call me out on other things I never said!"
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Terkala,0,Fri Mar 27 04:27:40 2015 UTC,"No, I initially thought you meant early access and pointed out the game wasn't for early access.   Then you clarified that you meant pre order.  Then I said basically ""I thought you meant early access, but pre orders are dumb no matter what game it is"". I also pointed out why I thought you were talking about early access in the first place.  I'm not trolling, you just can't read ."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,ducksaws,1 point,Fri Mar 27 04:37:28 2015 UTC,"Be extremely wary of this developer and pre-purchasing anything from him   I said it, directly, in my first statement. I'm not responsible for your inability to read."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Terkala,7,Fri Mar 27 05:22:25 2015 UTC,"Well, Stardrive 1 was an abandoned mess, and the dev told everyone to go fuck themselves.  Now he's back pretending nothing untoward happened because he's got another game to sell.  I suggest looking elsewhere. Star Ruler 2 has the same sort of build your own ship combat, the empire economics is an interesting mechanical take, and is still real time like Stardrive 1.  Plus it's devs don't have a history of fucking people over."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,pocketknifeMT,3,Mon Mar 2 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"While I won't comment on the drama, I will say that Star Ruler 2 is certainly worth a look. The new assymmetrical races have really drawn me in and the rest of the game is extremely solid."

Mr salty here obviously still has his knickers in a twist over the fact that he paid good money for a bad game.  True the developer did get angry at a few idiots hounding him for 'abandoning' StarDrive but I think most people (the developer included) realized it was just a bad game and that not much could be done to rescue it.  So yeah, the dev has released a terrible game in the past, but if you ask me, given what he was trying to do it was doomed to fail from the start.  This looks like he might be making a strong comeback, but I would wait and read the reviews first before buying."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,AdmiralCrackbar,-2,Wed Mar 4 03:29:19 2015 UTC,"A game with a guaranteed memory leak crash and missing features can very easily be labeled an abandoned mess.   Saying ""it's not""  doesn't really change that."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,pocketknifeMT,2,Wed Mar 4 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"Dude, let it go.  Seriously.  It's not the first game to be released with bugs and it won't be the last.  If you don't want to support the developer then don't buy any more of his software.  But this crusade, dude it has to stop, there are honestly more important things in life."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,AdmiralCrackbar,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:40:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it a mess - just not optimal.  It really depends on what you are looking for in a 4X. I have a played a lot of them over the years and while SD1 lacks strategic depth (Distant Worlds has spoiled me with making resources actually matter), the latest version with BlackBox (semi-official patch) is actually very playable.  I enjoyed SD and will probably get SD2 because at the end of it for me - SD has had the best ship design and real time combat implementation (Directional damage, module positioning actually matters, etc.) of any 4x game I've played so far. (Space Empires V would have won if it didn't also have broken or buggy combat implementation features). It's a Distant Worlds lite with polished graphics and a fun game for me to build fleets in and take over planets.  Of course none of this kerfuffel would even be a problem if people remembered the golden rule of PC gaming - No preorders. Buy a game after it comes out and don't expect it to better than it is. You will never be disappointed and waste your money again."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Darchseraph,0,Thu Mar 5 01:47:54 2015 UTC,"There are actually quite few games that are released in a condition I'd consider completely finished. But you can, and should, do some research before buying a game. IMHO it is very stupid to buy a game based on marketing material alone. So If you bought an abandoned mess it is in my opinion kind of your own fault."

4Xgaming,2xo42t,Revoran,3,Mon Mar 2 14:26:05 2015 UTC,I played and enjoyed star drive 1 right up until some of the warp changes. Is there a good place for a comprehensive feature list anywhere?
4Xgaming,2xo42t,cjet79,3,Mon Mar 2 22:07:47 2015 UTC,"This game is a bit like Total War in space.  There's a turn-based strategy/galaxy map where you manage your empire and order fleets around, and the battles are real-time instanced. So there is a loading screen and a separate layer for the battles. It's no longer like SoaSE or SD1 where everything happened in real time on a single map. Although by ""turn-based"" I should clarify that all turns happen simultaneously when you end your turn. So it's not ""I go then you go"" it's more ""I give my orders and then we all go at once"".  That being said, the battles are very similar, with the same directional damage / individual ship module damage, the same physics. Also the ship design system is coming back pretty much intact from the first game, only a tiny bit more streamlined.  Race design system of traits / points to spend is coming back. There are a few more unique traits now but yeah. All original races are coming back, plus one new race: The Chukk (insect pirates).  Added to this game are tons of random events / anomalies to explore and find (around 60 so far with more to come after release).  Research is now closer to Moo2 where you have 6 trees and get to pick one tech at each level in each tree, then the other techs are gone (have to trade or spy to get them).  Diplomacy system got a total overhaul and now you have a tolerance bar which builds up as you make treaties / trade. Once its full you cant do any more treaties until it depletes. It represents how much trust they have for you. Better relations = a higher maximum tolerance with that race.  Spying is back and pretty similar.  There are now heroes (about 15-20) which can be hired and set to manage colonies/fleets/fight in ground combat.  There is also a battle arena mode where you can play and create your own instanced battles, design new ships outside the campaign.  Ground combat is a turn-based tactical small-squad based on a square grid. Units have action points per turn, there is cover effects etc. Think XCOM or advance wars.  There will be no multiplayer on release. He will look at it possibly after release but absolutely no guarantees.  SD1 owners on Steam will receive a 33% discount when buying SD2 on Steam.  Can't think of anything else."

4Xgaming,2xo42t,Revoran,-1,Tue Mar 3 13:54:27 2015 UTC,"There will be no multiplayer on release. He will look at it possibly after release but absolutely no guarantees.   Nothing like abandoning SD1 because it ""won't do multiplayer"" to work on SD2 only to not guarantee it for that either.  Why was SD1 abandoned exactly if multiplayer isn't the concern?"
4Xgaming,2xo42t,pocketknifeMT,3,Mon Mar 2 23:46:43 2015 UTC,"According to the dev, the engine he chose for SD1 was pretty bad and inefficient. Some features were either not possible to implement or would take way too long, and he ""can't spend 6 months putting multiplayer in when my business assessment is that it's going to lose money - I have a wife, a kid and another one on the way, and I quit my job as a lawyer to make games"". According to him, it takes like 20 minutes to add a new ship in Unity whereas it took many hours in Sunburn/XNA. He also said that after 4 years working on the game from concept to execution, he was burned out.  Probably the reason he doesn't want to give guarantees on things like multi is because that's what got him into trouble last time around: promising things and later finding out that he couldn't deliver them."
4Xgaming,2xo42t,Revoran,-1,Tue Mar 3 01:00:57 2015 UTC,"His sob story doesn't change the fact he put out a product he charged money for,  and then immediately abandoned it.  He doesn't get to wash his hands of his decisions."

One of the few things I actually enjoyed with the first game was that the AI would use my ship designs if I played their race at one point in time, and the AI would also join federations against me/with me if it was appropriate.  Those kinds of features are what would sell me on this game, if the AI was a challenge similar to Distant Worlds.  Also, the typical attitude Dipes has towards customers is what turns me away"
4Xgaming,2xo42t,civilward,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:31:44 2015 UTC,"The AI still uses your ship designs, I believe. I'm not the best commentator on AI, but they're not pushovers. The federation mechanic from SD1 isn't in the game, though it may make a return at a later date.  I can't really add too much on the PR side of things. He's acknowledged his mistakes many times publicly, the healthy thing for him to do now is be productive and future oriented.   You get a different perspective on this when you're a mod. I think both sides could have done better. Though I know of a few really vocal critics who, after having one-on-ones with the dev, came away with a much more moderate view.  Everyone's at a 10 on the internet, when we would get more by being at a 2."

At settler difficulty, for example, you can basically just let your advisors pick everything for you and you'll probably win. It's a great way to get into one hell of a game. For me, I spent about 20 hours in Settler mode, getting a feel for the game. Now I'm playing on Diety, so it definitely won't hurt."
4Xgaming,2xoc9h,KaiserTom,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:33:36 2015 UTC,"Those are good games. I think the main issue is the learning curve. Just stick with it, you really need to fully play a few games to really understand the mechanics. MOO2 is really nice because you can just right click on everything if you're confused. it's also relatively short compared to some other 4x games.   I felt fairly similar when I first started playing as well. Especially with the research side of things. Just play on easy settings and have fun. Don't worry about doing things optimally, it's too much of a bother when you should be focusing on understanding the main mechanics."

4Xgaming,2xoc9h,Laladen,1 point,Wed Mar 4 14:05:57 2015 UTC,"I think I get you  There are two ways to play 4x games. The first is simply to have fun. Lower the difficulty and just have fun building  your empire and doing whatever. It's fun in it's own right, I got into 4x doing just that, basically just base building.  The second is to competitively play it while simultaneously having fun. Up the difficulty and try to accomplish  some goal while fighting on even ground or even with an AI advantage. Feel awesome as you dominate them fairly through pure effort and strategy.   This one takes some getting used to, and the easiest way to jump in, at least for me, was to watch let's plays or read AARs or other accounts of how others play the game in question at a higher level, or at least more even level. Learn from their strategy and start modifying it and seeing what works to develop your own. Take radically new approaches from what you are used to. Stop focusing on economy so much and get aggressive, play a game where you do almost nothing but wage war, and vice versa. Play from every angle. One of the best things you can do in a 4X game in my opinion is set absolutely everything on random, as much as possible, and go from there, having the game force you to take a certain path to win, whether it's because of the terrain it generated, the AIs it generated, or the race it gave you. Roleplay your race/empire, don't just play Russia, be Russia. Make wars in the name of your religion, in the name of your people, genocide races, make long term allies not because it is the best choice to win the game, but because he has been your friend for years. Have fun with it while having it be a challenge to do so.  At least, this is what I did, and it has helped a lot to increase the amount of fun."

The game is surprisingly unclear and it's hard to figure out what's best, there is a great lack of information due to no tutorial, and no internet threads, so you kinda gotta figure stuff out on yourself. The research tree is a joke, it's so overly complicated and tedious, but there is a tech tree which makes it more clear.There are a lot of mechanics that you will be scratching your head wondering. It's fun and it's great for a beta, it just needs more content and polish. You will have to experiment a lot and dish out a lot of hours to get a good idea. It has many nice little things like the ideology and the way you get the points through random events and when you settle planets. Starships are pretty cool. It's good, but not great.

4Xgaming,2x8mgc,Texashawk76,9,Thu Feb 26 15:23:26 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone!  New update for Imperia, with some game play changes and several UI updates. The big stuff:   Added empire treasury screen. This will greatly expand in future releases but for now you can see your sector-level profitability. As the game evolves you will have to manage your sectors first as well as your sector governors and this will be the first stage in that reporting. Added trade summary on planet screen. This shows what trades were coming and going, the status of the station, what kind of trades the planet can do, and eventually it will show the corruption (new concept!) and efficiency of the planet’s trade Added planet summary panels on the system screen. These panels show just about everything you would want to know about a planet in easy icon form. Will add tooltips for future versions. Added starbase effective range concept. In previous versions, a level I starbase was just as effective as a level V starbase as far as covering a part of space and supporting stellar missions/Edicts. This didn’t make sense from a gameplay perspective, so changed to be an exponential range increase based on starbase level. The downside to this is that starting in .413, the empire will have to pay 50% maintenance for all starbases. Added kickback information to emperor screen, so you can see how much money is coming in each turn from your less savory sources. Added additional comments/results for the ‘Have Conversation’ action. Now, depending on your charisma, you can learn additional things about the character, and they may even join your alliance if you are persuasive enough! Added charisma as the primary weight mechanism, with modifiers for intelligence, age difference, traits, and loyalty (was not considered before). This should produce more realistic interactions, where people who hate you all of a sudden love you and support you on the basis of one conversation Tweaked balance further now that the sector economy level is starting to be developed Added functionality to Edict creation screen. Now shows real-time what adding ADM to an Edict will do for a system/sector/planet cash flow. Also added ability to use a planet’s materials if they are out of ADM, so a system/sector can now use the remaining materials on the planet before dipping into their reserve. Added the ability for Logistical stations to send goods to their immediate trade hub only. May not send upstream to other planets for emergency supply. Added more Pressure/Persuade effects, should all be done except for personal actions (blue) Changed economic profits. Before, a sector could be losing billions of dollars and it would be subsidized by magic, apparently, since the money was never accounted for. Starting in .412, sectors that are not profitable will subtract from the total tax base of the planet before imperial and sector taxes are considered. This will make it more important to pay attention to ‘black hole sectors’ of your economy. On the plus side, made manufacturing and agriculture more profitable to somewhat compensate.   Coming soon are fleets and more economic and character actions!  NOTE: If you like this game, please help support it by reporting bugs to the forum. There is a lot of divergent gameplay and it is very difficult to reproduce every possible situation. You can help more than you can imagine by simply reporting and posting crash logs to the support forum at www.imperia5x.com. Thanks!  -Steve"

Simply having ""Stars: War"" is asking for a C&D. Adding in the fact that War of Empires and Empire at War are also similar pushes this over the edge.  Copyright aside, they should rename the game Falling Star. Adding "":War of Empires"" actually detracts from the title anyway."

4Xgaming,2x1bgz,LEGO-BUG,5,Tue Feb 24 21:43:06 2015 UTC,"I bought it ""late"" when the game + all DLC was part of a Humble Bundle.  At first I thought it was pretty and maybe a little generic.  But now that I have 80+ hours into it I think it's a good game with some important things to point out:  Good   Achievable victory conditions that will appeal to whatever your play style is.  Conquer the stars or sit back and turtle up in your area.  Expand, exterminate, exploit - they all lead to different victories. Straight forward UI, let's you get the job done. Combat - I know people complain about the 'rock-paper-scissors' of the combat but that's crap for two reasons.  One, it isn't 'rock-paper-scissors' as much as it's 'rock-paper-scissors-baseball bat-golf club-long sword-tennis racket-killer bees-disappearing act.'  What do you get, 12+ different battle plans from the tech tree?  And combat heroes get how many more at maximum level? 5?  You have plenty of options.  Two, no shit, X beats Y, that's how any two mechanics work in any game.  If you show up with a fleet full of torpedoes and my fleet has torpedo defenses out the yin-yang, guess what?  You aren't going to hurt me.  How is that any different if it's real time or turn based?  You can' just run the same ship design for 150 turns, you have to adapt.  And realistically, here's what makes the biggest difference in combat: your targeting protocol, not your battle action.  Sure, your offensive weapon needs to get through their defense but spreading your entire fleet's firepower over all 12 of their ships is going to have a different outcome than if you spread it over their lead ship.   Bad   No set enemy movement or combat phases on the main map.  It's frustrating to get used to but enemy fleets can move and initiate combat at any time.  It's weird that there is a button to force all of your fleet movements but then the enemy can move after that.  You may want to attack a fleet at a specific planet, fine.  But you can attack a planet, wipe everything out, move on to the next one.  Your invasion fleet comes next but an enemy fleet shows up to defend the planet or kill the invasion fleet outright.  I know you have to protect your flank in strategy games but it's extremely frustrating to have everything else in the game, including the combat, be turn based but the positioning is real time especially when you're one human versus any number of computer players. Subtleties of the gameplay are never explained.  How do you refill Troops used in invasions?  If I click on the fleet icon that's surrounding a planet and tell them to attack, what fleet actually attacks?  How many turns will it take for a fleet to reach a planet?  It was trial and error for me but of course the guides are easy to find online.  You just have to figure out what you don't know first.    Other   I didn't figure this out early on but it changed how to even approach this game: use the AI governors.  I don't mean the heroes you recruit, I mean switch to the screen with all the planets listed where it shows their populations, argi-/industrial-/science-/dust-output, working queue and hangar.  Look at the columns all the way to the right.  You can set the entire empire to automatically target a specific output - food, industry, science, dust, etc or a mixed approach for everything.  Those options set the entire system to work towards one goal to the point where it will build specific planetary exploitations to maximize one output then build specific improvements to increase it even more.  Except it will build coordinate and build these much faster than you could ever hope to as a human.  You can even set the entire empire to pursue one goal but one specific system does a different thing.  Seriously, try it out and see how much it frees you up to play the rest of the game."

4Xgaming,2x1bgz,onlycatfud,1 point,Wed Feb 25 06:33:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. Combat and Ship design killed my enjoyment of the game. StarDrive had excellent tactical ship design/combat despite being a shallow strategic game - Distant Worlds has the minimum amount of ship customization I would be willing to accept and mixes it with a really deep game.  I was disappointed that GC3 gave you an excellent ship builder but one that lacks any meaning in actual combat beyond module choice.
4Xgaming,2x1bgz,Darchseraph,9,Mon Mar 2 18:32:03 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised at all the hate in this thread. I loved ES, I put about 200 hours into it, it's not exactly MOO but it's the closest thing I've run into since MOO2. I put it above Sins of a Solar Empire, equal in many ways to Gal Civ. I'd say ES:CIV :: Gal Civ:EU4.  Steam rates it at 87% positive reviews, metacritic 77%."
4Xgaming,2x1bgz,pdxsean,5,Wed Feb 25 03:53:29 2015 UTC,"I had a blast playing it with friends, but like most 4X whatever resources you luck into have a huge impact on how you fair.  Disharmony changed the game radically. I didn't play nearly as much, but it seemed massively for the better. Combat modules rarely upgraded, whereas pre-Disharmony you'd be constantly upgrading your fleet. Instead, you unlocked modules that would have strategic requirements. This means there's way way less pressure to roll up with a cutting edge fleet- it's a game more about numbers, numbers backed by what your empire can afford (has the space, & resources) to float."
4Xgaming,2x1bgz,rektide,3,Tue Feb 24 22:48:36 2015 UTC,Love it
4Xgaming,2x1bgz,sethat,4,Wed Feb 25 03:39:03 2015 UTC,"Wonderful UI.  Nice little game for about 5-15hrs.  No real combat (one step above auto resolve).  Building skating rinks on all your planets gets old fast.  Tech tree webs are the worst; didn't work in CIV:BE, didn't work in ES.  Stacking bonuses more important than anything else.  I suppose the game design was hobbled by the budget.  Not putting in a whole combat system really saves the bucks, but hurts the gameplay."
4Xgaming,2x1bgz,FiveDogNight,2,Wed Feb 25 00:29:19 2015 UTC,"My favorite space 4X game by far. Have to say, I only started loving it after Disharmony hit, initially I didn't like the game at all.

4Xgaming,2x1bgz,TrevorBradley,3,Wed Feb 25 03:28:30 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that it's gorgeous and that other's opinions on combat are overblown.  Unit-unit combat in Civ isn't that tremendous (attack or not attack, both sides take damage), and fleet-fleet combat in ES is more complex (especially after the expansion, which introduced ranged weaponry, fighters, bombers, and made things more interesting.  I know my opinion isn't popular.  I feel like Iceberg flipped too hard in the other direction for Endless Legend - now the combat in EL is overly complex.  If you can pick the game+expansion up for <=$15, it's a blast."
4Xgaming,2x1bgz,TrevorBradley,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"It's no GalCiv, but it's fun, I like the graphics, and the idea of having planets have anomalies and unique features in some is a great idea, I was so excited when I discovered a planet with World Trees, I rushed to colonize it, even if it was in the face of another empire.  Combat sucks big time, as I dont like the card system, in how random it is (And auto resolves seems to not even try to pick any card).  Also, this game suffers from what many 4xs do imo, too much focus on war. GalCiv was fun because you could do things while at peace, build up your worlds, fortify them with starbases, spread your culture to flip planets peacefully...  This one may not be Sword of the Stars level of war focus, but there is little to do in peace here imo, only build improvements and rebuild the fleet.  I would have loved a more mazelike starlane distribution. (I would kill for a normal 4x with the starmap design of AI Wars)"

Disharmony was still super buggy when I played so I did not get to try that; I heard some people loved it and others hated it.  Personally I feel it was completely eclipsed by Endless Legend (which is a different kind of 4x to be fair), proving the developer to be capable of great things.  I'll be throwing in on their next Early Access or Kickstarter."

Sure a huge enemy army is a problem but is it better in a single stack or all over the place? Can't you pit your stack of doom against their stack?  Even if it is an issue it's like restricting infinite city spam by making the world smaller. If you really think it's an issue you should instead increase the cost of sustaining a large army. Make the costs proportional to your population, distance from cities, whatever.   An artificial ""1upt"" is the wrong solution to a non-issue IMO."
4Xgaming,2wx0ji,crasher_pt,3,Tue Feb 24 13:09:35 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, stacks of doom eliminate any tactical positioning of units.  In Civ 5, terrain and chokeholds really matter, because you have to think about unit positioning.  In Civ 4, none of that mattered, because you could fit like 20 units into a chokehold at once, so all that was important was the number and quality of units.  The way I see it, 1UPT just adds another strategic element to the game.  For example, researching artillery is a big deal in civ 5, whereas in civ 4, the equivalent (I forget if there even is one) is just meh, because you can stack them all with your army anyways."
4Xgaming,2wx0ji,General_Josh,3,Tue Feb 24 16:01:43 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, 1UPT just adds another strategic element to the game.    No, it adds a tactical element to the game. An element which IMO has no reason to be there, it's entirely artificial, made moronic AI a bigger problem (it could not handle that aspect for years) and was very superficial. Civ has no business trying to be Total War, why try."
4Xgaming,2wx0ji,crasher_pt,4,Tue Feb 24 17:42:54 2015 UTC,"I literally gave an example of how 1UPT affects strategy in the sentence after the one you quoted.  The fact that artillery is important tactically affects your strategic choice to research it.  Furthermore, when choosing city locations, you actually have to consider the terrain.  In civ 4, researching the next tier up from cannons just adds some extra numbers to it's damage.  If that's not superficial, I don't know what is."
4Xgaming,2wx0ji,General_Josh,0,Tue Feb 24 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"I literally gave an example of how 1UPT affects strategy in the sentence after the one you quoted.   Sorry, my brain probably didn't register because it's so unreal it had problems dealing with it... :)   The fact that artillery is important tactically affects your strategic choice to research it.    Broadly speaking artillery is crap (or if you prefer, sub-optimal) until you can shoot range 3 at the end of the renaissance. ""But that's a strategic decision!"" Sure going to war is a strategic decision and leveraging your tech comes into it but the tactics aspect is so shallow that +1 range or +10 str factors just about the same.    Furthermore, when choosing city locations, you actually have to consider the terrain.   Since warfare is gimped (you're often shooting yourself in the foot), the influence of it in city placement should really be at the bottom, after considering luxuries, coast, rivers, natural wonders, distance from enemy cities, distance from your other cities, visual appeal and plain whim.    In civ 4, researching the next tier up from cannons just adds some extra numbers to it's damage. If that's not superficial, I don't know what is.   ""Extra numbers"" is really downplaying it -- given the rules for unit combat in Civ 4 a small difference in strength gradient deeply affects your strategic decisions. See, since the units stack, artillery really becomes mandatory and devastating when the collateral damage manages to weaken the enemy army. While no shiny new icon appears for you to click on it, the fact that the numbers are different result in a very subtle emerging strategic behavior.  Incidentally this last aspect is what's actually wrong with Civ4 -- given similar stacks, initiative is everything, whoever shoots first with their artillery wins. But this is not the same as saying ""hur dur stacks of doom suck"". The problem wasn't stacks of doom and should not be solved with 1upt."
4Xgaming,2wx0ji,crasher_pt,4,Tue Feb 24 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"the influence of it in city placement should really be at the bottom   That's.... simply not true.  I don't know what difficulty you play on, or if you've ever given multiplayer a shot, but city positioning is way up there at the top of priorities for your capital and border cities.  Warfare in the MP and in the higher difficulties is pretty much guaranteed, and having a strong defensive position very often means the difference between winning and losing.  Look, I get that you don't like 1UPT.  That's fine, and I'm not even necessarily arguing that 1UPT is good, but you really can't make the argument that it doesn't add a strategic element to the game."
4Xgaming,2wx0ji,General_Josh,2,Tue Feb 24 20:14:27 2015 UTC,"Dude... I have no idea what that guy is smoking. I didn't care for 1UPT before, but once I got into it I realized the depth of strategy that was added. It completely made me re-think my tactics.  And it made some aspects like city placement more realistic too. Just like in history, I was choosing places for my city to be safe with maybe one or two sides to attack from if possible.   I don't think crasher is too experienced in 4x games..."

4Xgaming,2wx0ji,CompulsiveMinmaxing,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:46:07 2015 UTC,I can't remember in Civ 4 but in Civ 2 artillery was a huge deal. It meant that you couldn't simply mindlessly stack them or else you would get shred by the aoe.  Also Civ 5 ai is really terrible. It takes any fun from that game from me. The only way for the Ai to compete is by giving them an enormous amount of resources hoping that with enough units they will simply bruteforce their way into their cities.  Tactical combat was a huge handicap for the AI. If you could get them to a chokepoint like a city they would simply bang their head against a wall pointlessly throwing their units away.

4Xgaming,2wwfxy,Xerobull,26,Mon Feb 23 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"As someone who has played all of them, I will give a rough outline of where each shines and fails and give my ultimate recommendation:  For the first, Dominions 4 has a very high learning curve and complexity. However, if you're really big into mythology and religious mythology, the references in the game are all outstanding. However, while the game is very deep, it suffers a bit in terms of balance. The AI is very stupid and you can exploit some ridiculous combinations. However, if you're looking to play against other people, it has a healthy community of players for multiplayer and it's a very good game for that.  Crusader Kings 2 is more grand strategy than anything else, but it combines grand strategy with some RPG aspects and is arguably the easiest of Paradox's games get into. You can start as a fledgling count and work your way up to founding the Kingdom of Ireland and then onwards to Emperor of Britannia if that floats your boat. However, there are a lot of expansions and some add more content than others. However, you'll eventually get to a point where you're looking at the same text menus and breezing through the game and just outright blobbing. It gets stale after awhile. If you're into Game of Thrones, the Song of Ice and Fire mod is really, really well done and fits CK2 perfectly.  Distant Worlds: Universe is single-player only but it's really in-depth and I'd say the learning curve is high, but nowhere near Dominions but definitely higher than CK2. The level of detail makes you really feel like you're managing a space empire as the state. The private economy is AI controlled. You can influence the economy, but you don't take control of it. You handle diplomacy, war, and other matters of state. You influence the economy by building mines, etc. You can create your own ships, colonize planets, etc. There are also some really good mods for DW like the Extended mod which adds some balanced races and it's universally regarded as the best mod for the series (even the devs use it apparently). It's also the game I go back to with extreme regularity as each game is different because of the random galaxy generator.  In order if you want re-playability: DW > Dominions >= Ck2 In order if you single player: DW > CK2 > Dominions In order for multiplayer: Dominions > CK2 > DW For RPG Elements: CK2 > Dominions > DW"
4Xgaming,2wwfxy,paradoxpancake,2,Mon Feb 23 19:42:46 2015 UTC,"Outstanding write up, what I was looking for and kind of what I've pieced together from reviews. Sadly, i doubt I can play Dominions multiplayer very often as my life doesn't allow for extended sessions of gaming too much."
4Xgaming,2wwfxy,Infamously_Unknown,2,Mon Feb 23 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"Sadly, i doubt I can play Dominions multiplayer very often as my life doesn't allow for extended sessions of gaming too much.    Note that if you don't have time for long sessions, it's not the only way to play the game.  Larger maps with a lot of players actually take a lot of time and the turns are simultaneous (actions of players don't happen during their turns but all at once at the end) so it can (and is) played in multi-week campaigns. Each player can join anytime during the day and do their turn. The round concludes when they're all done and the next one starts.  It would usually still require from you to have at least some time for the game on a regular basis once you join one though (depends who you play with and what's the agreement, but think like a turn/day or at least excuse yourself if you need an extension. It can vary though.)."

Are there any plans to introduce actions that are not inherently good or evil? I absolutely love the amount of stuff Triumph is cramming into this expansion. I really liked Golden Realms, but it feels like a tiny patch compared to what's coming in this one. Is this a hail mary? Do they intend to stop making more content for AoW3 after this is completed?

In EU4 you are always in charge of a nation and you can be anything from a major power shooting for world domination or a minor nation trying to scrape together enough resources and troops to survive. In CK2 you play as a character and when your character dies you continue as their heir. Unless you start as or become an independent ruler, you will have a liege and depending on their laws you might not even be able to wage war on your own. CK2 is about scheming and acquiring enough titles, money and troops to climb the ladder from count to duke, king and emperor. I think CK2 is more fun but EU4 is a more well designed game."
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,Smurph269,2,Fri Feb 20 15:09:50 2015 UTC,Sold. I think I'll try CK2-- though it'll probably take me a while to learn. Thanks for breaking down the difference for me.
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,ToLongDR,3,Sat Feb 21 14:13:57 2015 UTC,Starting in Ireland is a great way to learn the game. Long term goal of creating the empire of Britannia.
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,Ulfsark,2,Sat Feb 21 19:42:40 2015 UTC,Noted. Thank you!!
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,FargoFinch,2,Sat Feb 21 20:58:27 2015 UTC,"One thing that is very different about CK and EU from other strategy games is that you need a casus belli, or, reason for war to declare war. In EU you can declare war without one but take a public order hit which is pretty significant. In CK you cannot declare war without one, but one of your council can be sent on a mission to fabricate claims which once successful, you can pay a little bit of money to gain a right to the land and a reason for war."
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,arquebus_x,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:33:57 2015 UTC,"CK2's difficulty curve is easier to overcome if you understand it as a dynasty spreadsheet game, and not as a strategy game. Unless you're playing as vikings/horde CK isn't even a wargame.   For example, most of my land during my Hungary game was acquired by arranged marriage and assassination, not conquest. Hell I even ended up with England under the crown because of inheritance through the obscure family ties of my mother's bloodline. The rest of the game was spent trying to hold my empire together through appeasement and brutal oppression of troublesome vassals."
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,stoobah,1 point,Mon Feb 23 09:37:05 2015 UTC,CK2 sounds pretty cool from what I'm reading here. I tried it very very briefly this weekend and some of it was difficult to understand-- hopefully I'll figure it out with more playtime though.
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,Sikran,4,Mon Feb 23 14:13:17 2015 UTC,I have 500 hours into CK2. Best game ever. It was made specifically for me.

4Xgaming,2wjpzw,themikesem,1 point,Fri Feb 20 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"1600 hours here. The way of life dlc adds a lot of flavour and options for things to do while not waging war, from intrigue to seduction to hunting. I'd recommend it, especially on sale."
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,Icapica,4,Wed Feb 25 20:55:36 2015 UTC,"EU4 is more similar to what you've played before, and will be slightly easier. Both are still very hard to learn on your own though.  I found CK2 to be more fun, but EU4 is becoming better and better."
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,Samwell_,2,Fri Feb 20 14:46:55 2015 UTC,"eu4 is like civ but  mid game while ck2 is completly diffrent.CK2 is based on medieval era politics(marriage,assassinations and stuff).And eu 4 is based on expansion,diplomacy ,exploration and managing your country.eu4 has a lot of hidden depth in battles etc while ck2 is only about stats.Both games are pretty easy once you pass the learning curve(CK2 is easier)"
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,ran88dom99,7,Fri Feb 20 15:50:20 2015 UTC,Neither are really 4X games but I thought EU4 was a bit easier to learn personally. I don't have much time in CK2 though so take that with a grain of salt.   I think it's worth mentioning that these games make Civ 5 feel like candy land. Probably looking at a minimum 50 hour learning curve for either.
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,yummyyummypowwidge,6,Fri Feb 20 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"Probably looking at a minimum 50 hour learning curve for either.   I somewhat disagree. To play them well enough to have fun and kinda know something of what's going on it takes a few hours in EU4 and maybe five or six hours in CK2. You won't know everything that fast but you'll learn as you go. EU4 is a bit easier to get into without any help while you might need some help from Youtube for CK2.  Sure it'll take at least 50 hours to get good in the games (probably much more than that), but one evening is enough to start enjoying."
4Xgaming,2wjpzw,arquebus_x,2,Fri Feb 20 17:10:11 2015 UTC,"True, 50 hours is wildly overestimated. I showed how to play paradox games to a lot of people and after 3-4 hours of learning they can fluidly play these games."

But I found them both to be exceedingly fun, in different ways. If you like building dynasties and dealing with characters and personalities, go with CK2. If you like a much more macroscopic view of the world where you're moving resources rather than people around, go with EU4.  CK2 tends to be a bit more opaque in terms of how the game responds to what you do, and how you should respond to what the game does. But that's intentional, since CK2 models humans rather than resources, and humans are less predictable."

Whereas CK2 you play as your dynasty, so you could lose half of your country because of some obscure medieval succession law.  CK2 is always considered the true Game of Thrones videogame, as you can plot to kill other rulers and get your heirs to inherit the other country and do all sort of intrigue like stuff.  IN EU4 you just attack people, but there's some restrictions compared to Civ."
4Xgaming,2wi7as,cwilsons,6,Fri Feb 20 02:42:44 2015 UTC,"Nice article.  I think the point about unbalanced games having more flavor to them is a good one to make.  Consider two games made by the same dev team. Albeit these aren't 4x games, Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihilation could be considered sequels to each other.  Supreme Commander had wildly unbalanced factions. Each faction had different units which were completely superior to the other faction's units in some way. But the key is that each faction was unbalanced in different ways. UEF was the master of ultra long range artillery. It even had kill-sats that could strike anywhere on the map. Cybrans specialized in shorter range but massive rate of fire artillery as well as being able to walk its ships onto land. Navy can't reach your island base? No problem! So long as you're a Cybran. Aeon didn't even need a navy. They had hover tanks. A swarm of tanks could go out onto the ocean, sink a fleet, and then hover right onto land again to wipe out a base. This was an outstanding game.  The successful, Planetary Annihilation, is in my opinion one of those utterly soulless games. This game has no flavor. There's nothing wrong with this game. But there's nothing great about this game either. There's nothing to set it apart. Its a technically fine, by-the-numbers game where identical armies fight using identical units, differentiated only by paint scheme. If one unit better than the other? Not really. Just spam them. And the units don't matter anyways. The end game is always smashing a moon into something.  What changed?  SupCom was very much unbalanced. Every structure and every building was different. Nothing was shared. This allowed for very different gameplay tactics between games, and because every faction was wildly overpowered in different ways, each faction had multiple perfectly viable ways to play, all of them entertaining.  PA is so streamlined that the course of the game is known from the start. Build extractors, build an army, then tech up to play cosmic billiards.  One game has many conflicting variables in play. Each variable can throw the game to a wildly different course. The other game has identical units fighting identical enemies with identical formations and identical tactics. Its simply put, bland.  Even the little details count for a lot. UEF structures and units told a story. Zoom in and look at one of them closely. UEF was very different from Cybran and still different from Aeon. Each structure or unit told a story. A design. Why was it designed and built this way? Sins of a Solar Empire does this exceptionally well. Every faction passively tells its own story through the little details.  When everything is the same, differentiated only by paint, you're no longer able to construct a narrative. Its just a synthetic, artificial wargame. Its red vs blue. Quite literally, because that is the only way you can tell one unit from the other. There's no overarching story. Its just an exercise in strategy and nothing more."
4Xgaming,2wi7as,Hyndis,2,Fri Feb 20 05:55:21 2015 UTC,"I think ""unbalanced"" is not the best term here, more like ""specialization"" or ""unique strengths & weaknesses"".   Unbalanced implies that one subset of choices is always superior to the other (like one race being always stronger) and is a no brainer choice therefore reducing the number of available (reasonable) choices to just one (so no choice).  Like StarCraft 1 races, these were very different yet almost perfectly balanced."
4Xgaming,2wi7as,LordArchibald,3,Sat Feb 21 20:18:25 2015 UTC,"I think there is a general poor understanding of what made MoM and MoO2 good. I don't think this article gets there but I like that you're trying to talk about it.  That guy everyone hates who is making stardrive 2 has a good read on what made MoO2 good imo. Granular game concepts, very game-y, not trying to do a simulation and honest about it. Also, cohesive and great art direction.  The guys making WoM are, serendipitously a great example trying to recreate something while labouring under a poor understanding of what made the original good. For example, MoM is old as balls but has a very idiosyncratic pixely art style that is bland enough to let you fill in the blanks but retains enough character to convey identity. It still works because it was not made (by design or by hardware limitation) to convey detailed character. Meanwhile WoM has way too much detail. They are joyful amateurs and that's great and I love it. It also really shows in the art direction and that is not great. This is not unique though. The stardock fantasy games have the same problem. Idk what it is, being too ambitious maybe?"
4Xgaming,2wi7as,stilig,2,Sun Feb 22 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"This article could really benefit from an equivocation purge. I suspect that you wanted to give voice to many of the opinions and theories given forth over the years - but those of us that have played MoM and MoO2 to death have already heard them all. So I'm not interested in a collation of those ideas. Remove all the term-quotations, vague attributions (e.g. popular theory, many believe, etc...) and qualifiers. Then list all of those previously-hedged statements by importance and delete all but the top five from the article. Now research and argue a position on those five points.  TL;DR - some of us like our opinion pieces just like we like our 4X games."

MoM has more spells, effects, and troop types than any other 4x since or before. That is why its the bestest. While Moo2 is the most reactive and tightly designed.

4Xgaming,2wd38u,FargoFinch,2,Thu Feb 19 12:50:59 2015 UTC,"I think Spore's scope was significantly greater than the scope of The Universim, it was so many different games in one, all built on top of a procedural content editor.  Very clever technology, but ultimately a shit game.  Somewhere along the line they forgot that it was supposed to be a fun game, not a tech demo.  It remains to be seen if The Universim will loose sight of their true goal or not, and there is very little indication either way at present.  It's the first small risky project I've invested in, and I did so mainly because their entry requirements were so low, and their trailer and game concept are awesome.  Fingers crossed!"
4Xgaming,2wd38u,runetrantor,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought Spore was great.  Could it have been ten times better?

4Xgaming,2wd38u,FargoFinch,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:28:53 2015 UTC,"The major problem with Spore is that because it covers such a long timeperiod, it is infact several minigames in one package. The role of the player changes, from controlling one animal to a civilization's overmind, and then back to controlling a single spaceship. These individual parts doesn't add up, and the parts themselves are mediocre. The game ends up feelig like a parade of lackluster gamemodes, and falls short of what it promised to deliver.  I did have a lot of fun with it, but I think its scope was too great and ambitious for the devs. I hope the devs of Universim isn't doing the same mistakes."
4Xgaming,2wd38u,Diablosword,1 point,Sun Feb 22 08:06:57 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised that they're going into such detail with workers and presumably other units.

It's also interesting to see that there's a perception stat, unless it's just view distance - it would be cool if there was a stealth / disguise element that could 'beat' unit perception (i.e. aliens investigating a planet before deciding what to do)."

Because you never disclosed your relationship to this subreddit, I thought it would be a good idea to do it for you. Daniel doesn't deserve any slack since he decided to throw a hissy fit on SomethingAwful and Reddit when people called him out on his shit.  The best value I got out of StarDrive was seeing Daniel (who had the username of Dipes) have a meltdown in his own Games thread when the goons called him out on his crappy game. If anything, it made me feel better knowing Daniel had his malicious mistakes thrown right in his face instead of being blocked from paying customers by people like you.  Daniel also hasn't learned his lesson. He's going to do the same exact thing, and the only ""apology"" he has released has been backhanded and forced because of business reasons.

Especially as it ties to ""ethics"" in ""game journalism"" - whatever those two things actually mean.  While I agree I felt that eXplorminate was blog-spamming at first, I legitimately want you to be successful, and want 4X gaming to increase in size and popularity.  If it does, that means we all get better-made, sufficiently-funded 4X projects.  90% of them will stink, but the 10% that make it will be worth it.  Don't let people's negativity take you down.  Just be transparent about what you do, and don't worry about people's opinions.  Sit inside any gaming subreddit for a week - people's opinions stink, and gamer entitlement is at an all-time high.

4Xgaming,2wb6va,Switche,4,Wed Feb 18 22:31:36 2015 UTC,"I don't really have an opinion here, this is just an analysis. I assume that's fair since this is an open letter.  Having beta access is not a particularly damning problem, especially when considering how many closed betas invite press under ethically gray NDAs these days, but it's up to you if that's something your company does, and how.  That said, it certainly rides the ethical line for anyone with a stake in a gaming news media organization to have close ties with a gaming company, or a game, that their organization covers.  Whether or not you're the one reviewing these games in question, doubt is inevitably going to cloud the credibility of the review a little wherever a relationship like this is known to exist. That's unfortunately just a fact of the matter; partiality will be a looming question in a reader's mind.  I can appreciate that you want to give your opinion on the StarDrive 1 issue, but that should be a private opinion held as a fan. If you're addressing us here as eXplorminate, only the relationship and the separation between you and the reviews should be covered. Your opinion on the StarDrive 1 upset is probably going to further tip things against you as it further ties you and eXplorminate to a polarized issue rather than distancing all three.  If I can be real and still be respectful, fans an onlookers aren't going to feel obligated to reconcile this doubt if they have it, even armed with the explanation you gave. As I see it, you have to either accept that your credibility will is harmed for this review and possibly others, or you have to publicly sever ties the same way you've explained them.  It's shitty, because you're entitled to a private life as a gamer, but this is a normal part of being impartial and working in media, and PR matters. I don't envy your position in this. I think you've done well in learning lessons publicly in how to improve and grow, and I say all this because I'm confident you want to help the situation more than fight it."
4Xgaming,2wb6va,FiveDogNight,2,Wed Feb 18 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"I think its okay to also enjoy playing the same game you're reviewing so long as you make the distinction between gameplay as a non-reviewer and gameplay as a reviewer. That distinction must be crystal-clear. It must be stated up front what connection you may have with the thing you are reviewing as a disclaimer. The reader than then decide if they trust the reviewer enough to continue reading.  Also make absolutely sure to backup any conclusions with plenty of evidence. I think TotalBiscuit does this well. He may personally like or dislike games he is reviewing. He'll state this up front what personal relevance he has, but then he'll go on to conduct a review. His review provides ample evidence so that the viewer can draw their own conclusion, and any statements he makes are backed up by plenty of fact. If he makes a mistake he'll own up to it. These things give him a lot of credibility despite sometimes having a personal connection to something he is reviewing.  Reviewers do not live in bubbles. They're ordinary people who have friends, social contacts, and they play games. They're not robots. They're people. No reviewer can be absolutely, totally neutral on any topic. Its just not happening.  Owning up to any potential biases and clearly stating them from the very start in addition to backing up arguments with evidence is a great way to overcome any bias, real or perceived."
4Xgaming,2wb6va,irrelevant_query,3,Wed Feb 18 16:50:47 2015 UTC,"Some good words on this. I just want to reiterate what OP said about the reviewer not sharing this connection.   From their perspective, it's understandably odd to preface a review by disclosing conflicts of interest and personal opinions that aren't the reviewer's, but the founder's. Identifying that ethical gray area to begin with is not an obvious choice.  The problem is, these are considerations you have to have in forming these connections to begin with, and have to be very careful in separating and clarifying all possible biases, because impartiality is the keystone of any review organization.  It's not a clean thing to do when you're part of an organization, rather than just one person. I think we can be understanding about that while also asking for more."

4Xgaming,2wb6va,ethidium-bromide,-8,Fri Feb 20 20:34:34 2015 UTC,SD2 is a scam just like SD1.  You constantly reposting your site/blogspam is nothing this subreddit needs. It worked well before you made your site. If you have decent content people will share it.  And thats all that is.
4Xgaming,2wb6va,Benthetraveler,11,Sat Feb 21 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"Look at this sub.

Not sure what you have against this guy for trying to do a service to the community.  I wouldn't have heard of some games without explorminate.  Maybe you have the time to follow every game, drama, and gaming news or whatever, but I and many others enjoy 4x and don't have that luxury.  What he does is a service to those in my shoes."

I get that the dude wants ad revenue but posting blogspam or bad articles isn't content. Which doesn't mean it should be banned. Just don't self-promote or shill and it's all good.

4Xgaming,2wb6va,Benthetraveler,3,Wed Feb 18 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"Sigh. Looking at your post history, a lot of your comments are in the negative going way back. I think that's more to do with your writing tone than it is to do with me.  As far as your links go, the first two are from before I was a moderator (like I told you last time you posted them). The last one has the OP apologizing for saying that a post was deleted, because it just happens that he'd lost where it was.  I'm very open about my moderation on the board, but I can't really use the material you've posted for self-reflection because it's about events that happened before I was a mod, or (in the 3rd example) events that turned out not to have happened after all.  Edit: Actually, I looked closer at your second link, and that one is from when I was a moderator. A user was asked to edit out an incitement to petition on the forum from their broader opinion piece. I'd felt at the time that a) prolific petitioning on the forum was creating a spam problem, pushing most other threads from the front page, and b) I had a more libertarian view about whether boycotts, petitions and class action lawsuits should actually be organised within a forum that's essentially handed over to a developed by a distributor. I had no problem with the opinion the guy wanted to express, just the part about encouraging petition posting.   The community had a dialogue on this subject in the thread reserved for moderation discussion: https://steamcommunity.com/app/220660/discussions/0/37470848537819715/ and as a response to feedback I changed the associated forum rules."
4Xgaming,2wb6va,Eviljim,2,Wed Feb 18 17:35:27 2015 UTC,I think you may be a little paranoid.  And by 'a little' I mean 'a lot'.  It's right about noon on a Wednesday and lots of us 'old timers' have 9-5 jobs which we get a lunch break for.  Grouchy workpeople + hostile commentary + unyielding paranoia/'this community is rigged' = downvotes.

Mr. thetraveler up there appears to lack the ability to incorporate new information into his beliefs.

4Xgaming,2w3x8f,dukeofgonzo,5,Mon Feb 16 20:24:58 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for letting me know.
4Xgaming,2w3x8f,Sometimes_Lies,14,Mon Feb 16 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"Specifically, I'd recommend Civilization V Complete.  V is the most recent installment, but a good number of people still play IV - over 10 years old at this point. But, V is a lot more streamlined, so it is easier to understand and more intuitive.  Get Complete because the DLC/expansions improve things massively and it's way, way cheaper to buy it all at once. Like, the base game + 1 expansion costs more than Complete, which comes with everything (base game+both expansions+the dozens of standalone DLC items).  Also, if you're worried about the expansions/DLC over complicating things right from the start, they can individually be disabled quite easily.  Also, it's on sale now for $12.49. That link is cross platform. It goes on sale regularly, but that site in particular seems to have it on sale very often."
4Xgaming,2w3x8f,theforemostjack,2,Mon Feb 16 21:41:39 2015 UTC,Some of us still play III as well!
4Xgaming,2w3x8f,vanillacustard,3,Thu Mar 12 05:53:16 2015 UTC,It's odd you say Civ V is more streamlined. I've always found it more cumbersome and the whole not stacking thing makes the game needlessly complicated
4Xgaming,2w3x8f,Sometimes_Lies,7,Mon Feb 16 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, IV is a great game, but I feel like it's very fiddly. It has a lot more moving parts, and while it doesn't seem difficult to decide the right thing to do at the right time, it always felt like a big list of things you needed to continually check and re-check.  V is definitely more complex (and also, sadly, much easier) for combat. I like the tactical elements it added, quite a bit. It makes wars more interesting and more thoughtful, rather than just a competition between whoever has the biggest army. It's a shame that the AI is so easy to outsmart though, which hurts the experience a lot.  Still, I don't think it's that complicated. You don't need that large of an army to win even a domination victory, so it being cumbersome to move a ton of units around isn't a big deal to me.  BNW's tourism mechanic is also fiddly as hell, which is by far my biggest complaint about that expansion."
4Xgaming,2w3x8f,KuntaStillSingle,7,Mon Feb 16 22:25:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah they made the wars tactical scale on a strategic map. I think it'd have been neater if they did it like RTW, where you move your deathstack around but when you hit a unit you enter a tactical combat, but that'd also take forever, and Civ games already go on a while."

4Xgaming,2w3x8f,Twisted_Paradigm,3,Sun Feb 22 13:34:19 2015 UTC,"Age of Wonders 3, if you like a High Fantasy setting.  Civilization is the first and arguably the best, but I'd consider Civ maybe the LEAST beginner 4x; it's got so many units, buildings, and mechanics.  AoW is simpler than Civ, stays focused on expanding and fighting, and is just more fun for me.  I'm always espousing the virtues of AoW, so I'm starting to get my patter down.  The world is beautiful (jungles and deserts and snowcapped mountains), the critters are many and often cute (Dragons and Ogres and Dwarvish Steam Tanks).    You play a Wizard King, telling your cities whether to produce Elvish Longbowmen (for troops now) or a Rider's Hall (to build better troops later); learning and casting spells (Fireball to blast stuff, or Arctic Empire to slowly cover the world in Snow); and moving your armies around to watch your borders, conquer a new city, or sack a Mana Node to get more Magic.  As with any 4x, you start with a small town and a few troops and expand from there. You've got a few types of resources (Research, Mana, Gold, and Happiness) and various ways to convert one into another. Lots of gold but no mana?  Spend that money building mana-generating Temples.  Lots of mana but you need troops?  Learn a Summon Elemental spell.  The heroes are really fun, with an array of powers to use in combat (Martial Arts) and out (Natural Healer).  They go up levels, and can use magic items you find in Dungeons (or enemy heroes' corpses).  When you attack a space or an army, you play out a turn-based move-and-attack game (kinda like XCOM, if you've played that.  Of course the biggest, toughest army tends to win, but I prefer the tactical game to Civ's ""look at both armies and tell you who won"" system.  And the random map maker is the coolest thing about the whole thing.  Always pretty and fantasy-ish, and insanely customizeable.  Want lots of Bandit Camps and no Cities?  Lots of water and mountains to make navigation difficult?  I just put all the settings to random, so it takes me a few turns to realize ""Oh, this map has no Mana Nodes, so I'd better build lots of Temples if I want to use magic.""  Civilization (and any other 4X) has all these features too.  What I think makes AoW a great 4x, especially for beginners, is that:   there are relatively few (but well-balanced) different units, terrains, buildings, etc. I'd rather feel like I'm in Lord of the Rings, than in a WWII documentary. The map is so pretty."
4Xgaming,2w3x8f,megazver,2,Fri Feb 20 19:41:06 2015 UTC,Wow awesome thanks for the comment. I actually got online and started looking into this game when I sat down tonight and now I come across your comment. Haha maybe the universe is trying to tell me something. I believe I will indeed be puurchasing this within the next month or so as it sounds like its right up my ally. Only reason I can't pull the trigger on it now is because I have only 30gbs of internet a month and the reccomended system requirements say it requires 10 gbs. Thats a large hit on my data unortunatly
4Xgaming,2w3x8f,FalseTautology,6,Sat Feb 21 01:41:57 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Masters of Orion II. My personal all time favorite 4X game. It offers preset or customizable races, tactical or auto combat, customizable ships to make your ideal fleet and an extensive tech tree.   Other than MOO 2, I would recommend Civ 4.

4Xgaming,2w3x8f,Ilitarist,4,Tue Feb 17 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"Seconding the MoO2 nomination. It's the game that got me into 4X. It has depth, but it doesn't force too much complexity; ship design is probably the most involved bit, and you can disable tactical combat until you're ready to deal with that (with tac combat off, ships are auto-designed)"
4Xgaming,2w3x8f,midnight_toker22,3,Wed Feb 18 09:40:01 2015 UTC,Almost forgot one of the best aspects of the game. You can right click anything to find out what it does. Really makes the game easy to pick up.

The Rebellion expansion is a stand-alone I believe so that's what I'd recommend. It's got a quick learning curve but can still be really challenging. And it's a space / sci-fi game (to go along with the fantasy and history genre recommendations)."

There is very little new actually being done in 4X at the moment.  The indie games that have come out of the crowd funding boom of late have injected more 4X games into the market which is great, and there are of course more to come from that, but so far there's nothing ground-breaking, it's all refinement of the genre.  We're yet to see:   innovative and captivating ways to play multi-player. a sense of progression or 'meaning' rather than stand-alone independent games. a decent economic model. a decent political model. a decent espionage model. innovative use of procedural content generation techniques to increase re-playability. something that breaks the mould and comes at the genre from a different angle.   A golden age is when there is a burst of creativity and innovation, and I don't believe we're seeing that.  I really, really hope we do soon though, but I think for the foreseeable future VR is going to dominate revenue streams as it enters a golden age."
4Xgaming,2w13wk,vampatori,2,Mon Feb 16 19:06:56 2015 UTC,Yeah honestly I think we are far from a 4x golden age.  IMO there haven't really been any solid titles in ages.

4Xgaming,2vym15,Silent-Viper,1 point,Mon Feb 16 01:51:01 2015 UTC,I think AoW3 suffers from late-game boredom more than most other 4x out there. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it for a while (almost 40h according to Steam) but it got repetetive really fast. It also didn't help that in multiplayer you have to watch every single battle that occures in the game with a player involved. Long-term motivation was pretty much zero for me.

Never played the first Star Ruler, and really liking this game.    I like how the planets are simplified over other games, each planet produces a single resource that you can export to other planets, which can allow you to upgrade those planets and unlock higher level resources.  And all the different resource types interact with each other in different ways.  You end up conquering 10-20 star systems, each with 3-4 planets, and there is a cool flowchart interface where you can swap around what planet is exporting to what planet so synergize the various bonuses.    I also really like how the ships are done, you have flag ships and support ships.  Your planet/shipyard produces flag ships and you assign support groups to them, say a group of 50 fighters.  All you have to micromanage is the flag ship, and if the support ship takes losses, just park your flag ship near a system with production and the support group will reinforce back to the number you gave it.    I also like the ship building, complete control and it even simulates directional damage.  I love the diplomacy interface, something like a board game, nothing like any other video game I have played.  The budget system is really neat, never seen one setup like that in a game before.    Truly, the only think I don't like is the research tree.  Its confusing, has a weird layout, doesn't give enough information.  Its functional, but really needs to redone from scratch."

That was the thing about the game that really caught my eye from what little I saw of it, it looks like you can ruin your competition.  You could always do that to an extent in some games like Railroad Tycoon, by out-servicing a city, but it would be a major pain to make a route unprofitable for a competitor.  It looks like in Offworld Trading Company you can actually sabotage other businesses in a variety of ways.  Really interesting element to the game, and in my opinion qualifies it for the 4th X.

Ignoring the interaction between playtime and a game being unfinished (which personally, I think makes me more likely to not want to play a game again) and even if a game is fun during early access, I should wait.  And if I miss out on a few games because coming out of early access isn't really announced that much anymore because they've been available, so I don't really hear about that happening, well fuck them.

Very difficult to get used to but nothing feels as good as buying someones stock after you made a ton of money off power. Using your resources to win makes you feel like you're some strategic genius.  Unfortunately, it can work the other way around and the AI tends to buy you out extremely fast once they start grabbing stock.

This is probably a legit strategy but it is obnoxious when it happens so fast I don't have time to sell stuff and then buy up my own stock.   Game is great either way. I'm having loads of fun.

But just because you have your panties in a bunch because you bought into some space based minecraft clone promising the moon and more and you didn't get it at the $20 pricepoint I don't know what to tell you. Sometimes experimental titles fail, for complicated reasons, and thats the risk you take when participating in this model. The game never would have existed at all anyway based on the old publisher model.   But kerbal space program, don't starve, project zomboid, prison architect, and a number of other niche titles haven't been able to obtain publisher financing for the entire 21st century until the last couple years through crowdsourcing.

The big issue and reason for a lot of people's rage, I think, is that Steam doesn't let people choose to not see EA games, which I would find pretty annoying if that were me.  But yeah, I got about 2 dozen other things on EA, here's some of the ones I'm optimistic on:  Starbound  Albedo  NeoScavenger (this might be out actually)  Arcane Worlds  Delver  Underrail  Paper Sorcerer  Interstellar Marines  Damn, I'm not home so I can't check my library, I know there's way more I'm forgetting.

I find each individual game to be frantic, and if not for the campaign mode would have lost interest within 2-3 hours. Even then, the campaign itself is quite short.  I just wish there was some staying power to the game. It's not going to be one of those 50+ hour games.  Oh, and the computer has a distinct advantage in non-monopoly markets as it can do marginal trading, etc automatically.  So if the price of water is 3/unit the computer can sell just enough water to maintain that price and make that 3/unit profit in real time, while a human being gets to fumble with the mouse and click around and crash the price down to 1/unit within a click or two....all while missing the opportunity for profit on two other resources.  If everything is commodity priced (ie a well functioning market) human players are fucked.  hydraulic despotism (I actually managed this literally on one map) is one of the only viable strategies...the other is to launch the cargo into orbit and ignore the market prices entirely, and that is so powerful the first player to build a launch facility wins, full stop.  I am happy the game was made, as I think more economic games are a good thing...however I just don't see this one having much staying power either in single player or multiplayer. Single player is too simple and has almost no game to game persistence to keep people interested, and multiplayer will quickly devolve into a zerg rush-esque building frenzy every time..."

In 4X games, ""politics"" are generally limited to the tools given to players (and/or non-players) to further their goals. The choice of which tools to use and when is driven by your preferred victory condition, not political aspirations.  For example, trading with another player might seem like a mix of politics and economics, but it boils down to eXploitation because there is no hidden depth in your decision. You are trying to win a game. In my opinion, there needs to be some asymmetry in the initial setup (beyond difficulty adjustments) and extremely deep gameplay for anything approaching politics to exist. And at that point, you've crossed the barrier from 4X to grand strategy.  That being said, I stumbled across Imperia a couple weeks ago, and it seems like it might fit the bill. Having no experience with it beyond half-assedly watching a LP video uploaded by the creator on my second monitor while browsing reddit, I can't make any recommendations for or against it, but the description and what I remember of the video makes me think it might be something you could be interested in.

Politics are one of the most fun things in games in my opinion.  Players argue, manipulate, and most times make huge mistakes, which is awesome well.  In Falling Stars: War of Empires, players vote on a multitude of political agendas throughout a game, and many of these laws passed alter the rule of the entire rest of the game.    Players get votes in the council based on the political influence of the planets in their empire. So it pays to have a set of strong influential planets.  These planets can also be bartered with, so let's say you land on the strange jungle planet of Zorn and they tell you that if you let them keep their freedom you will receive 3 frigates every turn, or 2 extra influence, or a one time lump sum of cash.  So you can enter into diplomacy with them for mutual gain.  BUT!! If you do so, you also must uphold good relations with them by not trading with their enemies or attacking their allies or you could suffer sanctions.  Conversely, destroying their mortal enemies can sometimes grant enhanced barters.  Last, there is of course trade that is performed between plates, where you can grant extra influence, ships, cash, ground forces, and more.  The game just recently went public so there isn't much out there yet, but I do have a lot of stuff on tig source ( http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=46086.0 ) and there is a closed alpha going on now with online multiplayer."

4Xgaming,2vo9z8,Eraser1024,25,Thu Feb 12 18:06:56 2015 UTC,37€ for early acces. I'm all for supporting the developers but come. the. fuck. on.
4Xgaming,2vo9z8,Benthetraveler,2,Thu Feb 12 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of with you in that it seems overpriced.  However, I don't think so simply because it's early access.  I think so because of what the game is itself.  It looks fun, but it's light.  It basically looks like a single city builder, and the simulation lacks depth.  That's fine, but that cuts down on replayability.  It looks like a game that would be fun for maybe a couple of weeks and then never again.  There just isn't much to it.  I definitely want it because it's interesting, clever, and different.  I'm going to wait for a steam sale though."

For instance, I did early access into Project Zomboid, Don't Starve, Kerbal Space Program, and a couple others, entrants into a space that was highly unrepresented at that time.  Should you be buying into the next competitive/coop FPS or pixel graphic game? Not so sure.  Anyhoo, if the concept of EA bugs people, ya'all really need to stop buying into it. I won't be touching EAGalCiv3 with a 10 foot pole, for instance, but I won't fault anyone who does. This one? We'll have to see. I get annoyed at certain concepts here, but its an economic base building RTS type game. I'm into that."

I'll hold off judgement and see how the game shapes up.  That said, if someone where to make a 4x style game in the manner of HoI/EU/CK and give it a sci-fi setting, that'd be all kinds of awesome.

When someone invades your territory, or you invade theirs, there's an option to play it out as an RTS battle, or let the computer sim it.   There's an option in the options menu iirc for deciding to forego the RTS portion.   But yes, the A&A based on the board game."

4Xgaming,2v1k7c,spotnyk,5,Sat Feb 7 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"So I just bought Star Ruler 2 and I think it is awesome. It finds a nice balance between Sins of a Solar Empire (fun but a bit too simplistic for my tastes) and Distant Worlds (fun but arguably too vast and complex). I highly recommend it, I would even go so far as to say I would have paid more for it than its current price ($20). But before I start rattling off things I liked an disliked, let me preface this by saying I've only played about 8 hours and am still figuring out a lot of features.   First and foremost, graphics (in my humble opinion) are awesome. Zoomed out, it doesn't look like much (just a bunch of cartoonish icons over the planets) but it's really impressive when you zoom in. Watching my first major fleet battle was an awesome experience, really cool to see all the different types of weapons and ship designs in action. The FTL effects, too, were dazzling. Watching your fleets (zoomed in) is just sheer eye candy.   Speaking of ship designs, the game has a great ship design/edit feature. It seems a little overwhelming at first, but the reward is well-worth the time it takes to figure it out. It seems like you can design them for practically any purpose: heavily armed and armored juggernauts, fast moving light attack ships, ships with virtually no firepower but capable of commanding huge numbers of support ships. The design sandbox (alluded to in the video but I haven't delved into yet) seems like the equivalent of a ""firing range"" to test your designs/ships/fleets without worrying about building an empire/economy to support them.   Planetary development / resource management is a really novel approach to building up your empire/economy. Basically you establish trade routes to keep your planets supplied with the needed resources to export goods ad level up. It feels really unique and its cool to see the networks and hierarchies that result, although after a while it becomes just a glorified game of ""connect the dots"". Still, much more interesting than a lot of games in the genre.   Diplomacy is another totally unique feature. The video does a nice job of explaining it, so I won't go into much detail. In summary, diplomacy is done through cards, which have different actions tied to them. The cards are acquired by a reverse bidding system, purchased with influence points. Ultimately, this makes for a much ""fuller"" system of diplomacy and intergalactic relations, compared to the typical ""give us gifts and destroy our enemies, and in exchange we will agree to a peace treaty with you (until it is no longer convenient for us)"" diplomacy in most other games I've played. The only thing I wish is that spying was more than just seeing an opponents territories and fleet movements.   That about wraps up my major things that come to mind when I think about this game. Some other random things: the fact that there are different FTL technologies (hyperdrives, warp gates, etc.) associated with different races is a really cool idea, something I've never seen done before. The different races, however, leave something to be desired. There's no humans, which I found odd (the devs explained that it takes place in a galaxy other than our own, but I really don't think anyone would mind if another imaginary galaxy had a human-analogue race). And the music is kind of cheesy. He last two complaints are obviously very superficial and don't affect gameplay, so take that for what you will.  So again, great game. I'm looking forward to finding out everything else it has to offer that I haven't discovered yet, and to playing it in its finished state. I highly recommend it."

Not that I'm trying to shit on this guy but anyone who plays 4x RTS games knows how important the pause button is. If I was considering buying a game like this and one of the first things the guy said was that it didn't have a pause button other than to bring up the main menu, that would be a big ""wtf"" for me.

4Xgaming,2v0pme,ArkisVir,6,Fri Feb 6 20:14:11 2015 UTC,"While I agree politics is a difficult subject in 4x games, the deeper you go in the direction you mentioned, the more you get into empire ""simulation"".    Complexity is not what people around here are sick of, it's the sheer number of menial tasks required to ""play"" the game, which ends up becoming one huge AI controlled game.  Why have all of these cool features if you aren't even controlling them?  Instead, complexity can be gained through the consequences of every single action.  If you decide to barter with some planetary inhabitants and open a line of trade, what happens when you pick a fight with allies of that planet?  Or what happens if players can vote on the outcome of an agenda, and it changes the state of play for the rest of the game, forcing people to alter their strategy?    While I don't have anything against large scale empire simulators, I think players just want to feel more invested in the actions they take these days."
4Xgaming,2v0pme,onmach,1 point,Fri Feb 6 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"The thing I think is at the heart of this, and which many people mentioned is the huge gap between direct control and AI. I read a post praising a game about custom build queues you can save for research planets and what not. AI governors who control some function and may rebel are probably more realistic, but you can combine that with other things that are more player controlled like players giving directions midway between direct and AI. So they still make high level decisions but don't have to click 40 buttons to implement them.  As for feeling invested in the actions they take, I don't think direct control, which causes tons of menial work, helps at all. It only makes you grumpier. Rather, the answer to feeling ownership of your nation/army/settlement lies in removing the linear techs and predetermined options. How boring a choice are idea groups in EU4? Everyone has the same 8 and they are the same every game. National ideas aren't even an option to choose, unless you use the ruler designer or mods. And again they are static and most of the time lack flavor anyways.  Unfortunately this issue lies in a realm besides politics, more like research/science/development, which I'll probably make a separate post on later.  I do think I have a good solution to give to this topic specifically, regarding ideology/religion and giving players real control over at least the framework of their nations politics. But I'd like to see a few more comments before I get to that.  I certainly dislike the way I have little practical control over the culture/flavor/development of my empire, just because of some stupid considerations about being too hard to balance or w/e the flavor of the month excuse is from devs. I think a really interesting area, which I brought up in my wall of doom is the massive abstraction of government forms and religions. Especially how something like the Holy Roman Empire had to be specially hard coded into EU4."

For a game to span that period of time without being tedious means you have to either leave planet management out and start the player with an empire of too many colonies to individually manage ala ck2, or you have to make it easy to control all the colonies when the game reaches that stage ala every 4x game I've played in a long time.  Warlock 2 tried to make it so that you managed only a few colonies and the others were barely functioning, but I'm going to be honest I didn't like that.  I think all of us would be in agreement that virtually any 4x should start with that first colony and expand outward.  All the solutions I've seen other than AI governor sucked.  And the reason AI governor also sucks was because they don't do as good of a job as you would.  But then, what to do?  I've seen no other good options."

I assumed by direct control you meant setting build orders for each planet/province, giving fleet move orders, picking tech to research. That is what most current 4x games do. I don't see how you could have direct control without lots of clicks unless you mean implement build queues and research goals or something."

4Xgaming,2v0pme,calloutgamesmods,1 point,Sat Feb 7 03:01:07 2015 UTC,I agree. I wish there were more games with the galactic civilizations franchise on this topic. There's not much to do during a military buildup to keep the game interesting later on. Having to worry about internal affairs is an important part of any empire and its ridiculous that there aren't more games that reflect this.
4Xgaming,2v0pme,ran88dom99,2,Wed Feb 11 20:47:07 2015 UTC,"Politics in 4x  You're faced with a tough road when it comes to politics in 4x gaming. While you could make the game extremely elaborate in terms of potential effects and what not, you may face two equally tough issues. One, you might go against a market that is much more in the business of eXterminate rather than eXploit. The other is that if you make something like this, there are generally defined rules that allow people to exploit the game mechanics since each attribute tends to be defined.  For this, the middle road is the road not travelled (and the hardest one to do). I think we can extrapolate something from Rome 2 and Europa Universalis. In Rome 2, if your faction became too influential, you're faced with a crippling civil war that is, for the most part, the final boss to overcome. Once you overcome this challenge, you get the steamroller effect to continue. In Europa Universalis, the way that the computer forces you to face tougher odds is that whole coalition mechanic, but even this isn't enough to delay the impact a good player has.  One good aspect that ""politics"" has on 4x could be a number of things. More planets/land means people to deal with- EU did this great in terms of a time period of integrating countries or costing a hard-to-increase resource that prevents extreme blobbing. A mechanic that this applies to is akin to how small countries are able to produce better technology or tactics vs. a large empire. This can be reflected by a malus on the player for each bit of land the player takes. More bureaucracy, more dissent, etc.  However, I think these ideas are heavily explored already and a strong system can be put in place to prevent a player from expanding too much. The issue is in when the malus is so restricting, the game no longer becomes fun.   For this, I think what 4x games need is a undefined set of rules. Rules that prevent exploiting because, for all the player knows, they don't exist. That means random maluses happen not because a pre-defined number of territory or any of that, just random events with the chance of happening that cause X to happen. This also creates a quasi-lore generator a la Dwarf Fortress. RANDOMLY GENERATED GROUP A is was historically at ends vs RANDOMLY GENERATED GROUP B. Unfortunately, Group B has highly influential people in your empire- let's say your top generals are part of this. For as long as your keep these influential people, Group A will always rebel regardless of how many troops you send/defenses. Your choice might be to get rid of these influential people, but at the end of the day, Group A and Group B will always fight each other.   You can choose to glass each side completely which will cause a massive uproar in your empire- so you can't do that. It's kind of like a, ""welp, I guess I gotta lvie with it"" concept. The benefit of always having Group B at the top would be good generals, but at the cost of that particular land making a risk on trade/stability/etc. Unfortunately, you can't just separate the two and the problem will always exist. Though it may fix itself randomly in the future via a chance system, you ""living"" with it engenders future conditions.   If every country (regardless of size) suffers (or benefits) under these conditions, then some dynamic things can happen. Countries can rise and fall within your own empire (given that you give certain levels of autonomy a la Crusader Kings), unions of different factions can rise to challenge you, and because group A hates the current situation and Group B is in power, group A could revolt for the benefit of another empire.  The only issue is that this doesn't simulate things like the HRE, etc."

4Xgaming,2uw1d4,Mezmorki,9,Thu Feb 5 17:26:23 2015 UTC,"These are fundamental issues with the simplicity of 4x games. If you don't simulate the inner life of an empire, then you have no non-totally stupid reason for most empires to fall apart. Paradox has this issue all over the place. The rise and fall of large empires were primarily driven by their leaders/founders and their political systems and not their military might. Rebellious governors essentially brought about the downfall of Rome. Ruling over every aspect of an empire/kingdom in most 4x games, and even Paradox ones to major degrees, not just Victoria2 but EU4, allows endless trivial expansion because as you note the biggest nation wins one fight and then curbstomps the enemy forever after.  There is no non shitty method of handling snowballing and steamrolling where you are also allowed to continue to run your state like it is populated by mind controlled drones."
4Xgaming,2uw1d4,Hyndis,4,Fri Feb 6 02:45:49 2015 UTC,"Nice and succinct perspective.  I like your last sentence in particular.  I've been thinking about 4X/civ games in two ways, how ""external pressure"" works and how ""internal pressure"" works.   Internal pressure is more of the empire management / internal affairs that could, in theory, cause an empire to collapse under its own weight regardless of the actions of other empires.  Resource scarcity, progressive populations, gluttony/greed/excess.  What would it be like to make a 4X game where you, as the player, were the only empire in the whole game world.  How long/big could your reign last before it collapsed on its own accord?  External pressures are of course things like military threats, diplomatic pressures, economic opportunities/threats, espionage and so on that is the hallmark of most purer 4X games.  Age of Wonders 3 is all external pressure, there is very little by way of internal pressure.  And in that case, when the game isn't challenging enough and doesn't apply enough external pressure, the experience is left wanting.  The shitty part, as you mention, is that you could have systems where your population transitions from mind controlled drones to independent people demanding all sorts of stuff - and along with that comes a loss of control for the player.  It might be more challenging and realistic, but would it make for a good game?"
4Xgaming,2uw1d4,KaiserTom,5,Fri Feb 6 03:22:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting read.  I think much of the problem with 4x games is making new cities/colonies be just as good as your starting city/colony. This makes settlements interchangeable. They all do the same thing, and because they all do the same thing more is better.  But this isn't the case in the real world. Capital cities are extremely important. Empires fall because a capital city is lost. In game mechanic terms, the player's starting area should be vastly more important than any newly captured/colonized area.  Look at the history of war and empires. Territory changes hands all the time, but the capitals of these empires? Those remain. If a capital does fall then its all over.  See Rome, Carthage, Paris, and Berlin as examples of this. The central city is the hub of everything. Take that and the empire or nation that lost their primary hub of everything can no longer function as a state. They're done.  I would translate this into 4x game mechanics by making your home city/province/planet/whatever have gigantic bonuses. Your main starting area should be 90% of your empire right there. New settlements will feed resources back to your core, but your core is everything. Production buildings should only be able to be constructed in your core. This is where all of your science and industry is. This is where the vast majority of your empire's citizens live. This is your Coruscant. Battles can be waged over remote colonies like Tatooine all day long. Conquerors can plant flags and take down other flags continually. It doesn't matter how many times Tatooine changes hands. It matters how many times Coruscant changes hands.  This means that, should one faction have a core plus a sprawling web of colonies, and the other faction has only its core left, there wouldn't be that big of a power gap between the two. The power gap would be small enough that the smaller faction can make up ground and beat back the bigger faction. This also means that the bigger faction gets weaker the bigger it gets.  Having roughly the same strength but a much larger territory to expand means that it might have a lot of trouble defending its gains."
4Xgaming,2uw1d4,onmach,3,Thu Feb 5 20:13:46 2015 UTC,"Emporer of the Fading Suns does this along with Star Ruler 2 now, where you have your outer/shitty colonies producing food/raw resources that then get focused into another colony where that colony then develops slightly and produces a higher tier resource which focuses into another colony, yada yadda, all going into your capital (or planet of choice) that is now extremely highly developed and a center of your empire (to the point where you then can build galactic wonders)."
4Xgaming,2uw1d4,Hyndis,3,Thu Feb 5 23:49:43 2015 UTC,"The Civ games enhance capitals with Wonders, buildings that are unique and have significant impact. Losing the city you have built key wonders in is a disaster. And they generally end up in your best cities, simply because of the huge build times in less developed places."
4Xgaming,2uw1d4,FiveDogNight,4,Fri Feb 6 01:40:27 2015 UTC,"The only problem with this is that you have to have a reason to settle colonies in the first place.  I mean why waste any resources obtaining and holding them if they do nothing?  There have been some games that did this.  Most notably master of magic did it.  When you kill the enemy wizard's capital, he is banished.  Unfortunately they also made it to where he could come back, which drug out games.  One way of doing things that I thought interesting was in crusader kings 2, as you get larger, you are less able to manage territories so you have to hand them off to underlings, and then they only lend you a percentage of their troops and money to use for your own wars, and then as you get more and more territory it gets harder to keep them happy so you accept less and less assistance from them.  But that adds all the complication of politics into the mix that I'm not sure is right for a 4x."
4Xgaming,2uw1d4,ArkisVir,3,Thu Feb 5 22:20:59 2015 UTC,"Colonies should be resource gatherers, not source of production.  In terms of how I'd go about this with an existing game, I'll use Endless Space or Endless Legend as an example.   Territories may or may not have strategic resources. You need these resources to build the best stuff. The only way to get these resources is to either trade for them or control territory that has them.  What I would do, via modding, would be to make all structures be buildable only once, only in your capital. This could be done by making a requirement check. Does your capital building exist in that system/region? If no, you can't build. If yes, then you can build. I'd also add a 0 on to the end of all bonuses for these buildings. Multiply them by 10x base values. You can only build one set of things per empire, but these upgrades are huge upgrades.  Meanwhile out in the provinces there's nothing to build. In Endless Space you will automatically gather resources on a planet if the planet is colonized and if the right technology has been unlocked. Planets can still colonize other planets in the same star system or specialize in food/dust/science, but they don't build any improvements. Star systems in Endless Space would just be resource farms and territory for fleets and armies to fight over. Cut off the resources by taking important systems, and the other empire suddenly can't build the best toys. These colonies would also produce some dust revenue, but it would be minor. As there are no buildings they only get base dust production and thats it.  In Endless Legend it would be very similar. I'd make it so that all upgrades require a capital building. Other cities would be small, simple things. They would be little more than a fortified/garrisoned mining town. The only things they could construct would be resource gathering buildings and watchtowers. They'd mine things like titanium and ship it back to your capital which has all of the upgrades built. Your capital builds things using resources imported to it.  Cut off that flow of resources and the capital can't build units that require that resource.  If a colony changes hands its no big deal unless there are strategic resources there. Colonies are also relatively lightly defended. Remember, they have no upgrades.  The capital is a mighty fortress. Remember, I just multiplied out all of the bonuses of its buildings by 10x. This means that not only is it an industrial juggernaut but it is also heavily defended. Taking a capital should be a serious undertaking.  That's how I'd do a 4x game and thats how I'd limit the snowball effect of the colony rush phase."
4Xgaming,2uw1d4,KaiserTom,2,Thu Feb 5 22:56:02 2015 UTC,An earlier post from my blog got dragged up here not too long ago - so I figured this brand spanking new one might be of interest to this crew as well.  It builds on the older post to some degree.
4Xgaming,2uw1d4,ran88dom99,2,Thu Feb 5 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people are making mechanic suggestions, or explaining in broad strokes issues with 4x games; I feel the main issue is that of complexity to fun balance.  Most mainstream 4x games are really just not that complex.  Reasons for this are because the developers actually want to be able to release and sell their game.  High levels of complexity can be a nightmare to balance and test, and most AIs struggle in even the simplest of 4x games with boardgame like rules."
4Xgaming,2uw1d4,megazver,3,Fri Feb 6 07:11:55 2015 UTC,"See, my issue is with so many 4X games is that complexity does not equal depth.  You can have a very deep and strategic game that is simple and elegant and not complex - look at the boardgame ""Go"" for inspiration.  I don't think 4X games need to get more complex, because most of them aren't very deep despite the complexity they do have."
4Xgaming,2uw1d4,Texashawk76,3,Fri Feb 6 11:53:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this, not every game should be like Chess or Go. Adding a lot of large systems to your game will probably increase complexity faster than depth but many times its still worth it. Dominions is Dominions because of the complexity. The economic system isn't complex OR deep, own tons of lands, build tons of forts. But just being able to play around doing different things is the major point of the game and it is aided by the excessive number of summons and spells and items. For many games the purpose of the game is to explore a massive possibility space, rather than focus on the balance needed for online multiplayer.  The reason for lack of complexity in mainstream games is that most people are simply terrible at evaluating large possibility spaces. Thus games that focus on that do not sell well. Mainstream games are all about sales."

Endless Legend had risen to the top of my list, so it's nice to have some confirmation that I wasn't misleading myself. The atypical races seemed like a nice change (elves replaced by Twi'leks?!), the whole game just seemed to have a really unique style, judging by the YouTube videos.  In your opinion, what sets Endless Legend apart from its peers?"
4Xgaming,2urq41,DeathGOD_1235,2,Sat Feb 7 15:15:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Endless Legends is your best bet and worth a try, but it probably will still leave you wanting on the empire building aspect because of the focus on tactics battles.

Steal map, steal technology, sabotage whatever... Just some simple actions to support the important parts of the gameplay. It's a shame, because it certainly has more potential and if you take it a bit further, a grand stategy-ish simulation of a cold war era intelligence agency could be awesome.  Not a 4x game, but I'm really interested how NetGain will turn out. About time someone reaized that spies can be cool in other games than just stealth/action ones. If it will be good, maybe it'll catch on among indie developers."
4Xgaming,2uo4d3,Infamously_Unknown,3,Tue Feb 3 21:45:34 2015 UTC,"The problem is that realistic intelligence would require a lot more freedom than is easily available.

4Xgaming,2uo4d3,patrick227,3,Wed Feb 4 04:42:20 2015 UTC,"Obviously, if you're talking about some ideal, but we're talking about games. You don't need realism to make a game more interesting. Intelligence usually seems like an afterthough in the design. It's some abstract magic that allows you to evoke a small selection of effects from time to time, not something integrated into the game. I'd say there's some room for improvement before you start dealing with realistic outside the box espionage."

Its fairly generic in it's options, with the standard steal map/tech and such, but it does allow you to incite rebellions, assassinate the generals or rulers of the enemy empire, sabotage the construction of a ship, or blow up a station.  I am aware that's not too deep still. Maybe go and see other genres? I would imagine genres that are more war oriented than most 4x would have more. (Hence why HoI is one of the better ones you have found, isnt that one much more war and army movement oriented than CK2 and EU4 are?)"

4Xgaming,2ufl5w,bobniborg,5,Sun Feb 1 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"The main start is: Huge map, couple hundred nations Start with one province, build it up, colonize new provinces AI does the same Eventually most provinces will be colonized  I guess the best example is that its somewhat like Dominions 4 but with more in nation stuff to handle.  There will also be some fighting in this phase over land. You can explore your provinces for resources and special locations.  Your citizens will be organized into populations which will have unique opinions of you and each other. These will determine their actions with regard to revolt and wars and so forth.  You will also have unique relations with various nations, guilds, factors, magic groups, and religions. I'm hoping to have all these groups control some land in the provinces they operate in. Guilds will have halls, factors factories, religions temples, mage groups towers and so forth.  In theory you could play as one of these groups instead of a nation. Nations could have state religions or magic societies, as well as secular universities and libraries. It might be possible to have your state magic group operate as a mages guild in other nations and so forth.  Exploration is a critical part of the game. Even the late game has some opportunities for expeditions even to long time provinces of your kingdom. You discover artifacts and books and resources that give you knowledge and new manufacturing options. There is no research tree in the game in the traditional sense.  Similarly, you don't have ideas or policies such as in Paaradox games. No tech focus like in Beyond Earth. Taxes are set by the player on each population they rule. Trade policies and subsidies are freely creatable using the priority system. Priorities also determine things like how the population sent to a new province is apportioned, what part of your population works on construction projects and expeditions, and you draft soldiers from your populations using the priority system as well.  There are several races in the game, some you only discover through exploration. You can have policies about breeding and so forth. Consider the humanbred and demonbred races in the Abyssian nation in Dominions. Your education policy also affects castes. You may educate your elvish population for clerical work, since traditional elves are smarter and more moral and so forth compared to humans.  Your populace adapts to local conditions over time, in lore probably sped up by some magic force, so you don't need to wait for evolutionary time scales. If you have a good percentage of your populace in cold lands, they become better at living in the cold lands over decades or centuries. You might then levy your armies for attacking nations with lots of cold land from those provinces, while tropical provinces will be drawn from for tropical wars. Military units take on stats from the attributes of the populations you create them from.  Your caste, religion, and tax, and even trade policies will cause opinion modifiers among the populations of your lands. Humans may resent that many upper castes are closed to them. Well granted different populations of humans or halfbreeds may be viable for higher level castes. Free trade laws may please traders but piss off nobles. Trade friendly nations are likely to receive private cash gifts in war to pay for stuff. Soldier friendly nations will have more soldiers, soldiers will be a high status caste, they may have superior martial traditions and so forth.  Similarly a policy of freely sharing knowledge in public universities, which may be open to foreign scholars, may gain you immigration of many scholars, who may bring new knowledge, or you might organize scholarly exchanges with other free knowledge/speech friendly lands. The same for magic.  The game has food requirements for your populace as well as logistics for military things. No running 100k men across the map for years at a time unless you can defend your supply lines.  I'll edit this comment if I think of anything else important."

4Xgaming,2ufl5w,Terkala,1 point,Mon Feb 2 05:36:58 2015 UTC,"Its only ambitious if you expect pretty pictures and a trivially simple UI. Those are the major roadblocks. Large projects generally need large budgets and shinies are the way to make that money back. If you aren't doing it for profit and are okay with a game that looks like it was from 1996 or worse graphically, the scale of the project suddenly contracts massively.  It would be helpful if Reddit would simply allow text and a link in the first post. Its not like the Karma on this site means anything anymore, its so inflated, so the whole link only thing is pointless. I suppose I could have solved that by making a text post with the link at the top but I didn't think of it till you asked for a summary."

4Xgaming,2ufl5w,Chriamon,2,Wed Feb 4 14:00:11 2015 UTC,"There is a new, though short, post up on the blog. I am in the process of coding this functionality as I'm writing this comment.  As of now buildings are functioning properly and you set province priorities to limit their production if you need to conserve resources. Setting a value of say 5 for flour with 6 mills which have capacity 2 will take the first mill in the list, make it run 2 flour processes, next in the list the same, mill after that does 1. All values the same except priority value is 9, you will have 4 mills at the full 2 capacity and 1 mill at 1. Note that if you only have resources for 9 runs of flour and you set no priority, the result will be the same. But if you have resources for all 12 runs, you will run all 12 with no priority. This may seem like a small effect but it becomes significant at much higher values in more developed provinces."
4Xgaming,2ufl5w,G-ZeuZ,2,Tue Feb 3 17:19:11 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, for the 4 people who dovnvoted, is this because of lack of screenshots/evidence, the current progress of the project, or lack of interest in the design goals? I noticed only positive people made comments."
4Xgaming,2ufl5w,Savagedlight,10,Mon Feb 2 00:21:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, I voted that way because blogs like yours are extremely common. For every 1 of them that actually results in a game that even makes it to ""tech-demo"" status, there are 100 that just die and go nowhere.  I don't mean to discourage your project specifically. But you're talking in extremely general terms about a lot of things. Not in ways that would actually be useful when it comes to implementation. You're describing a game that would be a huge set of convergent systems, with no easy way to actually balance them individually.  So your idea may be excellent, but it doesn't sound like you have the resources or details worked out to actually implement 10% of what you've envisioned. When I see dozens of blogs like this, I find that it's not worth the time to individually comment on them. I only replied here because you honestly seemed confused as to why anyone would downvote you."
4Xgaming,2ufl5w,bobniborg,0,Mon Feb 2 06:50:33 2015 UTC,"I was not confused, I was aware of several possible reasons. I was simply curious which was the case. Downvotes don't help much if you don't explain them because as I said there were several possible reasons for them.  There probably won't be intense balance, in case I didn't make it super clear, there's no multiplayer. Its more about shaping your history than winning, although I will be trying to prevent an obviously dominant strategy so that players feel like they have more of a choice on what to do.  I do have many of the details worked out though they may change a bit as I actually code stuff. I know how I'm implementing the production system because I already made something similar for a previous project for instance. If I described every single thing in detail, I probably spend so much time on that I wouldn't code anything.  I do agree there are a lot of vaporware blogs out there. Hopefully that will seem less likely once there is enough gameplay functioning to post a video or something. Sadly due to as you said massive convergent systems that will take longer than normal, unless people wanted to see a really basic game where most of the events and population interactions weren't functioning noticeably yet which seems unlikely since that's not the selling point of the project."

4Xgaming,2ub0bx,VineFynn,2,Sat Jan 31 15:24:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely abstract by design. We are aiming for a 4X lite experience. Gameplay is modeled after ""play by email"" chess.

We're still prototyping so we'll probably need to add some additional carefully-balanced elements to add meat to the strategy side.  Appreciate your honest feedback."

4Xgaming,2uac1b,PersistentGamer,4,Sat Jan 31 07:25:08 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, the way I identify my initial research paths is, first identifying my needs (money, production, population), and then my surroundings, and subsequently taking technologies that allow me to fully exploit my surroundings and achieve my goals the fastest.   If you're playing a smaller map, it is probably wise to get cracking on military technologies first. But on larger, spaced out maps it is easier to take your time and boom before you build up a military. There is some trial and error to it, as with all things, but a good game makes understanding your situation intuitive."
4Xgaming,2uac1b,VineFynn,3,Sat Jan 31 07:50:55 2015 UTC,"I'd start with ones that pay off in the long run then moving on to pertinent ones to your empire. For instance, if you save 10% on all military units grab that... then decide if you are going for economy victory or military. If military focus on powers for hero characters and research that gets better units. If not then focus on saving on unit upkeep and new buildings/places that get tourism/trade up.  Honestly, what I love about 4x is I can screw around and play by myself and get used to my failures and test things out so don't get discouraged. These games are mostly single player and as long as you are having fun forget about the rest.   Also, AOW3 is the bomb haha."

I appreciate the AAA production values that Firaxis brings to the table but it seems like they have really fallen off their 4x game in recent years; their name no longer implies ""best in the industry,"" at least when it comes to satisfying complexity and in game options.  I won't get into my personal feelings regarding the XCOM remake, but I was utterly disappointed with vanilla Civ 5 and even more disappointed by Civ: BE.  I worry that Firaxis, having achieved widespread name recognition with the Civilization series, now feels compelled to offer a more ""accessible"" experience, and whereas this is not necessarily a problem, I have no interest in playing Civilization: Revolutions, I want to play Alp[ha Centauri.

At that setting, I was easily beating them military wise, but found them to be building up OK, though slower than me.

However, I can say that it's really quite fun already and he's not planning to release until Q4. The way professions work, the need to migrate semi-frequently, the artwork, and the clans systems are all very different from anything the genre has ever seen.  My concern is for the end game, though. Because you'll only have one town, I worry that sense of progression with large empires and end game badassery may be lost. I have faith in Jon, though. He's a pretty smart guy!"
4Xgaming,2twm4d,OrcasareDolphins,3,Wed Jan 28 12:35:25 2015 UTC,"Seems like a cool game. I like the changing landscapes feature the most. Not sure if that has been tried in other 4x games before.  As /u/BrassBass mentioned, would love to hear from those playing the alpha builds."
4Xgaming,2twm4d,Shmutt,2,Wed Jan 28 07:08:31 2015 UTC,"Seems like it has a bunch of novel approaches that we've not seen much before:   Changing seasons that affect gameplay significantly with the supply mechanic and terrain-specific options that it opens, such as crossing frozen rivers. They're certainly not there just as visual candy. Packing up and moving the settlement. You have to do this once you deplete the surrounding resources. This is interesting as a conflict-inducing mechanic, map exploration incentive and historical theme. The focus on professions rather than the usual tech tree is also a novel approach, although it reminds me a bit of Colonization.   I'm very interested to see how diplomacy and brushing against the Romans work. Hopefully in one of the next Let's plays."

If you look at other kickstarters, there are videos of prototype gameplay and people showing their enthusiasm, convincing us to fund their game. The kickstarter page then shows heaps of concept art, sketches, diagrams etc.  And as /u/terkala mentioned, you don't explain in any way how you expect the game to work.  If I compare your campaign to anything that got funded, the difference is absolutely staggering. I do realize that all this takes a lot of work, but if you don't show at least the skill to create a proper kickstarter page, you can't expect us to give you tens of thousands of money and expect you to show up with a complete professional product (which is what you have to deliver if you ask for this kind of money) in a year or two."

The sequel looks better... but 10% off is hardly a deal and it's not finished yet.  Galciv 2 was phenomenal... after many patches and expansion packs. The base game wasn't that fun for me. I think elemental is still the last 'big' game they tried to make... and that was utter crap. Even after three iterations it's still a mediocre fantasy 4x. I honestly don't see galciv 3 coming out any less half-baked at release.  tl;dr just don't buy it yet. after they come out and people love it, then buy it."

4Xgaming,2tuspi,MegaGrubby,2,Tue Jan 27 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"after they come out and people love it, then buy it.   Completely agree, and I'll add to that:   Wait a month or so after it comes out, possibly more, and specifically look for some people with honest reviews showcasing the good and bad, with some specific and detailed criticisms and praises.  People naturally get excited about the good parts of a gaming experience while they're playing it. It's only as time goes on that those same people may stop playing and have more of the negative experiences to discuss.   It's easy as a reader who wants to get a game to get swept up when someone says ""best 4X of the year"" (paraphrase of the top-comment from Endless Legend post in this sub). We do each other a disservice by not trying to describe our full experience of a game rather than our opinion of it."

4Xgaming,2tuspi,cavilier210,9,Tue Feb 3 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"I bought Star Ruler 2 and I do play it every week or so. The game is rapidly changing as new patches as released. The devs are very active in developing it as well as responsive on the Steam forums.  In my opinion, Star Ruler 2 has a strong foundation. It is very well playable right now. It is an RTS sort of game. Its all in real time, but its a very slow real time. When I say ""real time"" I mean it plays more like EU or Hearts of Iron rather than Starcraft. This is not a game that requires fast reflexes whatsoever. Its all about the grand strategy.  That said, Star Ruler 2 is still very much unfinished. While core functions are there, the game has little in the way of balance. Systems and mechanics have not yet been balanced. The AI is also in dire need of work. The AI and balance are improving, but it is early access. Don't expect a finished product.  Its not a bad game, don't get me wrong. It looks like it is shaping up to be a good game, but you have to keep in mind it is an unfinished game.  If you buy it now I think you'll enjoy it despite the rough edges and so long as you don't go in expecting a finished, fully balanced and polished product.  I have not played GalCiv3 so I can't offer any feedback  on that one."
4Xgaming,2tuspi,Hyndis,3,Tue Jan 27 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"Hahah, that's actually me in that old thread.  I did end up buying Star Ruler 2 and it's definitely a fun, large-scale game with some very cool ideas, most of which have been implemented well.  But I must confess I haven't played it a ton and haven't been keeping up on what they've updated and whatnot since I bought it. Just flipping through their patch notes now and I'll have to fit some time in to try out some of the new stuff though.  For what it's worth I do plan on buying Gal Civ III once it gets good enough to do so."
4Xgaming,2tuspi,Trodamus,3,Tue Jan 27 17:41:44 2015 UTC,"The micromanagement gets absolutely absurd in GalCiv2 and even with all the modding tools noone made a simple ""fewer ships"" mod.

It exceeds the the recommended system specs and it can handle games like Sins of a a Solar Empire and Age of Wonders just fine, but the text and graphics in this are all bloated and blocky, I can't read or see anything, so I can't even get past the menu screen. Doesn't seem like other people are having this problem, but at least for me the game is unplayable. Wish I could recommend it but I can't even play it so I'm pretty bummed."
4Xgaming,2tuspi,midnight_toker22,2,Fri Jan 30 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"Does your laptop have an integrated GPU (particularly an intel chipset) for its graphics hardware?  I ask because, as stated on the minimum hardware requirements, the game currently only officially supports chipsets/cards from AMD or nVidia.  If you're on an intel integrated GPU your main menu probably looks something like this due to the (unfortunately common in Intel chipsets) incomplete/irregular implementation of OpenGL draw/shader functions in its graphics driver.  In any case, updating your drivers will probably solve the issue - unless you're on an intel GPU in which case it's a roll of the dice.  Some folks have had success in getting their intel chipsets to run the game after playing around with driver versions but we can't guarantee success.    Sorry for your troubles - lemme know if you can get it up and running."
4Xgaming,2tuspi,Firgof,2,Fri Jan 30 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"So I never got Star Ruler 2 working on my laptop, but I wanted to play it badly enough that I decided to drive out to my storage unit, dig out my gaming PC, clear some space in my apartment and set it up.  I am glad I did. This is an awesome game, and as far as I can tell, exactly what I was lookng for: a real time 4x space game that finds a nice medium ground between Sins of a Solar Empire (fun but a bit too simplistic for my tastes) and Distance Worlds (fun but arguably too vast and complex. It reminds me a lot of Imperium Galactica 2, my first and still favorite game of this genre. I only played about 6 hours but I had a lot of fun.   First of all, the graphics are pretty great, the fleet battles look really impressive and the FTL effects blew me away (sometimes I stop what I'm doing just to watch ships jump between systems). Fleets are controlled by a ""flagship"" that you can attach support ships to, although I haven't yet figured out how to add extra ""large"" ships to the fleet so for now it's just one big ship and a host of support ships. One thing I didn't like was that it seemed like all of the ships only served to increase the health and firepower of your fleet, as opposed to having different ships that served different purposes (like Sins of a Solar Empire for example). Also I couldn't seem to build up my economy enough to maintain fleets big enough to defend my empire. I'm sure some of this stuff I'll figure out as I play more (there IS a ship design feature that I haven't quite figured out yet).  The resource management / planetary development system is really cool and makes for a logical system of empire building. I wish it had a little more to it though, because after a while it felt like all I was doing was searching for certain icons and creating long chains of them - basically ""connect the dots"" when you boil it down. One unique thing about your economy is that you have a budget that works in cycles as opposed to a grand sum of money - but unfortunately your budget surplus doesn't pool into a reserve bank of any kind and I'm not quite sure where that surplus goes when the budget resets. Hopefully they change that during release.  Diplomacy is another really unique feature: it is based on ""cards"" that you can buy off of a bidding system, each card has an effect or action tied to it (like initiating a senate vote to annex a planet, add voted in favor or opposition to a proposal, spying, etc.) That's really cool and I imagine it will encourage me to use diplomacy more than in most 4x games. Spying could have some more options available other than just ""seeing"" another empire's activities, but that's a small thing.  Overall it makes for a really fun game. There were some things that were not so good (some of which I alluded to already) but it was hard to tell if it was because I just hadnt really figured it out yet or if it just wasn't in the game (still in early access / beta). So I am looking forward to playing it in it's finished state, but regardless of when that is, I highly recommend it."

We're glad you're enjoying yourself.   I'm not quite sure where that surplus goes when the budget resets.   As explained in the tutorial, excess money is placed into your Welfare option (defaults to Influence production).  Some of that is because we're still in Early Access, yeah.

Well let me just say thanks for offering help on my laptop issue and great work on the game! I tried to get into the ship design aspect a little bit last night and now I'm really excited to get into the meat of it and integrate that with the rest of the gameplay. Seems like it will be really fun and interesting.   One thing I thought would be pretty cool is, when you are in the design blueprint for a ship, if there were a several ship models to choose from (not the blueprint generator but what they actually look like when they are produced) instead of picking one ""family"" of models when you choose/customize your face before a game.

There is a manual override for which ship model you would like to use if you click the blue ship icon in the design editor's minitoolbar (underneath the ship's build/maintenance cost).   Also, I can't be the only person to ask for a human race to play as, can I?   You aren't, no.  However, SR2 takes place in a galaxy which is definitely not our own and so I felt it'd be odd if there were things which looked exactly like humans in it.

My laptop is a 64-bit system and has 4GB RAM and the processor operates at 2.6GHz I think...something that was pretty good in like 2008.   I've made sure the drivers are all up to date, but that didn't help. When I open it up, it's not nearly as bad as the picture you linked.

I can see them enlarge slightly when I move my cursor over them. Each one takes me to a different set of menu options, each one with what I have determined to be a ""back/main menu"" button... I've even clicked a series of buttons which have led me to a ""new game"", I can see the grid layout and circles for planets/stars, but everything else including the text is blocky and indiscernible, like the menu. So I can tell that I'm ""in game"" but it's like all the individual units and letters have zero resolution.   Another weird thing is that I've tried to take a screen shot of it, but when I look at the image it just my usual desktop background, like it's not registering that there is a program opened.   I've read that turning off anti-aliasing might help but I don't know how to do that from the computer's control panel and the in-game graphics options are, as with everything else, unreadable. I'm not sure if there's anything else I can do, hopefully it will be fixed by the time it's in the ""finished"" state because this game looks right up my alley."
4Xgaming,2ttl33,SirLafayette,5,Tue Jan 27 08:04:59 2015 UTC,"Sins of a solar empire.  It isnt centered around this, but you have very expensive limited capital ships, 'They are very powerful and have upgrade-able abilities They are specialised for their role, support, carrier, firepower, and the AI generally has one or a few accompanying their fleets, You have a maximum number of ships you can have at a given ""tier"" different types of ships use different ammounts of points, Capital ships use a huge chunk of these points, so fielding them means you will have much fewer small ships.  Beyond that its a good game, and well worth whatever price whoever decides to charge you for it. Check some video's and see if its something you'd enjoy."

Also, a hero levelled for administrative duties and combat will never be as powerful as a pure tactician.  It's not an uber-unit like a Gundam, but it adds tons of character to combat. Especially when two powerful admirals with big fleets are squaring off.  It's not anime, but it's very fun."

4Xgaming,2ttl33,wormspeaker,0,Tue Jan 27 17:27:04 2015 UTC,EVE is 4x for sure; You explore wormholes. You expand your corp/territory. You exploit the other players/corps. You exterminate everyone who disturbs you.  And it is a strategy game too; It's all numbers vs numbers. Spreadsheet vs spreadsheet. And since you can play the entire game by trading commodities on the stations you could say it's a strategy simulator market game; it has been used for economy studies a few times after all.
4Xgaming,2ttl33,Uloldodok,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"""4X"" and ""Strategy Game"" have some specific meanings in regards to video games. Eve definitely has the ""four exes"" and it definitely has strategy, but it's still not the same as what OP is asking for.  It's not to say that EVE isn't a good game, but it's just not what someone who wants to play a 4X or Strategy Game is looking for when they ask for those specific things."
4Xgaming,2ttl33,wormspeaker,0,Mon Mar 16 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"Eve isn't what the OP is asking for, no, but it is a 4x MMO game and nothing can take that away; same way that it's a strategy game which nothing will be able to take away either.   I was only defending Eve as you said it was neither 4x nor strategy. That's the 2 major things that Eve is after all.  OP is looking for Sins of a Solar Empire-esque game with bigger emphasis on one-shot resources. I'm thinking that Homeworld might be a good shot with some mods."

I realize this is harsh, and that 15 sec isn't a long time... buuuuut when deciding if i want to watch an hour long youtube video, the first few seconds/minutes weigh heavily as a first impression.  To put it bluntly, if you can't get ""I thought this game first sucked, but then I was convinced to try it again"" out clearly, what hopes should I have for the rest of the video?  I also realize this is basically a ""i'm sitting down with this game for the first time and this is my raw reaction to it"" - but that can be quite hard to pull off if you're not used to playing a game and commenting on it at the same time.  The video game reviewers / streamers I tend to prefer (like totalbiscuit) tend to save this sort of thing for their stream, but re-record and compose a more final product (even if it's a first-impression) when posting a video to youtube.

""Tactical"" would be setting up the positions of your fleet and executing a strategy that maximized your ships advantages and minimized their disadvantages.   A real basic example; if the enemy used primarily beam weapons and heavy armor,  a tactical system would let you move short range beam-shielded gunboats in close to absorb the shots while longer range but unshielded missile boats attack from the rear or flanks.  I understand it's Beta, but this advertisement doesn't get me excited about the potential product at all."
4Xgaming,2tc2li,Ranger33,2,Fri Jan 23 12:33:44 2015 UTC,"Look carefully, it totally is just a flashy way to slap hit points. There was no friendly fire, no weapon arcs, no different sections or armor.  This is just auto resolve in motion.

They had armor matrices in 4 quadrants, turrets of different sizes tracked at different speeds.  You could blow off weapons or whole ships sections. The list goes on.  Most other games just give their ships ""hit points"" or even 3 flavors of hitpoints (crew, structure, armor, +shields).  I agree SOTS2 was a trainwreck when it was released, but the game still pushed the benchmark for 3D ship combat in a 4x game.  It is my hope other developers pick up the torch as well, because its no longer 1996, MOO2 combat is not enough for me anymore."

4Xgaming,2tc2li,trancedellic,2,Fri Jan 23 05:14:10 2015 UTC,"I second this motion.  I thought the limited control you could exert in Endless Space was a great idea. As supreme overlord of your empire you're not actually able to command individual ships. Its beneath you. You can, however, dictate policy to your admirals. Engage cautiously, aggressively, avoid battle, etc. These would impact how your fleets behaved in battle without much micromanagement.  The other thing of concern is how do ships target?  I really hated the simplistic targeting on GalCiv2. Every ship would always fire at the same target. Damage was not spread throughout a fleet. Ships were focus fired down one at a time. This meant that attrition based warfare was impossible. Ships were all or nothing. Either they won or they were dead. How many hitpoints a ship had was irrelevant because it was focus fired on. The most efficient design was to build ""fleets"" of only 1 ship each. This ship had no defenses and as few hitpoints as you could manage. As much hull tonnage as possible was devoted to weapons. All weapons, only weapons, and nothing else.  (Edit: More info here: http://galciv.wikia.com/wiki/Ship_design_strategies#Ship_design_with_new_combat_rules_of_Dark_Avatar )  I really didn't like that system.  Ships should not focus fire. No navy in the world has ever done that. Yes, a navy would like to be able to do that, but the enemy doesn't cooperate. Ships maneuver, targeting gets jammed or is unclear, weapons miss. Things happen. Actual battle is a clusterfuck of target mis-identification and rounds that land nowhere near their target.  Ships engaging targets essentially at random would allow damage to be spread more evenly across a fleet. This means that a fleet might end battle with its ships intact, but many ships heavily damaged. Still alive, but badly damaged. Get thee to spacedock for repairs ASAP. This makes tactics and strategy both more interesting.  GalCiv2's 1hp glass cannon wonder tactic was the worst part of an otherwise brilliant game."
4Xgaming,2tc2li,vampatori,1 point,Thu Jan 22 23:11:44 2015 UTC,"Ships should not focus fire. [etc.]   I disagree. This is not modern-day navy. Ships in game have lasers (or other beams weapons) and computer targeting systems. It works differently than modern-day weapons, even rail guns."
4Xgaming,2tc2li,bananenbaron,1 point,Fri Jan 23 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"Even during WWII, ships had mechanical targeting computers to plot firing trajectories. Ships and aircraft were routinely tracked with radar.  Despite this, battle was inevitably a maelstrom of confusion and mistakes.  Combat always goes this way. No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy. Giving ships perfect targeting accuracy is unrealistic. This just doesn't happen.  What is much more realistic is ships engaging the most convenient target available at that time.   In gameplay terms, this can be abstracted by simply having them fire at a randomly selected target within the firing arcs of their weapons. Each time the weapon is fired it picks a new random target out of the selection of possible targets. Bigger targets should be weighted more heavily than smaller targets. Its easier to hit a carrier than a frigate. But gunners will still use their own initiative. In the confusion of battle different gunners on different ships with different weapon systems will end up engaging different things."

4Xgaming,2taxei,Hyndis,5,Fri Jan 23 06:35:01 2015 UTC,"Empire at War was a favorite of mine. The game is also easily moddable as it is based heavily on xml files.  Its turn based, but once combat engages it turns into an RTS, albeit with limited units. You only have the units you brought to battle. If your unit survives battle you retain it afterwards. If it dies in battle then you lose that unit. But during battle things behave like an RTS, albeit one where you cannot build anything new. This is much like the Total War games.  This game is also unique in that spacecraft have hardpoints. A Star Destroyer isn't just one block of HP. It doesn't have full performance until it reaches 0 HP, at which point it explodes. Instead every system is a hardpoint.  Its shield generators are a hardpoint. Engines are a hardpoint. Weapons are hardpoints. Systems can be picked off one at a time, and each destroyed system reduces a ship's functions. Want to stop a ship from firing its ion cannons? Target the ion cannons. Blow them up and its not shooting its ion cannons anymore. Shield stopping your proton torpedoes? Hit those shield generators. Want to stop the ship dead in space? Hit the engines.  Only when a ship lost all subsystems was it destroyed.  Ships also blew up in chunks. As hardpoints were lost, pieces of the ship would be blasted free and these chunks of debris would float around in orbit of whatever planet you were fighting over.  Ground battles were, in my view, less interesting than space battles, but still enjoyable.  Also the Super Star Destroyer is awesome to behold. This single ship takes up about a quarter of the entire map. By itself. Yes, its that big. And it is glorious.  I highly recommend Empire at War."
4Xgaming,2taxei,Turambar87,3,Thu Jan 22 23:16:51 2015 UTC,I did not know Empire at War had mods.  That changes everything.

Ultimate Empire at War is also pretty damn good.  If you are crazy, there is one I recommend to at least try over all the others, and that is Steiners Advance Unit Mod. It adds so many units and it increases number of hardpoints on ships significantly (frigates in EaW have something like 5, this ups it up to 10-15), making the space battles more epic beyond just the massive amount of units. Ground battles also become more interesting in a few cases as they also up the amount of infantry in a squad, so you have much larger scale ground battles. Warning, may be partially in German still, haven't kept up on the updates so they may have fixed it."

4Xgaming,2taff0,roninmuffins,1 point,Thu Jan 22 21:27:26 2015 UTC,"but I've heard you can do some really vicious things micromanaging fleet combat if you want to.   You can, but while you spent 10min microing your forces to victory, I built up my economy and have dozens more coming at you...all while gaining an ever increasing income.  Basically, if you are microing, you are doing it wrong."
4Xgaming,2taff0,pocketknifeMT,2,Sat Jan 24 00:17:38 2015 UTC,"This game. Excellent expansions and a stand-alone expansion (Rebellion) were made. Good mix of planetary management and rock-paper-scissors fleet mechanics. Everything is real-time and you can zoom out from fighters to your entire empire. Really exciting mod community (I prefer the Star Wars mods in SINS over Homeworld 2 anyday). Playing Empire at War after playing through the Sins mod-scene was actually a downgrade for me.   Get rebellion. Play through the vanilla game. Then try a couple of the awesome mods. I played Sins of a Galactic Empire, but there are quite a few popular mods out there."
4Xgaming,2taff0,michael_jk,2,Thu Jan 22 22:28:25 2015 UTC,"SoaSE is more of a higher level macro management game. Yes, you can micromanage, but this won't win an impossible battle.  You win by having the right ships in the right combination at the right place in the right time.  If you get the right fleet in the right place in the right time, battles take care of themselves. If you don't have the right fleet you're pretty well screwed. Micromanagement might save you, but prospects are iffy at best. The game doesn't require any micromanagement at all.  Combat is also slow. Ships have a lot of hitpoints and do little damage. This isn't Starcraft where units die instantly.   Its entirely possible to play SoaSE WWI style, where empires are continually throwing endless reinforcements that slowly die in the meat grinder around some godforsaken barren asteroid, with neither side willing to give ground. And this meatgrinder might continue on for hours at a time, uninterrupted, until one side finally is exhausted."

4Xgaming,2taff0,andreasn2,3,Thu Jan 22 19:11:01 2015 UTC,I also think That fits what your wanting quite well and it's an amazing game. the tactical combat isn't super deep though.
4Xgaming,2taff0,roninmuffins,3,Thu Jan 22 20:34:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that I would agree. I think there's a bit of depth there, elevation, flanking, morale, positioning all make a difference. That said, it seems like the strategic element takes precedence under most circumstances. An evenly matched fight would definitely go to whoever has a better tactical understanding, but if you're giving someone a fair fight, it means you've probably made a strategic error in the first place."
4Xgaming,2taff0,Hyndis,2,Thu Jan 22 21:23:22 2015 UTC,"My only problem with Endless Legend is the AI. The AI is as dumb as a sack of rocks.  AI armies tend to be only the same unit spammed infinitely. If the AI likes building infantry then I'll build the infantry counter. All of its armies will fall to my units because all of their armies are the same.  I heard that this was a problem being looked at by Amplitude Studios, though I'm unaware of any recent patch. Maybe this has been patched, but during my play of this game about a month ago the AI was pretty stupid."

4Xgaming,2taff0,jayman601,1 point,Thu Jan 22 16:09:04 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on Sins, I just feel like it's too basic. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it but found it to be a little too simplistic to keep me playing game after game after game (replayability is a big thing in strategy games for me).   Limited differences between the three races, limited number of ship types, limited number of planetary development options, limited number of diplomatic options, limited number of phaselane combinations... There's only so many games you can play before every one is the same as the one before. It's fun but it just leaves me wanting more.   The first 4x game I ever played (besides SC and AoE) is still my favorite: Imperium Galactica 2. It's more complex than Sins, where I felt compelled to micromanage every single aspect of my empire. But it's not as vast Distant Worlds, which felt like all I was doing was making selections on different empire management windows.   It's got a huge tech tree, customizable ships, tactical fleet based combat and ground combat, even planetary development to the extent of a simplified SimCity. It's got a huge map where you're not limited to phaselanes, and even though there are only 3 playable races like Sins, there several more AI-only races, so the galaxy does feel more full, like in Distant Worlds. And there is even a legitimate story that unfolds as your go through the single player campaign, so your not just playing random scenarios.   If you don't mind playing a 15+ year old game, give this one a shot; you sound like you've got the same tastes as I do, and I love this game. I've been looking for a modern-day successor, but have yet to find one that hits all of the right points. I just got Star Ruler 2, which looked promising, but the graphics aren't optimized to my laptop and it's unplayable for me. If anyone else has any suggestions, I'd be glad to hear them."

Want your cannons to be rifles or machine-guns? If you can survive to close the range with nimble maneuvering or heavy armor, kinetic-style weapons are great rapid-fire, low-accuracy ventilators. Want more shields to defend against beams, or flak to counter fighters and missles? Make the right decisions!  Want your heroes as governors or admirals? An admiral can make for a flashy, glorious battle, but a governor will boost production in a star system.  Endless Space is what the doctor ordered. I'm on my second game this week and it's a Tuesday.  Also, the skill tree makes it feel like alternate victory conditions can still be met, even if your original plan falls through. It's goood."

Combat not working as it should e.g. just tried combat again. The last remaining troop could not move and neither the enemy could do anything. I skipped 20 turns still both my troop is stuck and the same with the enemy and the worse thing is that we were both in melee range, so its not that the enemy could not figure out how to reach me. My troops did not respond to any commands at all."

4Xgaming,2sxlo5,Jellye,13,Mon Jan 19 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"I know this is the standard for Space Strategy games, but those completely-flat-2D hexagonal space maps always turn me off.  The floating ""bonus resources"" in the void of space also are a bit of an immersion breaker for me in this style of game.  I don't know, controlling space ships as a hex-grid game doesn't feel right for me. The idea that ships can so easily bump into each ""by accident"" or that evading an enemy ship would require taking a side-step is way too weird and makes it feel more like a naval game than a space game.  But a full 3d map and controls would also be quite unwieldy (I'm looking at you, SotS, your map gives me headaches).  I think at the end of the day I prefer the ""phase-lines"" style of Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire, as it allows for you to have a sense of depth in the visuals, and to have a valid excuse of how ships would actually get close enough to fight each other in the vastness of space (i.e.: they can't actually free travel around said vastness)."
4Xgaming,2sxlo5,Zoogy,3,Mon Jan 19 16:54:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I really hate the 2D hex space maps too. I understand back when space 4x games were really big you needed to make the map out 2D hexs but these days even somewhat old low end computers can handle 3D maps. By not doing a 3D map you are missing one of the big advantages a space 4X game has over a 4X game on a planet.
4Xgaming,2sxlo5,topher_r,5,Tue Jan 20 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"I'm curious what a 3D map would add to the gameplay that you don't have in a 2D map.  For example in 2D you can have flanking, which is fundamentally being attacked from different axes. In 3D this same concept exists, just with more axes. As a concept though you didn't gain it, you just made it more complicated to represent and understand."
4Xgaming,2sxlo5,Jellye,3,Tue Jan 20 02:30:58 2015 UTC,"The very idea of ""flanking"" and ""maneuvering"" in space combat sounds like something quite silly for me, for instance - space is way too vast, having two ships close enough for them to fire at each other shouldn't even be common in the first place unless they're orbiting the same astral body in low-orbit or something like that. Having ships needing to perform routes ""around"" other ships is downright silly, for me.  A free fully-3D map with proper scale would mean that ships would pretty much never fight each other in the interplanetary void, even less in-between stars.  But, as I mentioned, I personally prefer the ""phase lines"" style of space games: they allow for you to have 3D visuals (with basically still a 2D gameplay) and give us an excuse for why ships can still bump into each other, so that we may still have space fights, manuevering and such."
4Xgaming,2sxlo5,SadisticBuddha,3,Tue Jan 20 02:49:34 2015 UTC,Endless Space's lanes were my favourite aspect of conflict and exploration in that game.   It really made it feel like a vast largely empty universe with a few hubs of activity across the stars.  It added in layers of strategy where you actually had a system that the enemy has to break through before the rest of your Empire is exposed.   I could go on and on about what the lanes do to change the way the game plays but the point would be that ES nailed it and I think that a space game with hexes will just be weak both thematically and mechanically.

And with a number of great mods for all of these titles should scratch your itch for a good few years or so."
4Xgaming,2sxa75,MarkoffChaneyIII,1 point,Mon Jan 19 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"Indeed, most historical games are in the Grand Strategy genre instead of 4X.  The already mentioned Paradox Interactive games are the best of them, for me, but it's also worth mentioning the Total War series (which seem to suffer from some prejudice from both the 4X community and the Grand Strategy community, but they are actually pretty good games).  The Hegemony series is also somewhat rich in historical feeling and it seems that historical detail (I can't attest to it, as I'm no expert in the historical period of either Hegemony game). I'm not sure exactly how I would classify their genre: they play like a real-time Total War game without transitions between the campaign map and the battles, and with a much bigger focus on logistics and supply lines."

There's also Marbozir. He has many in-depth videos on some of the more popular 4X like Civilization 5 and Endless Legend.   There are other letsplayers like Quill18 or Northernlion but they aren't focused on guide. Keep in mind though that the guys I've listed do not make specific ""tutorial"" videos, they play the game and explain everything they do after brief introduction. It'd take several hours to watch the whole game but you'd be guided through most of gameplay mechanics.  Also small advice in case you want some bridge between AoE2 and 4X genre: get Rise of Nations. It's sort of AoE2 but bigger and deeper making it look like Civilization.  Another advice: get Civilization 5 with all addons (it's sold for couple of bucks on Steam often including RIGHT NOW SO GO AND GET IT. And also get Civilization 4, it has great mods and it's still a great though different game). Don't turn off advice in options (set it to New Player or something) and start a game on Settler difficulty. You'll probably even win though you'll make some mistakes. Then get to a difficulty 3 if you feel like it. Then up it with each win. By the time you get to Emperor you'll master and enjoy this game and will understand the genre as a whole."

4Xgaming,2swnij,ran88dom99,1 point,Mon Jan 19 11:34:10 2015 UTC,It has 2 addons which is almost all content you need. It's tons of content with many civilizations and custom scenarios - and you can have hundreds of hours put into game without playing any scenarios and only mastering several civilizations. I think it has all civilizations and scenarios but lacks couple of DLCs that make believable continental maps. I never bought those myself and wouldn't worry about it.  Note that your CD will probably still connect to Steam to download patches.

4Xgaming,2srkvr,danknerd,2,Sun Jan 18 05:38:38 2015 UTC,Is it that kind of error ? https://i.imgur.com/IxbAfj2.png Or is it during the installer ? just after ? Do you have installed MSVC2010 during the installation (ticked by default) ?  You can try this installer: http://sourceforge.net/projects/anewdawn/files/A%20New%20Dawn%202/and2_full_installer_rev868.exe/download It is the same as online but already contains all the files (so no need to download anything else).

4Xgaming,2smwsu,Amarice,2,Sat Jan 17 20:53:42 2015 UTC,"Last time I saw someone at Paradox mentioning it, they said that they didn't really had anything to change in Victoria for now - and they don't want to make a new game that's just a graphical overhaul.  Personally, I think they do know some things that would need to be improved, but haven't really had any conclusive ideia on the best approach for those issues. I wouldn't be surprised to see an announcement regarding Vicky3 later this year or perhaps in the next one."
4Xgaming,2smwsu,Jellye,5,Sat Jan 17 21:27:37 2015 UTC,Why sigh?  Just curious.  I love space 4x games :)
4Xgaming,2smwsu,jimmahdean,13,Fri Jan 16 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"Favorite game series of all time is Civilization. But I feel like there hasn't been a lot of innovation over the years, by comparison to other 4x genres (like space and magic). The reason is: There is literally ZERO competition.  There is not, nor has there ever been, another 4x game that has you guide a civilization from the first caveman settlements all the way up to the modern era and beyond. This franchise is one-of-a-kind.  I love the long game evolution of an entire society, but would love to see how a different developer approaches the same concept. (Just look at the crazy variety among space colony sims)."
4Xgaming,2smwsu,Maclimes,4,Fri Jan 16 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"Oohhh I totally get that. I really want a space game that goes from nothing to empire similar to how civilization, and while most of them do, it's too quick. Like, you just get started in space, you shouldn't be building long range interstellar scouts and colony ships, you should be exploring your solar system for resources and researching long range travel and colonization later."
4Xgaming,2smwsu,jimmahdean,13,Fri Jan 16 17:33:02 2015 UTC,"My ultimate dream? I'd like to see a game that embraces a sort of ""Spore-like"" series of stages (except with less sucking).  Start with ""Tribal"", in which you control a group of new humans as they begin to explore and interact. You would control individual citizens (hunters, bakers, etc), assigning them on a very micro level. It would play similar to almost a small-scale city sim. All other tribes you interact with would be culturally and geographically similar (so if you chose to play as, for example, the Zulu, you would be encountering other African tribes).  -Advancement to the next stage is achieved by uniting all local tribes under your national banner, either through military conquest, enslavement, bribery, or social superiority.   Then you evolve into the ""Empire"" stage. Things go a bit more macro at this stage, and you are now basically playing a truncated version of Civilization, including wars and colonization of other continents. Your opponents would be cultures from all over the globe.  -Advancement to the next stage is achieved by establishing dominance of the planet (via military, social, diplomatic, or scientific superiority).  Finally, you evolve into the ""Galactic"" stage. Things go even more macro at this point, similar to a space sim. You start off colonizing your local solar system, but begin exploring outward, encountering alien life, and dominating them.  The basic idea is that as you advance to a larger level, you don't have to micro-manage as much anymore, because that stuff has been abstracted."
4Xgaming,2smwsu,Maclimes,8,Fri Jan 16 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, you just want what Spore was supposed to be."
4Xgaming,2smwsu,bduddy,5,Fri Jan 16 22:02:02 2015 UTC,"No, I ... Well okay, yes, I do.  But this is something different. Spore would be creating your own species.  In my ""dream game"", you would be playing as humans in a historical setting based on real tribes/cultures/nations."
4Xgaming,2smwsu,Maclimes,3,Fri Jan 16 22:11:06 2015 UTC,Aurora
4Xgaming,2smwsu,ran88dom99,2,Fri Jan 16 17:43:57 2015 UTC,"I tried to like this game, I really did. I just can't stand the limited mineral presence. I like the idea, but I'd rather have simple minerals on your starting planet and you need to explore to get advanced ones for better techs/ships.  I couldn't get around the stress that the limited minerals gave me.  Also, the promise of game breaking bugs as the game progress doesn't help."
4Xgaming,2smwsu,jimmahdean,2,Fri Jan 16 17:46:48 2015 UTC,Like Distant Worlds?  Predestination is also looking that way but I've not seen a lot of it. Star Ruler 2 was also talking about developing faster than light technologies so I'm assuming you start with none.  Or are you saying you want to start as a caveman and much later explore space?
4Xgaming,2smwsu,MegaGrubby,1 point,Fri Jan 16 22:56:51 2015 UTC,"Distant Worlds is okay, I just think there should be more between pre-FTL and post-FTL. I haven't looked into predestination, never heard of it, actually.   Or are you saying you want to start as a caveman and much later explore space?   I'm saying I want to start at like year 2025, where you're just starting to have a solid space program going, maybe some mining ships and scanning and all that good stuff."

Oh boy I was so disappointed when he revealed his newest project: a mobile game with micro-transactions. Mehmehmehmeh.  Firaxis is (or will be) working on Civ VI for sure, but sadly I won't count on any real innovation from them.  I secretly hope that Stardock is working on a non-fantasy and non-SF 4X game. But frankly, it's not very likely."
4Xgaming,2smwsu,Eraser1024,4,Fri Jan 16 20:14:56 2015 UTC,"Odds are Civ 6 is announced either this year or next, so there's that.  They will not stick too long with BE, maybe an expansion or two tops."
4Xgaming,2smwsu,runetrantor,2,Sat Jan 17 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"I think no one wants to compete with the goliath that is civilization.  What could I, a humble developer, do involving cavemen and muskets and nukes that firaxis hasn't done ten times better over the years?  At least with space and fantasy, you can carve out your own geo political and technological realities."

4Xgaming,2snu3i,Paranatural,3,Fri Jan 16 20:02:56 2015 UTC,For $5 I think it's worth a buy. Frankly it's no Endless Legend or anything but it's an acceptable little time waster. The management stuff is pretty easy/formulaic and combat's not very in-depth either.

4Xgaming,2sju08,Reliant,10,Thu Jan 15 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"Biggest issue, to me, wasn't the lack of features or the lack of endgame or just general laziness in design (which are present but I could deal with), it's the clear lack of soul.  The different starting civilizations don't even have an explanation or splash screen when you're starting your first game, no attempt to give them personality whatsoever, they're the most boring and fucking lifeless options I've ever seen and are basically interchangeable except for a few traits and a couple that have SLIGHTLY more personality than the others (like the religious fanatics).  Though I can't seem to get past the early game, I'm actually having more fun with Pandora than I did with BE.  My issue seems to be not know when to expand vs build up military in the very early game, because apparently you really NEED a military early on... anyway, Pandora at least has a bit of personality and snarkiness/humor to it.  BE is like it was made by a committee of high school principals or something, it is the most inoffensive and bland product I've played since Skylanders at my little cousin's."
4Xgaming,2sju08,FalseTautology,1 point,Fri Jan 16 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"Oh man. The tech quotes in BE honestly made me cringe. Every time you research a technology, you are forced to confront the fact that someone was paid to write these, then pass them on to someone who was paid to voice them, then pass that on to someone who was paid to QA it all."
4Xgaming,2sju08,MilesBeyond250,1 point,Fri Jan 16 16:25:08 2015 UTC,I think thats been exactly my experience as well.  No real difference between factions.  The different endings are just about having 3 flavors of science victories etc...  Trying to put in a narrative through quests doesn't work well.  Most of the game I feel I just spend a ton of time choosing different bonuses and usually there is almost ALWAYS a clearly better choice.  Maybe they can pull it back with good expansions.  Either way I can wait.
4Xgaming,2sju08,FiveDogNight,16,Sun Jan 18 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this game sucks. I regret paying money for it. It's basically a mod of Civ 5.  The factions are indistinguishable, the alien fauna are basically barbarians.  While it's free for this weekend, I urge you not to waste your time.  Play Alpha Centauri instead."
4Xgaming,2sju08,sirboozebum,4,Thu Jan 15 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not very impressed with this game unfortunately.  I pre-ordered because I really liked Civ V BNW and wanted to support firaxis.  Never again."
4Xgaming,2sju08,Pires007,3,Thu Jan 15 22:41:29 2015 UTC,Civ 5 Mod is still probably worth $15-$20 to me...then again I'll play this weekend and probably get my fill.

If the civ5backbone wasn't so strong, this game would crumple into a pile of mediocrity.  I love firaxis games, but their new style of games may be too streamlined for me 😢 (like new Xcom for example)"
4Xgaming,2sju08,FiveDogNight,6,Sun Jan 18 10:51:51 2015 UTC,"I found this excerpt at wikipedia.org interesting:  ""Meier is not always the main designer on titles that carry his name. For instance, Brian Reynolds has been credited as the primary designer behind Sid Meier's Civilization II, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, and Sid Meier's Colonization,[9][10] while Jeff Briggs designed Sid Meier's Civilization III, Soren Johnson led Sid Meier's Civilization IV, Jon Shafer led Sid Meier's Civilization V and Will Miller and David McDonough were the designers of Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth"""
4Xgaming,2sju08,MegaGrubby,7,Fri Jan 16 01:16:06 2015 UTC,Also interesting for the 4x genre: Not a single person developing Galactic Civilizations 3 has ever worked on GalCiv 1 or 2.

4Xgaming,2sju08,skeeto,5,Fri Jan 16 15:42:48 2015 UTC,I'm expecting it to follow the same pattern as the Civ games before it. The initial release is just a mediocre title not at all worth the cost. But two expansions and a couple of years of polishing and it becomes one of the greatest strategy games ever.
4Xgaming,2sju08,Benthetraveler,3,Fri Jan 16 01:55:02 2015 UTC,If this was there plan they wouldn't discount it for -40%. This is another colonization.
4Xgaming,2sju08,goldenspiderduck,2,Fri Jan 16 07:21:15 2015 UTC,That's a pretty crazy thing to say about what is more or less analogous to Civ 4: Colonization (a game built on the current engine but modified enough to be its own game.)
4Xgaming,2sju08,combatwombat-,4,Fri Jan 16 02:25:12 2015 UTC,Game is shallow as fuck. Give it five expansions and it may be worth playing. Got two hours in and just about blew my brains out from boredom.
4Xgaming,2sju08,lemeure,2,Fri Jan 16 02:50:50 2015 UTC,"in its current state, yeah, but the faction system is unique and with the inevitable expansions, it might be a game that could live up to the Civilization name.  Still that's no excuse for releasing such a bland game at launch."
4Xgaming,2sju08,SadisticBuddha,2,Fri Jan 16 00:57:25 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Endless Legend and Endless Space have better faction systems. Beyond Earth doesn't do anything special with their faction system.  They don't really succeed in making the different factions different, even if you heavily dilute what the race does in either Endless Game, they still have their races affinity to root what their units and core abilities are and are fundamentally different.   I'm probably not gonna pick up Beyond Earth again, I doubt a good expansion can revive this game without changing it pretty fundamentally."
4Xgaming,2sju08,lemeure,2,Fri Jan 16 09:21:45 2015 UTC,"ok, well I don't really have a place to come from related to faction systems in 4x games, since i have yet to pickup endless legend, I decided upon civ BE since most of my friends picked it up around release and we got a few good weekends out of it.  the factions in BE look different, and use different resources, but that is where the differences end, they still play relatively the same.  I guess in EL they play differently, or have more depth that civ lacks,  ill find out as soon as it goes on sale."

Also the tech in Endless was boring, and I much prefer the spell of Warlock.  Only played one Endless campaign though, so maybe I should give it another shot."

4Xgaming,2si1g3,cwilsons,11,Thu Jan 15 09:27:18 2015 UTC,"One issue that plays into this, mentioned in a Firaxis interview a while back, is how testing influences game design...  The programmers/project managers/testers spend a lot of time firing up new games, trying different settings, and re-re-re-playing the early game.  Late game, though? Not so much.  One side is getting a lot more attention.    Civ: Beyond Earth gives a decent example of that.  The first hundred turns are full of decisions, events, quests, surprises, and challenges.   The last 30-60 turns are just pressing 'next turn' followed by a ""You did it, brosef!"" pop-up window."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,_pupil_,2,Thu Jan 15 17:06:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as much as I love the genre I do tend to find consolidating the victory and just wiping the floor with the last remnants of the enemy factions can be tedious.  As such I've often left many a game where it's clear that the opponent isn't coming back but where I don't wish to actually endure the tedium of the victory march over their last cities/planets.  I often love the fight and deciding who is gonna be the player who comes out on top. But I find the struggle and peril where you could lose doesn't last long enough.   I get other victories are available, but I'm just identifying the problem with supremacy victories in which it's so tedious to actually get the game to say ""YEAH YOU WIN!""  When I'm not aiming for military victories I often have more fun, my friends always try and tank my economy as much as possible as I love the economic victory.  To me, the pain of waiting to be squished or being the squisher needs a better pace than the classic swing either way that happens in most games. I wouldn't want the rubberbanding suggested by the article but I would appreciate the death of an empire being more of a struggle in 4x games.  This does relate to what you're saying about the first 100 turns being the most interesting then the victory march of a game just being the tedious eternity of ""Turn, ok, turn, ok, turn, ok..."" where you've won but there is no late game threat to you."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,SadisticBuddha,0,Sun Jan 18 03:57:37 2015 UTC,"This is more lazy/newbie/profit oriented game design than a consequence of testing IMO. I mean, I wouldn't put the fact that late-game is under-designed and under-tested on the shoulders of the testers."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,crasher_pt,4,Thu Jan 15 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to intimate that it's a Q&A issue (ie testing), apologies, but all pre-release game time - play testing, if you will.   It's not so much that the testers are dropping the ball, or poor processes, but rather that during development (when intricate mid and late-game systems aren't in place or finalized), the focus is going to gravitate towards startup rather than the tail end of an epic 40+ hour game.  Most manual quality checks (particularly on the dev side), will involve firing up a new game and tooling around a little.  Major annoyances in that work-cycle will get terminated with prejudice.  Annoyances that only present deep into the game get postponed.  Lots of AAA titles in this space have suffered from it... Starcraft 2 also suffers from a form of this: the early focus on Terran  left gaping design problems with the other races and some matchups."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,_pupil_,6,Thu Jan 15 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"The problem is the more accurately you represent an empire in terms of economies of scale, the better it generally is to be larger.  Its like if a world super-power went up against a small island nation; wouldn't be a competition.    By trying to artificially prevent snowballing with mechanics, we just hobble the expansion element of 4x.  Generally I believe lackluster endgame is more an issue of AI.  Most AIs aren't playing to win, they are playing to be an effective speedbump for the player."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,FiveDogNight,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:14:40 2015 UTC,"By trying to artificially prevent snowballing with mechanics, we just hobble the expansion element of 4x.   In that case why is the game concerned about that conflict? Shouldn't the gameplay simply overlook it?"
4Xgaming,2si1g3,crasher_pt,1 point,Thu Jan 15 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is that by limiting expansion, designers are trying to minimize the effectiveness of colony/city spam.  Expanding more efficiently than your opponents tends to win most games, unless specifically stonewalled by things like ""happiness"" or ""corruption"" etc... (whatever a particular game cares to name it.)  However they should just embrace it, or come up with different mechanics instead."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,FiveDogNight,4,Sat Jan 17 04:24:05 2015 UTC,"The problem the article is talking about is just a reflection that the game doesn't scale.   Like any system, scaling issues are often neglected until they can't be swept under the rug. You need to address them from the start. Classic games like Civ and MoO which were great early and OK-ish late got a pass since there was no competing solution.  Recent iterations tried to address this by artificially limiting the scaling so that you never really grow to an unmanageable scale. Another solution is to radically change the gameplay, like being restricted to the use of governors, but the merit in this approach is IMO yet to be proven."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,crasher_pt,8,Thu Jan 15 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Games' tendencies to snowball as they progress suck. they should be more like Mario kart, where people who are doing worse get better power-ups."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,Introscopia,6,Thu Jan 15 13:25:52 2015 UTC,"where people who are doing worse get better power-ups.   I guess that depends on the focus you want to give to the game. In multiplayer it usually sucks to see a runaway leader whereas in single player you want to know ASAP if you have a shot at winning and don't want to lose much time mopping up.  Civ IV attempted an interesting half-way design with the vassal system. Though highly unlikely you could theoretically be half-conquered and still win the game later on if you played your cards right.  But to me the endgame fails not because of this but because of losing the exploration aspect. It essentially stops being a 4x when exploration stops. I lost count of the amount of games I stopped playing simply because exploration was done. Granted, it was also  because exploration revealed I was stuck with an unfavorable scenario, but I could have kept going if exploration hadn't stop."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,crasher_pt,4,Thu Jan 15 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"But to me the endgame fails not because of this but because of losing the exploration aspect. It essentially stops being a 4x when exploration stops.    Hmm, so imagine a game in the style of Throne World, Twilight Imperium, Eclipse (etc), where the goal of the game is essentially to control a capital planet in the center of the map.  ...but, since this is a computer game instead of a board game, there's no need to put a limit on how far out you can explore and settle.  That would establish a defined and limited end-game (become powerful enough to defeat the capital guardians, take it, and then hold it for X turns (or whatever) against everyone else), without ever requiring exploration to cease.  ...and you also get an obvious and easy ""how long should the game last?"" slider, which simply affects how powerful the center guardians are."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,visage,3,Thu Jan 15 17:27:12 2015 UTC,OK but that doesn't solve the scalability issue. You can still have too many elements to manage.
4Xgaming,2si1g3,crasher_pt,2,Thu Jan 15 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, it's entirely independent of that issue.  It's a reply to a particular comment, in which scalability does not seem to be a major point."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,visage,1 point,Thu Jan 15 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"That's a big one for me too, about the exploration. I imagine as we see more and more powerful computers we'll be able to play games that can handle much more vast maps, or infinite procedurally-generated maps that still manage to simulate everything you discover until a very late game."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,Introscopia,1 point,Thu Jan 15 17:30:19 2015 UTC,I think you could probably get by with a bit of randomness in stuff which is currently deterministic like research trees and map configuration.

I'm not even sure where to begin on something like that but would nonetheless love to see. Maybe have two seperate sections, one for theoretical research and another for practical applications (which is based on the the theoretical research), and be able to give grant money to each of them to attempt to increase their speed, though failures and success are randomly determined, though maybe influenced by the level of the theoretical research(es) it is taking from. Ex. Having a higher understanding of theoretical rocketry leads to a much easier time developing a simple rocket than having next to no theory developed and trying to invent one."

You'd have to ride the edge of present day survivability to acquire future game perks."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,Reineke,1 point,Thu Jan 15 22:23:45 2015 UTC,"Vicky 2, I would say, is probably the closest I've seen a game come to that. Your research rate is determined by your nation's level of education and amount of clergy - both things you can influence but not directly control - and it was divided into two areas: Technologies, which were, for the most part, theories which you would decide to research, and inventions, which were practical applications unlocked by technologies that could be randomly activated. You have complete control over which technologies you get, but only a slight ability to influence which inventions you get, and how quickly.  That being said, while I agree with you and think that the 4X standard tech-tree definitely pushes a sort of Enlightenment-era notion of human history as linear progress, I also think that it's hard to implement anything else in a way that makes for good gameplay. The advantage of the tech tree is that it allows the player to plan out their game in advance - it rewards people who are able to assess their situation, identify their needs, and respond accordingly.  The system you suggest I think would work, but only in a limited time-period game - i.e. most fantasy 4Xs, some sci-fi 4Xs and a few historical 4Xs. The reason why is that on a Civ-like scale, where higher tech levels correspond to substantially more powerful units, advances left to random chance can be very frustrating - e.g. Your swordsmen are being mowed down by the enemy riflemen because your scientists finding practical applications for saltpeter hasn't come up in the RNG.  However, in games on a smaller scale, where high tech tends to more provide nice bonuses rather than completely reshaping the way your cities and armies look and act, I think it could work great."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,MilesBeyond250,4,Fri Jan 16 01:35:12 2015 UTC,"they should be more like Mario kart, where people who are doing worse get better power-ups.   That sounds terrible for MP 4X. Just allow players to hand themselves over to the AI when they have fallen far enough behind not have fun or learn anything by continuing and the problem is solved.  In a 4 minute social game, like Mario Kart, it makes total sense to fudge things to keep everyone interested. In a complex game that can last days, weeks, or even months, not so much."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,arstin,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:39:58 2015 UTC,"Right. I totally agree. By nature in a big strategy game the winner wins before the end because the only dis/advantages you have with relation to the other players are those you make for yourself as the game goes on, so the 'mopping up' phase is part of the flow of the game."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,Introscopia,5,Thu Jan 15 22:03:53 2015 UTC,"Perhaps those who are doing poorly should have advantages in the way that partisans have advantages above and beyond those of an organized army?

4Xgaming,2si1g3,Eviljim,2,Thu Jan 15 14:53:13 2015 UTC,This was done in Civ IV with the Vassal system but it was highly penalizing for the vassal it seldom allowed you to come back up.
4Xgaming,2si1g3,crasher_pt,3,Thu Jan 15 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"There have been steps in this direction in a fair number of 4X games.  For example, the way in Civilization that research costs and happiness penalties grow rapidly with the number of cities a civilization has.  It would be neat to see more mechanics in that vein."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,Law_Student,2,Thu Jan 15 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"Eh, the Civ 5 way is a very poor way of limiting expansion, because cities are always profitable no matter where you place them. You have increases to research and culture but when it comes to war, the large empire will always win regardless because production costs don't increase and because the differences in unit strength are negligible when you spit them out enmass.  Civ 4 did it right, you could expand as much as you want but each city cost you maintenance, you had to make sure that city was in a good spot because it's going to cut into your research and finances for quite a while until it grows. It didn't increase your research costs but instead decrease your research potential, which is much better. It becomes a serious strategic decison, because some cities will simply never be profitable, and must fulfill some other purpose for you or they are worthless. Tundras are often barren for a long while in many Civ 4 games unless they have resources where as in Civ 5 cities are always profitable and will also always produce more money than maintenance and happiness than unhappiness because of buildings.  Cities in Civ 5 are a immediate slap on the wrist and then straight profit and growth, cities in Civ 4 are a long-term investment that costs you at first. It also limits your range and number of cities even more by increasing maintenance as you get farther from your capital and getting more expensive the more cities you have. You have to make sure each city after the next is more profitable than the last, which is extremely hard to do and manage."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,KaiserTom,0,Thu Jan 15 20:47:13 2015 UTC,"There's definitely room for exploration in improving mechanics in this vein, and I agree with your analysis."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,Law_Student,2,Fri Jan 16 00:07:44 2015 UTC,"Power ups for people at the back? Yes.  Rubber band AI that get super bonuses to always stay on your tail? No, I should still be allowed to dominate if I do sufficiently well, not have the ai be given a full army from thin air to suddenly be on my level and it becomes a boring thing because no matter how good you are, the game will not let you steamroll it."

I don't think that's what he meant either, it's always gonna be something the player is aware about and it makes sense within the game.   But me personally, I think the steamrolling is part of the nature of things..."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,Introscopia,2,Thu Jan 15 22:00:46 2015 UTC,"Why every single 4X game needs at least an option for some form of Domination victory, IMHO. Once the player's number of cities/planets, soldiers, techs, economy, and/or any combination thereof reaches a certain % above the rest of the players, the game ends and they win.   The Warlords series had this and it was great. Civ 3 and 4 had it as well (I'm really not clear on why it was swapped out with taking all capitals in Civ V and BE). It's especially helpful in multiplayer games - in singleplayer you can just say ""Well, I've pretty much won. I'll just start a new game"" but you can't really do that against other humans (well, you can, but...).   The trick is making the condition low enough that it can be achieved without dragging on the game too much, but high enough that it can't be cheesed."
4Xgaming,2si1g3,MilesBeyond250,2,Fri Jan 16 01:44:08 2015 UTC,"I hate the ""taking capitals"" method of domination. It feels weirdly arbitrary. I'd prefer a ""control X% of the world's population or land mass"" style victory."

It works, but for games that are so complex and varied, this is pretty limiting. I don't have any solutions. I wish I did, but I'm not a game designer. I thought quests were a cool way to give you motivation throughout the whole game. And bigger quests more like Endless Legend than Civ: Beyond Earth quests. But they should be applicable to any playthrough, not just a ""quest"" playthrough. Archeology is a great way to keep building toward a cultural victory in end-game. But it's still not perfect as a permanently engaging system. But I think the idea of a goal to work toward is ideal."

4Xgaming,2sefyl,Soverayne,7,Wed Jan 14 14:11:42 2015 UTC,"People grow and change. I certainly have. StarDrive 2 clearly reflects the growth of my development skills. If you didn't like the first game, then I hope you keep in mind that there is middle ground between people who perpetuate this narrative that StarDrive was an unfinished mess and between people who loved the shit out of StarDrive. Both exist in fairly large numbers but I think there are a lot more in between who thought SD was ok, and they'll give this a fair shot when the time comes.  Just keep an open mind and check out the reviews. I'm convinced that we've got something special cooking here. Those dudes at PC Gamer are no hacks and they seemed to really like what I've got going."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,zer0sumgames,4,Wed Jan 14 22:06:01 2015 UTC,Good luck with your game. I'll make sure to check out the reviews and some Let's Play's.  I'd like you to change my mind about the game ;)
4Xgaming,2sefyl,Haekel,2,Wed Jan 14 23:44:01 2015 UTC,I loved the first one. Building your own ships! Awesome!   I look forward to the new one!
4Xgaming,2sefyl,aaron2610,1 point,Thu Jan 15 00:20:26 2015 UTC,/u/zer0sumgames will you address the 33% off coupon for prior owners?  Do you realize that most people who felt burnt by the previous game view this as a slap in the face?
4Xgaming,2sefyl,irrelevant_query,-1,Thu Jan 15 02:24:12 2015 UTC,What figure of discount do you feel doesn't constitute a slap in the face?
4Xgaming,2sefyl,cwilsons,0,Thu Jan 15 02:50:12 2015 UTC,"Very good point and it is subjective.  I can only speak for myself here obviously.  Steam games very commonly hit 50-75% off during any sale (though admittedly not brand new games or pre-orders), so for me to financially support this dev a 50% off would probably sway me to give it a shot.  Perhaps something like a 50% off the first week it is released for SD1 owners."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,irrelevant_query,-2,Thu Jan 15 02:59:01 2015 UTC,"Look, don't quote me here, because I'm not behind the scenes on this so I could easily be mistaken. But my understanding is that the loyalty discount is additive, not multiplicative to anything that Steam's doing.  So if you wanted 50% off, you could grab the game when it's on special for 20% off. If you feel that you should receive the game for free, then you'd have that option when the game's being discounted at 66% off (which isn't a rare discount for Steam).  Again, I might be mistaken about how that works, but that's my current understanding."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,cwilsons,1 point,Thu Jan 15 03:09:26 2015 UTC,"While I would like to give SD2 a go, the lack of Multiplayer is a pretty big deal for me personally. I haven't been following development but is that on the timetable this time around?"

Do you deny the memory issues still exist with your code?  A game breaking memory issue isn't exactly the hallmark of a finished game.  A modder is fixing your mess. Do you deny this too?  Your statement here contains demonstrable lies, and I still remember you banning me from the steam forums on the day of your steam sale of a game you know is broken and you will never fix. Censorship is always popular with the internet.  Good thing you don't actually control reddit, huh?"
4Xgaming,2sefyl,pocketknifeMT,2,Sat Jan 17 03:45:10 2015 UTC,"Although I didn't play SD1 or get burnt buying it, I did get burnt on SOTS2 so I understand where you're coming from.  Personally, I think its best to just let it go.  Ultimately we all just want a good 4x game to play; maybe SD2 will be one, maybe not.  Either way there are other games to play, and losing out on a few bucks here and there is pretty small potatoes considering how much value you can get for your dollar from games.  I've paid $5 for games I've played for 60 hours, and $60 for games I've played for 5 hours."

He still says otherwise though, and ""lots of people liked it"" isn't actually an answer to whether or not it's a broken game. It's just a rhetorical trick.  If he doesn't want people speaking ill of him still, he should probably quit the incessant lies."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,pocketknifeMT,3,Sat Jan 17 04:59:41 2015 UTC,"Write me your version of what the dev should say so that he's allowed to come here and talk with the community.  Sincerely, write out what would pacify you from the 18 month long animosity you've expressed."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,cwilsons,0,Sat Jan 17 05:30:45 2015 UTC,"Simply admit its a broken game he couldn't be bothered to finish and quit pedaling the ""it's totally functional"" BS. Truth in advertising.  If you launch a game, it will crash. full stop. It's simply a matter of time and system config as to when."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,pocketknifeMT,0,Sat Jan 17 05:41:26 2015 UTC,"He's acknowledged the memory error multiple times, and also that he decided to cut losses with the engine and shift work onto a new project.  However, he's also said, truthfully, that the errors aren't encountered by everyone, the game has a lot of the features and functionality he was aiming for, and he thinks that it's an alright effort for someone's first ever game.  It seems that you have a bigger issue with the dev saying anything positive about the game, rather than acknowledging its faults."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,cwilsons,3,Sat Jan 17 05:48:20 2015 UTC,"He's acknowledged the memory error multiple times, and also that he decided to cut losses with the engine and shift work onto a new project.   So...acknowledged a game breaking memory error, but couldn't be bothered to fix = finished game. This ignores all the dropped content like missions, balancing issues, and other glaring omissions of basic fit for purpose expectations in the video game.  Simply on the memory leak alone the game is unplayable for long. How long would it have taken to fix? Several weeks, worst case? DiCicco couldn't be bothered.   he thinks that it's an alright effort for someone's first ever game.   Absolutely. It would be an amazing first game, but I highly doubt thats the case. I doubt he made this game without making a simple platformer or poker game first simply to learn code and such. Probably more complex things too along the way.  That's all irrelevant though. When you charge money the standard isn't ""I tried really hard.""  53% of the steam reviews are negative, and I had to hit the load button 4 times to find the first positive review in the ""helpful"" category. It appears it's only popular in echo chambers maintained by censorship.  He charged money for a product, and then didn't stand behind it, followed by the banhammer and flippant remarks to paying customers for pointing this out. To this day the official line is it's complete and in a good state, and to this day the steam forums are managed so anyone saying it's broken is simply deleted because... reasons, by your good self IIRC.   It seems that you have a bigger issue with the dev saying anything positive about the game, rather than acknowledging its faults.   I had a problem with a defective product being sold as functional, under delivery, and being treated very poorly throughout.  Now I just have a developer denying reality problem. It's a broken game, everyone admits it in a doublespeak sort of way, but he can't flat out say it, because he is trying to sell another game and there is no way to spin ""I just abandoned it after it made most of the money it would make and defaulted on promises and basic stability"" positively."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,pocketknifeMT,0,Sat Jan 17 06:28:18 2015 UTC,"As he's said above, he feels there's a middle ground between perfect and failure. But you seem to characterize that nuance as a lie, and that the only honest position is the one you hold.  I think he was pretty forthright about the game in the recent stream;  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rluc_XcjZdM#t=299  and in his comments about the game;  http://www.reddit.com/r/4Xgaming/comments/2s6w5n/live_stardrive_2_interview_with_creator_dan/cnmqz0h  Also, I'd challenge you to demonstrate my involvement in the creation of any kind of echo-chamber of positivity on the forums. I'd say criticism gets its fair shake there, and I can count the number of bans I've handed out on my fingers. The vast majority are for the kind of behaviour you can see here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/220660/discussions/0/613936039344120254/  But if you're going to discredit alternative views by saying that the dev is lying about his experience, or that I'm lying, or that positivity toward the game is manufactured, all you're doing is insulating yourself.   I think it's valid for you to say ""the game is an unfinished mess"", and I also think it's valid for the dev to have a more favorable perspective. It's okay for other people to hold different views. It doesn't make them liars."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,cwilsons,2,Sat Jan 17 07:19:42 2015 UTC,"It's okay for other people to hold different views. It doesn't make them liars.   No, claiming a broken game is finished/complete makes him a liar. This isn't a matter of opinion. It is a simple fact the memory issues exist.

4Xgaming,2sefyl,cwilsons,6,Wed Jan 14 17:26:39 2015 UTC,"While this explains some of the issues, it doesn't exactly make me trust him more.    ""Stardrive 1 ... I'm actually pretty happy with it.""   ""(Stardrive 1) is totally functional, it's... got some technical issues... that's... that's what I got to say about that."" ""I mean this was literally the first game I made.""  ""I made a couple (of) bad decisions"" ""I've learned so much about development since I started""   To me, that sounds like he is trying to play the flaws of the first game down, without actually appreciating the magnitude of them. Saying the game was playable is laughable. It was at best an Alpha when it was released.  And even with the 33% off, this game is a ""buy at sale"" title, at best."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,Haekel,3,Wed Jan 14 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with StarDrive 1. The game is feature complete and playable. Maybe not in some people's books but really the vision of the developer is and should be the final.   I know he promised things he couldn't deliver, which he has apologized for repeatedly but ultimately it is his decision on whether to continue the game.  Do I wish it could be more? Sure I do. But I also wish a lot of other games could be more. The only reason this gets so much negativity is it's a single developer you can point fingers at. I can't count the number of promises AAA titles have broken.   This hate of SD1 is a witch hunt."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,Haekel,8,Wed Jan 14 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"I can't count the number of promises AAA titles have broken.    ... for which they, too, get an appropriate amount of heat. Think EA, think Ubisoft.    The only reason this gets so much negativity is it's a single developer you can point fingers at.   See above. I wouldn't have cared if it was a small studio instead, or a big one. I've supported my share of indies (one-person games included), and am able to cut them some slack.  Why my beef with StarDrive?  Because it was left uncompleted (as you say, this is a matter of opinion), and left to die, instead of trying to fix it.   And I do not think that a based on fact distrust is comparable to a witch hunt."
4Xgaming,2sefyl,irrelevant_query,3,Wed Jan 14 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"Please hold your downvotes.  That isn't even accounting for the utter mess that was his censoring of forums and banning anyone who had anything negative to say.  Between that and in my personal opinion abandoning Star Drive 1 when he did was a pretty huge slap in the face to me as a kick starter backer.    Calling the negative opinions commonly seen on /r/4Xgaming regarding StarDrive 2 a witch hunt is silly, considering this was only 1 year ago when all this went down and the blatant censoring or banning that was done.    While I hope Zero learned a valuable lesson from it, he really lost a lot of the communities good will save for a few very loyal followers.    I'll be honest and say that Star Drive 1 had a ton of potential, and I hope the second lives up to the potential I saw in the first one.

MOO2 is still waiting to be beaten out by one of these new games as the gold standard space 4x game.  And yes, there are other space 4x games that do x, y, or z better; but this game is clearly going for the MOO2 thing, which makes that an important thing to discuss in an article of this nature."

Its a game that actually innovated on many levels (perhaps too much for some people).  However I would also acknowledge elements from other games, like the UI from Endless space for example.  I'm just over building Space Stadiums on all my planets, and a few other tropes.  Building fleets of ships and sending them into battle is probably 2/3rds the draw to the genre for me."

I understand the game is in beta but from what I saw from the steam greenlight page, it will stay there for quite awhile.   No offense to developers, as I know it takes along time to make such a game but honestly I would not be worrying about ship designers and stretch goals right now... Those could be added as DLC or expansions if have enough stretch goals. I would get the base game out and have things to add.  I am developing my own games and I have many ideas that are tabled until I have a stable reliable build of my game engine, games, and code. I am happy your showing it off but please remember that other developers are also characterized by what you do.  I though am wondering, is the engine their own design or prefab?"

4Xgaming,2s6w5n,zer0sumgames,4,Mon Jan 12 18:55:26 2015 UTC,Yaaaay!
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,Nistrin,2,Mon Jan 12 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"I loved Stardrive 1 and think you do a great job, the only question I have is when are you going to add the promised  multiplayer?"
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,zer0sumgames,13,Mon Jan 12 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. You know, a lot of people ask me about that. I said I was going to add multiplayer, and then I didn't, so I broke my promise. I think the real disconnect between me and people who are mad at me about that is that I did it with a very heavy heart and a sober analysis of what needed to happen to move the StarDrive franchise forward. After wrestling with my SD 1 engine for years, I came to the disappointing conclusion that MP just wasn't possible - not in any sort of reasonable time frame. I very much doubt I could have achieved a good result.   And you know, I've got a family man. I got a kid now, and we're thinking about another. I can't grind away at a problem like adding Multiplayer to StarDrive 1 for 2 years when my business analysis is that it's going to lose money. So StarDrive 1 is never going to have multiplayer, and I really hope that you can accept this answer and take a fresh set of eyes to StarDrive 2, which is really a great game."
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,Nistrin,6,Mon Jan 12 19:36:57 2015 UTC,"Perfectly reasonable answer, thank you."
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,AutoBalanced,3,Mon Jan 12 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"I...wow, so I was really bummed when Stardrive stopped getting updates but now I'm back on board. I won't be pre ordering but things so far look good so I'll be keen to pick this up if it stays on this course."

4Xgaming,2s6w5n,Rhaegarion,-2,Tue Jan 27 23:06:07 2015 UTC,I hope you get sent down for fraud for the lies you told to sell your product. Did your business analysis factor in law or being unable to make money in prison?
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,Nistrin,1 point,Thu Jan 15 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"You are very misinformed about how kickstarter works, and about what constitutes breaking the law."
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,Rhaegarion,1 point,Tue Jan 27 04:22:15 2015 UTC,In the UK it is illegal to misrepresent a product. It is called fraud and unlike the shitty US law we have considerable consumer protection.
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,Nistrin,1 point,Tue Jan 27 08:26:33 2015 UTC,"Kickstarter isn't a system selling a product, it is a way for people to fund the creation of a product in exchange for rewards.  If a product on kickstarter does not meet all the goals of the project it isn't fraud because the product isn't being sold.  It is an important distinction.  The US has the same fraud and consumer protection laws."
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,Rhaegarion,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:40:34 2015 UTC,Telling lies to get money = fraud in the UK.
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,Nistrin,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:07:23 2015 UTC,"Except it was not telling lies (also you are oversimplifying the law to a rather extreme degree).  There was a planned development track, some goals did not get met, the product was still produced.  If it was sold as a finished product and the box said it contained multiplayer, and when you installed it it still didn't have multiplayer, then you would be correct and it would be fraud.  In this case however that is not what happened."
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,Rhaegarion,1 point,Wed Jan 28 08:01:53 2015 UTC,Was multilayer promised?  Yes  Was it delivered? No  Hence it was a lie. Clear cut and end of story.
4Xgaming,2s6w5n,Nistrin,1 point,Wed Jan 28 08:06:47 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to be able to grasp this.  But with kickstarter you aren't dealing with a product in that legal sense.  The law is the same in the US as in the UK, you are misinformed concerning fraud.  This categorically isn't fraud, it isn't a product, it is developement of a future product.  When you put money into kickstarter you are not buying something, if bought the game through steam or any other source, actually purchase it, it makes no reference to multiplayer.  The multiplayer stuff only appears in the original kickstarter pitch, as a planned part of the finished product.  Goals are not always met in software development, sometimes things get scrapped, this is normal.    The problem is that you seem to not understand that kickstarter isn't a place to buy things.  No matter how much you want it to be, it is a place for people to invest.  Also I'm fairly certain you haven't actually read anything I've typed since I've been over this 20 times now."
4Xgaming,2s7174,greendiamond16,3,Mon Jan 12 19:29:21 2015 UTC,"If you like Civilization type 4x, Endless Legend is similar with a sci-fi/fantasy setting."
4Xgaming,2s7174,IamRem,3,Mon Jan 12 19:43:42 2015 UTC,"I love Sins of a Solar Empire a lot, but it's 4x-lite, at best.  Of this list?  I say go with Endless Legend, easily.  It's great."
4Xgaming,2s7174,Ophidios,3,Mon Jan 12 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"I will say that I just finished playing a game of endless space and it was an amazingly well put together 4x game.  The economy meta is good and deep, the battles are decent, things are manageable with the great ui.  I ended up owning about 50 star systems and it never really felt like a chore to play the turns, ended up researching every tech and winning the science victory.  You will be using the wiki to figure out the mechanics, the approval rating system, the tax system and not clear in-game, but after you read the wiki it will make sense.   Endless legend is a great game too, basically takes the 4x concept and makes it fantasy.  Not fond of the battle system myself, but you can simulate the battles in it too.    I bought the amplitude pack mainly because I really wanted to play endless space.  Let me tell you that dungeon of the endless is awesome too.  Its basically a turn based puzzle game that is randomized and as hard as they come. I tried it on easy mode like 10 times and couldnt get half way, played once on very easy and beat it, still cant get more than half way on easy mode."
4Xgaming,2s7174,eberkain,2,Tue Jan 13 15:07:02 2015 UTC,i have been looking at the player stats for this list and i have noticed that endless legend is a lot more popular. It has even held its spot in the top 100 for a while. i have also noticed that GC3 is consistently low which is to be expected for a full priced beta. How well has the beta been going?
4Xgaming,2s7174,MarkoffChaneyIII,2,Mon Jan 12 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"If your a Star Trek fan I'd go with Sins plus the mod Armada 3, it's absolutely amazing."
4Xgaming,2s7174,Terkala,3,Mon Jan 19 16:37:36 2015 UTC,"If you want a good AI that will give you a challenge, Galactic Civilizations 2 or Sins of a Solar Empire.  Endless series games always have atrocious AIs. Though Endless Legend has fairly good game design.   If you're looking for a 4x game with a lot of replay value, go for GC2 (not 3) If you want a more action-y 4x game, Sins is a good choice.  If you have a bunch of friends who want to play on a LAN, go for Endless Legend."
4Xgaming,2s7174,Nistrin,2,Mon Jan 12 19:41:50 2015 UTC,that is exactly what i wanted hear. thank you very much.
4Xgaming,2s7174,Terkala,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"I very much disagree with his assessment.  Gal civ is great for the reasons he said, Sins is very janky imo.  The Endless games are phenomenal, the AI can be derpy at times, but unless you're a very serious 4x player the higher Difficulty settings will provide you with tons of enjoyment, they are amazingly well put together games.  Additionaly gal civ 3 is early access, and from what I hear not actually by the same people as the other gal civ games, so it's quality is uncertain, plus it isn't finished."
4Xgaming,2s7174,MegaGrubby,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:54:41 2015 UTC,I actually missed that it was GC3 on that list and not GC2. I'm going to edit my post.
4Xgaming,2s7174,MegaGrubby,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:37:06 2015 UTC,Is your Windows setup vanilla? I had problems with SOSE because I moved My Documents away from the default location. The developers told me to move it back to the default location which I did not want (booting from a smallish SSD).  Some additional notes. SOSE is real-time and can be paused. SOSE is probably the most complex of the 4 games. GC is turn based. I really liked Endless Space (also turn based) but it had less eye candy than the others. Endless Legend is more like Civ and less like the other 3.
4Xgaming,2s7174,MegaGrubby,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:00:27 2015 UTC,"Wether it is turned based or not isn't a problem what I'm looking for is a game with a good single player mode. It's AI has to be fun to play against and civ's answer to that is give them more stuff. Another thing that bugged me is how they never seemed to interact with each other, other then kill if I'm aggressive and if not they never go to war. Even if they did go to war with each other it would never last long. Among other problems like the other civs having no loyalties other then to win the game. In civ 4 it was rather common to see an axis of evil against an alliance but not so much in civ 5."
4Xgaming,2s7174,Terkala,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:12:31 2015 UTC,"Was Distant Worlds:Universe considered?  Of your 4, I remember SOSE being the most challenging and some good automation (ship and fleet movement, ship upgrades...you can set up the flow...not AI...just flow...huge fleets would tend to win games...challenge was getting to the huge fleet stage). GalCiv had the best customization/ship building though I don't have experience w/ III. Endless Space had a lot of Steam Achievements which some would consider ""replayability""."
4Xgaming,2s7174,MegaGrubby,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"Distant Worlds: Universal looks a lot like that mod that came out for civ 4 a million years ago. I had a lot of fun with that, but for 60 i think ill wait for the next sale to get it."
4Xgaming,2s7174,Revoran,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:38:39 2015 UTC,Been playing it a lot lately. Better than your other 4 choices IMO. Lowest sale price has been $10 off. I think a sale just ended on their site so it may be a while.
4Xgaming,2s7174,zasxcd,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:42:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't mentally process that you were talking about GC3 and not GC2.  Buy GC2 now, but wait for GC3 to come out of early access. GC3 has numerous issues right now, and it is not being developed by a single person who had their hand in developing GC2. So it's not an actual sequel, and doesn't carry the same weight until it proves itself."
4Xgaming,2s7174,Terkala,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:38:41 2015 UTC,Was about to ask about that. That is good to know. It looks like it will make it out of development and I would rather play it as a completed product.
4Xgaming,2s7174,Etaywah,0,Mon Jan 12 20:47:00 2015 UTC,"Also, I would stay away from Early Access games. Often a Premium Price tag for an unknown end product. Planetary Annihilation is a great example. Was $60 early access and was $5 this past weekend"

Even then i'm still nerves about buying a 50 dollar beta. It could be worth it though and from what i have heard it is no slouch."

4Xgaming,2s7174,Bigheadmike,1 point,Tue Jan 13 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"The one major topic I am not seeing a discussion about here is tactical and strategic warfare. I liked pretty much everything about Endless Space, Civ5, Civ5 expansions, etc. - but good god are those battles boring. There's hardly any other strategy other than ""tech faster, build more units than they do, swarm, kill""  If they made a game that was a mix of Civ5 and Galactic Civ 2-3 mixed with Star Wars Empire at War's Space battles and Starcraft-style RTS ground combat I don't think I'd ever play another game again.  Is there anything on the horizon that is that ambitious?"
4Xgaming,2s7174,ran88dom99,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:12:48 2015 UTC,"It appears that /u/Terkala got you sorted, but I'm going to put my 2 credits in.    1) GC3 if the AI is as good as GC2 Dark Avatar (because Twilight of the Arnor, while making the game 'fancier', really decimated the AI, DA was the superior AI) Also, if you haven't figured it out yet Brad Wardell is very, very economically conservative and if you follow the ideas of Supply Side economics, you will do very well for yourself he more or less programmed the economy to work off those principals (happiness tied to taxation, and pop growth tied to happiness)  2) I'm having a really good time myself with Endless Legend.  If they can get it together on the AI through patches or an expansion, it has a very real possibility of being the greatest 4X of all time.  Also multiplayer.  3) Endless Space is very elegant.  It's not nearly the experience that Endless Legend is and I'd put it last among the pure 4X titles on your list.  That isn't to say it is a bad game, but GC3 has a great pedigree and Endless Legend is just so good.  4)Personally I didn't enjoy Sins very much at all.  The RTS/4X blend just didn't mesh up well, it really felt like a bad grand strategy title.  If you haven't tried it and want something very deep Sword of the Stars is a good game.  It's very difficult to get into though."

Just put up a new Let's Play of Master Of Orion 2 and thought at least a few of you may have an interest and this posting serves as my invitation. I took a bit of time in post edit to remove in-game music and replace it with a remastered track from the GoG version of the Moo2 soundtrack (gets rid of the hiss you may hear in many of the videos out there); rendered it out in 1080P and I believe the results are pretty solid.

4Xgaming,2s0tls,Cameron122,3,Sun Jan 11 12:12:03 2015 UTC,"There doesn't seem to be any direct control using WASD. I miss that feature too :/  But you can use the mouse to tell ships to move or attack, change the combat stance of the ship (broadside, forward facing, keep moving) and the engagement range (how close they will go before shooting). And you can tell individual ships to retreat (25 second timer before they warp out of the battle)."

4Xgaming,2s0tq3,abandonedstardrive,6,Sun Jan 11 02:20:37 2015 UTC,"Disclosure: StarDrive mod here.  This community really needs to deal with its toxic element.  I can't believe that someone can make the effort to put together an ad-free website & community in order to host feature articles, podcasts, reviews, exclusive previews and developer interviews, and be essentially bullied out of sharing that content here.  DevilDogFF, Nasarog, and Warmacblu are content creators for the 4X community through explorminate. These interviews with Jon Shafer of Conifer Games, Lennart Sas of Triumph Studios, Romain De Waubert of Amplitude, and (yes), even the twitch stream preview with Daniel DiCicco of Zer0Sum Games would not exist but for their efforts. Yet there's a determined subsection of the community here that seems all too interested in dismissing their contributions as ""blogspam"".  Honestly, I would think that a community that was as in-need of content as this one would be much more interested and supportive of a project that seeks to give a platform to community oriented original content for the genre.  The 4X community isn't large, and major journalism outlets don't often give it the coverage we'd like. That's the problem. So when members of the 4X community stand up and decide to create the content themselves, I hope people can see the irony of shutting them down because they're not adequately distanced from the games they're covering to be qualified to deliver the content back to the community.  DevilDog has disclosed his relationship with the StarDrive developer. It's not financial. The website he runs has no advertisements to generate revenue. He's a prominent figure in the community that has access to means of content creation that few others do. That's not impropriety.   He'd like to share that here occasionally. I feel it would be a real shame to lose that.  Edit: Looks like /u/eXplorminate deleted their account, so I guess some people got what they were pushing for."
4Xgaming,2s0tq3,cwilsons,6,Sun Jan 11 08:40:10 2015 UTC,"We occasionally receive complaints about self-promotion by eXplorminate, due to frequently posting in the past.

I wasn't aware of the relationship until just yesterday, which, considering the unfortunate StarDrive situation, I prefer wasn't the case, but I can live with it. As you've pointed out, the website is ad-free and the relationship is not financial, so I still don't see a problem. Content creators are vital, otherwise we'd have little to discuss on this subreddit. So nothing changes: posts linking to eXplorminate will not be removed or discouraged.

I actually helped him make his first video.  He's not trying to mislead anyone or lie to anyone.  However, he does have a close relationship with the game's developer. You are right that he should make it clear every time he writes/does a video on the game.    Full disclosure:   I was an alpha and beta tester for the original StarDrive, after buying it on early access on Desura. I made the first beta video on the original game and was the 10th poster registered on the official forums. I am an inactive admin on the (unofficial) StarDrive 1 wiki, I created the Stardrive 2 wiki on Wikia.  I am not involved with StarDrive 2's development except for posting on the forums.

He couldn't deliver on some of the stuff he promised and the original StarDrive ended up a fun game that was unpolished and flawed.

4Xgaming,2rjlav,SharkMolester,5,Tue Jan 6 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"One other thing to keep in mind is how ship classes behave when automated.  Escorts and frigates will try to protect everything. This includes planets, stations, and even freighters. Your escorts and frigates will follow freighters around, potentially drawing them away from defending planets.  Destroyers will automatically protect planets and stations only, but they will not try to escort freighters.  It may be beneficial to not have an escort or frigate ship class design so that you can leave your ships on automatic, allowing them to form an organic defense of your empire.  A destroyer that is protecting a planet but is engaging an enemy is no longer protecting that planet. The planet is considered to be unprotected by this destroyer, so another destroy gets assigned this task. This destroyer shows up, finds the hostiles and engages. Planet is still undefended, so another destroyer shows up, finds hostiles, engages. Planet still undefended, so another destroyer shows up...  Because of this behavior destroyers on automatic make for excellent empire defense ships. They will end up dogpiling any hostile ships. More and more of your destroyers will show up to engage those hostiles. Once hostiles are destroyed or flee, the destroyers will then spread out once more across your empire.  Cruisers, carriers, and capital ships have similar behavior to destroyers. They will not try to escort freighters when on automatic.  Ships on automatic will also attempt to fill up their troop bays if equipped with troop bays. Keep this in mind if you build these ships with troop bays and set them on automatic, as these ships may vacuum up all of your troops. This may be good or bad, depending on what you want them to do."

How do you differentiate between difference sizes of Star-base for example? I pull all the labs off of mine, I see no need to put labs on them when a couple of big multi lab research stations will cap out my empires research on their own.

Have you tested this yourself?"
4Xgaming,2rjlav,waterbucket999,1 point,Wed Jan 7 11:39:52 2015 UTC,"Yea, he's saying the same thing I did, just in a different way.  The Ion Defense will adsorb the attack by the Ion Weapon at all but the shortest of ranges due to damage drop off.  However, if the enemy has more than one Ion Weapon, the Ion Defense won't be able to absorb it because it has been disabled by the other Ion shot, so having only one Ion Defense will not protect you from multiple weapons.  When you get to the point where you're invading a heavily defended world with a big space port and multiple defense stations and they all have like 10 Ion cannons, putting 10 Ion Defense on each of your troop ships costs 20 size, definitely a doable trade-off.  Yes, I have tested this myself, it's how I know :P  I used to assume that only one was sufficient... and found out the hard way that it isn't.

So I guess I disagree a bit on the ""Layer"" philosophy. This is because there are certain components you only need one of on each ship (command center, hyperdrive, damage control, targeting). If you design ships that are less than max size, you're essentially ""wasting"" space and materials to create additional command centers, etc.  I have heard that smaller ships have better evasion, but I don't think this has ever been confirmed."

4Xgaming,2rkutn,carn1x,9,Wed Jan 7 01:26:12 2015 UTC,I had Civ IV vanilla and bought Civ IV Complete (for the expansions) only to play a better version of the Fall From Heaven (FFH) mod. I have not played vanilla or its expansions since. FFH is a fantasy mod set in its own world and was the most popular mod for the game at least back then. The mod was finished(!) and main developer got later hired as professional game designer.  There are many other mods based on FFH. Nowadays when I get the Civ itch I play a modmod called Erebus in the Balance.
4Xgaming,2rkutn,Ksielvin,2,Wed Jan 7 02:41:44 2015 UTC,I played FFH vanilla (without any mod mods) and gigantic stack of doom of one of my enemies ruined all the fun. Did they deal with it in Erebus or any other mod mod?
4Xgaming,2rkutn,Eraser1024,2,Thu Jan 8 17:23:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure what to say since you didn't define what the problem is supposed to be. The fact that AI can wield large armies? The difficulty settings behave same or similar to normal Civ IV, including the cheap maintenance costs that AI gets at higher difficulties. FFH has a lot of options for collateral damage and area spells and summons that player will generally use more cunningly than AI does.  Long ago there was some patch that had actual bugs related to huge stacks of doom but it's fairly unlikely that your issue was during that specific patch.  I think any situation of being hopelessly overrun is a snowball result of other, usually economical factors. Including me running a farmer's gambit and having insufficient army at the wrong time. AI uses power graph as a factor of decision making so it does sometimes appropriately punish a foolhardy builder. So that's either my fault or map script and game settings producing somehow overly challenging circumstances this time. I can only aim for settings that mostly give me the kind of games I want.  Erebus in the Balance is a multiplayer balance focused mod and doesn't directly change AI as far as I can recall, and the mechanics it changes to address abuse cases are more likely to be underused by AI in the first place. Quirky world wonder mechanics and spell interactions for example."

There are so many things broken under the hood that no amount of modding will make it a good game, which is a shame because SotS2 has flashes of brilliance. You can see that there is a great game hidden somewhere in there, but there are so many problems with it that on balance, its a bad game.  The major bugs I've seen are AI bugs, where the AI just stops responding in battle for some reason.   There's another bug with deployments. Where will your fleet actually be deployed in battle? Will it meet the enemy to defend your homeworld? Or will it be off way in the boonies, leaving your homeworld totally undefended while your capital gets glassed from space? Hell if I know. I have been unable to discern any pattern to deployment whatsoever.  Managing your empire and building/upgrading space stations is a royal PITA. Its so amazingly clunky. So many clicks to do a simple thing.  On the plus side, SotS2 has a brilliant ship design system. The ship and weapon design in the game are outstanding.   I also like the fleet basing/mission system. Your fleet is based at one star system and can be sent out on missions to others. Fleets only have enough endurance to operate for so long before having to return to base to resupply. A large fleet will need a starbase for support and as a home base.

4Xgaming,2rfoyo,ran88dom99,2,Tue Jan 6 03:39:45 2015 UTC,Many of these sorts of games seem to be very much about hero units running around works that are filled with overpoweringly strong monster units rather than building up cities and resources to either win non-militarily or to create better non-hero units than the competition.  How does this compare to elemental or warlock in this regard?

4Xgaming,2rcl0r,Ilitarist,3,Mon Jan 5 19:15:39 2015 UTC,"It's a city-builder with light inner politics system. The meat of the game is campaign where you have interesting situations and challenges. It's lighthearted and funny.  Combat is very simple and you barely control it. You have soldiers, they go and shoot rebels and win depending on quality and quantity of soldiers and stuff like towers. It only happens a couple of times in campaign and for most people it wouldn't happen without special event.  There are no competitors in this game so it's rather close to traditional city-builders."
4Xgaming,2rcl0r,Parareda8,2,Mon Jan 5 23:38:11 2015 UTC,"You are the presidente of an island and you can build any kind of building (available ofc). You basicaly try to make everyone happy so you can be elected president again. You do this by building some specific things, making some laws and doing some economy work. I haven't played the newest one but you can play online with your friends and battle. Like you said, there is not much emfasis on this but there are quite some things!"
4Xgaming,2rcl0r,runetrantor,1 point,Mon Jan 5 21:48:16 2015 UTC,"It's a city builder that unlike Simcity, takes place in a parody of Cuba or any Banana Republic.  It's a very fun game, not as micro intensive in how buildings ar eplaced like Anno is, but combat is very minimal.  In Tropico 5, the biggest conflict you will see is when you are in the Colonial Era (5 has four eras, colonial, World Wars, Cold War, and Modern) and declare independence from the British Empire by force. Combat boils down to some enemy units spawning in the coasts, and your units popping out of any fort or military base you have, and you can have guard towers for added defense. You cant control them, they auto path to the enemy.  I liked it a lot, as I dont care much for the combat side (There's more than enough 4xs that focus on that X).  You only get one island, but in free mode you can chose from a wide range of them.  Personally, I would equate it to Anno and Simcity much more than to 4xs, as expansion in Tropico is only limited by exploring the island, once that's done, you can take it over, but it's cool to build with so much land, making a tourist powerhouse island nation that has nuclear program and a space one.  And there's a new dlc coming/just released (Only know it's soon, so I am unsure if it's out already) with water structures, like floating houses and cool stuff.  TotalBiscuit did a 'WTF is...' of Tropico 5, you can check it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nft1D74EHv4 It is from before the embargo though, so he cant show you the two last eras. (I sort of recall he made a second video with them)"

Each city is just the one un-upgradeable building, but you can only build resource extraction cities a certain distance from each other, and you work your way up an industry chain to be be able to get certain resources, chemicals and elements to get electronics, electronics and biologics to get cyber implants (iirc), stuff like that. plays out over a bunch of planets, combat is great, and you can manually shuttle resources around if you want to."

4Xgaming,2rcl0r,ran88dom99,2,Mon Jan 5 21:05:12 2015 UTC,"Each city is more like one building, it is not an upgradeable thing like in civ. They each produce one resource and some tax revenue, and all can build basic units- militia, arty, antiair, antitank. Barracks and factories build more advanced troops/vehicles respectively.  mines and farms extract the basic resources, iron and trace elements for mines, food and bioloigcs for farms. The latter resources for both are only found on special tiles but are necessary. these then go to a 2nd tier city where they are turned into say, electronics, which are then used to build more advanced units, or sent on up to a 3rd tier city to build another resource, say a cyclotron which produces..monopoles? something needed for starship engines.  each city can be conquered by other factions, planetary invasions may end with only a couple of cities conquered. these cities can be used as a springboard for further expansion on to the planet in question. Take a barracks, bam! troop production. take their labs? they lose techs! the church likes to do this to players.  oh, there are other forces around other than the..5? great houses. the church, pretty much like the imperial cult in warhammer 40k. the traders league, a powerful confederation of traders who are working behind the scenes to re-establish a republic. the vau,aliens who because of a bug just sit there and do nothing, and symbiote invaders who are bottle necked in one part of the map and all factions have to co-operate to some degree to keep them there.  well thats a massive wall of text. feel free to ask for more details, although i'll admit i'm a bit fuzzy on details as i havent played the game in ages. it's a small download, pretty sure underdogs or abandonia have it. the game is based on the fading suns universe for the RPG of the same name, pretty cool setting. if WH40K is the dark ages, the fading suns would be the renaissance/ high medieval era."

4Xgaming,2rcl0r,Jellye,13,Wed Jan 7 22:02:49 2015 UTC,"Victoria 2 by paradox.  It's set during the period of colonisation. The game is obviously about empire building and it has a very heavy focus on infrastructure. Building railroads and also factories are important. You can specialise in certain types of industry like automobiles, oil, tobacco etc. You even compete in the global trade market. There are wars you will have to fight and colonies are important for wealth. The game focuses a lot on prestige which adds a good level of challenge.   I know you said you don't want much of an emphasis on military but it's worth it for everything else. You can play any country in the world though so I'm sure you could find what you want from at least one country.  Also, in terms of a 4x game, I think it checks the 4 x's really well."

4Xgaming,2rcl0r,Boonaki,1 point,Mon Jan 5 21:22:19 2015 UTC,It's always on historical map and the setting is close to real world. You won't be able to conquer the world there and most countries end the game in the same borders they've started it (plus colonies). Also it's not 4X.
4Xgaming,2rcl0r,Boonaki,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:39:49 2015 UTC,"Well that's not true, if you play Prussia and then form Germany, you can easily eat the whole of Europe by the end.

4Xgaming,2rcl0r,kaspar42,9,Mon Jan 5 16:02:29 2015 UTC,"I'd try Distant Worlds: Universe. Honestly, the best 4x game I've played, and it has a huge emphasis on infastructure. The best part is, you can play it as an open sandbox, and the galaxy will continue to live and breathe, with new species evolving into minor races and then into major civs overtime. You need to spend the time to establish mining bases throughout your region of space to ensure that your empire has access to the various (20 or so) resources, some of course more frequently used than others. The game has a lot of aspects to it, including colony development, but there are plenty of tutorials on youtube to help you adjust to the Dwarf Fortress-like complexity.   It is a real-time 4x game however, but you can control how fast the simulation moves (1x, 2x, 4x, etc.)"

It's somewhat similar to Civ, but as well as food and hammers, citizens working at your colonies also generate various resources.  These can be processed and upgraded, and either sold to your home country, or to native Americans.  There is a fair amount of strategy in setting up production chains and building colonies in the right places to maximise your income so you can spend money on other things you'll need.  The end game is basically about acquiring enough cities and resources to declare independence and fight a revolutionary war against your home country."

It's more like Settlers in space with you having to move food, water, luxury and industrial resources between planets to ""level them up"" to the next level of development. And it turns into a huge spiderweb of planets trading with each other for resources so that you can have a few Coruscant city worlds."

After the glorified experiment that was SR1 it was absolutely astounding to see such an improvement just in the base idea around the game.

Of the 4x games that came out in the last 3-4 years, I think Distant Worlds is one of maybe 2 or 3 that didn't have multiplayer support.  The game itself is excellent and extremely ""different"" feeling than most other strategy games. But it certainly doesn't feel like a ""we all have a balanced start and I outplayed the enemy"" sort of game. It feels like a ""this is a real empire that actually exists and I'm managing it"" sort of game."

At first, I thought it was a wonderfully automated game you could play your way. As I get into it, I am finding the automation of my fighting ships very frustrating. I am not sure if I am doing something wrong or the game is truly hair brained once you get to know it.  I am also new to streaming so my apologies if it's not top notch. I'm doing it for self-entertainment...not to make a career out of it.  My Twitch  edit: to explain my frustration with the ship AI. My ships are often out of fuel. Two thirds of my fighting force is useless because they need to re-fuel before I can attack something. By that time, the target is long gone. They spend much of their time flying from one end of my territory to the other. Pirates attack 1 or 2 systems away from them and they don't seem to react.

Maybe tomorrow I will try it and see if that is somehow what the thread intended.  Also, I find the game stable. I can post my computer specs if that somehow makes a difference.

4Xgaming,2rca4r,nolok,2,Wed Jan 7 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"Pros:   Best deep 4X out there if you are looking for scale and things to do, with automation to manage the more micro aspects as your empire expands. DW handles this very well and you can change the levels of automation to transition from a micro heavy early game to an empire-centric late game.  Very deep economic gameplay. Strategic resources MUST be mined and ferried around by freighters to supply your empire. The spice must flow.  Ship design is rather meaningful as your component choices actually do make a huge difference in how your ships behave. I personally love ship design and prefer the systems in games like StarDrive or Space Empires V (Spatially located components and damage) but I can understand how that kind of per component spatial damage simulation would not work for a large scale game like DW.  Full tech tree experience; you can start as a pre-warp civilization, explore your system, and eventually conquer the galaxy. Gameplay is quite challenging for the most part and newer players may need to tone down the pirates to progress at a reasonable pace out of their home system.   Cons:   Almost every con here can be attributed to the ""suffers from really small dev team and budget"".  The graphics look really dated. As much hate as StarDrive gets on this subreddit, it's a similar subgenre of 4X game that does the Aesthetics right despite presumably being also budget and manpower limited. The ships aren't the highest quality and the combat isn't as eye-catching as it could be.  Still no full moddability. Universe supposedly added a lot of new mod friendly features but I am still waiting for a full-on galaxy editor to happen. Also a lot of gameplay elements are too hard-coded for my taste and would require a recompile of the executable to implement as a mod, which I don't think Matrix allows. Don't get me wrong, it has more mod support than many games, just not as much as I expected from the promises of the developer before I bought it.  No Multiplayer. Man this game could have had epic multiplayer.  I love fleet combat. For all the intricacy of the fleet customization and design DW offers, the combat is dull both graphically and mechanistically. There is no point defense, weapon variation isn't all that expansive (Space Empires had fantastic weapon variation and is the gold standard to how to make interesting ship design and combat mechanically).   TL:DR If you like managing a potentially huge empire in real time with effective automation and a fantastic economic system, it's worth it. However expect some issues in overall polish and graphical fidelity due to limited developer resources."

It's below par of other games in its genre by a significant margin, and it even has a really simple state machine mechanic (follow the last player that pinged it, otherwise go to lane and attack minions. Use skills if enemy happens to enter range).  Then again, it's an expensive site that is probably only subscribed to by AAA developer teams with too much budget on their hands. Just look at their forums, a full 10% of the ""total posts by everyone"" are posted by the site moderators. That's a minimally active site if I've ever seen one.

4Xgaming,2qy5b7,Brodivh,2,Wed Dec 31 21:27:44 2014 UTC,"I've thought about this before but nothing really fits that well.  Since games usually don't have dynamic empire creation or deterioration, and very little emphasis on trade.  Making a special tech tree for the Empire that makes their stuff worse and disallows them from building things is easy enough, but making it so new nations start popping up is a rare thing to be able to mod.  Off the top of my head-  Distant Worlds has a scenario editor which you can use to set up the map, then add some events if you want, like making the Empire's global happiness level take a nose dive- which will cause it to be automatically broken up into separate empires as worlds rebel.  Also, having pirates set to many and regenerating would be fitting.  I feel like Space Empires might be doable with some modding work, but I don't have a whole lot of experience with it.  Star Ruler would likely be moddable to do this, but it would take a lot of work- like total conversion level.  And I feel like I'm missing a very obvious one, but I can't think of anything else..."

You watch Germanic and Slavic tribes fight over Europe. The Byzantium stands strong, but is threatened by both Muslims, Avars and later any mighty empires that might arise in the north. Frankish empire quickly unites half the Europe, only to get soon shattered again. And everyone is threatened by Viking raiders from the North, Muslim Sultanates and Caliphates from the south and later Mongols from the East (and if you have the appropriate DLC, late game an Aztec invasion from beyond the Atlantic).   You can play the post-Roman states and stabilize Europe, you can play the Byzantium and attempt undo the division of the Empire to restore Rome to its former glory, you can be a Viking and leech as many riches as possible from the fledgling European kigdoms, only to eventually mature, find God and become a proud empire of your own. Or you can wipe Christianity off the map and rule the world in the name of Thor...  I'm a sucker for science fiction though and would also love a proper strategy game set ""during the fall""."

I won't say its shallow because in a big way it isn't. Like when you build your god there are a bunch of ways to set it up, like there are factions which benefit from all their lands being a little bit cursed and you can make your gods dominion do that, and the way you can develop regions and create forts in choke points.  You can cast spells to scry regions to find sources of magic and discover hidden special properties in tiles, or build your god to be a magician of every type at once to do that stuff.  But honestly the last part is pretty tedious.  You can come up with fun and pretty sophisticated strategies which seem like a super good time if you're into a rather deep and slow, asynchronous experience fighting a bunch of other human players simultaneously. It is like... the 4x answer to the super technical fighting game scene. And I think you have to be into it in a particular way and play with the right crowd to really pull everything together, in which case it really pulls together.  But it isn't an empire builder. It is about how to come up with a doctrine to conquer the thrones by force and ascend to motherfucking godhood. Which is exciting, but you know, whatever."

It has the same level of ""you can learn the intricate mechanics, but you don't really have to"".  That being said, the game is 80% combat/tactics with 20% empire building. So it will be more of a focus on fighting that you may be used to. It's entirely possible to win Civilization 1-5 without going to war, it's impossible to win Dom 4 without being at war constantly. In fact, diplomacy doesn't exist and everyone is at war at all times as part of the game's inherent design."

However the utterly incompetent AI made it difficult to stick with the game for me. Have they fixed this in the meantime? I remember there was a patch that came out shortly after release, made minor improvements in this area, but still presented no real challenge. Hard to see it winning GOTY based on this critical flaw. Although I do admit, the innovative and unique aspects of this game are so bold it is almost enough to make up for the AI."
4Xgaming,2qb7t5,specter800,7,Wed Dec 24 21:47:49 2014 UTC,"The AI is improving iteratively, but still makes mistakes which make it weak to rushes and well timed attacks. I don't think that major game sites really play 4X's to the level where they can start abusing the AI's weaknesses at all difficulties, or where the dominant strategies make the game repetitive. This allows the its great strengths to sit front and centre while the flaws hide away in the back.  It's definitely my favourite 4X for a long time (maybe since SMAC) even though it hasn't had the longevity of other 4X games that I've enjoyed less.

4Xgaming,2qb6js,dukeofgonzo,4,Wed Dec 24 21:04:06 2014 UTC,"I figured I could chime in and list a couple more differences in addition to the above:   A stack can have a maximum of 6 units instead of 8. Not quite sure why this is, but it doesn't affect gameplay that much that it really matters. A huge change is that AI now builds their own cities. Now you actually have to make settlers, while in Shadow Magic, building settlers meant you would crush the AI with huge numbers. Mountains are now passable for all units, albeit at a huge movement cost. The same can be said for water tiles, though you need to research a tech first. Unfortunately, this means ships and harbors are largely useless. Guard Towers are back! In addition, builders can now build forts, which are similar to cities in that they generate domain. These are useful to claim resources before you are able to build a city on a location. All map structures now has to be captured by your domain to give your empire resources, and will go to the city whose domain it was captured by."
4Xgaming,2qb6js,DigiAirship,3,Thu Dec 25 01:22:20 2014 UTC,"Haven't played Endless Legend, but I loved Shadow Magic until I got AoW3.  AoW3 feels tighter and smoother to me, but there are only a few differences.  I'll list all I can think of, you'll notice most differences are minor.   The biggest difference is you'll choose one Class: Archdruid (summons animals), Warlord (spells that improve combat units), Dreadnought (uses guns and steampunk things), Rogue (stealth and politics), or Theocrat (priesty things).  This determines the majority of the spells you can learn.  Then you also choose a few spellbooks like Fire or Creation, and get thee spells too. It feels like my Wizard is more customizable. way better graphics (map, units, and environment). combat now has mechanics for Flanking (bonus attacking from behind) and Attacks of Opportunity (get a free attack if someone moves in front of you). Makes it more tactical. attacks now never miss, but things that reduce hit chance (like long range or obstruction) reduce damage.  It's almost like instead of your archers having a 40% chance to do 10 damage, you now have 10 40% chances to do 1 damage, so you'll probably do 3 - 5. Reduces frustration. flying units can now be attacked by ground units, though flying is still useful for clearing city walls and avoiding Attacks of Opportunity. No more leveling up a dragon hatchling by attacking critters that can't fight back. the lists of Races, units, and Spells are broadly similar but not identical.  There's Fireball, but no Water Walking; Gold Dragons, but no Baby Dragons.  customizing the ""look"" of your wizard is AWESOME. the rules for unit abilities, racial effects, and really everything are a tad simpler and clearer.  Everything is spelled out in tooltips, so you never wonder things like ""Do elven priests get a ranged attack bonus?"" or ""Is this one of those places where slain enemies come back as skeletons?""   While there are permanent enchantments you can cast on cities and terrain, there are no permanent Unit Enchantments.  Spells like Heroism are now Combat spells, which will last only for the rest of the fight. You can only cast one spell per combat round, even if you have multiple heroes. It's a balance thing. Disjuncting spells now uses a system where if you fail the Disjunct roll, the spell loses Integrity and becomes easier to Disjuct next time.  You can also spend mana to repair the integrity on your spells.  It's thematic and clear. The Random Map Generator is even better, if you can believe that.  More customization options for things like number of roads, cities, mana nodes, etc; each of which can be set to None, Few, Normal, Lots, or Random.  I love Random, Each map plays differently and requires different strategy.   Basically, it's the same game, with updated graphics and a tighter, simpler and better-balanced rule set (not that SM had major problems). Not a must-have. If you still love SM, you don't need this.  If you want a game that plays like SM with better graphics and some cool new features, and aren't a purist about a small change here and there, AoW3 fits the bill."
4Xgaming,2qb6js,MeepleTugger,2,Wed Dec 24 23:14:39 2014 UTC,Don't forget the sorcerer class! Lots of summoned units and direct damage.

Since then, everyone seems to think I'm bad luck, and stays out of my way.  I'm on King, so turtling probably won't work.  But I hate declaring war. I'll just see how deep in my spellbook I can get before the Dwarf Sorcerer takes the piss and stomps me with T4 stacks of doom (I see them circumambulating my domain)."
4Xgaming,2qb6js,MeepleTugger,2,Fri Dec 26 03:58:04 2014 UTC,"I'd say fairly different.  That's one of the things I love about the AoW series - each new iteration is distinct enough from its predecessors that not only does it feel worth it, but it never makes the preceding game obsolete (the obvious exception to this is Shadow Magic, which was simply better than AoW 2, and made it completely redundant). I played Shadow Magic to death, but it never dampened my enthusiasm of AoW 1 because, while obviously related, they played very differently. I've had the same experience with AoW 3.  So, yes. It plays quite differently from the preceding games. Here's some of the changes that I felt were most profound, in addition to some of the others mentioned in here.  1) Class system. This has already been mentioned, but I'm saying it just to emphasize: This is the major change that AoW 3 makes. This, more than anything else, is what makes it unique from earlier games in the series. The units you can build, the spells you can cast, your passive abilities and more are all determined, at least in part, by your class.  2) Less variety, more diversity. That might sound like a bit of an oxymoron, but what I mean is this: AoW 3 was (and is) a little disappointing in how many races it has. Six in the base game (Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Goblins, Draconians), with a seventh (Halflings) added in an expansion and an eight (Frostlings) coming in a second expansion. Considering how 1 and 2 had twelve races and SM had fifteen, that's a little underwhelming. However, the races all play very differently from one another. Consider your basic tier 1 archer unit: Elves have Longbowmen, which have no ranged penalty; Human Archers are heavily armoured; Orc Razorbows are weak but can inflict bleeding wounds; Dwarf Crossbowmen can move and fire without penalty; Goblin Swarm Darters deal poison damage (now called Blight damage) and ignore obstacles; Draconian Flamers have an AOE attack that deals fire damage, and Halfling Jesters have a chance of stunning the target as well as everyone adjacent to it. All of this is on top of all sorts of generic racial bonuses and penalties.   What this means is that most units, even basic ones, end up feeling and playing fairly different from each other - and since this also extends to class units, it means there's quite a lot of different possibilities here. I still wish that there were more races, but I'm glad that the ones that are in the game are so different.  3) Tactical Combat There's been a lot of changes here, almost exclusively for the better. It's been made more, well, tactical. Concepts like flanking and defensive positions have made their way into the game, and a unit's morale now has a significant impact - with higher morale allowing for critical hits, and lower morale possibly leading to ""fumbles,"" or a unit hitting below minimum damage (it's even more important for Halflings...). The UI is now a lot more informative, and hovering over an enemy unit will give you a brief overview for both yours and theirs, telling you how many attacks each gets, what the damage range of each attack is, and what sort of special effects could come into play. This makes life a lot easier, as you can get a quick assessment of how things could go without having to memorize every unit's stats.  Speaking of which, stats have been revamped. Attack is completely gone, and as has been said elsewhere, every attack is an instant hit (unless you're the Halflings). Defense and Resistance both now reduce damage, rather than reducing the chance to hit - and this has ultimately had the effect of nerfing level 4 units, which IMHO is a great change. Damage is now tied to the specific attacks, rather than the unit itself, so some units will have different types of melee attacks that you can choose depending on the situation.   A much bigger change is how elements work. They now have their own specific damage (so, for example, a flaming sword might deal 10 physical damage and 4 fire damage), which makes resistances and weaknesses way more interesting. Speaking of which, instead of just the Immunity/Protection/Weakness system, it's a fluid system based on percentages. So, for example, a unit might have 100% Frost protection, 65% Lightning protection, 20% Blight weakness, and 80% Fire weakness, allowing for a lot more diversity in both units and tactics. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, status effects and elemental damage have been separated, and most element types have more than one status effect. This means that some units that deal Blight damage might not inflict any status effects at all, others might cause a mild poisoning effect, while others still might inflict more severe poisoning.  It's also worth noting that damage is much higher in relation to HP, making the game more like AoW 1 in the sense that units die much faster. Also, even your most basic units have got all sorts of interesting active and passive abilities that you can throw in the mix.   What all this means is that combat in AoW 3 is faster-paced and more tactically fulfilling than any other game in the series, and IMHO has the best combat of any 4X game I've ever played.  tl;dr - It's different enough to be worth playing, but similar enough to still be recognizable as an AoW game. Definitely get it."

4Xgaming,2q4tgk,Sekh765,3,Tue Dec 23 05:17:11 2014 UTC,"Hey. Huge fan of Paradox games and 4X in general. I've played all their games + Distant worlds.   Distant worlds is about as close as you can get to one of their games that is out right now. But it's still more 4X than Grand Strat. There's some serious Tech Tree going on, and you have Win Conditions everyone is striving for (I'm not sure if you can turn them off or not). EU4 and Vicky are unique with their whole, start here, end here regardless of your place in the world system.  I will say Distant Worlds is a really awesome game once you crack the difficulty curve. You can leave a ton of automation but then you are just staring at the AI doing your game for you. Most of the fun comes once you learn how to manage everything. The Combat is less abstract than Paradox games. You have individual ships that fly in fleets, theres no ""Win""/""Lose"" battles like Paradox.  The economy system is the most reminiscent of paradox titles. I would place it closest to Victoria 2. You have a constant running tally of cash, and you have reserves of various resources such as helium, dense metals, etc. These have a market value and you can buy / sell them depending on this. You need certain materials to build certain things in your  empire, so if you are missing a crucial material for your next fancy space ship, you'll need to go find it.  Diplomacy can be complex, depending on your race and how far you want to go into it. I feel EU4/Vicky gives you more fun options though.  Hopefully some day Paradox just goes nuts and makes a Space Grand Strat in line with their current products. I'd love to see that. Until then Distant Worlds is probably your best bet for ""Grand Strategy"" feel. Good luck!  EDIT: On the topic of unbalanced stats. Distant World races aren't as unbalanced as Grand Strat, and you begin most games with only one or two planets colonized. However they are pretty distinct and have some unique play styles, so as the game goes on they will distinguish themselves in various ways. You won't find the same ""Already established empires"" style of EU4 system where the entire universe is divided into various blocks though."
4Xgaming,2q4tgk,SharkMolester,2,Tue Dec 23 22:36:19 2014 UTC,"You won't find the same ""Already established empires"" style of EU4 system where the entire universe is divided into various blocks though.   Actually, in addition to the Ancient Galaxy scenario, or whatever it's called, you can set up a game so the galaxy is already completely colonized by the other empires.  During custom game setup, in the screen where you select how many AI empires you want, make it so you set them up manually.  Then change their expansion factor.  The last, biggest setting gives an empire about half the galaxy.  Diplomacy starts from nothing though, so there are no wars or treaties, however, the preset racial biases are still there.  If you leave the expansion factor set to random and change the galaxy age, the empires will each be given a random size with a max size that corresponds to the age of the galaxy.  If the technology is set to random too, it will scale to the size of the empires.    The above also works for the player empire.    BE WARNED  If you set a random race to have half the galaxy and they end up being bugs, don't rage too hard :)"
4Xgaming,2q4tgk,paradoxpancake,2,Wed Dec 24 01:41:58 2014 UTC,"Distant Worlds is as dense as you want it to be. Most beginners start with a large amount of automation and the game's AI is competent. Even more so if you use the enhanced AI mod on the forums.   So, you can focus on whatever aspects that you want of Distant Worlds. I can play now with full manual, at least at the beginning portions of the game. It'll get to a point where you're managing sectors of space at a time or maybe letting planets manage themselves."

I do know having animals you can warg into gives extra prestige and some stats buffs, depending on what animal you have (at the cost of a small opinion malus for non-Old Gods followers, since the southroners just think it's creepy that all these animals are following you).  Playing as a follower of R'h'llor can be pretty fun, though.  If you're Blessed By / Chosen of R'h'llor, you can sacrifice prisoners to get access to fun little things like the ability to heal almost any injury conceivable, including maimed limbs, mental infirmities, etc.  You can either use them on yourself, or you can ""gift"" them onto friends and vassals in an effort to convert them over to the ways of the Red God if they aren't already.

4Xgaming,2q4tgk,SteelChicken,6,Tue Dec 23 23:21:20 2014 UTC,"Check out aurora 4x, its freaking amazing. Its up therle with dwarf fortress in complexity. I'd actuially consider if a more of a grand strategy game than anything paradox has, more to do, more detailed, you need to constantly consider long terms vs short term goals, every ship you make will likely already be outdated by the time you prodice it, colonize planets and systems, fight other races, design every single aspect of your ships, what role it will play, point defence, tanker, transport, damage dealer, carrier, battleship ect from the guns, and what ranges you want to fight at, combat can happen from millions of km away via missiles, or up close and personal with fighters or fast ships, engines, armor levels, crew capacity and size, to the weapons, size, sensor strengths, range, and the missiles, from the warheads to the engines, terraform planets, it is simply amazing. The turns range from 5 seconds to 30 days, which brings another level of gameplay to it, there are enemy's, they don't like you, it will take you 10 months to build a ship to defend yourself, but if you let them find you and destroy your current defences they can bombard earth for days and weeks until you die while you still have months left to wait for your newest ships to come online. Check it out. The graphics arent much, then again they arent really needed, you have enough to look at to play the game.  Check out http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=47678.15795   A forum topic on it on the DF forums, its been going for 4 years and people still post to it.  http://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php  the official aurora forums  http://aurorawiki.pentarch.org/index.php?title=Main_Page  the wiki  http://www.pcworld.com/article/243397/aurora_an_intense_game_of_intergalactic_exploration_and_expansion.html   a review of the game  http://www.reddit.com/r/aurora  the aurora subreddit, not much goes on here though.  The game is awesome, I'm a huge fan of grand strategy games, and as far as space grand strategy's go, there really isnt much out there that actually has real depth to it. aurora fits the bill better than any other game out there in that regard.  When you install it, pay VERY VERY close attention to the installation instructions, do everything spot on as it says, or the game will not work, at all. you will need to install the 5.54 installer and then the patches, its been a while since i've installed fresh, but the information is out there on how to do it. i believe, but double check this, that it just goes 5.54 to 6.4 to 6.43  the game will take you days to learn, There are lets plays out there on it, just setting up a game for the first time i would recommend you watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnYfJ6m68jU  and a few other after that in his series. once you learn the game it is very fun and rewarding, there isn't any sound, so i usuially listen to sci fi themed audio books while playing, I've listened to the ender sage, and am currently working on the Honor Harrington series, which the game is closely based off of."

It runs pretty flawlessly too, 40 hours on record and 0 crashes for me.  I have a tiny 1 GHz CPU and it only starts to drag once I get to the end of the tech tree with 100 colonies and three other AI's.  There's full diplomacy, which the AI is already pretty competent at, enough galaxy creation options to make several different flavors of gameplay- epically slow games with very powerful remnants and 500 stars, to ultra quick 3 star matches, 5 different types of FTL, planets are all unique and important- lose one and an entire section of your empire's economy will collapse domino style.  My only dislikes are the shipbuilder- the combination of scale and size of parts worked better in SR1, but it isn't 'bad', just un-intuitive and it's easily moddable.  The tech tree- I don't know what it looked like before the November update, but the current one is meh.  It's very easy to use and understand, but in return it is very shallow.  Again, it is easily moddable though.  There is also no background for the game, if that matters to you."

4Xgaming,2q4xu1,KaiserTom,3,Tue Dec 23 15:56:50 2014 UTC,"It's completely different than SR1.  You can 'level up' your planets by connecting other planets with certain resources to them- if you lose one of those planets, the leveled up planet loses access to it and produces less.  If the planet that you lost was giving food or water to the leveled up planet, then a timer starts and if you don't replace that food or water, the planet loses the level.  So, if the empire you're attacking has a level 4 planet (currently the highest level, and allows a wonder to be built), and they don't have any spare water planets- taking a water planet will force them to build a water producing building (which costs a sizeable amount of upkeep), or let another planet be de-leveled by taking that planet's water supplier."
4Xgaming,2q4xu1,Firgof,2,Tue Dec 23 19:47:05 2014 UTC,I haven't played for quite a while but can't you have other colonies set to a planet for redundancy? Like 5 level 1 colonies going to one level 2 instead of only 3? So that if you lose one that part won't collapse?

I didnt understand how to use the planets to level up at first but the in game wiki is really easy to read and made it really easy to jump into a game. So far it is one of my favorite strategy games!

I kind of want to see my planets prosper overall, not a system where most planets are thrown under the bus.  Btw, how close is it to release? Been considering it, seems more fun than Galciv 3 is looking..."
4Xgaming,2q4xu1,Firgof,1 point,Wed Dec 24 00:48:46 2014 UTC,"--There is an option to automatically colonize and trade resources to level up planets.  If you colonize a planet, it requires no extra input and is level 0.  If you want to upgrade it to level 1 it requires one food and one water if it doesn't already have them.  Level 2 requires an additional food and a level 1 resource (a level x resource requires that the planet it is on be level x in order to export it)  Level 3 requires yet another food, two level 2 resources and one level 1 resource.  Level 4 requires another food, four level 2 resources and two level 1 resources.    So a level 4 planet requires 5 level 0 planets (food and water suppliers), 4 level 1 planets and 6 level 2 planets.  In total that's 17 water planets, 26 food planets, 10 level 1 and 6 level 2 planets.  61 planets, though in practice it's less due to your homeworld starting at level 1, asteroid resources, other crap. (in my current game, I got a level 1 and 2 asteroid resources in adjacent systems to my homeworld)    BUT, you can, if you wish, build water and food factories on your planets, which cost money to build and maintain, but allow you to level up more planets.   Btw, how close is it to release? Been considering it, seems more fun than Galciv 3 is looking...   I think this is beta 0.4 something."

That's something that irked me about Star Ruler 1, that we could mine dry a whole planet so quickly, and wished there was an option to play with infinite resources.  If a planet has a resource and I sent it to supply another world, does it sort of keep a copy, or it does not count for themselves?  I knew of the factories, but heard they are super expensive, so they are very situational, rather than a case of 'they cost, yes, but using them upgrades this planet and the better income offsets it'.  Only 0.4? Damn, and it looks so finished already. O.o This and Cities Skylines are both still in development and look great already."

Asteroids tend to generate with temporary resources but they sometimes also have infinite ones (even Level 1/2 resources which don't require the usual food/water/etc. to get at).  Not sure where we are in the version numbers right now.  0.5-0.7 sounds about right to me, but we're on r4470ish I think (4470 commits to the repo).

Those shots being fired by thousands of individually rotating turrets on-board each ship shown and impacting upon many thousands more subsystem or armor hexes in the direction they were received.  Suffice to say: The engine is capable of handling nightmareish amounts of unit, subsystem, and so forth processing.  It is a native 64-bit multi-threading optimized program with JIT'd script files which is mainly CPU limited; it should be able to take good advantage of whatever performance you can get to it.

We are finally stopping the whole piggybacking old computers, at long lasI heard there's a colonization range too now? So we cant colonize half galaxy away at will? That's AWESOME, makes so much more sense and keeps empires more consistent.  I think the only thing lacking from Star Ruler 2 that I would like, is an option to make it lane based FTL, rather than free movement.  Free is fun, dont get me wrong, but sometimes I wish we had lanes to plan out chokepoints and such. Maps like those from AI Wars. Shame that game is so odd.  Overall, this looks promising! Between this and Skylines, I have some nice potential games. (Still will hold on a bit, too much burns from pre orders recently, and it's not like steam will run out of codes. ;P)"

4Xgaming,2q43qp,MoXria,4,Mon Dec 22 22:33:34 2014 UTC,Master of Magic!
4Xgaming,2q43qp,ran88dom99,4,Mon Dec 22 23:43:22 2014 UTC,"Age of Wonders.  Spiritual successor to Master of Magic, but updated graphics and such. AoW Shadow Magic was awesome in 2003, and I believe is still available on Steam.  But AoW 3 just came out this year and is worth the money.  You play a wizard growing and running an empire, building cities to produce Elven Unicorn riders and Orc Shock troopers; and learning spells to summon Earth Elementals or Hellhounds.  The main resources are money, mana, and spell research.    There are 6 or so fantasy races, each with their own bunch of units; and your character can choose from 6 classes (like Archdruid and Dreadnought, a steampunk thing) which gives you different spells to learn. You can also choose 3 spell books in things like Creation and Fire Magic which gives you more spells, so being a Dwarf Water Rogue will play different from a Goblin Destruction-and-Earth Warlord.  The exploration is fun, and the world looks pretty and fantasy-ish. It's easy to imagine it as a Lord of the Rings type thing. ""My Halfling hero and his band of Assassins is exploring the mountains to the west; uh-oh, Bandits!  Can my Eagle Riders get there this turn, or should I retreat across the bridge and hide in the forest?""  When your army runs into another army, Fighting is turn-based move-and-attack, with simple cover and flanking mechanics.  It's fun figuring out the best order to do things in: ""I'll attack the elven archers with my Spider because elves are vulnerable to poison; then have my Shaman Curse his Knights to reduce their resistance before my Bard tried to Charm them; if that doesn't work, I'll cast Static Shield on the Bards and hopefully they'll survive the round.""  Your units move around in parties of 6 or less, but adjacent stacks can join in a fight so there may be up to 42 units total in a battle. Each unit has lots of powers to affect their movement and combat, and your Heroes can carry magic items and learn spells; and every power is clearly described for each unit in tooltips.  Believe it or not, the coolest thing is the Random Map Generator.  You can make an archipelago of islands, a few big continents, or one huge (or tiny) landmass; it's full of frozen tundra and mountains and rivers and forests and jungles and swamps and volcanic badlands (different races prefer certain terrains). And there's a million settings for things like how many gold mines, mana nodes, independent cities, monster lairs. You can set them to your preference but I just put them all on Random (love that feature), so each game feels like a different world requiring different strategies.   And the developers are awesome, they seem like a small team that really loves the game. They come out with balance tweaks and maybe a new class or race and some new monsters every few months.  It's not buggy at all, but I did find one easily-avoidable bug a couple weeks ago and emailed them about it; a week later they sent me an email that they fixed it for the next patch.  Downsides: I don't think it's really downside, but the game stays focussed on exploring and fighting and conquering cities and dungeons; it doesn't have religions and complex building and tech trees like Civ.  You can buy nearby cities with gold or do quests for them if your alignments agree, and you can be at War or Peace or Allies with the other players; but ultimately you'll win by breeding big-ass monsters, learning big-ass spells, and whooping some keister without leaving your cities too undefended."
4Xgaming,2q43qp,MeepleTugger,2,Tue Dec 23 04:15:03 2014 UTC,It is much less buggy and user-friendly than warlocks 2 but its little focus on economy and city buildind ans expansion is a put off though.  I did buy it! I love how if you zoom out far enough you get a nice fantasy map! It is brilliant indeed just wish it had a better city building options.   Are there different victory conditions? Is there a way to manage armies? Remove a swordman from one army to another?
4Xgaming,2q43qp,MeepleTugger,2,Tue Dec 23 10:30:26 2014 UTC,"Definitely! When you click a stack, a list of the units appears at the top of the screen. You can click a unit to select/deselect it, so you can choose just the unit or units you want to move.  Right-clicking a unit selects only that unit.  I remember it taking me a while to get comfortable with it, but now it's second nature.   With a little clicking, you can move whatever you want wherever you want. One thing I like about AoW is the limited content (compared to Civ).  There's not a million researches, buildings, races, units, etc.  There's dozens of each, and what there is is well-balanced so that everything has value in different situations, and almost nothing is ""always get"" or ""never get"". I strongly recommend the Golden Realm expansion, it's so worth the money. It adds a new race and some some new spellbooks, and some game mechanics to address your exact concerns. For victory conditions, it introduces Seals and  Empire Quests. Seals are essentially King Of The Hill spaces guarded by Elementals.  Every turn you stand on one you gain a Charge, and the first to x Charges wins.    Essentially, it gives you a way to end the game without the trouble of exterminating everyone; or if you're losing, it gives you a way to throw a Hail Mary. And everyone knows when somebody is getting Charges, so most games end with a multiplayer riot around the Seals. Empire Quests are just a bunch of achievements like ""First person to grow a city to to biggest size gets a permanent bonus to that city"" or ""first person to research everything in their spellbooks gets a new random spellbook."" While not exactly victory conditions, the bonuses are significant and reward you for exceeding at a particular play style. As for city building, it took me a while to get used to the way cities are found in this game, not built; even when using Settlers to build a new city, it will never be profitable unless you choose a location with lots of useful structures near by, and terrain that appeals to the city's Race.  Golden Realms does introduce some more Buildings. Each race now gets a unique defensive structure: the Human Bell Tower shoots arrows at attackers each turn, for example.  And there's buildings anyone can build, but only if the city contains a certain monster site (like a Dungeon let's you build a building that gives all infantry produced there Regeneration, or something).  This makes each city unique: ""I'd better conquer that guy's Elf city and convert it to Dwarves, so I can get that sweet bonus on my Firstborn.  Then my other city will specialize in producing Priests, and my third city with all the gold mines will just Produce Merchandise. "" On top of all that, Golden Realms gives you a new race, 2 new Spellbooks (Wild Magic is a blast) , and several new creatures, structures, and combat maps. If you like AoW, GR is a no brainer.  And if you're not sure, GR may very well put it over the top."
4Xgaming,2q43qp,onmach,3,Tue Dec 23 17:22:07 2014 UTC,"I had read about this, but didn't see the parallels to master of magic, which I fucking loved.  I'm quite a bit more interested now.  Does it have interesting persistent magic like in master of magic like zombie mastery that causes all units who die become zombies under your control?  Or cool summoning spells? Edit: Actually is the spell book / tech tree random at all or will I get the same game each time?  Also is it worth getting for single player play?  I have no real interest in trying to find players to play against."
4Xgaming,2q43qp,MeepleTugger,3,Tue Dec 23 18:57:56 2014 UTC,"Single player is all I ever do. I'm just not a multiplayer guy, I'm too slow.   Apparently the multiplayer is quite fun for some, but one downside is a battle can take 5 - 15 minutes, so in MP you have to either turn on Autobattle (so you can't control your troops, computer tells you who won and who died) or maybe wait 30 minutes some turns while other people resolve fights.    SP is a blast for me, computer players move fast and you can see what they're up to, if you have LOS; planting spies around the board is important. Flying creatures that can hang out on water and hard-to-reach mountains work well, as do sneaky thief types that can be invisible in forests, say.    The persistent spells are great.  You can cast an enchantment that, say, makes an opponent's city lose population and morale every turn, maybe eventually it will revolt. Every turn he can pour mana into weakening or trying to cancel the spell, and on your turn you can strengthen it again.  But you can only spend so much mana total each turn (depending on your caster level), so while you both are locked in this mana clash you probably aren't summoning monsters and doing the other things you want to do.    Once there was 2 dudes attacking my only city right from the get-go, and I knew I couldn't defend it for long. Neither would make peace (and why should they, I was easy pickins).  So I just poured everything I had into casting nasty enchantments on one dude's city until he sued for peace, and I ended up winning that game.  And remember how MoM had that magic realm above the world you could go through to sneak behind enemy lines?  AoW has an Underground map that's similar (if you want, of course; everything about the Random Maps is configurable). If you liked Master of Magic, AoW is the obvious spiritual successor."

Necromancer is a new class that I guess will be part of the next expansion, you can read about it at http://ageofwonders.com/halloween-journal-necromancer-skills/"
4Xgaming,2q43qp,MeepleTugger,2,Tue Dec 23 19:36:14 2014 UTC,"Just noticed your edit. The spell book is similar to MoM (if I recall).  You can choose from around a dozen spells to research; when you finish one, another researchable spell appears to take it's place. The spells tend to appear from weaker to stronger, with some randomness.  What spells are in your book is calculated as follows:  Everbody gets the same set of Arcane spells, simple things like Seafaring and Disjunction (for dispelling magic).  Plus you get a bunch of spells depending on class: Druids get a lot a animal summoning, Warlords get a lot of unit enchantments.  Plus you can choose 3 Specializations, each of which gives you a few more spells: Fire Magic might include Fireball, Creation tends toward healing and protection.  So you'll never get the same spells in the same order, unless you make a point of playing the same type of Wizard."
4Xgaming,2q43qp,onmach,2,Tue Dec 23 22:46:54 2014 UTC,"Okay that's not too bad.  The magic system was always my favorite part of master of magic.  But none that I've tried have even come close to replicating the fun of that system, but this sounds pretty close."

This trend might be acceptable with other genres, but it just doesn't mesh with 4X.   They've made wonderful games in this series, but it just doesn't sound like the company is giving GalCiv III the serious attention and development cycle it needs."
4Xgaming,2punbk,Bowmister,5,Sat Dec 20 09:24:55 2014 UTC,"As far as I understand version 1.0 will be a complete game (maybe not polished, but complete). Any additional features, not being core features, will be free updates or DLCs.  On the other hand game development cycle (especially if you are privately held company / indie) is evolving towards very long evolution model (Minecraft style). So maybe in fact you are right and the game won't be finished in traditional sense when it's released. And I'm okay with it, as long as it feels (to some degree) complete and is enjoyable to play. (The game won't be in state even remotely comparable to War of Magic, we can be sure of that.)"
4Xgaming,2punbk,FiveDogNight,2,Sat Dec 20 12:20:01 2014 UTC,"""Complete"" is relative term and is more marketing and good intentions at best.  The problem isn't their development cycle length.  The first release should have at least ALL the core features implemented.  For myself, this includes ship combat.  This is a 4x game, and they are hobbling one of the most important of ""X""s (exterminate)."
4Xgaming,2punbk,dhivuri,6,Sat Dec 20 14:43:34 2014 UTC,"You're completely misunderstanding what they said... It was never stated ship combat wouldn't be in 1.0, only that the hardcore / casual distinction in shipbuilding wouldn't be."
4Xgaming,2punbk,FiveDogNight,3,Sat Dec 20 15:45:06 2014 UTC,"No I understand.  I'm just not being explicit, so here I go.  Majority of other space 4x games being developed are implementing more advanced ship design/combat than ""put highest level weapon on ship"".  I personally believe they are shooting themselves in the foot by just remaking Galciv2 combat."
4Xgaming,2punbk,Hyndis,2,Sat Dec 20 16:11:30 2014 UTC,"Agree. In my view combat was by far the weakest point for GalCiv2. Ship design was wonderful, but combat was so simple that it hobbled the rest of the game. Why have such detailed ship design when it doesn't matter?  And I'm calling it simple for a game that came out in 2006, based on the standards of 2006. If they do the same thing again in 2014 or 2015 (whenever GalCiv3 is released) that just isn't going to work."
4Xgaming,2punbk,igncom1,2,Sat Dec 20 19:05:46 2014 UTC,"Ship design was cool, but it didn't really amount to anything more then slotting on the guns and engines you wanted.  If the shape of ships mattered, possibly even the actual mass then you'd be getting into wonderful.  EDIT: although other comments are mentioning the placement mattering in 3, so there is that."
4Xgaming,2punbk,KaiserTom,3,Sat Dec 20 20:34:56 2014 UTC,"Ship design will still be in the game as per a much better Gal Civ 2 ship designer, just what they are planning on won't be, which is having two different ""modes"" for ship design, one of which is the ""casual"" which is the ship design we see in 2, and ""hardcore"" where placement of everything actually matters in combat."
4Xgaming,2punbk,dhivuri,3,Sat Dec 20 11:28:53 2014 UTC,"I don't see what's so special about 4Xs regarding this. Even in Civilization 5, I'm sure they thought about trade routes and religions during the development of vanilla and shelved them for the time being, only to bring them back further down the line.  This is just standard, they can't do everything they want, sadly, or else they'll probably never release anything at all. I'd rather trust their judgment on what to prioritise and see what comes next."
4Xgaming,2punbk,FiveDogNight,2,Sat Dec 20 15:47:51 2014 UTC,"So ship design is a focus, and they want it to be meaningful, but not for 1.0 release?  I'm not sure if I understood what they were saying."
4Xgaming,2punbk,Glitchdx,5,Sat Dec 20 05:54:04 2014 UTC,It means they have a deadline they have to meet and some content they want to include won't be ready until version 1.whatever.
4Xgaming,2punbk,FiveDogNight,6,Sat Dec 20 10:09:12 2014 UTC,"Oh I understood that part.  What I didn't get is why they would say it, or not include such a fundamental feature in the initial release.

4Xgaming,2punbk,dhivuri,1 point,Sat Dec 20 14:34:57 2014 UTC,"They said this about the effects of placing different modules at different points on the ship. My guess is that shipbuilding would still be meaningful in 1.0 as far as stats go but you won't have, say, ""weapons on the side can only fire at the side"", instead they'd contribute to the overall attack stat of the ship.  Such a system sounds like a complicated thing to build and I'm sure they have other priorities for 1.0."

Not great, but decent enough that I don't regret the time I spent playing it.  I actually got a bit more play time out of it than Endless Space, which surprised me since FE has/had such awful buzz and ES has/had such great buzz.  LH looks a bit better still, and I do have it, though my free time has tanked lately so I've not checked it out much. Still got in a full game of it that I enjoyed, though.  I guess my point here isn't that GS3 is sure to be a good game, just that they're not completely incompetent. Hopefully they learned their lesson from the Elemental debacle."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,skyline385,2,Mon Dec 22 14:06:24 2014 UTC,Didn't they remake Elemental and gave it free to everyone who bought the original one?
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,Terkala,4,Fri Dec 19 21:43:06 2014 UTC,They did. And the remake wasn't even a finished game by the standards of the first 1.  Their third remake of Elemental produced a pretty mediocre 6/10 quality game. But it was mostly feature complete. I have no idea how Fallen Enchantress got an 85 from PC gamer. Standards have really fallen over there.
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,Hyndis,3,Fri Dec 19 22:02:20 2014 UTC,"FE was a thoroughly mediocre game. It was stable, it was feature complete, it was full fleshed out, it was even polished.  The problem was that the game had, in my view, no soul. It had no spirit, no personality. It was the most generic 4x fantasy game imaginable.  Planetary Annihilation has the same problem. There's nothing wrong with the game from a technical standpoint, but the game is downright bland.  I don't know what went wrong. Supreme Commander 1 was brilliant. How did they go from that to Planetary Annihilation?   Likewise Stardock produced Sins of a Solar Empire. Also a brilliant game, but then Elemental/FE/Legendary Heroes/Sorcerer King (these all seem to be iterations of the same game) keep falling flat. These Elemental games (and Fe, and LH, and SK) are lifeless games. Sins had personality out the wazoo. The ships and stations were gorgeous. Even though the game had no story and it was skirmish mode only, it didn't matter. Just zoom in on a Kol Battleship and look at it. It told its own story.  Perhaps the problem is trying to do everything at once. Attempt to do everything and you end up doing nothing well. Pick what you want to do and focus in on that. Do that thing the best you can possibly do. Go all out. Make that one thing awesome. You won't please everyone, but you'll certainly please enough people to make it worthwhile.  Edit: Looks like Sins wasn't actually made by Stardock, just published by them. Didn't know that. Different people working on Sins and Elemental would explain so much."

4Xgaming,2pt4yq,skyline385,1 point,Sat Dec 20 06:08:35 2014 UTC,Isn't that your opinion? Even on metacritic (where even slightly bad games get shat on) has a good user review rating of it. Both Critic reviews and user reviews saying its a good game doesn't mean standards have fallen just because you didn't like it.
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,Terkala,3,Fri Dec 19 22:07:43 2014 UTC,"It is my own opinion of it. Though steam reviews back me up on Fallen Enchantress being a mediocre quality game. And metacritic user reviews give it a 7.3, which is squarely in the mediocre range for metacritic.  Metacritic is heavily manipulated, you need to actually dig into the review history of the top reviewers. The metacritic 85% doesn't mean much when most of the reviews are from overwhelmingly positive reviewers. Of the top 5, 3 are from small publications, and those 3 are all from publications that post positive reviews 65-80% higher than the average score.  So an 89% from gamingnexus doesn't mean anything when a huge number of all of their reviews are 100 scores. You have to go 4 pages deep on their review page to even find a non-100 score.  I'll be fair, one of their user reviews at a 0 is unfair and written by an idiot who gave them a 0 for it not being an RPG."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,skyline385,-4,Fri Dec 19 22:14:49 2014 UTC,"You mustn't visit Metacritic very often if you think that 7.X there in user reviews is mediocre. People troll on it way too much. Something they don't like; insta 0/10. For a game to be above 7 there, it must have some redeeming qualities.  As for the game, i didn't play it but i have read from lots of people the remake was good enough so i am gonna end this discussion for now. I just feel that a company remaking an entire game and giving it away for free shouldn't be frowned upon as it means they owed up to their mistakes."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,Terkala,5,Fri Dec 19 22:28:54 2014 UTC,"""Here, I know you purchased this turd, now we have finished making it, so now we're rebranding it and selling it a second time. Here is your free 'polished turd'. Aren't we so generous?""   Doesn't change the fact that it isn't any good. It did give me enough interest to pay attention to it and give it a fair shake. But it's still pretty bad."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,FiveDogNight,2,Sat Dec 20 00:11:01 2014 UTC,"ALL of the reviews are other people's opinions.  I don't understand why you would even need to bring up that fact :S  It is hopefully understood without further comment that ""your mileage may vary""...however it can be argued that a general consensus has been reached without trying to dissect meta-critic scores."

4Xgaming,2pt4yq,Ilitarist,2,Fri Dec 19 21:14:35 2014 UTC,It's an ordinary claim with early access games. Besides their previous game was shot on release. Besides we had many great strategy games this year so I doubt OP will die of boredom without GalCiv3.
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,FiveDogNight,0,Fri Dec 19 22:19:48 2014 UTC,"This is obviously a comment left by someone who hasn't played beta 3 of GalCiv 3.   IMHO, it's already better than the base GC2. With 4+ months of development left, it could get MUCH better."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,abbzug,2,Fri Dec 19 22:15:41 2014 UTC,"However this exact statement was said by tons of beta testers for Elemental... and we know how that turned out.  Not to beat a dead horse, but I just felt massive deja vu."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,NotOJebus,3,Sat Dec 20 02:48:51 2014 UTC,"I don't think early access is for people on the fence about games.  If you have any reservations, you might as well wait."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,ran88dom99,3,Sat Dec 20 15:37:00 2014 UTC,"I've seen people complaining of a lack of people who have played the game commenting so I thought I'd throw my piece in.  In its current Beta III state, the game is GalCiv 2 with Hexes. They've added a few things to make the game more interesting but most of these haven't been implemented yet.  Changes they have made that make a difference:  *Black Holes, Nebulas and other ""Terrain"". These things add an interesting dynamic to the map, no longer are ways fought in a straight line to your closest objective, sometimes there are things to go around. You can use these things to retreat or hide. If your ship has fantastic defence and not great attack, nebulas that cut accuracy and speed by half will help you a lot.  *Placeable Shipyards. I love this change, whilst before I would have a few planets for production with shipyards, but now I can have a whole cluster of planets all devoted to production, supplying 1 shipyard, making it far more useful to me whilst also making it a far bigger risk. Right now they aren't perfect, once all your shipyards get destroyed there's essentially no coming back. They also die way too easy. I'm not sure how they can fix this, but right now it needs work.  *Ideology tree. Only the first 3(?) layers of it are available and I already love this. In GC2, your alignment basically was minor bonuses and some diplomacy effects, but nothing too much. I can already tell from just looking that this will have a large effect on your species. They also have some nice flavour text which helps with getting into your role and shaping your civ how you want it (I always found RP'ing in GC2 to be very easy, so my eyes absolutely lit up when I discovered the Ideology tree).  *Colony Management. It now matters where you place your buildings on planets, as adjacent buildings get bonuses. I like this as it makes me actually think about how my colonies are run, as opposed to just ""Farm, Entertainment, spam either Research/Prod/Econ"". It also makes you want to get those terraforming techs a little more, as they might unlock that one extra slot to push your factory from +5 to +6.  *OH and how could could I forget ship design. I never cared much for ship aesthetic, but the new system is amazing, in just a few minutes I had a very 40k looking ship going and was able to use it as a base for other ships. Great improvement.  I've only played 3 games and none very far (The game runs like ass on my rig) so I haven't noticed any other major differences, though this isn't a bad thing, I want an upgrade to GC2 and that's what I'm getting.  My only issue is happiness doesn't make sense any more. It's essentially a number that goes down for reasons that I can't explain that I can increase when I build happiness buildings. I do this until it's not economical for me any more and then my planets just fall into a great depression. My main problem is that my planet might say something like 40% happiness, but when I hover over it, I get a few numbers and percentages in green and a few in red, and I have no idea how to change any of these numbers. This needs to either better explained, removed or changed to make it less of an annoyance. So far it's my only gripe.  Anyway, I recommend you buy it if you liked GC2, if you liked GC2 but still aren't sure, wait for the release. If you haven't played GC2 or didn't like it, I don't know what to recommend as I have played GC2 and loved it.  Hope that helps!  Edit: added a point about planetary building and ship creator"

4Xgaming,2pt4yq,ziekke,2,Tue Dec 23 22:08:18 2014 UTC,So GalCiv3 has multiplayer. What kind of mod support does it have? Same as last GC or what?
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,FiveDogNight,2,Sat Dec 20 00:09:15 2014 UTC,"I'm still waiting for something between incredibly tiny font, and so big it only works on 4k, so I can properly try the game (I play on my TV/couch.)  Not really their fault since I'm not a major demographic, but I've sort of lost excitement for the game in the meantime.  Endless Legend is just so fantastic, and what I have played of GC3 really feels a little too much like GC2."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,Rehcra,4,Sat Dec 20 01:42:58 2014 UTC,Early access isn't worth it. Also... Why is a game going on sale before it's even out yet? That alone is a red flag to me.
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,FiveDogNight,2,Fri Dec 19 21:46:33 2014 UTC,"I bought it, although after the Elemental debacles (and now Sorcerer King?) the developer is making me nervous.  I'm thinking that the reviews are accurate and that the game will be good and keeping with GC2.  EDIT: I am informed that Stardock has hired on some new folks and that the teams appear distinct. Perhaps someone can clarify."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,FiveDogNight,4,Fri Dec 19 21:27:36 2014 UTC,"My abridged non-objective understanding of Stardock:   They were a company making desktop utilities and decided to make some games as a side hobby. Got ""lucky"" with GalCiv 1 & 2 releasing both games into the market without any real competition in an under represented niche genre with expectations that were 10years old. Painfully learned with Elemental that you can't stick a bunch of mechanics together and call it game. Hired some people with actual game design chops. Are slowly and publicly learning how to design games as they go.   I wish them well, and am optimistic about GalCiv 3, but knowing all that I know....I can't justify picking up the game until its done."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,MilesBeyond250,2,Sat Dec 20 03:02:15 2014 UTC,"So much speculation and no actual experience. It saddens me to see everyone so cynical and opinionated about a game that, by the looks of it, none of you have played.  It's in remarkably good shape and the developer is listening. However, Early Access is a crapshoot. I can stream it for you, if you'd like."
4Xgaming,2pt4yq,pdxsean,2,Fri Dec 19 22:32:10 2014 UTC,"I bought it, a few weeks ago with a 50% off coupon, along with Sorcerer King.   I played a game of it. And honestly to me it feels just like GC2 (which I will grant you I haven't played in a few years). I didn't care for 2, so it didn't impress me much. But once it is 'finished,' I'll give it another go.  The ship design, doesn't seem important enough to bother with. I never had any conflicts, that needed worrying about. The 'exciting and new' economy slider, I set once and forgot. I basically built a few scouts, and tried to pump out colonies, faster than the other guys. Build as many constructors as you can, to build bases for area control.  Next turn... Next turn... Next turn... Move/Use colony ship/contructors... Repeat../    AI diplomacy seemed standard (read weak). I liked the 'discover tech/can't research everything' and the tech focus, but it really isn't that ground breaking.   I suppose if someone loved GC2, they will love GC3. If not, then not.  Give me a nice updated SotS1 or MoM. AIWar and EU4 will probably continue to hold me until then."

Regardless, two points;  1) This post refers to a mod by a very dedicated and valued community member, CrunchyGremlin, who has done a lot of work altering the game's performance and functionality through a novel code injection mod called Blackbox. However, it does not represent official game development, and isn't affiliated with the developer.  2) There is absolutely no ""buy in"" to using the mod. Crunchy had received multiple requests over the months to create a paypal link so that fans of the mod could support his efforts. He really dragged his feet in doing that because he always felt uneasy about introducing a monetary element into his work, but it's there now. However you can, and always could, get the mod for free.  TLDR: It's a mod by CrunchyGremlin that you can get for free. The donation link is incidental."

Also, remade? Echo was doing this video as a sort of rematch. But you can save scenarios, if that's what you mean."
4Xgaming,2pu23i,ran88dom99,2,Sat Dec 20 01:30:55 2014 UTC,The same as in SD1. I mean here we are at the same level of complexity as SD1's development ended at. Maybe Switching to unity means SD3 will be all improvement over SD2.

4Xgaming,2poahz,FalseTautology,4,Fri Dec 19 03:52:22 2014 UTC,"I think Endless Legend is a good game, but I'd be hesitant to call it a great game.  Its a 4x game with a lot of customization and a focus on macro rather than micro management. You do not directly control units in armies, but instead give overall orders. As with all combat, your plans rarely survive contact with the enemy. Each faction has significant differences which is good.  My problem with the game is that the end game gets boring. Once you get your stack of doom its all over. The AI just cannot compete. Then you're just conquering one province after the other with your wrecking ball.  The end game momentum so common in 4x games is in full swing on Endless Legend. Once you get that momentum rolling you've won. Even if you only control a quarter of the map, once your stack of doom gets moving the game is over. Its just a mop-up operation after that.  That said, the game is pretty good. It has high production values. The game looks downright gorgeous. UI is slick and informative without being clunky. The game's main weakness is towards the end. Early game is great. Mid game is pretty good. End game is boring.  I don't think any 4x game has really figured out the late game doldrums. How do you stop that steamroller effect?"

4Xgaming,2piffc,SharkMolester,1 point,Wed Dec 17 10:42:36 2014 UTC,Ugh... I don't like that one :)  Why exactly you like it? Is it about replayability? Or about not knowing what you will find next (no information)? Or just about immersion/realism? Or about something else?
4Xgaming,2piffc,SharkMolester,3,Wed Dec 17 22:18:43 2014 UTC,"Replayability, I guess.  Having to adapt your game to what winds up being available tech-wise.  Constraints like that make for a more interesting game than just going for the same things every time."
4Xgaming,2piffc,SharkMolester,3,Thu Dec 18 09:43:50 2014 UTC,"If you like Vicky's you should take a look at Darkest Hour's-  http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/games/1/14/13724/thumb_620x2000/5aircraft.png  Personally, I do like to be able to just click a tab and see a few dozen techs, rather than the endless scrolling of the trees, as in literally every game ever.  Makes planning and comparing techs much easier.  I've come up with this idea of having 'epochs'.  Like have 5 or so 'levels' of your empire's maturity, like infantile, adolescent, prime, golden age and twilight.  Then you can choose between a few choices at each stage, for each tech group.    Like for ship designs and tactics you can choose to focus on small, maneuverable craft, or huge lumbering dreadnaughts, which automatically sets out the techs you will be able to research. (like in HoI, where there's multiple groupings of naval air and land doctrines, Russia gets human wave, America gets superior firepower, Germany gets Blitzkrieg)    Each of the choices are available in each epoch, so long as you have the appropriate research, but they have different names depending on the epoch.  Like dreadnaughts for instance-   infantile- The Romantic Age of the Ships of the Line,  adolescent- The Chaotic Age of the Ironsides,  Prime- The Era of the Unstoppable Dreadnaughts, Golden Age- The Radiant Days of the Leviathans, Twilight- The Waning Years of the Colossi   Then for socio-economics you can choose between whatever economic and social theories and what-not, and you get to pick an 'accomplishment'.  If you choose space-communism during your golden age, you get to build a ringworld on your most prosperous system, if you choose space-mercantilism, you get jump gates built on several of your key systems, for example.    And when you finish up your empire's twilight years, something incredibly awesome, or tragic happens and the whole race just disappears.  Then you start all over, on the same map, with all the infrastructure and other alien races still going.  Like a combination of David Brin's Uplift series and CKII.  /thinking out loud"

But I wonder, these categories in HoI are perfectly categorized into unit types (infantry, armour, air, sea), with SF techs... I don't know if it would make sense. Here you have more like scientific division (energy, construction, computers, physics, sociology, chemistry)  As for epochs and other mutually exclusive choices, I think these should be done via some sort of ""government choices"" instead of research.

Just wondering, personally I kind of agree with you...   Take Endless Space's for example.  You're halfway through each of the four tech trees.  There's ~4 techs in each tree available.  You narrow that down to one, or maybe two, then you have to compare between the different trees.  Look at a tech, drag the mouse, drag the mouse, drag the mouse, you over shot, drag back, look at a tech, repeat 10 more times.

Well, HoI, being a wargame about a very specific period of time, about which there are shit-tons of information, is extremely granular.    Yes... While clear and easy to find what you want, I don't think it fits SF theme in sense what you get from what (what I liked in Endless Space or MOO2 is that you were getting more than one thing from a path, like ship hulls + industrial buildings form Construction in MMO2).

I agree, I was just giving an offhand explanation as to why it's like that.  Also, you definitely can have a branching tech tree, with multiple techs per slot, just like the HoI tree.  The Black Ice mod has the most contorted, convoluted tech tree I've ever seen.  Dependencies, branches, infrastructure and event requirements, mutually exclusive choices out the wazoo, it's amazing (but pretty overwhelming).

4Xgaming,2piffc,elblanco,2,Fri Dec 26 14:54:41 2014 UTC,"The interface doesn't really matter to me, as long as it fits the aesthetic of the game and the techs are cool.  Also, emergent 'technology' is nice.  Like being able to construct a ringworld out of things that you already researched and not having to research 'how to build ringworlds' even though you have level 50 gravitic distortion and level 45 metallic polymers or whatever and have just popped a few stars into existence."
4Xgaming,2piffc,elblanco,3,Fri Dec 26 22:04:37 2014 UTC,"You might also tie parts of the tech tree to activities that are not just research. Like discovering a certain kind of material on some small percentage of planets in the universe unlocks parts of the tree, but then you have to mine that material (and defend it).  Or maybe only espionage of another race or capturing one of their ships or something will move the tree forward.  Alternately define some kind of technology that has different types and are expensive to research, and then build trees have to follow that type. For example, power generation might either come from nukes, zero point energy, cold fusion, casimir effect capture, nutrino capture, etc. and you can only build certain types of engines for each kind of energy, which leads you to only allow certain ship designs allowable, and a civilization can only ever know about one kind of energy type."
4Xgaming,2piffc,chewvader,2,Wed Dec 17 12:20:18 2014 UTC,"I see a lot of people want mutually exclusive choices of some sort. Is that just my impression?  Do you want research to be about mutually exclusive choices OR do you want some sort of mutually exclusive choices in the game, not necessarily in research?"
4Xgaming,2piffc,ran88dom99,3,Wed Dec 17 22:30:08 2014 UTC,"I don't think it has to be mutually exclusive per se. Just that the cost of going down more than one path should be high, enticing the player to keep pursuing the route they happened to end on.  There's real-life analogs like this all the time. Like buying an Xbox or a Playstation. It's easier/cheaper to just keep buying games and peripherals for the console you have rather than do so with both. Once you've made your choice you're ""committed"" to that path, but not exclusively so. If you really wanted to, instead of buying a half dozen games for the platform you have, you save up instead and buy into the new platform.  So like in a 4x game, you might put all your beans into jump-gate technology and build out a huge jump-gate network now that the research is done, or you could have invested in space folding FTL drives instead. You can have both, but the game can make it hideously expensive to dissuade doing that."
4Xgaming,2piffc,ran88dom99,2,Thu Dec 18 01:35:38 2014 UTC,"I don't think you can really do that for any 4x game considering how many things you need.  If you dump all of your science into laser weapons you might have some really awesome lasers, but what if the other guy is shooting missiles at you? Do you have any countermeasures for missiles?  The recent trend seems to be making weapon systems be a rock paper scissors sort of thing. Kinetic, energy, and missile weapons each requiring their own counter.  Sword of the Stars II did research well, I thought. There were benefits to focusing but it wasn't too expensive. And not everyone would get every tech. What I didn't like was how amazingly clunky SotS2's UI was, nor the bugs in tactical combat which would frequently cause ships to go dumb and stop responding."

Before Steam it cost 100 bucks to buy, thanks to a region they want $29.99 from me now but still for those money I can get Endless Space + Addon + Endless Legend and I'd have spare change to buy Civilization next time they sell it for $0.49 or something.

4Xgaming,2op881,Xalimata,4,Tue Dec 9 04:38:59 2014 UTC,Start with this awesome guide.  http://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=3508583  If you have any issues this collaborative series got me into the game it the people playing it do a great job explaining what they are doing as they go along.  http://youtu.be/8Mqe63NeKwY?list=PLGB6RkFB7ZmPF2xNNcuqNMiMtLXRgD6nZ  If you're still unsure then I'd check out the mods. I've played the heck out of the Picard Era mod and love that. The Star Wars one feels a bit unbalanced but it's pretty dang comprehensive and awesome.  Distant Worlds is by far my favorite 4x so I am a bit of a fan boy but I think most people will at least like it once they get over the hump. Hope that helps!
4Xgaming,2op881,Beanchilla,3,Tue Dec 9 04:45:26 2014 UTC,Thanks I'll give the game another try.

4Xgaming,2op881,nolok,1 point,Tue Dec 9 22:31:25 2014 UTC,"The reason why the game feels like this, is that there are too many stuff at once when you start a normal game. Back in one of the extension, they added a ""pre-warp"" start/era, it's not the default but it's a perfect start up because things are slow AND you have little of everything so you can handle properly each thing as it comes and see what it does.  A WARNING: in normal or higher difficulty pre-warp, pirates are king. Pirates WILL decimate you and gang up on you and run all your progress in one fell swoop. Thankfully, when creating a game you can make pirates ""weak"", which you want to do for you first couple of game when you are only learning the mechanics. It's still totally possible to learn the game in pre-warp with string pirates (I did it that way ...) but if you're on the verge of quitting the game that can break you :)  Start pre-warp (you get one world and like two ships, things are super slow due to no warp), automate ship design, manually handle diplomacy / construction (base and ships) / research / colonisation / tax rate / ... Set notifications for everything, any events will show up and you can be informed about it (either in top menu or side popup).  You will get to learn all aspects one by one with a slow start, so you have time and you understand what you do. You're flying your scout ships by hand, select construction (by constructor ship and in space station) one by one manually, answer to pirate attacks yourself ...  Then when you grow, you enable what you want to take off on the fly (eg, once you have more than 3-4 systems, automate mining construction), you disable the warnings you don't care about, and from then on you decide where you want to go and what you like to handle yourself.  Ship design should be done manually only after you have a correct grasp of the game."

This subject has been discussed extensively and almost everyone who is familiar with how the dev handled SD1 got left with a bad taste in their mouth.    I'll admit the game had a lot of potential but you can tell the game was never really finished or polished.  Maybe Zero the dev learned a valuable albeit costly lesson with SD1.  However the 4x community will not be quick to forgive the SD dev.

It was sold with promised features that never materialized. It never said this on steam, but while it was on steam the game's webpage did promise multiplayer and some other stuff still. This was eventually changed everywhere but kickstarter...because they couldn't. This is relatively minor. The game is unstable across a wide range of PCs, has balance issues, and is widely considered unplayable without mods by even it's fanboys.  The most popular modder has to work without the source code to an admittedly dead game that is still being sold, but is only playable at all because the modder's work exists. Holding back the source code to your abandoned game and relying on someone to hack around your code to fix it....basically to help you make money is pretty shitty. The Developer acted like a complete child throughout, never apologized, and continues to sell an unstable, unfinished mess for $30, all while censoring any negative comments and/or warnings he can.   The Developer has acted in a completely duplicitous manner and continues to act as such."

The game needed more time polishing and working out the bugs.   Unfortunately the game did not receive this, so those people who did end up buying it paid for an early access game not advertised as such.  The same people in the same positions will probably do the same thing.  Maybe Stardrive 2 will be an amazing game. Maybe. Or perhaps not. I don't know.

The most recent patch was released on July 20, 2006. In October 2006, an expansion titled Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption was released.

4Xgaming,2o2x1s,Doranbolt,3,Tue Dec 2 20:43:14 2014 UTC,"You could try Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic, which is AoW3's predecessor. There are already quite a few unit and balance mods out there, my favorite being MP Evolution  The graphics are  a bit dated, but it's an excellent game, and a lot of things will be familiar for you since you've already played AoW3, like the adjacent hex system, spell casting, and moving units.   There are some flaws, however, like the AI is completely unable to build settlers themselves, which mean you might want to hold off on building your own citites or play on emperor. Another issue with the AI is that water and mountains are blockades in this game, and only specialized units can traverse them. Ships are needed to transport units across water, and the AI is not very good at it.  Other things you might notice are that the stats and mechanics of how units work in combat is different. Instead of a pile of health, attacks and defense work together to calculate if a unit hits his target or not. In short, high attack value versus a low defense value mean your unit will be able to hit the enemy unit more often than not. The reverse is true for high defense over low attack. Spells are a bit different too, as you can cast spells with every hero with spellcasting who is a part of the battle, and your main hero can cast spells in any battle as long as there is at least one hero in the battle or within your domain. There are also permanent (with upkeep) unit enchantment spells that buff your units, and income structures are no longer tied to a city but independent on the map. Finally, the controls are inverted, so that might take some getting used to. I know I had a hard time adapting to the AoW3 controls."
4Xgaming,2o2x1s,DigiAirship,2,Wed Dec 3 09:41:14 2014 UTC,"Can you elaborate a little on why you prefer it to Civ?   I found out about it on the Steam Sale. I didn't pull the trigger, but I'm still intrigued and haven't seen a good Let's Play to understand what the game really is."
4Xgaming,2o2x1s,cooper_the_corgi,3,Tue Dec 2 22:15:46 2014 UTC,"Some of the things I liked over civ:   Fantasy setting   As much as I can appreciate a more or less historically accurate RTS game, I really prefer fantastic universes (elves, dwarves, etc.)   Combat   The combat in AoW just seems to click for me, something that didn't happen in Civ or sins. Specifically, I like being able to cast spells in battle that serve some strategic purpose but don't feel entirely overpowered.   Character Customization   I'm a big fan of the player being able to create content, hence why I'm looking for something with mod support. To that end, I like how I can create my own hero units in the game. Its pretty rudimentary character creation, but I still find it fun to bring my own characters in and have them battle it out."
4Xgaming,2o2x1s,Hyndis,3,Tue Dec 2 23:01:55 2014 UTC,"I picked up Endless Legend during the recent Steam sale, and I'm enjoying it.  It plays very similar to AoW3 and it is also extremely simple to mod. Its just xml files. Easy.  That said, I do think Endless Legend's balancing is a bit off. By default, cities are captured way too quickly and too easily. A single battle can decide the fate of an entire empire. Once one battle is lost and one army is lost, cities are steamrolled nearly instantly. Fortunately slowing down the game pace (or speeding it up if you want) can be done with only a few minutes of notepad.  The game is enjoyable. It just needs some adjustments. Fortunately the game was built with adjustments in mind."
4Xgaming,2o2x1s,Hyndis,2,Wed Dec 3 03:11:47 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I'll give it a try! :)"
4Xgaming,2o2x1s,Terkala,2,Wed Dec 3 03:53:57 2014 UTC,"The fun thing about Endless Legend is that its actually a sci-fi game. Its just that their civilization collapsed so long ago that all of those highly advanced technologies have turned into myth and legend. Magic and sorcery is in fact merely very advanced science. But most everyone is running around with swords and crossbows because the technology level has regressed so far.  And whats worse? The planet is spinning out of control. It seems to have been knocked from a stable orbit, doomed to be an exoplanet to wander the frigid expanse of deep space forever.  Every winter is worse than the last. Its like Game of Thrones style winter. Its bad. Really bad. And it goes downhill from there.  Its a pretty grimdark game when you think about it. Everyone is battling to control a world that is doomed anyways."
4Xgaming,2o2x1s,TheSwarmLord,4,Wed Dec 3 12:37:57 2014 UTC,"Try Dominions 4. It has a lot of the same overall features (especially character customization). But combat is more hands-off, you set combat behaviors/tactics/spells and then let it run.   It has a huge number of nations, and all of them are actually well balanced and good at what they do. It has nations for atlantis, roman legionnaires, satyrs&minotaur armies, literal angelkin and devilkin, to undead legions. Each of which has an extremely different playstyle.  The character customization comes in with your god. You choose a template for your god (such as a dragon, or an ascended mage, or a blood fountain, ect), and then apply your own customization in terms of what worshipping that god does to the land, and what kind of magic that god has. Your diety ""fountain of blood"" could cause magic to drain from the land and cause despair to flow from your dominion, for example.  You can also recruit champions to lead your armies, much as AOW3, but you don't really level them up. They do gain experience and long lasting combat wounds over time though, and you can equip them with better magic and better items though.  All in all, the game is more about the big-scale battles. Each side can easily get up to 400 v 400 battles by the midgame. Late game I've seen upwards of 1,000 troops on each side.  The graphics are not as good though, because it's sprite-based graphics. That's compensated for by every nation having entirely unique units, which brings the in-game unit count up to over 1000 different unique units (though obviously you don't need to study the exact details of them). Many times the difference in unique units is ""this is the kind of undead that are raised from peasant bodies, these are the kind of undead raised from units with spears, from units with hammers, from units with swords and shields, ect ect ect"". So the same soldier will have 4-5 entries just for their different kinds of equipment.  TLDR: Dom 4 is ""my army of 800 skeletons being led by their shadowlord with his black blade of disease have come to rip the life from the earth""   AOW3 is ""my 4 guys on horses and their mech-suit commander take over your kingdom""."

4Xgaming,2nzpgi,jayman601,2,Tue Dec 2 00:10:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks for letting me know. Are all the opponents in EU and Victoria 2 human or mostly human?   There is single player and multi player for almost every paradox game, and there are usually groups that play fairly regularly.    And how much micro management is there? Less is better so I can focus on grand strategy more?   Depends. You can micro a lot in them or you can micro very little (by my standards at least). In Vicky, for example, there is an entire menu full of data and sliders and selections for trade. But, you can go the entire game without even opening it (ai takes care of it). There is a lot of data presented usually, but most you can ignore.    Also are they turn based?   They are, in my opinion, a hybrid. It goes by certain time lengths that represent a turn, usually a day. You can speed up time or slow time or pause whenever you want and however you want. It's all the benefits of both turn based and real time. You can drop in and drop out whenever you like though, and judging by the OP that's what turns you away from RTS."

4Xgaming,2nuyii,Trollatopoulous,2,Sun Nov 30 19:58:21 2014 UTC,You can't really go wrong with any of the popular titles. For someone just starting out Warlock 2 is pretty good and doesn't require too much knowledge of previous 4x games to do okay and have fun. My favorites are the Endless Space/Legend games because of their atmosphere. I'd say they're medium in difficulty.
4Xgaming,2nuyii,Cai_E,2,Sun Nov 30 20:03:43 2014 UTC,"Start with Civ 5 as that is the standard of the genre and has a large fanbase for tutorials, etc.    Then fire up Europa Universalis III and pick a big and powerful country.  You should be able to walk over the AI with ease while learning the game.  England for example has good tech and is easy to protect due to the fact you're on an island.  You can pick smaller countries or countries not on the European tech tree to up the difficulty.    Alternatively if you want something with a new tech feel to it, do Hearts of Iron II and play as America.  You can focus on naval combat in the Pacific or play around with land combat in North Africa.  HoI2 also has a fairly forgiving logistics engine so that isn't too brutal.    If you really want to do land warfare in HoI2, pick the USSR.  You'll have a bad stretch right when the Germans invade, but you'll be fine in the long run likely.  Germany is actually a hard nation to get started on since to avoid the historical outcome (losing) you need to execute the invasion of France fairly quickly and also get a Sealion pulled off.    From there you can move onto other Paradox games such as Crusader Kings II which is the best of their portfolio currently, but definitely has a curve."

I do play games like Crusader Kings II, so I'm not too opposed to learning a game by myself."
4Xgaming,2np53b,Cai_E,3,Sun Nov 30 19:56:32 2014 UTC,"It's not that difficult.  I picked it up yesterday and am 250 turns into a 600 turn length game, Normal difficulty, and I'm the top ranked faction by a fair margin.  I did have some experience with Fallen Enchantress prior to this that helped, but I ran the tutorial on this one and it did a fair job on teaching me how to play it.  If you play CK2 and you've ever thought to yourself that you want more custom control over your army composition, how your troops deploy, how they fight, etc then buy it.  You get to fight on the terrain and can use it.  For example I just finished off a battle where some silic giants/elemental type things were a problem, so I used ranged crossbow and a hero to murder them.  My units were happily deployed on a cliff top and the silic giants died before their slow movement allowed them to get around the cliff and in melee range of my units.  I can custom equip my heroes, design my own units (in the vein of Alpha Centauri, if not with quite as many options), and micromanage my cities.  If you are happily playing CK2 and thinking ""I'm so happy I don't have to deal with that micro level stuff."" then this might not be the game for me.  This game is fun in that you can move the stacks around but then it zooms in for a six phase battle when stacks meet.    Now the game isn't quite as polished as some might like, how it zooms down onto the map personally annoys me, and a few other minor tweaks, but overall I'm happy.  It offers a nice level of customization and I'm having fun with it.  If micro level tweaks (like what specific ring a specific unit wears) doesn't excite you, then you're more likely to notice a few of the rough edges and dislike the game."

I only have two small armies and two unit types currently (Crossbow Archers and Centaur Calvary)  currently out and deployed and I'm doing just fine, but I'm mostly pursuing a domination via industry/colonization model and avoiding wars.    My faction itself has three basic unit types, infantry, cavalry, and a defensive unit and you can be competitive with just them.  I'd imagine if I was doing total war I'd be much more focused on tweaking my units and my heroes.    Also to be honest I'm not sure how much better my centaur cavalry is (I assimilated them into my Empire) vs just being flavor.  I'll have to see if they give me a real edge when I get into a war."

I like war and stuff, but I also like 4X games that allow you more than one way to victory. Civ V is famous for having multiple paths, but always critisized that a military victory is the only viable one. Is Endless Legend similar?"
4Xgaming,2np53b,Cai_E,2,Sun Nov 30 23:41:17 2014 UTC,"I've mostly being using the game's diplomacy Civ 5 style, to keep people from ganging up on me as I knock them out one by one.  That said the game does have an interesting take on diplomacy.  Every citizen in your nation can be assigned to focus on the production of crops, production output, dust (gold and mana rolled into one), and influence.  You can use influence to socially engineer your nation, you can use it to assimilate minor factions, and you can use it for diplomatic actions.  As you use it, you lose it.    I've spent almost all of mine internally since I'm focusing on leading in science and production, so my influence has been spent to gain bonuses through social engineering in that area.    There is this faction of dragons that is supposed to produce insane amounts of influence which can be used to end wars and force deals on other people.  There is also a faction creator so you can create influence rich factions.  There is also a trade centered nomadic faction (you build your cities on the backs of giant scarabs and migrate around).    That said, given the map size and the focus on obtaining resources, I feel as if the game has a bias towards ""Kick your neighbor's ass and take his stuff.""  style of play.  You can likely do a fair amount with the diplomacy and trade, but it isn't like CK2 where you can play the dynasty marriage game to get your hands on stuff without ever hitting the declare war button, etc."

4Xgaming,2nln42,ran88dom99,1 point,Sun Nov 30 23:38:57 2014 UTC,"Actually no, to the best of (my own meager) understanding it is linked to the processor and the amount of reading/writing to the database. Thats why faster single cores and a SSD help but more ram or video processing do not.  Aurora running its processes is kinda like a boot up process for a OS-- lots of little tiny randomly positioned data. SSD speeds up aurora for the same reason it speeds up a boot-up process."

4Xgaming,2nk4gu,Silent-Viper,10,Thu Nov 27 07:03:16 2014 UTC,"Star Ruler 2 is so far coming out really nicely from what I have been hearing and what I have played. I haven't played it in a while but I'm gonna copy and paste my thoughts so far on it.  It's only early access so far but they have expanded on a lot and made it into something you could call more of a game than the glorified experiment the first game was.  Diplomacy and the senete is completely unique and very intersting for a space strategy, votes can be manipulated in very unique ways and you can cause chaos politically between players as you keep manipulating votes to swap systems back and forth between two players.  Planet development can and is largely automated on the per planet scale. This is also a very interesting system and pretty damn cool and very reminiscent of Emporer of the Fading Suns. Planets have 4 development levels, every planet starts as level 1 and gives a level 1 resource. You connect enough different level 1 resources to a planet (often your homeworld) and it develops into level 2 and provides a level 2 resource. Enough different level 2 resources and it develops into level 3, yada yada up to level 4 where the planet becomes pretty powerful and where unique and potentially game winning things can be done with it if others don't have their own level 4.   You're essentially having border agricultural worlds provide inner industrial worlds which provide for commercial worlds which all focuses on wherever you chose the heart of the Empire to be. Individual planets potentially matter a lot more now, while level 1 planet trade routes can be replaced with another level 1 somewhere else in your empire, if the enemy takes one of your level 2s, you may be in a little trouble, since it takes time for planets to develop after given the resources to do so. It allows natural choke points to form in an open map game and that is really cool.  Ships are now clustered into ""fleets"" with support ships, which is any other ship, and a, probably giant and with super awesome weapons, flagship in the middle controlling it all, these flagship and support ships being fully customized by you, size and modules, as per Star Ruler fashion.  Ship design is better, you are given a layout and the position of your bridge, guns, armor, power supply, everything, now matters since you take damage in that area. If you put your power supply in the unamored back of the ship and someone flanks you and hits you in the rear, you are dead in the water, no more arbitrary module destruction like in the first game, you can now actually more or less aim your fire, at least via flanking.  FTL now exists and is another interesting mechanic. You are given a global resource which represents your ""FTL energy"" which powers one of various FTL drives, most of which you fit to your one of your flagships, such as a basic hyperdrive, point and go, wormholes, instant travel but 2 way, and gates, travel to any gate in the Empire but have to pay constant maintenance of FTL energy per gate. You also have ""flinging"" which you set up a station, a ""fling beacon"", and use it to ""fling"" ships anywhere you want very efficiently, though highly inaccurate at distance if you don't have a ""fling beacon"" on the other side. STL will still be the main form of travel, but it adds a nice layer to the military strategy.  Overall I think they will end up delivering a very good product, and something that could very well etch it's own place in 4X history. It was a definite buy for me."
4Xgaming,2nk4gu,KaiserTom,3,Thu Nov 27 09:28:07 2014 UTC,"Is there going to be more automation in there?  I recently tried to get into the first game of the series again, but what puts me off is the amount of things to do. You can colonize every single planet and research is pretty fast, so you have to design new blueprints every so often, when a new module is researched. Sure, I have planet governors and I use them, but they aren't helping that much. I still have to micromanage defenses and fleets. Sadly there is no ship automation, so that I either have to use static defenses in systems and leave them undefended in the beginning. Moving fleets around to new systems is tiresome, and when I'm doing this to help defend from pirate attacks, I usually lag behind in colonization compared to the AIs.  I feel that this game has a bigger scope than Distant Worlds in the strategic aspect, with nearly every system having multiple colonizable worlds, but offering less to mitigate the amount of management that is needed to maintain such an empire. I'd love it if I could tell governors not only to build the buildings, but to also always have a couple of defense stations in orbit and building a small fleet to defend the system.   One of the few things that were great in Star Ruler was the fleet management system: Set a fleet up, then after a battle simply single out damaged ships and request replacement for those and the lost ships, without needing to select which ships or even the need to have those ships already built.  That said, I really like the concept of Star Ruler, but the amount of micromanagement has put me off from the game since the beta. That and the wonky combat system with the ships performing some odd space ballet. I would have really liked it if they could use a max speed for combat engagements."
4Xgaming,2nk4gu,Cheet4h,3,Thu Nov 27 11:41:26 2014 UTC,"They are trying a lot of things to simplify strategic decisions, like UI changes and being able to colonize planets from a strategic point of view, you no longer have control of coloziners, you just tell your empire to colonize a planet and it produces ships.   The dev have also said they are also trying to make the game operate a lot slower and more strategically because they realize the first game went way too fast and was very micro intesive and put off a lot of people, just like you said. Planets aren't just things you wildly colonize in the second game anymore, at least at first, you have to pay attention to the resources and their position in space that they provide since that is really what is going to develop your planets to higher levels.  Like I said, Ships are now forced to be clustered into fleets with however many ships based on the support of the flagship. The fleets are also a lot smarter and can be controlled from a more strategic view. Capturing planets isn't done on a fully planet by planet basis but you output influence on the star system by having the fleet there, which is of course sped up by bombing the crap out of the planet, and eventually you take over the system entirely.   Truthfully I haven't played the early access enough to know enough about the second game currently to alleviate some of your concerns but so far from what I have played, it's coming along pretty solidly, and the dev views of what the game should be falls directly in line with what your (and mine) concerns are with the first game."

4Xgaming,2nk4gu,SharkMolester,3,Fri Nov 28 15:49:59 2014 UTC,"In SR 2, because of the flagship/ support ship system they have, and the upkeep that flagships require, the number of fleets you have is very limited.  I was playing a 100 star map with two other empires and I only had 3 fleets, one at home and one off skirmishing with each of the other empires.  Of course, I could have made dozens of smaller flagships if i wanted to, and in a multiplayer game that would probably be more beneficial.    Each fleet is commanded by exactly one flagship, which can cost an infinite amount of money to keep running depending on how big you make them.  Each fleet has an amount of support ships which can be any size you like, but your flagship has to have enough logistic capability to control them.  Your empire builds support ships automatically and for free if you have a certain common resource.  They will circle the planet(s) that you are using this resource on.  Each planet has a certain maximum amount of support ships that they can hold.  If your game goes on long enough and you have enough of the defense resource, you could theoretically give every planet in your empire a full complement of support ships."

What really aggravates me is that underneath all of the crash bugs, performance bugs, and broken things you can see a brilliant game. Its a diamond in the rough.  The problem with a diamond in the rough is that you have to polish it to get its true potential to shine forth. Stardrive 1 had immense potential, but because the game lacked any form of polish all its buyers were left with was a useless rock.  Its one thing if a game was rotten to the core. Stardrive wasn't. At its core, it was a great game. The problem is that this great game was only hinted at. Players could get a glimpse of it, but they were kept away by bugs and other problems resulting from a rushed schedule. Development has since ceased completely, leaving it forever a gem in the rough.  In a word, I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed that Stardrive's potential was squandered. It was a great idea, but a terribly executed one. This game failed to live up to its potential.  If you want a far superior game that has a similar playstyle then I strongly recommend Distant Worlds: Universe. It has customizable ships that can be designed from the ground up, same top down, 2d sort of graphics, and the game is very well polished. Its perfectly stable. It does not crash."

Master of Magic, Master of Orion 2, and Fall From Heaven 2 (FFH2 is not a retail game, it's a fantasy total conversion mod for Civ 4:BTS. And when I say total conversion I mean TOTAL.)  Master of magic I love. It's the greatest fantasy strategy game of all time IMO. Similar to how you can customize your race in MOO2, you can customize your wizard in MoM. There is a 9 unit per tile limit on the overworld, and battles are fought in a tactical map. The magic system is VERY well done, with each of the five schools (roughly analogous to Magic the Gathering's colors) having their own strengths and weaknesses. Life is all about buffing your nonmagic units and your cities, Nature has a mix of buffs and summoned units, chaos is about direct damage and summons, sorcery is about interfering with other players magic, and death is about debuffs and undead. There are up to 6 hero units per ""civ"" which can level up more than a normal unit, and can also equip items. The items can be found or created by a player. What spellbooks you chose during wizard creation determines what powers you can give an item.  If a lot of those features sound familiar, it's because a fuckton of games have tried to be a spiritual successor to MoM. Not fuckin one of 'em has topped it yet. Even with it's dated graphics (1995!) and god awful sound, it is still the best of the subgenre.  Master of Orion 2 I love. The techs are neat, the ship design is awesome, the races are cool and customizable, and it can still run in windows 7/8 (although you need to kill explorer.exe while playing due to a palette bug).  Fall From Heaven 2 is the best fantasy strategy game since Master of Magic. It's not the same as MoM, being a mod for Civ 4 BTS, but it is clearly inspired by MoM (one of the title screens is even MoM 2). It has a varied and interesting magic system, interesting hero units, religions which have their own units, buildings, and unique effects, a tech tree which allows several different paths to win, and civs/leaders with unique features. A game of FFH2 will be VERY different depending on which civ/leader/religion you choose, but it is still surprisingly well balanced.  I guarantee that any of those three games will warm the cockles of your 4x heart. No fantasy strategy game has topped MoM, no space strategy has topped MOO2, and FFH2 is a very very good second place."

4Xgaming,2nakvn,Reiker0,5,Tue Nov 25 14:57:59 2014 UTC,"The barbarians are no joke in FfH. They're a serious threat for a good portion of the game. One of the civs (Clan of Embers) is neutral with the barbs and trains ""barb"" units. Definitely adequately defend all of your cities."
4Xgaming,2nakvn,paradoxpancake,2,Tue Nov 25 15:00:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah the first game I played I was playing some dwarf people. Right outside my first city was a ""Guardian of Pristin Pass"" which looked like a dragon statue on a mountain. I moved a warrior past it to scout around and three 8 attack Gargoyles spawned out of it and wrecked me, and from then on I was kinda pinned into my starting city since those Gargoyles were just roaming around outside my borders.  Another game I played as the elves, started with a worker and within like 10 turns a barbarian lizardman just walked up to my capital and took it. I think it took me 8 turns to build a warrior and since I started with 2 scouts the only way to survive would have been to start with a warrior and then win the battle at the capital.  It's a bit much but I keep going back to it. I also have no idea if I'm doing well / playing it correctly or not but that probably just comes with experience playing it."
4Xgaming,2nakvn,Reiker0,2,Tue Nov 25 15:07:31 2014 UTC,"Never leave cities unguarded. Also, would advise playing your first game as the Grigori. Also, there's some good resources on the Civfanatics forums on playing your first game, including a manual. The Grigori or Calabim make for good starting factions."
4Xgaming,2nakvn,paradoxpancake,2,Tue Nov 25 15:09:49 2014 UTC,"Huh, my suggestions for starting factions would have been Sheaim or Amurites. Pyre zombies make for a solid early defense for the Sheaim, and less worry about keeping the AC low is always nice.  As for Amurites, their bonuses to magic help make the magic system easier to learn (since it IS pretty dang complex!) and firebows are top notch defenders, worth rushing every game.  Just to add a good civ for balance, I'd say Malakim are the simplest one. Lightbringers make early scouting a lot easier, and have a wealth of upgrade paths once the player has started to figure out religions."

In addition, there are a ton of mods for the game - everything from adding more to the 4X aspects (E4X mod is a great one) to changing the ships to other popular sci-fi series (Sins of a Galactic Empire: Star Wars mod, etc - but they have everything from Star Trek to BSG).  It's a great game and one of my favorites.  Other newer space-based 4X games (and I am skipping the classics such as MoO2, GalCiv2, etc) that I enjoy are Endless Space, Sword of the Stars 1 (not 2). Although some people here like Distant Worlds, I personally only found it mediocre."

4Xgaming,2nakvn,onlycatfud,3,Tue Nov 25 08:33:45 2014 UTC,"I don't know that I would say favorite, but Space Empires IV truly showed me the potential of the genre. I had some early versions, II  or III perhaps, on floppy disk, and had been playing it for a long time.  I was so disappointed when SEV went ""ooo look 3d and hexmap"" and didn't improve so many other things to have stayed competitive with other emerging streamlined and really slick 4x games. Though it always has a pretty solid mod community. It's a little slow and clunky for multiplay to be practical. I tried on occasion in earlier versions to play by email with a friend, a savefile, and password protected logins, heh. So archaic. But it IS available on steam today and I am quite happy firing it up when stuck on a less powerful work laptop and other games wont play. I think you have to be sandboxy with it, I can't imagine without mods or anything it is very well balanced.  Currently when I have a spare minute from Kerbal I just still soak up too many hours play Civ 5 with both expansions made it so solid."

The planetfall mod is quite simple but I enjoy it. SotS is fun simply because of the difference between races engines and the way the technology tree works. It was ridiculously innovative in that way.  Distant Worlds is truly grand but requires quite a lot of micromanagement if you don't want the auto-micro to fuck you up.  MoM is, well... The pioneer of fantasy 4x. It was and still is an amazing, solid game.  MOO1/2 is, well... The pioneer of space 4x. It was and still is an amazing, solid game.  Alpha Centauri, hm. I love this game... Simply because even though it had its problems with balance and a pretty ridiculous expansion it was the only strategy game that actually made me immersed in it. The characters, the quotes, the secret project videos. It truly made me imagine different factions of different leaders of different ideologies all battling it out, and on top of that, it was a solid game."

If I would want to play something with movement unlimited by starlanes, it would be maybe moo1/2, galactic civilizations or something from civilization series... Imo only thing bad about moo3 is too small building que and micromanagement that is going with it.  I just love starlanes, and ability to build quite large fleet to send in waves either to die or kill enemy and their population. Not few units to defend from every direction, so you either end up with small fleets that can't fight off enemies or one/two that can, but before they will get to attacked planet there is nothing to defend... Same with civilization.  X2/X3 games, unless only strategy 4x games count.   Next would be stars!, but limit of 255 units is just too few for me :P Even though there are no starlanes I enjoyed it until i got to limit.  Then Aurora - but bit too much micromanagement, especially during combat with couple hundred of units..."

I originally expressed my appreciation for anyone who likes games off the beaten path, and it's interesting to hear from someone who likes MOO3 despite all the negativity that surrounds it.  My biggest issue with the game is that it seems to play itself after a while. Whether its setting up new colonies or choosing technology, I feel like very little I do has any immediate impact. Maybe it's just me, I don't know."
4Xgaming,2nakvn,druebey,1 point,Wed Nov 26 15:10:52 2014 UTC,"Some people just like what they like, not what other people say they like ;)  But is is bad that it plays it self? Instead of micromanaging way your empire works by deciding on every detail, like let's say building of transport ships, loading them, unloading at destination, repeating whole process, or planing what will be built where on your new colony you can concentrate on fun stuff like exterminating enemies. Ok, less choices are not always better, but by managing every little detail i feel more like clerk not leader of empire/nation. Come on, do leaders supervise and order every little detail, or just main idea and go into details if they choose so? I did read somewhere comparison something about these lines so on this point i might repeat someone, but i agree in 100%.  I will also agree, that AI is not always good, so in MOO3 I plan out colony, but if there were detailed enough templates available to make i would use them and go on with fun stuff.  Perfect game for me would be fully automated, but would allow to run things as you desire and set in templates, or changing template for single planet/city according to needs. But most of my planets/cities I develop same way, so repeating bunch of steps every time gets boring."

4Xgaming,2n5omi,alexgmcm,11,Sun Nov 23 10:21:18 2014 UTC,"I've noticed this even in multiplayer Civ IV - whoever is winning at 1000 BC is usually still winning at 2000 AD. The problem is that you want a game where the challenge stays roughly constant while still giving you a feeling of progression, but in most 4X games you stronger when you win a war while your enemy gets weaker. So (in single player) there's a big challenge in the early game when you're all equal, but once you win one war, you're just a little bit bigger than your neighbours, which makes it easier to win the next war and so on. It does seem to be a real issue in these types of games, because it seems unrealistic that you should take over a country without increasing in power, but it means that you basically win the game once you've won your first war.  I think Paradox games get around this by (a) penalising expanding too fast so that rapid conquerors don't have such an advantage, and (b) having a large world filled with many nations, so that distant nations can still grow to be strong, independent of your actions."

4Xgaming,2n5omi,WhatsUpWithTheKnicks,8,Wed Nov 26 08:38:36 2014 UTC,"The issue is that it's very hard to make a game where all your decisions matter. In other words, if the game can change a lot at the end, then that ends up making it feel like your early decisions don't really matter, and that can be frustrating. On the other hand, if the early game matters too much, then the game reaches a point where the ending is a foregone conclusion and you're just kind of clicking through to get to the end that you already know will happen.  I think most games tend to err on the side of the latter for two reasons: First, because I think a game where your choices now matter more than your choices later will generally be more fun to play, and second, because a lot of people don't play a game to completion anyway (though arguably this is because late game decisions don't matter as much, creating a sort of vicious cycle).  I also kind of feel that Paradox games fall into this to - I've only actually played one game of EU through to completion, because you almost always reach a point where you've blobbed enough that you can effortlessly steamroll everyone.  That being said, I don't know if I'd say the same about Vicky 2, but I feel like that's because the real challenge and interest there is the economic and cultural development of your nation, rather than the expansion of your borders."

I for one will only pay for any paradox published or developed game if its only 75% off or more. I honestly dont want them to get another dime more than just production.   They have lately been releasing games that are buggy and such. Mind you I expect my own games to be a buggy mess at times, but I am a single developer without the support or QA of them. I also will not be catering to this Simplify crowd as the complexity is once what made the games great. Another thing is Modding games...  When Sid Mier made colonization in 94 there was no modding. He made a great game that did on its own and MO and MOO2 added and started the genre. So in that, Modding in my opinion shows the games lack of vision and exucation of being a game. Do you Mod board games? I am hoping through community involvement my games wont need modded and I will be able to make patches just engine upgrades and bug fixes while DLC and expansions be more substance.

For instance if one race is the only one able to settle on stone planets (at that poin tin time) and has more settlements than anybody else?

AI Home Colony fleets/defenses are not as powerful as they should be late-game and they don't construct Hyperspace Inhibitors intelligently enough so you can often drop a massive fleet right into orbit and either bombard or land troops to quickly take out their major industrial planets.  You can offset this by making the beginning muderously hard or just giving some distant AIs slightly better starting techs.

4Xgaming,2mt87z,cooper_the_corgi,8,Wed Nov 19 21:45:12 2014 UTC,"Civ 5's AI is notoriously awful, and AFAIK there aren't any mods out there to fix it. My assessment there is that because Civ V changed so much, they had to spend most of their time developing those new systems and so ended up not having any time to teach the AI how to use them. Unfortunately, Civ BE's AI is even worse, and they haven't got that excuse since they were working with a lot of Civ 5's stuff, so...  However, I know that Civ IV and SMAC have both got AI mods, and they make a non-trivial difference. There's generally a few things that go into an improved AI mod for a Civ-type game.  1) AI that plays to win. As far as I'm aware, in no Civ game ever has the AI actively pursued victory (with the exception being Civ 4, where one or two AIs would sometimes pursue a Cultural victory). Oh, sure, they can win, but they'll just kinda fall into it. They'll try for a diplomatic victory if the option arises, sure, but they won't go out of their way to actively try and get votes. If they happen to have spaceship techs, they'll build parts, but they won't beeline spaceship techs or try to build up major production centres to prepare. AI mods usually change this. They educate the AI, to some extent, on how to actually win the game.  2) More effective AI personalities. In every Civ game, the AI has been programmed with personalities that reflect their historical person. Even back in Civ 1, you knew that if you spawned next to Gandhi, you were fine (til nukes cuz gandie nukes rite? LOLOLOLOL kill me now please), but if you spawned next to Genghis Khan, you better start spamming those Phalanxes. The issue that emerged over time is that some AI personalities are much better at playing the game than others.   Take, for example, Civ 5. In Civ 5, Alex will almost always be the dominant AI player of any game he's in. Why is that? The Greeks aren't a bad civ, sure, but they're not particularly amazing, either. It's because the personality they gave to Alex is incredibly well-suited for playing the game well. He's aggressive, competitive, and he expands early and often. Compare and contrast Babylon. Babylon, in Civ 5, is a ridiculously powerful Civ, but in my experience they very rarely do well in the hands of the AI. Why? Because Babylon emphasizes things like a super small empire (remember that due to AI bonuses there is no advantage for them to go tall over wide), city defensiveness, and wonder production (it is extremely rare that wonders are cost-effective). In short, the AI just doesn't play the game very well.  Most AI mods will identify the personality traits that make an AI more competitive and the traits that hold back the AI, and emphasize the former and minimize the latter for most AIs. This dramatically reduces the flavour of the game, because, well, most of the AIs are similar - but on the other hand, it means that now you've got far more threatening enemies to deal with.   3) More aggressive AI. The #1 reason why you can win at higher levels in Civ games is because the AI will not squash you like a bug just because they can. Civ AI mods change this, within reason. This loosely ties in with point 1 up above, as it represents the AI actually trying to achieve domination victories rather than haphazardly declaring war and hoping they benefit, but it deserves its own category, I feel. The AI will become a lot less stingy about declaring war, and while using diplomacy to maintain peace is certainly possible, it's a fair bit more challenging now, and usually to keep that peace you still need to maintain a decent standing army to discourage opportunists (which, according to #2, will be most AIs). This is huge because often, especially in Civ 4 and 5, the reason why you can get ridiculously early cultural victories on IMM+ is because the AI is perfectly content to let you wonderwhore and spam great people in peace. This changes that. It also means that before you start a war, you don't need to just make sure you have enough soldiers to win, but also enough soldiers to hold off anyone who decides to jump on you while you're in the middle of it.  4) Saving the most important for last: Teaching the AI how to actually play the game. The biggest issue with Civ AI is that they don't actually understand the game. They don't know how it works. This is most obvious in Civ 5, where an ""invasion"" usually consists of a few soldiers milling about your territory aimlessly, pillaging a few tiles and maybe launching the occasional half-hearted charge at your city while you pick them off one-by-one, but it's present in all the games. AI mods do what they can to equip the AI with more knowledge.  The SMAC mod is a great example of this. Two of the changes it makes are, alone, enough to drive up the AI's ability. First, they teach the AI how to terraform effectively, and most notably they prioritize planting forests (forests in SMAC are a versatile and powerful improvement, and blanketing your territory in vast swathes of the stuff is a simple but highly effective strategy, especially for low-micro players who can't be bothered to learn how to use the other, more powerful but more specialized improvements). It also teaches the AI how to respond in strategic situations. In SMAC, air units are considered extraordinarily powerful, but now the AI's been taught that 2-3 AAA Plasma Garrisons behind a Perimeter Defense and within range of a Sensor Array can hold off a virtually endless amount of Chaos Needlejets. Air units are still powerful, but much less so now that the AI's been taught to react appropriately.  Kmod did something similar for Civ IV. A big issue Civ IV's AI had (well, come to think of it, the AI for every Civ game ever) was that it was completely incompetent at anything resembling naval warfare. If you had a continent to yourself, you were untouchable, because no AI, no matter how strong, would be able to mount an effective naval assault. Kmod changed that. It showed the AI that you needed to use more than a couple of transports, and that you needed to group those transports with plenty of fighting ships. Now the Industrial era on becomes a slightly terrifying period because that's when the AI is capable of keeping a massive fleet outside your vision and then swooping in, unloading their army, and capturing your city all in one turn.  It, too, taught the AI how to better respond to strategic situations. For example, Horse Archer rushes are a popular early-game tactic in Civ 4, but the AI will now respond to them, if possible, with Spearmen. The AI will now also place a higher emphasis on Axemen and Horse Archers - arguably the two strongest early game units. It certainly places a lower emphasis on Swordsmen.  Ultimately, I think the issue comes down to the fact that games like Civ tend to attract two sorts of players: ""Sandbox"" players who like to take it as an opportunity to build up their empire in their image however they like it, and ""competitive"" players who want the game to be challenging and enjoy the feeling of accomplishment when they win a game that pushed them to their limits.  And the reason why this is a problem is because, generally speaking, what makes the game more enjoyable for one group will make the game less enjoyable for another group. Aggressive AI that will invade when they sense a weakness is a huge draw for the competitive crowd, but it will massively put off the sandbox crowd, who want to create an enlightened empire and aren't very happy about having to give up on a bunch of wonders so they can create some additional soldiers.  What I'd like to see is a GalCiv style system where you've got two axis - Difficulty and Intelligence. Difficulty determines what sort of handicap the AI gets, Intelligence determines how competitive the AI is. Mix and match to get your preferred experience."

I've mostly been playing Distant Worlds so I know there's AI mods for that game, one of them in particular is very effective.

Pretty sure the devs even said at some point that a lot of them play with it as well.  Icemania's AI Mod: You'll find that DW's AI does stupid things later on. Hell, just knowing how to build good ships puts you ahead of them by a considerable margin. The AI mod fixes most of those problems, and if you play on Hard, the AI is actually very challenging but will still give you a good contest on Normal. They're not idiots any longer with the mod, at least. There is a version of it that works with the Extended Universe. (Edit: Worth noting that it does a fair few balance changes for the better as well, like making all weapons appealing)  Those are the two cores that I suggest. I've also used the older graphics mod that makes the planets/stars look better and changes the backdrop of the galaxy to look more like the Milky Way background. There's also some sound mods and UI mods that make the game look good as well. I won't specify which, because I don't know their exact names off the top of my head but you can find them if you go to the forums.

4Xgaming,2mjp6d,MrsWarboys,11,Mon Nov 17 09:41:15 2014 UTC,"1) Victory conditions. In my opinion the very concept of victory conditions is at odds with the 4x genre. I want to build an empire. I want to be either benign or cruel. I want to stand the test of time. I want to experience a history. A winstate invalidates these goals, suddenly nothing mattered, the game either ends prematurely because some player fulfilled an arbitrary condition in their own corner of the world or it drags on because we ""can't"" finish until the game officially declares a ""winner"".  2) Slippery slope (and its corollary). Your current ability to succeed is a result of previous success. 4x games usually depict some kind of steady ""progress"" which amplifies small differences over the course of the game, leading to a foregone conclusion and a dead endgame.  3) Development. 4x games are developed from the early game onward. The testers experience the early game over and over and reach the endgame much less frequently, therefore early game mechanics and aesthetics tend to be much better designed and balanced than late game ones."
4Xgaming,2mjp6d,igoh,3,Mon Nov 17 12:01:15 2014 UTC,"Agree with all your points. Point 3 is very interesting and I've never thought of it that way. You'd think that Firaxis could have figured it out already with their decades of playtesting and experience of late-game Civ.  I wonder if there's any way to do away with Victory Conditions and still have the game feel satisfying. When I've beaten everyone on my continent in Civ, I generally feel like I've 'won the game', even if there's another survivor on the other side of the world. Maybe that's enough, although I would obviously like a screen that said 'you are the best' and didn't lead me down some endless tunnel to tell me the exact same thing after a 10 hour time investment"
4Xgaming,2mjp6d,igoh,7,Mon Nov 17 12:58:19 2014 UTC,"Although not ""really"" 4x, paradox grand strategy games might point in the right direction. There are no explicit victory conditions, instead the game rewards you with various statistics and a ""history"" text that is composed of the achievemts and setbacks that your empire experienced during your reign.  I could easily imagine improvements to this, the game should acknowledge all sorts of things, for example how benign you were, what cultural artifacts your artists contributed, how well your infrastructure was developed, how many conflicts were won against overwhelming odds, how many people lived in slavery and many more. Sort of like achievements but in game, much more detailed and actually meaningful."
4Xgaming,2mjp6d,igoh,2,Mon Nov 17 13:12:48 2014 UTC,"These achievements shouldnt be merely numerical either.

4Xgaming,2mjp6d,Hyndis,3,Sat Jan 10 11:33:22 2015 UTC,"Point #2 is an issue that makes the late game of many 4x games boring.  Star Ruler in particular had this really bad. The entire game was decided by the first few minutes of colony rushing. The more colonies you had the more resources you had, allowing you to build more colonies and get more resources... This positive feedback loop meant that aggressively colony rushing would give an unbeatable advantage.  More 4x games need to have downsides for being bigger. A bigger empire should of course be stronger than a smaller empire, but the smaller empire still needs to be able to compete. The balance of power between the biggest empire and the smallest empire cannot be so vast that the player with the big empire gets bored at the end.  One way I've seen this done is to give your starting city/colony/planet a massive advantage. Your home is always going to be the industrial, economic, and science juggernaut of your empire. Your home gets massive bonuses that cannot be replicated by colony rushing. Should you capture someone else's home this bonus is destroyed. This prevents one empire from eating another empire and doubling in power for doing so.  With this model, colonies are things you extract resources from rather than centers of production. This gives all empires roughly equal footing regardless of size. A bigger empire has more resources to play with, but everyone has the same industrial, science, and economic hub with roughly the same capabilities.  The downside of this is that some players may get upset if they're not able to crush their enemies with an endless tide of units due to this compound advantage."

For those of you haven't played it, once you captured 50% of the map the remainder 50% of the map would all ally against you and declare way on you. Despite owning 50% of the map this was still an immense challenge. The sheer number of enemy armies marching against you made it very difficult to hang on.  To add to the challenge, Realm Divide causes massive unrest in your provinces, so you're fighting the remaining factions in addition to having many provinces rebel. They might raise peasant armies or simply refuse to pay taxes, resulting in an economic meltdown while you're fending off an onslaught.  Be prepared to lose quite a few provinces until things stabilize. Realm Divide is always rough, but its a useful way to keep the game going."
4Xgaming,2mjp6d,Terkala,4,Tue Nov 18 00:28:40 2014 UTC,"The Fall From Heaven mod for Civ4 got it very right.  Empires would be at war, slowly gaining power. But of course, some people get kicked out or are on the weaker side. These players have the option of opening up gates to heaven/hell (depending on alignment). If they open the gates to hell, it spawns a super powerful hell-city, which gains new units as any evil units (or population) die in any country. If they open the gates to heaven, it turns one city into an allied-city-state of heaven (that you can also play as) which gets new units as good-aligned units die.  So the down-and-out players have the option to restart as factions that are viable in the late game.  Even if you're not one of these two factions, someone will have started them by the late game.

The religions in G&K is actually a slow burner that changes from a race to strategically sending missionaries later on. The fixed prices to increase the reputation in city states leading to competition later in the game, when money becomes more available. Not paying attention to the tourism in BNW can completely fuck you over in late game.  Notable mention goes to Galactic Civilizations II, which had the only AI I remember that actively tried to prevent you from reaching a victory condition."
4Xgaming,2mjp6d,igoh,2,Mon Nov 17 21:42:02 2014 UTC,"I think a solution is kind of hard to do.  As many other 4x gamers, the game isn't done until everyone is dead (aside from one poor soul you can aggrandize) or every part of the world has your name on it.  I think that's what makes 4x great- it's the survival, then expansion. Steamrolling is fun at first, but gets old quick.  One solution that I could think of is the game switching over to pure automation mode essentially functioning as an AI when it comes to the more annoying things like any form of city-building/colonization/trade/light bandit-related things and give you full control of smashing things.   That and create, sadly, a gimmicky end game idea. You're the sole power in the whole universe? SURPRISE, evil ancients come from a portal to take back the land.  I feel like that would give me what I want personally. I spent hours slaving over to create this economically efficient, highly technological empire- and I have no foes to slay. If there was a 4x game that essentially threw me into another game where everything I have done/made is flown into this funnel where I can say, ""I want 200x of high class ship that takes 20 turns to make"" with the game automatically splitting the order across all your lands to form battle groups to continue to fight in, I'd love it. That would be your final bang before the game is over. Your final struggle to succeed based entirely on your combat acumen that, whether you realize it or not, you formed throughout playing the game.  Though the issue with even this would be that once you know how to do it, the replayability sort of dies out. You'll eventually know ""AI sends X units to your army, need Y units to counter""  That's the inherent issue I believe. How can you constantly challenge the player?"
4Xgaming,2mjp6d,Hyndis,2,Wed Nov 19 18:42:59 2014 UTC,"If you go into the late game winning, then the late game is just a matter of keeping your lead. This is the same in every game anywhere."
4Xgaming,2mjp6d,Jaxck,3,Mon Nov 17 09:48:44 2014 UTC,"This problem doesn't matter so much in genres where the average game length is anywhere up to an hour. 4x games however usually last several hours, which means that a lame-duck or going-through-the-motions situation is a much more serious concern for game design."
4Xgaming,2mjp6d,Jaxck,2,Mon Nov 17 12:45:13 2014 UTC,"I've been wondering then if there should be either one of two mechanics.  The first would be a catch up mechanism, so maintaining the lead is still your goal but it's not an automatic assurance (like it is with most 4X games). Killing the snowball effect, a bit like the Blue Shell in Mario Kart.  The second would be some sort of dynamic victory condition, that recognizes if a game is already effectively over and deems a winner. Perhaps some sort of gap in score that's measured every 'age' (or whatever period of time) that must be maintained for more than one turn to automatically win the game.  I wonder if they would help"
4Xgaming,2mjp6d,Draakon0,1 point,Mon Nov 17 12:53:19 2014 UTC,"The first would be a catch up mechanism, so maintaining the lead is still your goal but it's not an automatic assurance (like it is with most 4X games). Killing the snowball effect, a bit like the Blue Shell in Mario Kart.   A common mechanic for this is a tax. The bigger your lead is the more you're taxed. The more cities you have and the more armies you have the higher percentage you're taxed.  This can be chalked up to the bureaucracy of running such a large empire. Bureaucratic complexity doesn't increase linearly with the size of the system it governs. A smaller entity has much simpler paperwork needs, so they should be able to operate with a lot less red tape involved.  Its perhaps not the best way to handicap the leader, but its a possible solution to narrow the gap and allow others to catch up."
4Xgaming,2mjp6d,topenhargen,1 point,Tue Nov 18 00:25:51 2014 UTC,"Using the basic concept of the era system from civ, I think I have a solution. Instead of victory being decided overall, victory is decided by earning points at the end of each era. Once victory points have been awarded, civs that are falling behind would get a boost up to the same tech level as the leaders, resetting the victory race each era. In addition, I would add a more layered and complicated combat system which allows for more nuanced and interesting conflicts. A greater variety of units, supply trains, more varied terrain, and so on. Specifically with civ I'd replace xp with moral. Each 25% moral would unlock a promotion, meaning more experienced units would be better longterm, but fresh troops would be better short term. Units could be built faster at 0% moral, or slower up to 25% moral. A greater variety of diplomatic and peacetime options would be enormously appreciated. Instead of making decisions that stick, being able to go back and reverse decisions in response to public sentiment. Being able to release unwanted territory as new nations would be incredibly useful for creating buffer states, splitting cultural groups, or to create a richer trading environment."

I'm not shocked that many games lack the depth of SE4, im just shocked that in the age of all these alpha 'give us free money' never finished games on steam, that something like SE4 hasn't been one of them.

What made you enjoy in Civ 5, and what did you not like?  In the sidebar to the right there are a list of prevalent 4x games today. Most of them are modern, and will feature decent UI and controls so you won't feel too lost coming from Civ 5.   Endless Space is a very lightweight intro to the space 4x genre. It has an excellent UI and control you can in fact play the game one-handed using only the mouse without sacrificing time if you're so inclined). I would say it doesn't have any particular strengths, but no real weaknesses either. Battles are automatic. EDIT: AI might be a bit daft. Age of Wonders 3 is an excellent fantasy 4x if you want more out of combat than what was featured in Civ 5. Battles occur on a turn based battlefield, and features tactical options like spells and flanking. Diplomacy is not very deep, however, if that's more your cup of tea. Sins of a Solar Empire is another game focusing on combat, but instead of turn based battles you control your fleet in a Real Time Strategy manner ala StarCraft (Homeworld is a more apt comparison, if you've heard of it). Diplomacy is just about non-existant - games feel more like really long RTS skirmish matches than anything else. Galactic Civilizations is THE 4x you want if you're into diplomacy. Its main strength is the excellent AI that no game has really rivaled so far. Battles are automatic and very similar to Civ 4. The graphics are very rudimentary and dated, however, as the game is starting to age quite a bit. A sequel is on the horizon. Distant Worlds is a complexity behemoth. You can basically micromanage everything in this space 4x - or have the computer do it for you. The UI is.... bad, but if you want a challenge, this is it."

From everything i have seen so far, if you provide a working AI and a solid combat system to your management part you will be just golden.  I hope this game will not add to the list of 4x space games which do a lot of things right but break at some point so crucially that you can't enjoy it.

4Xgaming,2lilw7,gruesky,9,Thu Nov 6 21:51:48 2014 UTC,FYI: I'm in this game I'm not sure why SEIV over SEV(except for the mod we're using works better on SEIV).  We're only 20ish turns in on this game(although this is the second game our group has played).  Each turn takes roughly 24-48 hours.  We expect to be playing a loonnngg time.

We do a turn each day. Lots of time for diplomacy and negotiations. Alliances and initial conflicts are still forming, but I suspect small wars or conquest attempts are about to erupt."
4Xgaming,2lilw7,bronzite,3,Fri Nov 7 09:12:16 2014 UTC,"We're about to launch an 10-player SEIV game, and the choice of SEIV over SEV was a long and contentious one.  Ultimately, thought, SEIV seems to just be more technologically stable. In the experience of our group, large SEV games seem to start making weird mistakes in production and simultaneous turn movement once empires start getting into the double-digit number of systems size range."
4Xgaming,2lilw7,Maccalus,2,Fri Nov 7 14:40:33 2014 UTC,I'm one of the organizers of this particular game.  We chose SEIV due to our increased familiarity with the game over SEV and greater knowledge of this particular mod.  We ran one game that lasted about 3 years with a previous group with an earlier version of this mod and were itching to get it going again.

4Xgaming,2l7q6s,Ayrr,3,Tue Nov 4 00:55:59 2014 UTC,"I feel that fallen enchantress has a really good civ-like feel while endless legend is quite radically different.   I'll personally suggest fallen enchantress because its older and I think more complete. Its a lot of fun as the combat is enjoyable and a lot better thought out - definitely has a lot of depth.   Thats not to say endless legend is bad, it just doesn't have the same depth yet I feel."
4Xgaming,2l7q6s,DoctorDiscourse,2,Tue Nov 4 03:24:56 2014 UTC,"I really love FE:LH, but I keep getting the feeling of 'almost great' from it. It's difficulty and steep learning curve turns off a lot of civ players.  You won't regret buying Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes.  Big pros: Character customization, Faction customization, RPG elements including mapwide spells, citywide spells, and individual battle spells, along with both city and hero/unit leveling. Immersion is stellar in this game as well. Easy to mod once you get the hang of it. This game is a nearly perfect fusion between a 4x and an RPG.  Cons: Some balance concerns, difficulty/learning curve, map generation (getting a DLC to hopefully fix that), and aesthetics. (map terrain often uninteresting or bland to look at). Crappy name. It could also use a good rebranding that finally sticks along with a name that doesn't suck along with people hyping the game on Twitch. No multiplayer. (Very sad about that.) and bland quest dialogue. (They should hire the Sorcerer King writer to rewrite LH quest dialogue, but modders have solved a lot of that, so it's no big deal.)"
4Xgaming,2l7q6s,filthgrinder,3,Tue Nov 4 08:57:14 2014 UTC,"Personally I enjoy Fallen Enchantress more.  It has more diversity in races and style, love the rpg elements, character customization etc.  More bang for your buck."
4Xgaming,2l7q6s,wOlfLisK,6,Tue Nov 4 17:44:30 2014 UTC,"They're both really good (though FE: LH needs to be what you're talking about), so it depends (sorta) on what kind of game you're looking for.   Do you like story and unique factions? Endless Legend is better there than FE:LH.   Do you like empire building and seeing your cities become big and unique? Legendary Heroes is probably better at that.   Do you like spells and using them in various ways? FE:LH has that and EL doesn't.   FE:LH is probably cheaper.   You can win Endless Legend this month if you join my eXplorminate group on Steam.   Both games are supported really well. FE:LH is planned to receive a 2.0 update next year.   EL has an expansion planned for Q2 2015."

I made a post here recently about a game with a nice mix of Civ-like economy with HoMM style heroes. While the Heroes don't cast crazy spells and stuff, they do still feel like cool unique and exciting characters (especially how they can be attached to cities and armies). The factions are incredibly interesting, and in the 2 games I've started playing (one on Mac, one on PC) I've played as Necrophage and those Dust Knight guys and they're wildly different playstyles.  Basically I can't get enough of this game and I'm trying to figure out how to make the weekend come faster so I can get to the end game (I'm still only in Research Tier I).  Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes sounds like something I'd love on paper, but I just found it boring. Maybe I'm missing something but I found the city decisions dull, the combat dull, the factions dull... everything about it just didn't feel great. And I don't think it's just a polish/style issue (it's undoubtedly crappy looking, especially compared to Endless Legend). I found myself bored playing it. I didn't like that there were extremely limited places to build cities (which is funny because Endless Legend restricts your city purchases, but the placement is more interesting). I found combat slow and tedious.  Maybe I should watch some Let's Plays and give it another chance, but Fallen Enchantress just felt wrong imo. Perhaps my expectations are giving me a bias but at the end of the day I just wasn't enjoying playing it.  Although you didn't mention it, Warlock 2: The Exiled is another game in a similar vein that I've also played (I've been doing 4x research over the last few weeks). I found that pretty enjoyable. Closest thing to a fantasy Civ that I've played, and I found the heroes and city management in that game much more enjoyable than Fallen Enchantress."

I would play children of the storm mod, not sure what the title for it now though.  Endless legend is very good.  But EL combat is pretty weak in my opinion, its not quite in the level of other 4x fantasy just from options for units and abilities, and you don't have a wizard either (ardent mages aren't even close to that style of gameplay when they should be)."

We're new, but we're adding content all the time. We also hold contests now to win 4X games. Endless Legend is up this month.   Secondly, between those games, it's about what kind of game you like.   Do you like tactical battles above all else? Age of Wonders 3 is your answer.   Do you like to deal less with empire management and focus on army building with simpler battling? HoMM, is better for your buck.   Do you like your game a bit well-rounded with equal parts economy, battles, diplomacy and quests? Endless Legend is your answer.   They all have their strengths and weaknesses. I probably wouldn't consider HoMM a true 4X game, but rather a turned based strategy game with some 4X lite stuff."

Both have historical start points which are as close as possible to actual history, but whenever the player takes a seat, the game can deviate wildly from actual history. The game has settings for 'lucky nations' which try to enforce historical happenstance in the games, but any time after the player begins the game, the game can be very allohistorical.

Now while at the store, you state, ""I got some generic apples for free!"" without explaining where the other $10 went.   Does that mean you're allowed to pocket the $10? No. You still owe a product. Did you deliver on your hand-picked apples either? No. You owe an explanation as to why you didn't pay for the apples anyways and where the money went to."

4Xgaming,2kwaaj,VanderLegion,8,Fri Oct 31 16:24:04 2014 UTC,Let me know what you guys think so far. Any one really liking it?
4Xgaming,2kwaaj,Tuna-Fish2,4,Fri Oct 31 17:53:10 2014 UTC,"I'm having a lot of fun with it.  To be fair though, I never played Alpha Centari so I don't have the hangup with expecting a sequel in the same vein"
4Xgaming,2kwaaj,grand_master_ram_rod,4,Sat Nov 1 02:12:56 2014 UTC,"I very strongly recommend buying it, it's cheap on gog and works reasonably well on modern machines. The graphics are dated, but as they are hand-painted low-res if you can at all stand the pixellated trend in modern indie games it's pretty reasonable. In terms of design and atmosphere, it's imho still the very best 4x game ever made. The factions all have a real difference in feel and gameplay, the tech tree is awesome etc.  http://www.gog.com/game/sid_meiers_alpha_centauri  The pack contains both the base game and the expansion. I recommend playing without the expansion first, as while it adds a lot of neat stuff for experienced players, it makes the game feel more cluttered and hard to get for first time players. Oh, and during your first playthrough, nuke someone. :)"
4Xgaming,2kwaaj,UnGauchoCualquiera,7,Sun Nov 2 15:22:52 2014 UTC,"I haven't purchased the game and the review basically confirmed to me what I already gathered, that it was a studio funded mod. Having said that, this is where I think I and yourself went wrong.   I think the game was never intended to be an Alpha Centauri remake or fit any kind of relation. I think it was always intended to be Civ 5 in space which is why it's appropriately named. Reading the review, you listed all the same issues I had with civ v, especially at the end with the diplomacy.  I will never buy this game because after 1000 hours in Civ V, this game is just a mod in my eyes. Although perhaps it wasn't to be anything more."
4Xgaming,2kwaaj,Decker108,5,Sat Nov 1 00:01:49 2014 UTC,"So I guess then that paying $50 for a mod isn't right.   I know it wasn't intended as a sequel, but they didn't need to look far for good inspiration. It feels like they completely missed the opportunity to take what was best from AC and apply it here."

4Xgaming,2kwaaj,shmael,4,Sat Nov 1 14:28:58 2014 UTC,"Pretty much agree with your review.  You may have even been a little easy on it... or maybe I'm just feeling harsh because of the disappointment.  It's hard to imagine how the company that made SMAC churned out this  bland unfinished moneygrab.  On the other hand, I wasnt at all surprised by what I found when I played, given that all the interviews and pre-release stuff made it basically look like a CiV mod... and that's what it is."
4Xgaming,2kwaaj,igoh,1 point,Fri Oct 31 20:40:36 2014 UTC,"I follow your criticisms but I'm personally more positive. I just went in with very low expectations because I absolutely loathed Civ 5 vanilla and still only thought it was alright after the expansions. I've had more fun with this game than with Civ 5. The atmosphere, factions and lore are much weaker than in Alpha Centauri though, which is my main complaint."
4Xgaming,2kwaaj,flyingtiger188,1 point,Sat Nov 1 09:34:06 2014 UTC,"Definitely been playing the crap out of it.  LOVED AC and was really excited about this game but what could have been a classic I played for hundreds of hours is really underwhelming for me.  Another couple complaints I didn't see in your review (well done btw):    The unit 'promotion' system has been declawed by the affinity system.  We have a 'choice' of increased stats or 50hp but none other throughout the whole scope of the system.  How dull.  The endings, both winning and losing, range from uninspired to baffling.  Where is my game summary??  Trade routes are ridiculously overpowered.  Once you make your trade vehicles immune to aliens via the electric fence 'quest,' any other game choice (be it what improvement to put down, what affinity you choose, how to treat aliens) has anything to do with your chance of victory as long as you spam more trade routes (and, of course, cities).   The insulting thing is they will more than likely address a lot of these issues in a DLC but I will have to pay MORE money for them to fix their game... /sigh."
4Xgaming,2kwaaj,marlowe221,10,Mon Nov 3 14:40:13 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately I have to agree with your analysis. Civ:BE does not look like a work of passion, to be honest. It's solid as a full conversion mod and weak for a full-price release. There is some fun to be had but it wears off far too quickly for a game in this genre.  They said they intentionally departed from the SMAC formula. Fine, but in that case, why is it that they cobbled together bits and pieces of different sci-fi-universes without actually delivering substantially on any of them? Why is it that the possible infrastructure is as restricted as that of bronze age regular civ? No real megastructures occupying several tiles? No actual terraforming? How is it that a civilization on the brink of transcendence is still hampered by mere mountains, canyons, ice caps or oceans? How is it that their military doctrine seems to match exactly what 20th century humanity has been able to come up with?  I have one gripe in particular that almost never gets mentioned: The more I build the worse the map looks. My enjoyment of developing a strong civilization is severely hampered when the game punishes me visually for doing well. Civ V had that issue, too, but the alien environment makes it worse."
4Xgaming,2kwaaj,marlowe221,2,Fri Oct 31 20:47:42 2014 UTC,"There is some degree of terraforming with the satellites that can add basic and strategic resources to unupgraded tiles. But some land reclamation, or forest planting (if there was a lumber mill equalivant), or some world changing wonders like melt the ice caps and all marsh tiles would become coastal tiles would definitely be a nice addition to the game."

4Xgaming,2kwaaj,Ophidios,3,Sat Nov 1 21:52:33 2014 UTC,"btw, did you play Planetfall, the mod for Civ IV? I thought how they handled ""planet attitude"" was pretty cool. If you started as Miriam with the -1 planet penalty you had gave you incredible difficulty with growing out your cities (you'd get stuck on like 2 pop unless you got a biology lab but farms and mines also reduced your planet attitude so it was a delicate balancing act) until you can erase all of the fungus within a 10x10 radius of your city. The alternative (having over -2 planet attitude with nearby fungus) was random but inevitable native life attacks of incredible scale.    The other option was to surround yourself in fungus and work transcends to maximise your planet attitude so you could control more native life units but your cities would be super unhealthy. The tech on this route enabled certain government types that reduced maintenance for more cities and city distance allowing planet factions to spread across the planet. So you'd have way more cities but they'd be much less productive."

4Xgaming,2kwaaj,Thexare,3,Sat Nov 1 02:41:05 2014 UTC,"Your assessment is off in a few places. First, Civ BE has no luxury resources. There are only basic resources and strategic resources. This does make health more difficult to manage, but it is easier to ignore than happiness in Civ V. Health will only give penalties to science, growth, and culture. However, these are easily offset by trade routes. In fact, trade routes are so powerful in Civ BE that an ICS strategy the most effective strategy. The high costs of affinity units towards the end of the game, also give reason to have a large empire so that one has many strategic resources available.  The affinities have bonuses that do require different play styles to utilize them effectively. The more apt critique is that the AI is not strong enough to make this increased micromanagement necessary. However, the unit variation is much greater than Civ V. While Civ V had a long list of units, most things boiled down to: melee, ranged, artillery, or calvary. The simplified list does not detract from the series. The unique units for the affinities are at least as distinct as the unique units from Civ V. The only critique is that the power level is linear and comparable between all of them. There is no period akin to the Aztec's having access to the most powerful unit in the world for a brief period of time. This made the civilizations different and contributes to the sameness of the sponsors in Civ BE.  Furthermore, your whole essay seems to give, at worst, a mild review but concludes that Civ BE is a ""disappointment on many levels."" The hyperbole does not contribute to the discussion."
4Xgaming,2kwaaj,djcabbagehead,5,Sat Nov 1 13:45:58 2014 UTC,"Thanks, you're right. No luxury resources. I changed it to reflect that. I was thinking basic, but luxury was typed.

To be fair though, it took a long time for me to get into AI war too, so I'm still hoping Last Federation will get somewhere.  I couldn't tell you about anything else they've made."
4Xgaming,2kw467,sk_2013,2,Fri Oct 31 18:51:58 2014 UTC,"They made Bionic Deus, which is a pretty fun turn based strategy game.   And they made A Valley Without Wind (1 and 2), which was a metroidvania platformer.   And some zombie puzzle game.   And Skyward Collapse, a point-score turn based tactics balancing act (you play both sides of a turn-based-strategy game).  Their strategy is to make a ton of smaller/quicker games and hope something takes off. So they produce a lot of low/medium-quality games, and occasionally make a few games that do really well."
4Xgaming,2kw467,Terkala,2,Fri Oct 31 19:02:28 2014 UTC,I saw Bionic on the steam store. I feel like it seems to hit a lot of the same notes as AI War (which is fine because AI war is great).

4Xgaming,2kvrfi,marlowe221,1 point,Fri Oct 31 22:45:56 2014 UTC,"Ah, I can imagine. Pity, the game is great and it has aged really well.  As for the feedback, I'm only an hour in so far, so apologies if you figured these things out later on in the stream - I will be back to edit this if that is the case once I've watched the rest.   When you started the scenario, you thought you chose normal difficulty, when in reality you chose the easiest difficulty (CPU Squire) with the Normal AI trait. There are 5 difficulties, with Squire being the easiest, Lord being the normal difficulty and Emperor the hardest. These can then be modified with an AI trait like agressor or defender. All that being said, nothing wrong with playing on the easiest difficulty, especially when new to the game, just wanted to let you know :) Defense is king! That stoneskin spell of yours is really useful. Defense works like this: If your unit has 2 defense, and an enemy attacker has 2 attack, his attacks has a 50% chance of hitting your unit. For every point of defense you have over his attack, that chance is lowered by 10%. The reverse is true if attack is higher than defense. Anyway, 2 defense doesn't sound like a lot, but it drastically improves the survivability of your units. Don't build tier 1 infantry, they are terrible :P Archers are great, though. I would also upgrade the tier 3 city you start with much earlier, so you can build some better units. When splitting a stack, you can right click on your selection to invert it, so you won't have to click on every unit you want to keep in the stack.   That's all I have for now, gonna continue watching now. Feel free to ask if there's anything you want to know!"

I think the slew of developers trying to just remake MOM or MOO2 is holding back the genre...not unlike it help back the fantasy genre in the 80s as EVERYONE was just copying Tolkein
4Xgaming,2kmd8d,Eraser1024,8,Tue Oct 28 23:23:54 2014 UTC,Let me know if anyone has any questions! I'm around. ;)
4Xgaming,2kmd8d,draginol,3,Tue Oct 28 23:55:56 2014 UTC,"Thanks for stopping by Frogboy!   I'm sure a screenshot from Master of Magic isn't a coincidence. Are there elements of Sorcerer King directly inspired by MoM, which were absent in your previous games (or not satisfactorily implemented)?   (BTW, I'm still waiting for true spiritual successor/remake of MoM. Nothing on the horizon yet (Worlds of Magic looks awesome, but I don't think it's it yet).)   The Sorcerer King being anti-me sounds intriguing. I'd love to hear more about it. I guess it doesn't mean he will be compassionate if I'm cruel. Are you going to switch to Oxide's Nitrous engine in 4X genre? I wonder how will Elemental 2 or Fallen Enchantress 2 look like on this engine. I can feel new era of strategy games is just around the corner (Total Annihilation II, which is undoubtedly being made by Chris Taylor at the very moment, will use a Manta-driven engine, won't it?;).   edit: corrected engine's name"
4Xgaming,2kmd8d,draginol,4,Wed Oct 29 00:30:57 2014 UTC,"MOM is definitely a major part of the inspiration for this game.  And yea, if you are cruel, the SK will have attracted a lot of help from the people you wronged during the game.  It's kind of neat because it means that you'll have many many different end battle scenes (visually different and with diffrent unit combinations) all based on how you played.  The Nitrous engine (Oxide's engine) is the future of our ground based 4X.  Our future new 4X titles will be using it."

4Xgaming,2kko8i,Zephilinox,13,Tue Oct 28 15:05:18 2014 UTC,"Exploration is garbage and space travel is simplistic. Every game is the same. You have a box of dots and Lvl 1 scouts can explore everything meaningfully. Range seems binary and in the games that have fuel there's no real penalty to running out.  The problem with exploration is related to the requirement for the colony rush. Somehow 6 races all have to grab all the available territory at the same time. There's no barriers to expansion so it seems more like a game of risk than anything else.  It's a big beautiful universe. Stars are huge and widely separated. No game does mankinds first tentative steps to the stars, you always start with colony ship building on turn 1 to colonize the contintental earth analog guaranteed to be within 5 turns of start location.  Give me an empire simulator with real decisions to the types of experiments you need to do to get colonization an infrastructure on the planets you can reach-  not ultra rich vs poor."

Think of how big a deal the LHC was  think how big a deal the first ""jump"" is and would be to a civilization. Star Trek touches on this in the movie first contact. Its a huge deal, successfully visiting and returning from another star. There is immense logistical seperation between testing warp technology and launching 10,000 people on a colonization-- let alone millions.  if someone wants to do a colonization game where you have to deal with launch costs, ship food, move colonists, build bubble hab modules, and manage the early warp experiments, i'm in to help do the brainstorming on that. I envision it as an anno2070 type thing where you have to manage the needs and outputs of the colonies relative to the collapsing biosphere on the homeworld.  but nobody does, and i can't code the project myself."

Aurora- you start with normal newtonian rockets to get around and shitty, normal industry, then research post-newtonian materials which let you do things like ignore inertia.  However, there is a limited amount of these post-newtonian resources on your homeworld.  You have to carefully calculate how much industry to convert to the more efficient versions so you still have enough resources left over to start mining fuel and structural materials from the other bodies in the solar system (all of Jupiter's moons are represented, for example).  Fuck up and run out of resources and it's game over.    Eventually (decades, in a game with 5 seconds as the smallest possible timescale), you can start your first colony in another solar system.  Then you have to transfer mines and industry with giant freighter ships (which take years to build).  Then you have to transfer the colonists a few thousand/million at a time, set up a basic habitat for them to live in while you spend another decade converting the atmosphere to be suitable for your genetically-modified-to-live-on-planets-with-0.5 of Earth's gravity- quasi-humans.

4Xgaming,2kko8i,Eraser1024,8,Tue Oct 28 16:43:18 2014 UTC,"Supreme Commander did allow a lot of automation:  Build a factory. Give this factory patrol waypoints. Everything this factory builds will move through the patrol waypoints.  You can have the factory build a mixture of units by using the repeat order. For example, build 3 tanks and 2 bots on repeat, which will build a ratio of 3 tanks to 2 bots forever.  To increase production build more factories, and order these new factories to assist your primary factory. They will take over production orders. Soon you'll have swarms of tanks and bots, built in a 3:2 ratio, swarming these patrol points.  Patrol waypoints can be moved about at will even after the fact. The units will then move to follow the newly moved way points.  Factories will build as resources are available. If you temporarily run out of resources nothing is canceled. Things are just slowed down. Resources are pay as you go rather than pay up front (like Starcraft's economy).  This was an outstanding system for a large scale RTS game. In my view, Supreme Commander was one of the best large scale RTS games of all time. These tools of automation allowed you to focus on the big picture. It was a macro-management game, not a micro-management game."

And I don't mean some setting where you can automate parts of the game for AI to run because you can't be bothered with the micromanagement any more, but a a system where you have to delegate power to others simply because game mechanically you wouldn't be able to do everything yourself. May it be a galactic empire or some fantasy dread empire, the big boss can't be everywhere all the time to take care of every detail, so power is handed to others with the problems that would bring. So it would be more of an empire management game in a 4x frame.  I definitely wouldn't want every game do this, but it would be nice for some game to give a decent shot at it. I read ages ago that Master of Orion 3 was supposed to have something along those lines with some sort of limited ""Imperial focus"" resource each turn that allowed you to make decisions yourself. But they scrapped that idea along with lot of other promises."

Also if anything by the time you get to the point of sprawling empire in crusader kings, in which imperial management would be requires, CK simply gets easier."

4Xgaming,2kko8i,Uloldodok,3,Sat Jan 10 11:44:50 2015 UTC,"For a RTS space 4X I'd like to see some restrictions in travel to other stars, for example having to actually use other stellar objects to ""slingshot"" to your actual destination so that you are forced to wait for opportunities instead of just traveling straight towards whatever, whenever. The early game ""grab everything quickly, now now now!!!!"" just doesn't make sense in my head, colonization should be hard, risky, time consuming and expensive in my opinion.  Something I really would like to see would be a near-future game in which the base-building would be done similarly to, for example, the Anno series. If you want to colonize another planet you pick your target, launch your colonization rockets/ships with the people you want to start this colony and the gear needed(You put this all together, choosing what you need for what planet) and wait for it to arrive. When it arrives you plan and build on that planet too. Say you launch a colony to a huge planet made of some weird substance; you don't build a colony here as it would never be able to be self-sustaining, but you might build some sort of production/mining complex for whatever valuable resources is available on this planet, and ship those resources to where they are needed. Perhaps to a large cargo station that is close to the center of your interstellar empire so that all the colonies can pick up what they need from there.  Space battles would be very, very late game and the early attacks would be landing troops on planets you want to capture the infrastructure on, or perhaps launching bombs to places that you do not want to save the infrastructure on to kill the opposition, which would be cheaper than sending a landing party. You'd never waste anything on other planets as you'd have to rebuild it, and repopulate it - shipping whatever resources needed from where they were available. No more instant resource shipping, or resource sharing through all colonies at once. Teleporters do not exist and trade routes would have to be managed and protected.  Technology would also not be the same for everyone. Sure, the baseline might be as in Space travel, military, management etc, but the actual tech would be different. A race living on an ocean planet would not research the same things as another race living on an earth-like planet for example. Neither would they have the same opportunities as each other. IE; Colonizing a planet with gas so heavy you can swim in it might be very hard for a creature who walked, but not as hard for someone accustomed to living beneath the surface.   TL;DR: 4X RTS in space, with actual resource management and shipping, no instant capture of everything on the map, actual base-building and planning with people management and technology dependent on conditions.  Basically what I want is Anno mixed with Sins of a Solar Empire and Kerbal Space Program, and a touch of Dwarf Fortress on a galactic level."

It had nice deviations from the traditional Civ-esque approach where you could build cities whenever or wherever.  Here you were limited ( this might have changed ) in that you could build a city in a region or conquer whatever native tribe lived there.  Also, it had heroes much akin to Master of Magic.  If I recall correctly there are several races with inherent details and an underworld/second plane.  Again, haven't played in a months so I don't know anymore.

Discover cities Setup automated trade routes Buy out the senate  Make yourself Doge, raise taxes and buy armies to secure cities for yourself and shut out your foes.   I recommend starting by buying glass from venice and selling it somewhere local. An okay trade route is to go to and from rome trading glass for beer. London is a good spot to scout out cause it has tons of wool and iron. St Petersburg (Novgarod) has a nice supply of furs. Cairo is a nice spot as well (grain and fish IIRC) especially as it will start your land bridge towards Africa enabling you to pick up Ivory and Gems from places like Timbuktu. Roads are very much worth the cost in the long run although all factions may use them once placed. Send a small ship around the horn of Africa ASAP to find all the precious trade routes to the east you often get a bonus if you're the first to sail into a foreign harbour. Long term you're looking to setup trade routes from the far east back to Europe; pearls, gems, gold, silver, silk, spices all raise a fine price in the right markets. The true jewel is Molucca situated in Indonesia which contains vast quantities of spices.    When it comes to the senate the money it costs to bribe each senator depends on your popularity so it might be worth building up your villa first of all. Ensure you have at least one senator before the election as it guarantees you a spot in the cabinet (road builder/army/navy).    The entire game is mostly about looking through all the cities and trying to spot out the best set of trade routes for the highest returns."

Having a council with actual people with different traits and personality, who you can send on very specific assignments or missions. They might die or turn against you. Also it would be cool if your opponents had more personality, or maybe changed over time - instead of being the same ruler for thousands of years. A bit more personal relations to the mix, because in reality global politics - which many 4X is sort of based on, often comes down to personal relations between leaders and not merely how much of resource X you trade for resource Y."

4Xgaming,2kigj5,GroZZleR,12,Mon Oct 27 23:06:59 2014 UTC,"Do you prefer turn or time based? Is either style a deal breaker?   I generally prefer real time, turn based games usually involve too much time waiting for something to happen, then everything happens at once and the turns start taking an hour instead of a minute.  I do like Paradox's method though- basically auto-ending a few turns a second with the option to not auto-end the turn.  Gives the best of both worlds.  A galaxy-spanning 4x with 1,000 stars, well-paced gameplay, Paradox's turns method and Total-War type battles = all the money in the world.   Which victory conditions do you enjoy and which do you despise? Do any games stand out for having particularly well implemented victory conditions?   I ignore victory conditions.  They're never relevant, interesting, or useful.   Do you prefer tactical, fast or automatic battles?   Silent Hunter, Close Combat Series type realistic, cautious battles.  This requires having a battle/ tech system that's based on the reality of some era of warfare- Age of Sail, or WWI or WWII, or coming up with an interesting paradigm to base the game around, Sword of the Stars does a good job at this.  Aurora is probably the game with the best system, very flexible, lots of strategies viable, and delicious electronic warfare to ice the cake.  On the other hand, Distant Worlds is pretty meh, the hyperdrive mechanic is really the only interesting thing about DW warfare.   Do you prefer to micromanage every detail, manage the big picture or somewhere in between? How much does the size of the ""map"" influence that?   I micro everything right up until the point where it's obvious that I can just steamroll.  Usually that's when I also just quit.  If the game is sufficiently automated, like Hearts of Iron's theaters, I'll handle logistics and major objectives.   Of the four Xs (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) , which is your most and least favourite? Which do you feel is most poorly implemented (in general)?   Exploration- who doesn't love exploring?  Extermination- do X, hit Y, win.  Yawn.    If Aurora wasn't so buggy and finicky, then both Aurora's exploration and extermination would be my favorite and exploitation would be my annoyance.  (If you want to get philosophical- exploration is the unveiling of possibilities and extermination is the ending of them.)"

What percentage of time will user spend on battles? If it's 5% why do we need it? If it's 40% then they have to really affect the game or it's better to put on autoresolve.

4Xgaming,2kigj5,visage,7,Wed Oct 29 13:38:12 2014 UTC,"Of the four Xs (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) , which is your most and least favourite?   Most favorite would be expanding.  It'd be hard to separate ""least favorite"" from implementation failures.   Which do you feel is most poorly implemented (in general)?   Exterminate is probably the least-well implemented.  Combat is generally the weakest part of 4X games -- it's the one that people just can't seem to get right.  I want the combat to be the best part of the game, but it so rarely is.   Do you prefer turn or time based? Is either style a deal breaker?   Turn based; I don't have much interest in time-based.  If I played multiplayer, that'd probably be flipped.   Which victory conditions do you enjoy and which do you despise? Do any games stand out for having particularly well implemented victory conditions?   My biggest gripe with victory conditions would have probably be diplomatic victory conditions where the AIs have to make decisions that allow you to win.  Having a cultural victory as a replacement for diplomatic victory is generally a good call in my book.   Do you prefer to micromanage every detail, manage the big picture or somewhere in between? How much does the size of the ""map"" influence that?   I don't like giving over control to ""governors"" and the like, and I don't like micromanaging.  So, what I really want is a mechanism to reduce micromanagement as the empire grows.  Templates can go a long way here.  Good UI also helps -- for example, I keep on finding myself in Endless Legend wanting to flag an improvement ""never to be built in this city"" and have it go away from the available improvements.  Alternatively, as the empire grows, start hiding game layers from me.  Once I've got 3 sectors colonized, hide the individual colony management from me and abstract that away.  (Of course, if I encountered that in practice, I might hate it.  shrug)   Do you prefer tactical, fast or automatic battles?   I prefer a combat system that has depth.  That can be any of the above, it's a question of where do you focus the interesting decisions.  Is it force design?  Then battles can be automatic.  Is it the operational game?  Then presumably again battles should be automatic or very fast.  If neither of those has any depth (""throw my fleet of 15 beam cruisers against your fleet of 15 beam cruisers""), then hopefully there's an interesting tactical minigame.  Apart from the above, some of my personal hobby horses when it comes to 4X games:  1) AI bonus scaling:  Just about every 4X game gives AI players scaling bonuses with increased difficulty.  What they never do is scale those bonuses over time -- if you're playing at higher difficulty levels, the AIs could squish you like a bug in the early game if only they bothered.  At some point, your bootstrapping pays off and you've slingshotted past them and now you're squishing everything in sight.  The game becomes all about avoiding early-game smackdown.  I really wish games would increase the bonuses over time, such that early-game AI empires aren't much stronger than I am, but as we get into lategame their bonuses get larger to make up for my superior bootstrapping.  2) Repetitive tactical combat: Everyone knows this one -- the ""automatic combat resolution"" gives you results that look nothing like what you'd get from playing it out, so you end up manually controlling combats... and every combat is pretty much the same.  3) More on combat: What I really want out of combat is a system that encourages forces with (for example, in a space context) intra-fleet diversity and inter-fleet diversity.  You don't build a fleet of ""15 beam cruisers"", but a mixture of short-range and long-range forces, with destroyers and dreadnoughts and everything in between.  ...and you don't want every fleet to be identical, either.  I think my ideal combat resolution system would be one where combat is automatically resolved after you, essentially, give the fleet admiral orders.  (Endless Space tried to do something like this, but mostly failed.)  Either that, or combat in the fundamental vein of Civ 5 and Warlock -- one-unit-per-hex.  5) The ""guns or butter"" dichotomy: I'd really prefer that 4X games make militaries less of a drain on the civilian economy.  Games that have separate build tracks for military versus infrastructure are superior, in my mind, to games where you have to stop developing a city/colony in order for it to be producing military.  ...and if combat is attritional (as it almost always is), I'd prefer to see a mechanism where rebuilding your military from strength X to strength X+k is cheaper than increasing your military from X+k to X+2k.  That can be done via force limits (command points, etc), but what I'd really like to see is military upkeep cost the same resource that military construction costs -- so the amount that your empire is focused on military determines an effective maximum military size that you approach asymptotically."

Which do you feel is most poorly implemented (in general)?   Exploit is definitely my favorite. You can't get there without the first two but there's nothing I enjoy more than establishing monopolies, building surpluses and creating a web of trade routes.  Exterminate is usually my least favorite, though I think that's also because it tends to be the most poorly implemented.   Do you prefer turn or time based? Is either style a deal breaker?   Not a deal breaker but I do prefer turn-based.   Which victory conditions do you enjoy and which do you despise? Do any games stand out for having particularly well implemented victory conditions?   The ones I enjoy tend to be along the scientific/cultural slant. While mechanically it usually boils down to ""research X technology, build Y"" they tend to be the most creatively tied into a game's lore. Transcendence in Alpha Centauri was always cool. Endless Space lets you upload all the minds of your empire onto a computer network.  Military and economic victory conditions tend to be a bit boring. Either kill everyone else, or just amass a bunch of cash.   Do you prefer to micromanage every detail, manage the big picture or somewhere in between? How much does the size of the ""map"" influence that?   I like being able to micromanage, which is part of why I like turn based games. When you're not harried by the clock the scale of operations doesn't really prevent micromanagement.   Do you prefer tactical, fast or automatic battles?   Tactical by far. If there aren't interesting strategic decisions to be made then automatic because I'd rather not waste my time with boring combat."

4Xgaming,2kigj5,vytah,3,Tue Oct 28 19:53:58 2014 UTC,Micromanagement is bad when its stupid or repetitive. When player automatically knows what to do in each screen and does not need to spend even a second thinking then hes in microhell. Repetition eventually makes this situ inevitable.
4Xgaming,2kigj5,druebey,2,Tue Nov 4 01:05:38 2014 UTC,"Of the four Xs (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) , which is your most and least favourite? Which do you feel is most poorly implemented (in general)?   My favourite is exploitation (city-building turned into empire-building), my least favourite is extermination as it's usually very poorly implemented (see below). Exploration is usually bad too though recent games like Endless Legend and Civ5 BNW (renewable exploration resources) are doing some progress in this regard.   Do you prefer turn or time based? Is either style a deal breaker?   Turn-based, but it's not a big deal. RTS usually requires more balance tweaking and makes micromanagement much more complex.   Which victory conditions do you enjoy and which do you despise? Do any games stand out for having particularly well implemented victory conditions?   4X should always have ""peaceful"" victory condition. It doesn't mean the way without combat, it means specific and proxy war for each playstyle (or against each playstyle). Usually peaceful victory means turtling, i.e. you spend your resources on defence and exploitation so your enemy fight against a victory timer in your hands (see Rise of Nations wonder victory or Civ4 cultural victory and sort of space victory in all Civs and science victory in GalCiv). Other good type of victory is battle ""on another plane"" like culture victory in Civ5 BNW but it's rarely seen. You can use war to prevent someone from winning the game this way or to secure your victory (like killing the last Civ with enough culture to resist your blue jeans in Civ5 BNW) but it's auxiliary to the main victory - just as high culture may give you military benefits for you conquest when you're going for military domination.   Do you prefer to micromanage every detail, manage the big picture or somewhere in between? How much does the size of the ""map"" influence that?   Micromanagement is an illusion. People think they want it. People think that Civilization with Total War battles would be a good game. It would be a disaster. If you're adding micromanagement you have to make sure it's important. In TW battle you can't move individual units cause the picture is made more abstract, realistic and, most importantly, convenient. If you could move your individual units then it would be either useful or not. If it's not useful it's just irritating. If it is useful then you're trapped. You have to use 5000 individual units and you know if you do it properly they'll be more effective this way. You carefully move each unit and micromanage it, you are 20% (or 100%, or 1%) more effective than the guy who just uses 30 platoons and not individual soldiers. But you are bored and soon you see that using specific soldiers instead of big parties is boring.  But what if it's not boring? Then you don't play 4X, you play tactics. If you have detailed micromanaged battle and complex empire builder then you have to make sure they're both equally important. Otherwise why should you care about grand strategy if you can beat any empire with clever tactics, micromanagement and exploits? If clever citizen placement can dramatically increase your city production then why would you have to concentrate on empire as a whole?  Micromanagement is bane of good strategies. It destroys strategic thinking and devolves the game into longer tutorial (it's what amateur gamers think is good: learning something new instead of using what you already know) and then into tedious and boring long games.   Do you prefer tactical, fast or automatic battles?   Fast or automatic. The combat must be clear: either I should see what's behind autoresolve math (e.g. see Warlords) or it should give me clear predictions (see Civ4)."

Is either style a deal breaker?   I prefer turn-based, but RT is also ok.    Which victory conditions do you enjoy and which do you despise? Do any games stand out for having particularly well implemented victory conditions?    diplomatic victory – bad (Hey, vote for me, so you can lose the game!) victory by researching a single tech – bad victory by researching some techs and then doing several other things after that (i.e. space victory in Civ) – usually ok victory by amassing a fixed amount of something (culture, energy, mana, money) – very boring victory by the score after a certain number of turns – boring; awful only if too early; it would be better to design the game so it almost never happens extermination victory – boring domination victory – ok regicide – good   Of course a lot depends on how peaceful/warlike the game is.   Do you prefer to micromanage every detail, manage the big picture or somewhere in between? How much does the size of the ""map"" influence that?   There's a certain amount of attention per unit of time I'm ready to give to the game, if it exceeds that, I try to automate everything I can, or queue up production. At the start, micromanaging is fun, but after a certain number of cities/colonies it's annoying. The number is usually in the range 8–20, it depends on the game.   Do you prefer tactical, fast or automatic battles?   If the game has like 3 types of units, then tactical battles are a waste of time. If there are many units with many different abilities, tactical battles are preferred."

You can automate most of it (well, all of it), but it's still a mountain of stats and numbers. It's a great game, but not for beginners.  Since you said you loved Ck2 (It's not strictly a 4x, it's lacking in the 'Explore' category), have you tried the other Paradox Clausewitz grand strategy games?    Europa Universalis 4 starts after Crusader Kings ends and spans the late middle ages through the Renaissance and up to the Napolenoic wars, but instead of a dynasty and characters, you control a country directly. The gameplay revolves more around military conquest and diplomacy than CK2.  Then you have Victoria 2 which is all about colonialism, empires and the start of the industrial age and the 1st World war. This game is all about the economy, and is ridiculously complex compared to the other two (IMO).  Finally, you have Hearts of Iron 3 which basically throws you into the world post Vicky2 and the start of the second world war. This game is all about surviving the war as your chosen country, and is heavily focused on troop deployment and tactics.   As for other games to check out, Endless Space is my go-to suggestion for people new to the genre. It is easy to get the hang of and it has an absolutely excellent UI. The battles are for the most part automatic, so no worries in the leading 'no army leader' department.  Galactic Civilizations 2 is also an excellent choice, though maybe a little dated. It still has the smartest AI around though.  Civ4/Civ5 are both excellent games, but different. I wouldn't say Civ5 is a definite upgrade on Civ4, except graphics wise, more of a sidegrade. Do note that they both need to be upgraded fully with their expansions though, especially Civ5."

In addition, a new race is added with unique mechanics.  The community is kind of split on the changes (At least it was when I last played, which is admittedly a while ago). The changes drastically cuts down on the amount of tiers each weapon system has (Down from 5-6 to 3) which can be both good and bad, depending. Bad because it makes the weapons less varied and there are less technologies to research on the weapon tree, but good because in the old game you'd usually upgrade three tiers in between each refit of a ship, because of how fast you could research. With the new tiers you could actually use the weapons without them being obsolete in 5 turns.   In addition, defense was changed to become more relevant. In the vanilla game you could get away with (Well, actually it was probably the best strategy) just creating glass cannons, while with the new system it's just about mandatory (A single defense module basically halves incoming damage.)   As for the new fighters and bombers, they're kinda useless, sadly.  All in all, a mostly positive bag of goodies... But not necessarily mandatory for having a good time with the game. If you don't own the game and is thinking of buying it, just buy the base game. If you find that you enjoy it, buy the Disharmony expansion. If you find a good bundle deal or something, buy them both and play Disharmony for the updates - as I said earlier, they are mostly positive.

I have to say that this was a huge blow, and  I didnt want to start a new game. I will definitly play CK2 again one day, but right now,  i want to play something else."

4Xgaming,2kf78f,Eraser1024,3,Mon Oct 27 02:02:17 2014 UTC,"I don't expect to find anything better than ac, or even as good, but something to scratch that itch."

4Xgaming,2kf78f,Turambar87,4,Mon Oct 27 07:36:06 2014 UTC,I also recommend this mod.  A lot of Civ:BE is completely unsurprising just because i played Planetfall.

There are key resources like the grand crater, the options allow you have AC like starting positions and the tech tree doesn't punish you for digging deep on a particular path (rather it encourages it). Additionally the terrain differences are huge, and planet attitude is a really big deal."

It's called Predestination. It's not finished yet though.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nyphur/predestination-a-turn-based-space-4x-strategy-game  I have no better ideas."
4Xgaming,2kf78f,Savagedlight,5,Mon Oct 27 03:40:51 2014 UTC,"I'm enjoying BE, but there is definitely room for improvement.  My biggest beef is that when it asks you to select a new build option in a city, it doesn't tell you what you just finished building.  Simple stuff.  I'm a little surprised that Firaxis didn't get that right.  Hopefully it isn't too hard to mod that in."
4Xgaming,2kf78f,Terkala,5,Mon Oct 27 17:37:35 2014 UTC,"I have played both. I prefer Civ:BE by far. My biggest problem with Pandora is it feels like the AI cheats too much, and always has an infinite number of units. There are also stacks of doom, but they are good stacks of doom, because there are mechanics (AoE strikes) to damage every unit in a tile."
4Xgaming,2kf78f,Savagedlight,2,Mon Oct 27 05:09:58 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure that people are familiar enough with Civ:BE to know how much the AI cheats. I've already seen bugs with release where the AI will declare war, then surrender a city 4 turns later without any combat happening. So that gives me a lot of indication that the AI is as stupid as it is in Civ5."

Is it people that played with all the Civ5 expansions that are feeling this ""unfinished"" thing or am I missing something?  The game is obviously inferior to Alpha Centauri but seems to be good fun (BE I mean, I skipped Pandora over the complaints)."
4Xgaming,2kf78f,DoctorDiscourse,3,Mon Oct 27 07:19:33 2014 UTC,"I'm playing BE now thinking it feels pretty damned complete to me.   You know what ? I skipped Civ5 for a long time, and tried it only after the second expansion. First two-three games i was just learning the mechanics, and i was enjoying myself quite a bit. But then i tried to play a ""proper"" game of Civ 5 and found out that the game doesnt really work out to my satisfaction. AI is completely lobotomized, constant trade routes requests, stupid infinite bonus systems, extremely tiny maps...all this is still a thing in Beyond Earth, so i'm not touching anything Civ5 related with a 10-foot pole, and am inclined to try Pandora in a few days and see how that goes."
4Xgaming,2kf78f,megazver,2,Mon Oct 27 12:46:42 2014 UTC,"There's a certain level of Balance and stability that people have come to expect from civ games, and it feels like Beyond Earth isn't there yet. Health is extremely hard to come by until midgame where it ramps up and you never have to worry about it again. Trade feels important, but when you're playing wide with 2-3 or more trade routes per city, it becomes a trade management game. Miasma is impossible to spot until it's too late. The victory conditions all feel the same.   You know, It's a great game and I really like it, I know that Firaxis will put in the wrench time to balance the game and make it great, but Vanilla BE is like Vanilla Civ 5 and even Vanilla Civ 4, it's got potential, but it's not there yet."

Civilizations Revolution has already been mentioned, but I think you'd be doing yourself a disservice not picking up one of the Civs with more complexity.  I have a lot of hours into EL, and it's not bad and I would recommend it to jump in. Civ 4 is still my favorite (stacking units ftw).  Easier to drop in and out is up to you.  The saying with 4x games is ""just one more turn.""  There isn't a single person on this sub who hasn't found themselves at 3 in the morning uttering that phrase."
4Xgaming,2kcpab,fredrodgers,8,Sun Oct 26 18:30:26 2014 UTC,"I would recommend not taking BE yet, it still is very buggy on certain setups (some Radeon cards specifically have been having issues).

You are in the wrong genre if you don't want to memorize tons of information imo."
4Xgaming,2kcpab,Chriamon,4,Sun Oct 26 13:53:34 2014 UTC,"If you're looking at those two choices, Endless Legend is what I'd recommend. It has a much easier learning curve, and doesn't require in-depth knowledge of how everything works in order to play the game.  If you want something more space focused, but still easy to get into: GalCiv2 is a really good game with a great mixture of ""easy to learn, hard to master"" gameplay."
4Xgaming,2kcpab,Terkala,3,Sun Oct 26 08:26:01 2014 UTC,"Having played both a significant amount, Civ BE seems, to me, to be more complicated and harder to get into, especially for a 4x newcomer. Endless Legend is very newbie friendly and streamlined."
4Xgaming,2kcpab,teeto_,3,Sun Oct 26 07:39:50 2014 UTC,"Question, why is the choice only between those two titles? There's quite a few modern 4x games that are relevant and easy to get into for beginners on the market right now."
4Xgaming,2kcpab,DigiAirship,3,Sun Oct 26 13:06:17 2014 UTC,"GalCiv 2 does everything right as a modern 4x, but doesnt have a classic polished feel that you'll get from Civ 4, Civ 5, or Civ:BE.    Since you've been on hiatus for so long id recommend to go with Civ 5.  It is very user friendly and more approachable than most offerings from smaller studios."
4Xgaming,2kcpab,Karma_Gardener,2,Sun Oct 26 15:55:00 2014 UTC,"If we're venturing into space 4x I'd recommend Master of Orion 2 over GalCiv2. It may be older, but it's also better."
4Xgaming,2kcpab,Fambida,2,Sun Oct 26 20:41:13 2014 UTC,MOO 2 is glorious.  Especially if you can research all the way to that super laser thing at the end.  Epic battles!
4Xgaming,2kcpab,fredrodgers,2,Mon Oct 27 06:48:52 2014 UTC,Civ V (get all the expansions)
4Xgaming,2kcpab,thefattestman22,4,Sun Oct 26 18:09:24 2014 UTC,"Not one of your 2 options, but I think Age of Wonders 3 fits your specifications beautifully. Always fun, easy to learn, you can click on any unit to see exactly what all its powers do (if you care, but the fighting is intuitive: Dragon Causes Fear, your elves run away).  Lots of replay value: you can choose from about 6 races, 6 classes, and 6 or so magic specializations; the differences between them are small but significant.  You can find some killer combos, but I just play a random character (on a random map) and have fun every time.   Compared to Civ, it's very combat-focused: Cities are mostly just to earn money and make military units.  There's diplomacy with the CPU players and independent cities (basically whether you're at war or peace), but no real mechanics for religion, culture, etc (though you do need to research magic spells).  It's about using your armies to conquer the various cities and dungeons, level up your heroes, find magic items, and conquer opponents without leaving your cities too undefended.  It comes with a few cool campaigns, but the real strength is the random map generator.  You can make a small map and play it in a couple hours, or a gigantic 30-hour explorationfest, or anything in-between.  Every game is different, and fun in different ways; playing an Orcish Fire Sorcerer requires different strategies than an Elven Creation Warlord; and playing a small map with 7 opponents packed in is different from a large, open map.  And if you find you prefer a certain type of game, there are dozens of options when creating a map.   TL;DR Age of Wonders is easy to get into; it doesn't have dozens of buildings and techs and stuff, just enough well-balanced ones that combine to create an experience that's always interesting and fun."
4Xgaming,2kcpab,MeepleTugger,2,Sun Oct 26 22:07:36 2014 UTC,EL is perhaps the best 4X I've played in a long time. Definitely worth picking up.
4Xgaming,2kcpab,wOlfLisK,3,Sun Oct 26 13:54:26 2014 UTC,"As a lover of 4x I don't think Endless Legends is actually any good. Its nice and shiny but its just not that satisfying throughout the entire game IMO. You're doing the same kind of stuff all game as the unit designs don't change after the second tier of tech (literally no further unit designs). I strongly recommend getting a Civ game as its really the only place to start if you've never played 4x. Typically you don't want to get the latest and greatest because they're often released somewhat incomplete so this applies to both Civ BE and Endless Legends.  I recommend Civ IV. Over 2k hours I've spent on that, totally worth, early, mid and late game all have exciting features to keep you interested and things varied (religions, ancient war tech, siege weapons, elephants, classical units, gunpowder & steel, corporations, tanks, planes, nukes, space race). Also cheap so if you don't like its not a big deal. Nice introduction to the genre, reasonably modern graphics, lots of excellent mods (Buffy is a good default mod that just makes more information available, blue marble for better textures and on top of that there are a ton more like Fall of Heaven 2 which is an excellent fantasy mod). Its a complete game which is really what you want to buy as your starter. The big drawback is that combat is simplified in Civ IV where its a touch more advanced in Civ V and BE, other modern titles do offer much more complex combat but sometimes at a bit of a cost of other aspects. Combat in Endless Legends is shit in my opinion so if you're considering EL because of that go look at some of the other titles I mention below (Fallen Enchantress specifically looked like it had a solid implementation), I'm genuinely saving you hours of frustration here with Endless Legends. Its worth noting that complicated combat is a recently new addition to the genre (i.e. 5-10 years or so ago) because the genre classically focuses on empire building more than microing units.    Might also be worth looking at videos for Age of Wonders III, Fallen Enchantress and Warlock 2. They all looked quite interesting when I was digging around last.     Which doesn't require me to memorize tons of information or read through a glossary to figure something out every 3 minutes?     I personally ignored this requirement because that's what this genre is pretty much all about. If you're really set on it then I'd give the vote to something like Warlock 2 or Age of Wonders III because they appear reasonably simplified (but alas I do not have personal experience of these)."

4Xgaming,2kcpab,MeepleTugger,2,Sun Oct 26 21:37:44 2014 UTC,"The very first video game I purchased with my own money was Stars! I really love the older versions of Civ (I miss Leonard Nemoy's narration every time I researched something (bring him back Firaxis!!!!!!)) I'm of course a member of the Supreme Master PC race (or whatever) so when I finally got a PS3, I bought Rev for it.  I actually enjoyed playing it as a Civ-lite.  Sure, there really isn't the depth I was used to, but I could play a complete and large game within a couple of hours (and really, why play a small short game?)   I've not extensively played Civ5, but I'm not as happy with it as I felt I should be.  EL is a good game, but still has a bigger learning curve than Rev does."

I have 1,000+ hours of civ games behind me and BE confuses me quite a bit.  Civ 5 is a perfect start for someone new to the genre. You have a good tutorial, clear objectives, fantastic UI and the historical context will make much more sense than a fantasy or sci-fi setting."

If you want to wait a month or two before buying, I'd say try that and check back on BE and see if it's been worked on. Also, there are many more mods available for Civ V than for BE at the moment.

(No equivalent) Many Orbital units (Closer to great people or civilian units I suppose)   Civ V has 13 different types to choose from at any one time. All units are a subset of these. BE has 12 with another possible 8. But I think theoretically you could unlock all 20. And BE still has bombers and fighters, they are just both combined into the Tacjet.

You've more fun with Civ5 + DLC because there are at least 18 choices of civilization compared to BE with its 8 choices (lol).  It's my point of view, if you really want to change universe and want something new, go with BE.  Both are different games, you can have fun with Civ5 and BE.  The best way is to try before buy."
4Xgaming,2kaptq,Alex-L,6,Sun Oct 26 05:08:48 2014 UTC,"It's not quite true that BE has only 8 civil choices.  You have 8 sponsor choices, 6 colonist choices, 6 ship choices and 6 cargo choices.  So, you could claim that BE has 1728 civs.  Now, not all combinations play substantially differently, and sponsor is the most broad reaching option.  But, AU/refugee/worker/tetonic does play differently from AU/artists/clinic/retrograde."
4Xgaming,2kaptq,loveablehydralisk,2,Sat Oct 25 17:08:01 2014 UTC,"Civ 5 is cheaper, and more complete. BE isn't really any better than vanilla Civ 5."
4Xgaming,2kaptq,BoboTheTalkingClown,3,Sat Oct 25 17:36:18 2014 UTC,"I have about 2'000 hours into Civ 5 Brave New World (BNW). I have played 100 turns of C:BE. I find C:BE has the same faults that Civ5 had when it first came out. I am heading back to BNW with my lovely mods (Unlimited units per hex, UI DLC, and many more) and will probably wait for my favorite mods for Civ 5 to be ported over or new ones to replicate the experience.  TL;DR: C:BE isn't worth the $60. Get BNW- wait for 75% off sale."
4Xgaming,2kaptq,Fambida,4,Sat Oct 25 22:50:34 2014 UTC,"From the sounds of your mods, seems like Civ 4 should be your recommendation. I mean, one unit per tile and its accompanying awful AI was one of 5's biggest flaws that 4 didn't share.   (The other main one being penalizing wide to the point the expansion and conquest weren't really viable options.)"
4Xgaming,2kaptq,Crapzor,2,Sat Oct 25 20:33:43 2014 UTC,One unit per tile is a flaw?You mean 15 units on one tile that you cannot see is good game mechanics?
4Xgaming,2kaptq,ZanThrax,7,Sun Oct 26 02:18:01 2014 UTC,"Tactical combat doesn't make sense on a scale where a single unit take up a space a hundred miles wide.  http://www.garath.net/Sullla/Civ5/whatwentwrong.html  Many of civ5's basic design problems are down to the effects that implementing 1upt had on the game. (Useless ai that can't actually fight for shit, insane diplomatic ai that can never be trusted to honour agreements, and happiness/research mechanics that mean sprawl is always better aren't helping the game either.)"
4Xgaming,2kaptq,MetalMermelade,2,Sun Oct 26 05:14:41 2014 UTC,I actually like the 1 unit per tile. In civ IV the doom stack took all the fun for because it was all I needed.  For me it makes sense that 1 unit should use 1 tile so that the players could use the map. I am challenged when I want to conquer a city with hills mountains and rivers and I have to work my way around it instead of rushing 1 stacked unit across 1 empire. its a problem solved by brain power instead of being challenged by tweaking the numbers to make it harder
4Xgaming,2kaptq,Draakon0,3,Sun Oct 26 07:36:08 2014 UTC,"The major problem with Civ combat (both 4 and 5) is the actual 1vs1 mechanics, algorithms, etc. that happen between the two units. An archer basically is just a warrior with different skin and stats. Sure, there is ranged combat (default with Civ 5 vanilla, Civ 4 got that thing modded in), but other then that, what else there is?  Combat is largely rock, paper, scissors type of deal in both of these games. It's stats warfare. Each unity type doesn't have anything unique going on about them that makes even the most impossible of battles successful. And visually, it's just a whack-a-mole combat.  1 unit per tile also introduced 2 major problems with Civ 5. One is that the game felt as if I was already fighting a god damn WW2 already with large fronts. It tried to combine two different things into 1: tactical and strategical warfare. As such, battles especially late game turned out to be boring, long turns. That is problem number 2.   I am challenged when I want to conquer a city with hills mountains and rivers and I have to work my way around it instead of rushing 1 stacked unit across 1 empire.   That was a problem even in Civ 4. Sure, having superior numbers worked, but that ratio between attacker and defender had to be big, especially late game. And very especially if you did attack from places that gave a penalty during attacking, such as across a river. With Civ 5, if a city only had 1 optimal attack angle (say that city had 4 hexes filled with water with the 5th being only plains) it takes ages to move a single unit there, attack it, have it die or bring it out of there and then move another unit in. The amount of movements I had to do for things like that was just too damn much.  TL;DR version: Combat by far is the most boring gameplay element in any Civ game, ever. It has been pretty static in its improvements since the first game and even with Civ 5, it's still stupidly tedious."
4Xgaming,2kaptq,Fambida,2,Sun Oct 26 09:26:50 2014 UTC,"No, doom stacks were a problem. However, civ 5's ""cure"" was even worse. If you want to see a good solution try playing the Fall From Heaven 2 mod for Civ 4.  There were units which would attack the weakest units in a stack, units which would do collateral damage to every unit in the stack, and plain ol AoE that'd hit everything too. There was even a unit that exploded on death, making taking a stack up to it retarded as shit."

Throughout all game types, you'll earn experience towards permanently levelling up your dynasty weapons, which can boost your heroes in a variety of ways.  Also, with points you earn from completing achievements, you can buy perks, and you can change your perk loadout between games depending on your strategy/etc.   Heroes 6 got a fair bit of flak, but I thought the game was quite good.  Downside: Ubisoft's uPlay always-on DRM :-(.   Edit: On the RTS side, Starcraft 2 has some similar ideas in their campaigns, but none of those carry over to multiplayer of course."

4Xgaming,2jznb4,naranha,-14,Fri Oct 24 13:28:09 2014 UTC,Why not just make a video?Put the same pictures on rotation and talk. This way i can do other things while im listening instead of giving yet another endless legend review my full attention.
4Xgaming,2jznb4,Crapzor,13,Wed Oct 22 15:59:58 2014 UTC,"Don't be like that, text also has its advantages. I personally prefer text in a lot of situations (reading at work is a good example). Videos are much more difficult and time consuming to make and ""lets play"" videos are often mind-numbing deviation quests. To make a proper video that doesn't waste your time would literally take a few days compared to an article that would take a few hours (im trying to factor in encoding, editing, reviewing, potential issues which lengthen the process)."
4Xgaming,2jznb4,_tpyo,-9,Wed Oct 22 18:31:33 2014 UTC,Iv uploaded videos to youtube. All one has to do is read that exact text from the article while rotating the pictures from the article as video feed. You dont need no days to do that.

4Xgaming,2jzo5d,Fambida,1 point,Thu Oct 23 02:47:09 2014 UTC,"I got round to starting Age of Wonders...  Economy wise, it feels a bit too limiting for my tastes (well my taste for a HoMM/Civ hybrid).   At least from what I understand so far, the only real economic decisions you get to make are where to place your city so that its borders expand over Gold Mines and other various resources. That and choosing repeatable economic actions in your town like 'Generate Mana' (equivalent to Civ's Convert Production to Wealth/Research).   There didn't seem to be many economic buildings or things like tile improvements or luxury resources. Spells cast on the city have been interesting so far though. Also tiles around the city didn't seem to matter at all, whereas in Civ you've got hills and grasslands and deserts with different yields.  Maybe I was wrong when I said Civ V was too economy focused. I find myself playing AoW and wanting all the economy features from Civ inside xD"
4Xgaming,2jzo5d,Draakon0,2,Fri Oct 24 03:36:38 2014 UTC,"What you want is called Master of Magic. It's an old (OLD!) game, but none of its successors have managed to top it yet. Not Age of Wonders, Warlock, or Fallen Enchantress have recaptured the magic.  Ways in which it is like Civ: Settlers, Cities, gold, grid based map, special resource tiles, cities are effected by the terrain around them, balancing research vs production vs military. (research is a subset of magic in this case. there is no tech tree, but spell schools instead)  Ways it's like HoMM: Heroes, Tactical battles (units on the world map can stack up to 9 per tile, and when a stack engages a different stack, it switches to a tactical battle map.) items, magic spells both overland and in battle.  Ways it's better than both:  There is no research tree, so all tech type advancement is done through a building progression tree in each city, so much HoMM building determine what units a city can build. However, The unit production is done in a civ hammers per turn style instead of HoMMs clunky weekly caps.  There is a magic research tree, and an associated resource called mana. Different city buildings, certain races base population, resource tiles, and special tiles called nodes (which can have defenders just like HoMM's tiles) can all provide this mana. Mana is allocated amongst researching new spells, saving mana for casting spells, and raising your casting skill, which determines how much mana you can use on casting per turn.  Item Creation: MoM allows you to create your own custom items for your heroes using  2 spells called create magic tiem, and create artifact. The bonuses and powers you can assign to an item are determined by what spell schools you have books in, and as you assign more abilities the cost of creating it rises.  There's bunches of other shit too, but I'm tired of this wall o' text.  TL;DR http://www.gog.com/game/master_of_magic it's only $6, you may as well try it. While the graphics and sound are old old old, the gameplay has yet to be topped."

The AI and diplomacy was terrible and unfortunately the game's only single player, but it's a great little fantasy sandbox.  If you somehow missed out on this classic its worth acquiring.  You may also find the Dominions series interesting - though there's a bit less focus on the hero development the pretender creator is unparalleled in variety, and provides a huge impact on gameplay.  Like Master of Magic, the AI doesn't really do well with this kind of open endedness, but if you just want a nice fantasy sandbox to play in it's absolutely amazing."

4Xgaming,2jyu2j,ion-tom,3,Wed Oct 22 05:22:38 2014 UTC,"This sounds like a great project. Good luck.  I can't really help you with your technical issues, but I'd have a suggestion about gameplay:   The early game will be manual and difficult, but as the game world develops sophisticated AI around 2040-2050, some of the processes would self-manage.   Don't do this. Let's face it, your AI will probably suck. That's just what AIs in games do. So unless you have the manpower and confidence to create an AI that can act just as efficiently as an experienced player, this is most certainly not the way to go. If the AI is worse than a player, it's sudden introduction at some point in the game might as well become a punishment, rather than a reward.  Not to mention that dragging players through the mud of learning some deep game mechanics just to take them away from their grasp when they finally figure them out sounds like a rather poor design idea, even for an educational game.  If you want to add some automation, provide it to players from the begining as a tool, rather than acting like it's some sort of a futuristic in-universe industrial AI running the show. Games like Hearts of Iron 3 or Distant Worlds have already proven enough that allowing players to automate anything at any time doesn't hurt the gameplay. At the end of the day, a player is almost always better at it, making the manual control more rewarding. Automation is best as a crutch for new players so they won't be overwhelmed by the game, which sounds especially useful in this case. Providing it only in the late game would be a spit in the face.  Even better, make good tools for players to automate the game themselves. Let them set transport routes, production queues, storage management etc. That way, they can configure the established parts of their ""empire"" and leave it running, while still making the actual decisions themselves, applying their knowledge of associated game mechanics. That will make the game work better both as an educational game and as an interactive simulation."
4Xgaming,2jyu2j,Infamously_Unknown,1 point,Wed Oct 22 12:26:06 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Right, the game we've essentially divided into 3 phases. Of which, only phase I is being developed currently.   1. The Early game - individual missions, totally manual 2. Rise of Automation - the player sets up automated factories, trade networks (orbit cyclers), computing arrays 3. Playing towards the end game - approaching full automation, but giving the player unique decisions based on how they've grown their ideology, tech focus, and infrastructure   Now... if we cut the game off at ~2040 and focused on small missions, automation won't be an issue. But part of the idea for the later game is depicting exponential growth... and there are millions of asteroids out there.  HoI is actually one of the few Paradox games I haven't played, I may have to check both of those out. But yes, having some sort of logical weights to assign to the automated system would be the best way to go, you would still need to have interactivity and control or the game would stop being fun. Actually the game that inspires me most for that part of the game is AI War: Fleet Command  Cheers!"
4Xgaming,2jyu2j,Hyndis,3,Wed Oct 22 18:07:10 2014 UTC,"What is the focus of your game? Is the focus of your game going to be building factories? If so, then go wild with the details. Let players worry about all kinds of factory parts and refining/cracking processes for things.  Some games do this, like Factorio. This game is about building a factory and converting one resource into another. That is the entire game. And its fun because it does this one thing well.  If your game isn't focused on processing resources then you really need to abstract it. You don't need to simply it as much as the Starcraft system perhaps, but you do want to abstract it. An needlessly complex game is a bad game. You have to pick an area and focus on it. Abstract everything else.  You may want to take a look at Distant Worlds for an abstract but complex resource system. Every object in space may have some resources. These resources could be extracted by building a colony there, building a space station, or having portable mining ships visit to go mine the object. Planets, moons, gas giants, and even asteroids could be mined. Everything in Distant Worlds needs resources to build. Want to build a new ship? Every piece of armor plating and every laser gun on that ship needs resources to construct. The AI is smart enough to mostly automate this. Freighters will haul resources to planets that have shipyards on them, but construction can still grind to a halt if you're missing something. A very large, complex ship may take 20 different resource types to construct, but actually harvesting them is completely abstracted. Build an extractor module and a cargo bay on a station, put the station in orbit around an asteroid, and it will do its thing. Freighters will stop by to haul these resources from its cargo bay to shipyards that need resources."
4Xgaming,2jybs3,MMSTINGRAY,2,Wed Oct 22 02:11:18 2014 UTC,"I've played 3 games and it was fun to get to know the mechanics. However even with huge bonuses AI is impotent so you don't get much interesting strategic challenges. I expect the game to become a lot better soon. It's fun now but in its current state it won't live in centuries.   Usually it's a sign you should forget about game as most of them (especially 4X) don't get fixed in the end but Amplitude showed they work on their games just like Firaxis (and, I think, no other company) does. I expect the game to be expanded and fixed with free updates.  So buy it now and you'll have some fun. Just don't expect it to be as replayable as Civilization (or even Endless Space) is now. Year later you'll still have fun with it and it certainly be better."

4Xgaming,2jybs3,moo422,-3,Wed Oct 22 02:17:18 2014 UTC,"Heh, some timing, I just wrote up my metacritic review. It's a 4/10 for me:     I really wanted to love this game. To a degree I still kinda do. The art design is glorious, the loading screen for the vaulters, that transportation tube going through the mountain tells so many stories, the cultists look absolutely amazing I really fell in love with the fluff of this game, the necrophages and ""elves"" are a bit cliched but everyone else is pretty damn cool. The sound is glorious, the graphics are very pretty, everything about it is really good..... except the actual game. That's not to say you can't burn numerous hours and have a blast, much like the people above me who love this game to bits, you can. However if you're the discerning type, maybe you've played a few civs, maybe Sins of a Solar Empire, you've been around for bit.... you'll get frustrated with some of its design. First off don't listen to the quests. The quests mislead you and put you in a bad spot. For example the Cultist quest begins by instructing you to convert two villages. One of those villages will be outside of your border, you can only have one city. Someone else will colonise that land and burn your converts down, then it will cost you twice as much to convert the next village. Instead, fast tech to peace treaties (tier two), then follow the quest. Most of the quests are like that. There is barely any diplomacy. You have to sort of prod and poke to work out why/if people are mad at you, when they'll attack. It's annoying, its opaque (think release Civ V).  The combat. Alas. This game due to its lack of interesting diplo options (i.e. you can't try to start trouble between other factions) is based on its combat. The combat sucks, its poorly designed. Some units have an ability that performs an AOE attack on retaliation only. When you attack someone first (you have more initiative) you prevent them from attacking you. So you can't build initiative items. The void lord infantry unit gains health if they have attacked a unit on the same turn that it dies (not relatiated) they have incredibly low initiative that is really hard to buff so you miss out on it all the time. Chances are the enemy will die from a retaliation at the start of their turn robbing you of it. You can't control where you move AND who you attack. Only one or the other. If you just give attack markers the AI will typically make all your units block each other so nobody gets to fight. If you automate combat it will do the most stupid things in the world (especially if the terrain is cramped). Not all villages are equal, if you start a game as the vaulters and have a the little flyer village in your territory the game is vastly more difficult than it otherwise should be. Bad design. For some reason someone thought it would be ""fun"" to have a ""winter"" month. Where for a certain amount of turns (more the longer the game goes on) you get WAY less gold, production, food and movement speed. That's the opposite of fun. It's annoying and arbritrarily pointless. You're forced to put heroes into towns because the town bonuses you get are way too good to pass up, so you have to unlock the market and save up a ton of gold to do so (they're really, really good).  This should be a great game but unfortunately its just a bad Civ rip-off. I feel so sad for the people that did the gfx, the art and the sound that the game designers didn't actually play through their game enough to actually make it fun and logical, so much of it doesn't make any sense. There are tons of Civ clones out there but unfortunately this isn't one that takes the genre into an interesting direction. OH and what's with all these people flattening tech trees? Its not ""fun"" or ""strategic"" to be forced into teching things you don't need just to force the tech era onto the next one. What's fun is making trade-offs so you can rush something dazzling that fits into a strategy that you have formed.     Possibly controversial as some people seem to love it. It just didn't work out for me.    OH ALSO, I left it out of the review, when I played it last month there were some somewhat annoying glitches in it as well. They're tolerable albeit a tad annoying. You might have to click too much sometimes, ungarrisoning a troop is usually a nightmare (especially if you want them to do something with their movement points), it sometimes bugs out if you reload in the middle of a fight (although typically this gets fixed when the reload finishes). Its still totally playable in my experience."
4Xgaming,2jybs3,_tpyo,6,Wed Oct 22 04:53:50 2014 UTC,"One of those villages will be outside of your border, you can only have one city. Someone else will colonise that land and burn your converts down, then it will cost you twice as much to convert the next village.   I don't think you get how the game works. This quest chain gives you very good rewards and if anyone burns this village the price for next conversion will fall. Also you gain significant benefits till the province is converted.   You general concern is understandable and your points of gameplay being significantly weaker than visuals and AI being stupid are perfectly valid but talking about ""bad design"" when you clearly don't understand said design makes your review useless for those who played the game and disinformation for those who played the game."
4Xgaming,2jybs3,Ilitarist,3,Wed Oct 22 08:44:27 2014 UTC,"This. Reviews like this make me cringe, you make some valid criticism and then ruin it by showing a lack of understanding of the game, which suggests you didn't play it for very long as it really isn't that complex of an issue to work out. It might not even be true but I can't help but read the rest of the review in that light now.  I wonder what he gave Civ V at release?"
4Xgaming,2jybs3,_tpyo,-2,Wed Oct 22 13:35:32 2014 UTC,"I played Endless Legend for 64 hours. I played Civ V for 83 hours (horsemen OP, roads cost 1 gold PER TURN, happiness is global, AI was utter, utter trash with the Iroquois furiously throwing warriors and bowmen at my crossbow units while refusing any possibility of peace). I appreciate they've resolved a lot of this but what bugs me is the 4x market embracing very strongly the premise of less cities to reduce complexity, some of us like that complexity and things like global happiness ontop of existing corruption mechanics make that full world empire much more tricky to pull off. I DIDN'T PICK GANDHI SO STOP LIMITING ME.  I used to play Hall of Fame for Civ IV on Civ Fanatics so I'm obsessed with efficient gameplay which is why I believe the game is poorly designed. Sure, go ahead and piss away your influence, I'd rather tech first and then influence so I don't waste anything or drag myself into a pointless early war.    If you're cult then you're great at generating influence, ergo diplomacy is your arena. Don't mindlessly war as it doesn't provide you with a great benefit for cost. You're better off converting villages than spending your time fighting. When you fight you want a clear tech advantage (shiny armour!) and you want a swift resolution. If we're talking bad design then why bother researching increased army size if you're not the cult (as it also increases village size). You can just bring re-enforcements as a separate group at any stage of the game (sure they turn up a bit later but just use fast units or fight in chokey environments)."
4Xgaming,2jybs3,_tpyo,0,Wed Oct 22 17:09:16 2014 UTC,"The quest rewards are good? Are you out of your mind? Some of the boosters are incredibly so-so, giving me gold at the start is just five dust a turn (-50% maintenance), others might give me extra influence that I don't require at that stage of the game and when my converts are burnt down it DOESNT reduce the price of conversion, certainly not when I played on release. I like to play the game efficiently and to do so with cult you fast tech for peace because tech is always nice, you want to build up your city anyway and not having that tech and converting is pissing your influence points away. Starting a war with a neighbour is best avoided early as you can't conquer their lands so it provides no sort of snowball effect aside from some production boosters. Its best to grab a strong ally ""hope they war"" while slowly converting the world and building a super army to either conquer or go for the scenario victory. As you can sell your converts to the slave market it puts you in a great position to put yourself in a dominant global position by fast building your city.  The design is fucking abysmal in places. I suppose you want to defend the preacher unit next? That unit is a complete waste of space at the start of the game (15% buff of low amounts provide you with little reward and its so fragile and poorly ranged that getting the slow off is a dangerous task). Much better to fast tech markets and buy better units to clear your first camp (parley is very variable in terms of difficulty so it might not be a good option some quests are impossible to do with just hero + 2 preachers).    I played the game for 64 hours so its not like I didn't give it a fair crack, I spent probably 1/4 or a 1/3 of that working out the most efficient opener for cult and IMO its fast tech to peace treaties."
4Xgaming,2jybs3,Ilitarist,2,Wed Oct 22 17:07:11 2014 UTC,"The quest rewards are good?   After you complete couple of quests of this quest chain you get cheap artifact you can give to any unit.   my converts are burnt down it DOESNT reduce the price of conversion   It does.   I like to play the game efficiently and to do so with cult you fast tech for peace because tech is always nice, you want to build up your city anyway and not having that tech and converting is pissing your influence points away.   Conversion is the quickest way to develop your city and get tech. Again, you didn't understand the mechanics.   I suppose you want to defend the preacher unit next?

4Xgaming,2jybs3,_tpyo,-1,Wed Oct 22 17:15:26 2014 UTC,Conversion is the quickest way to develop your city and get tech.     You have options. Its not like you can't build boroughs or some of the core tech buildings. You happen to have the exact mechanics to hand? From my understanding the major benefit is the free pop.   After you complete couple of quests of this quest chain you get cheap artifact you can give to any unit.     Really? How do you apply that? I've spent many minutes trying to desperately click on things in the unit screen to no avail. Afaik you have to wait till weapons 4 (is it?) and a certain unit level to get the dust weapons on your units. Everything else is just pendants you put on your commander. Is it one of those?  Are you really still going to continue to defend the game design? I've got more shots. Whats the point of mithril/purple stuff when the final level of weapons goes back to the previous resources? Seems silly to me (sure you need it for some buildings but it seems odd that the final tier isn't the final resource). Its just another indicator of things being rushed and not fully thought through (better would be pink level 1=>2 and then mithril for the final stage).
4Xgaming,2jybs3,Ilitarist,2,Wed Oct 22 17:46:48 2014 UTC,"You have options. Its not like you can't build boroughs or some of the core tech buildings. You happen to have the exact mechanics to hand? From my understanding the major benefit is the free pop.   You get free pop and tile income from the converted village as if it is your capital district (with no disapproval IIRC). Also you get income from all of those region's resources as soon as you have tech (no building needed, but you get them very slow, like 0.1 per resource per village). Also it generates units you can use as cheap cannon fodder or sell them (usually >250 per unit).   I've spent many minutes trying to desperately click on things in the unit screen to no avail.   Every Cultist unit can get this artefact as accessory and it's viable trough the whole game.   Whats the point of mithril/purple stuff when the final level of weapons goes back to the previous resources?    You are make in it worse with every post.

There is no level 2 weapons of green/red.     Every Cultist unit can get this artefact as accessory and it's viable trough the whole game.   Where do you assign it, is it automatic? What does it do?     You get free pop and tile income from the converted village as if it is your capital district (with no disapproval IIRC). Also you get income from all of those region's resources as soon as you have tech (no building needed, but you get them very slow, like 0.1 per resource per village). Also it generates units you can use as cheap cannon fodder or sell them (usually >250 per unit).     Fair point, sorry my advice is poor. I'm just remembering the game I was happy with and the trick is to convert districts that aren't at risk of being populated (at least one district gap) at the start while fast teching to peace treaties, not selling the units inside until you do."
4Xgaming,2jybs3,Ilitarist,1 point,Wed Oct 22 19:00:49 2014 UTC,"Level 3 is purple/pink, level 4 is green/red and level 5 is back to purple pink.    You're talking about the order in which you discover those. The game calls them Lvl 1/2/3 Titanite/Orchilarium/Whatever Axe. Some of those techs you can't get by research (only by discovering techs). Generally later resources are better but earlier have special abilities you may want. E.g. if you research Lvl 3 ""Cheap Resources"" Armor you can get nice accessories for you governers that give bonus to specific area associated with said resource. Same with weapons: some give speed, some give attack, some give defence. And you may be limited in resources. This way you can research upgrades for all types of weapons. And also dust weapons.   Where do you assign it, is it automatic? What does it do?   It's accessory (slots undo unit model) in hero equipment screen and it requires some dust and cheap resource (malachite or something). It's also on unit creation screen so you can add it to any Cultist unit. Here it is."
4Xgaming,2jybs3,_tpyo,1 point,Wed Oct 22 20:51:56 2014 UTC,"Oh that. Yeah that's just a hero accessory that buffs troops, I thought you meant an item you could actually GIVE TO TROOPS (I was looking around hard for one of those while I was playing but sadly they don't seem to exist). Glad you see you're donning the best accessory in the game though (the speed upgrade).  The order of Isivier is nice but remember they're all % based bonuses so if you're rushing it to put it on preachers they'll still suck because +35% to fuck all is still sadly fuck all. ;). Obviously its incredible later on and +35% is still okay on early troops.   Back to the metals briefly. Its worth noting the first two are plentiful, the next two slightly more rare and the third even more rare. That's why its strange that the best weapons only require the Tier2 and not the Tier3 metals IMO. After I'd finished playing I questioned the designer's consistency and this was one of the small details that contributed to that thought. I don't have an issue with it not being your assessment but it is mine."

4Xgaming,2jxwbi,_tpyo,3,Tue Oct 21 23:49:07 2014 UTC,"You can set the payment to mercs by pressing and holding either arrow keys or +/-, maybe even just typing the amount (I haven't played it in a while). You don't need to click your mouse several hundreds of times.  If you're holding shift (iirc, maybe ctrl/alt) when recruiting troops, it will add them to the queue by 10. In dom4, you can set recruitment on repeat.  When setting up mages or other units, you don't need to do it one by one. Set up one and confirm it. Then hover over the set command (that would reopen the unit's setup) and press ctrl+number to save the settings. Hover over another unit's setup button (without opening it) and press alt+number to paste it.  Pincer/flanking is actually kind of a thing here. Given how blocking and parrying work, an encircled squad is at a disadvantage and more likely to get hit. That's why single giant units can get so relatively easily overwhelmed by common chaff even if each of the soldiers wouldn't usually be able to scratch them. It's just that dom3 doesn't have formations and units are always deployed in boxes, so it's not as easy to achieve that in squad vs. squad combat as in dom4.  EDIT: Also, those single troops sneaking through your borders and destroying your temples are just exploiting the fact that you're not using province defense. Use province defense. Spending a single gold on each province is enough to discourage any scout from attacking. At PD 15 (iirc), it will start actively searching for stealth units . At 25-30, it can repel a raiding party. It also lowers your unrest."

You still need to adjust positions if you're combining armies though, right? As some units may have overlapping locations in their current settings.     Pincer/flanking is actually kind of a thing here. Given how blocking and parrying work, an encircled squad is at a disadvantage and more likely to get hit.    How do you achieve this? Whenever I put a slow unit in the middle and fast ones on the side with a simple ""attack"" option they'd all just stream into a big traffic jam in the middle of the fight instead of looping round.     Use province defense   You mean buying local troops or something else? Some plots have almost zero resources so its not always possible to create an army that would even put a dent in say a lategame five commander stack that's on a rampage."

Whenever I put a slow unit in the middle and fast ones on the side with a simple ""attack"" option they'd all just stream into a big traffic jam in the middle of the fight instead of looping round.   Having one of the groups slower doesn't really help you here. Try setting the center to attacking closest and flanks to attacking rearmost.

Try setting the center to attacking closest and flanks to attacking rearmost. They will still deviate from their course and engage if enemies get close enough. Just don't put the flanks too far to the sides.     Ah okay, I've done this a lot but evidently put my fast units out too wide. Is it better to have big blocks of units or smaller clumps?    Completely off topic for a second..... how do you get undead armies to work? I find its hard to put necromancers on the front lines (fragile) but the dead they animate are too slow to contribute much. Are they just better with long range armies instead or are there other techniques? I had limited success with just spending my gems on summoning more disposable undead units that can summon so I can put them up closer.... they still die a lot though :D."
4Xgaming,2jxwbi,Infamously_Unknown,2,Wed Oct 22 17:54:46 2014 UTC,"Would that still help against those horrible late game commander stacks?   No, you need proper armies for that. It's just a militia protecting you from small annoying raids and stealth units. A strong PD can sometimes beat a mid-game AI attack, but that's about it. They also consists of locally recruitable units, so they're stronger in some provinces than in others. The cost of PD is cumulative (upgrading from 0->1 costs 1 gold, but from 29->30 costs 30 gold), so it's about balancing how much you want to spend on it. Just note that at PD 20, they get a second commander. (iirc, dom3 doesn't show you the PD army, so you're buying it a bit blindly)   Is it better to have big blocks of units or smaller clumps?   That depends on a number of things, but unless it's a part of your tactics, bigger squads are generally better. Each squad gets collective morale checks based on their % of losses and wounds, so a big squad will stay and fight longer, while multiple smaller groups would be routing throughout the battle. You just need to find the right balance with your units.  What do you mean by undead armies and necromancer? Like playing Ermor, or just having death mages? Most undead are meant to die, they're just chaff to throw at enemies while you blast them with magic."
4Xgaming,2jxwbi,crazedanimal,1 point,Wed Oct 22 18:48:04 2014 UTC,I played almost exclusively as the Lizard guys. So I'm talking death mages. Found it hard to effectively use the enchantment magic tree in conjunction with their forces. Probably just my bad in terms of strategy.
4Xgaming,2jxwbi,crazedanimal,2,Wed Oct 22 19:04:29 2014 UTC,"Raise Skeletons is useful if you have several mages spamming it, but it won't win you a battle on it's own. You need damage.  I never really played them, but there are a few things you can try. If you play EA or MA, those shamans look like great communion slaves. Get Thaumaturgy 1 and put together 8 shamans and 2-3 death mages who rolled astral on recruitment. Give those mages any equipment that raises death magic and fill their pockets with death gems. On round one, set mages to cast communion master and shamans to cast communion slave. Then make those mages blow enemies into pieces with Shadow Blasts (Evocation 5). Just be careful about your living units, because those blasts will be pretty powerful this way. Better use a screen of undead (they're immune) and make your lizards stay back for a bit (or take just archers to protect those mages and use skeleton spam for melee).  Alternatively, you can use them to rush Alteration 8 and then make them into snipers with Disintegrate. It can target just one creature, but it's lethal, precise and doesn't take much fatigue. Very nice against powerful units.  If you're playing LA C'tis, those Sauromancer also look quite interesting, because they can cast Bane Fire (Evocation 6). That stuff is pretty dangerous though, so again, better don't let any expensive living units anywhere near your targets, because it will make them decay at long range unless they have high magic resistance (lizards do, but buff it anyway if you need them in the fight).  If you want living units safely at the front, you can try supporting your combatants by spamming enemies with Ghost Grip (Conjuration 5). It just stuns, but it affects multiple enemies and your D3 mages should be pretty decent at it.    There's a lot of ways how to use any of the empires in this game, these are just some obvious choices that I noticed when I looked them up. Death also has some cool anti-living enchantments, so try experimenting with them and don't be afraid to use communions, they're your friend.  Also, you might have a use for this.

4Xgaming,2juiz4,DarkSyzygy,5,Tue Oct 21 02:21:11 2014 UTC,"So much this.  My primary complaint about ship design in 4x was that it was pointless. Moo, sots, in the end, it's all about the tech level and min maxing the economy. In most games, the tech growth becomes so fast that effective lifetime of a ship before obsolescence is like, a couple of turns. Takes longer to gather fleets for planet destroying rampages than it does to build them.  In aurora, all this is different. Every player can set things up the way they wish, and can go with all one kind of ship if they want, but for the first time I had a flagship that concentrated the jump drive necessary to move the fleet, scanning ships with extreme point defense lasers to screen incoming missiles, long range missile boats, carriers, antifighter destroyers, and heavily shielded short range brawler ships.  Missiles go fast in conflict, so you need supply ships to carry missile cargo to the front lines, and of course the factories to produce the missiles, and the mines to produce the minerals, and the population to work the factories and the mines, and the cargo capacity to move it around....  In other words, aurora has a lot of depth. Unfortunately, the code is a little old, and the ai and database are not sophisticated enough to present real challenges once you have a well organized fleet."

4Xgaming,2jkfw6,krelian,1 point,Sat Oct 18 07:41:46 2014 UTC,"Something that has recently drawn my interest in the 4x genre that you may like to discuss: Economies/economic victory types. A lot 4x games have some sort of ""get a ton of money to win"" victory-type, and in my experience it always feels forced. Getting a lot of money helps with almost every other aspect of the game, buying military for example, so the economic victory almost ends up being superseded by some other victory type. What are some 4x games that ""get it right"" economically, and perhaps what are some ideas that newer 4x games should explore in this area?  Also: appreciate the regular content that you add to the sub, keep up the good work!"
4Xgaming,2jgjqy,Orcaman4,3,Thu Oct 16 21:58:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah, there is definitely a KoDP vibe with this game - and that's a good thing! King of Dragon Pass in an old favorite of mine."
4Xgaming,2jgjqy,marlowe221,9,Fri Oct 17 17:19:21 2014 UTC,"It definitely seems like he has fixed the mistakes of Civ V, and seeing that he recognizes that Civ V had some serious issues makes me hopeful for this. The game looks very interesting, and I am hoping to see him really get this done."
4Xgaming,2jgjqy,nerga,7,Fri Oct 17 22:07:15 2014 UTC,He wrote a pretty good post about Civ V during the Kickstarter for this game.
4Xgaming,2jgjqy,megazver,3,Fri Oct 17 02:05:48 2014 UTC,"That's kind of a relief. To be honest, I've been just ignoring this project and waiting to see how it turns out to to feeling suspicious about the whole thing.  I really, really like Civ V. But I can't help but feel a little paranoid about the fact that the game got so much better after he (as far as I know) stopped working on it. The expansions that everyone praises up and down and sideways all had (as far as I know) nothing to do with him, while he designed the base game that everyone hated...  In any case, your comment makes me really hopeful. I do want this game to be good!"
4Xgaming,2jgjqy,Sometimes_Lies,3,Fri Oct 17 18:31:59 2014 UTC,It's definitely shaping up. I've been following the game on and off for a while so it's nice to see the game in action with detailed commentary from the creator about what's going on in the game. It also takes place in a historical period that I find interesting.

The clan and other mechanics look thoroughly thought through. I like the idea that researching is simply researching professions (as far as I understand it).  Overall: wow. I knew Jon Shafer won't fail, but I didn't expect his game to be this good. (Judging by the gameplay video alone.)"

4Xgaming,2jezzw,Ophidios,0,Fri Oct 17 13:10:41 2014 UTC,Question to the downvoters: did you see the video? I really like the progress they are making and I don't think the submission deserves a downvote.  edit: Comment downvoted without explanation. Nice.
4Xgaming,2jezzw,Eraser1024,0,Thu Oct 16 14:16:02 2014 UTC,"Seriously?? 3 year user and  you don't know that the downvotes you are seeing are part of the score system reddit uses?? The up/downvotes is NOT the actual number of people clicking upvote/downvote.   A submission's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed"".   Source: http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq"
4Xgaming,2jezzw,filthgrinder,3,Fri Oct 17 16:09:26 2014 UTC,"Value of 'upvotes minus downvotes' is real. They changed it couple of months ago. So if a submission or comment has 5 score, and ten minutes later is has 4 score that means at least one person downvoted it (or someone took away his/her upvote, which I presumed is very rare). edit: Or maybe I didn't get what they had done...  edit: It could be bots. But no one can stop me talking to bots! They can downvote so they should learn how to communicate!"

I really like the overall concept of the game and I think that is impressively done.  I really have to spend some quality time with the wiki though. The tool tips that are in the game are great but there should probably be more of them. But I am definitely enjoying the game.
4Xgaming,2j5ogm,marlowe221,4,Thu Oct 16 15:04:15 2014 UTC,Thanks for dropping by. Maybe you could post something about your game here at /r/4xgaming from time to time?

There's plenty of settings out there that do future feudal lords so it wouldn't even be drastically out of place.  Unfortunately I believe someone over there said recently that they'd considered a sci-fi grand strategy game and decided not to go that route.

4Xgaming,2j58xt,marlowe221,2,Mon Oct 13 19:51:21 2014 UTC,"I suppose it depends on what aspects you find most enjoyable.  I found the combat to be a bit underwhelming and the UI isn't necessarily the most intuitive ever designed. On the positive side, there's a surprising amount of depth to the simulation of your empire. There have also been some recent balance updates which open up your late-game options a bit more so focusing on combat isn't as necessary as before.  I will say that I am happy to see the developers continue free updates to tweak Last Federation even though the expansion is now in beta."
4Xgaming,2j58xt,PapaSmurphy,1 point,Mon Oct 13 21:00:31 2014 UTC,I really enjoyed the combat system. It's a shame that the rest of the game was pretty opaque and boring.

4Xgaming,2iuklo,PfalzDIII,4,Fri Oct 10 12:03:55 2014 UTC,I absolutely hated star ruler 1. What makes star ruler 2 get so much good press? Or is it truly that much better of a game?
4Xgaming,2iuklo,Terkala,5,Fri Oct 10 12:59:09 2014 UTC,"It's only early access so far but they have expanded on a lot and made it into something you could call more of a game than the glorified experiment the first game was.  Diplomacy and the senete is completely unique and very intersting for a space strategy, votes can be manipulated in very unique ways and you can cause chaos politically between players as you keep manipulating votes to swap systems back and forth between two players.  Planet development can and is largely automated on the per planet scale. This is also a very interesting system and pretty damn cool and very reminiscent of Emporer of the Fading Suns. Planets have 4 development levels, every planet starts as level 1 and gives a level 1 resource. You connect enough different level 1 resources to a planet (often your homeworld) and it develops into level 2 and provides a level 2 resource. Enough different level 2 resources and it develops into level 3, yada yada up to level 4 where the planet becomes pretty powerful and where unique and potentially game winning things can be done with it if others don't have their own level 4.   You're essentially having border agricultural worlds provide inner industrial worlds which provide for commercial worlds which all focuses on wherever you chose the heart of the Empire to be. Individual planets potentially matter a lot more now, while level 1 planet trade routes can be replaced with another level 1 somewhere else in your empire, if the enemy takes one of your level 2s, you may be in a little trouble, since it takes time for planets to develop after given the resources to do so. It allows natural choke points to form in an open map game and that is really cool.  Ships are now clustered into ""fleets"" with support ships, which is any other ship, and a, probably giant and with super awesome weapons, flagship in the middle controlling it all, these flagship and support ships being fully customized by you, size and modules, as per Star Ruler fashion.  Ship design is better, you are given a layout and the position of your bridge, guns, armor, power supply, everything, now matters since you take damage in that area. If you put your power supply in the unamored back of the ship and someone flanks you and hits you in the rear, you are dead in the water, no more arbitrary module destruction like in the first game, you can now actually more or less aim your fire, at least via flanking.  FTL now exists and is another interesting mechanic. You are given a global resource which represents your ""FTL energy"" which powers one of various FTL drives, most of which you fit to your one of your flagships, such as a basic hyperdrive, point and go, wormholes, instant travel but 2 way, and gates, travel to any gate in the Empire but have to pay constant maintenance of FTL energy per gate. You also have ""flinging"" which you set up a station, a ""fling beacon"", and use it to ""fling"" ships anywhere you want very efficiently, though highly inaccurate at distance if you don't have a ""fling beacon"" on the other side. STL will still be the main form of travel, but it adds a nice layer to the military strategy.  Overall I think they will end up delivering a very good product, and something that could very well etch it's own place in 4X history."

Whats worse is that after abandoning the buggy, incomplete mess then a new game was announced!  Stardrive 2.  Considering how badly the first one went, I don't have high hopes for the second one. Avoid it. Do not do early access or pre-orders. Maybe Stardrive 2 will be brilliant, but considering the state Stardrive 1 was in when it was abandoned, this is something you should adopt a wait and see stance on."
4Xgaming,2iuklo,mtmdog,1 point,Fri Oct 10 17:40:29 2014 UTC,I'm going to buy the second one because I really loved Star Drive one right up until the point it becomes obvious how incomplete it was. The ship customisation and the combat are way more fun than most 4x games which usually suffer in the combat area.
4Xgaming,2iuklo,Hyndis,2,Fri Oct 10 23:05:13 2014 UTC,Thats what made it such a shame. You could see the brilliant game design hidden away under a mountain of bugs and incomplete features. It had so much potential.  The game being abandoned in such a state makes me very wary of buying anything by the same group. I'm going to wait for user reviews of the finished product first.

4Xgaming,2iuklo,CFGX,1 point,Sat Oct 11 23:39:58 2014 UTC,"Ehhhh, it's real-time, so there's that. There are some aesthetic similarities as well. But it's a much larger setting (multiple star systems instead of one map). It also doesn't have the Z-axis freedom that Homeworld does."
4Xgaming,2iuklo,yorii,1 point,Sun Oct 12 10:47:29 2014 UTC,"While on the subject of real-time, how about Distant Worlds? While not really super similar, it does allow you to individually control ships, not that you might really want to though.."

4Xgaming,2iuklo,Terkala,3,Sat Oct 11 00:33:20 2014 UTC,"There are earlier games that are in the same vein. I am a huge fan of ""Conquest: Frontier Wars"", as it is basically the game that started the subgenre that is space-RTS games. It holds up pretty well even by today's standards of graphics and gameplay, so I highly suggest checking it out.  There is also ""AI War"", which is another realtime 4x game. It's unique in that the AI is not playing the same game you are. The game is about an AI that has already won, it has taken over the entire galaxy. You play as the last human survivors, and your actions cause the AI to respond in proportion to how much you damage the AI. So it's an interesting mix of trying to be aggressive, and trying to not be so aggressive that you trigger a large enough response that the AI kills you."

4Xgaming,2iualt,_tpyo,1 point,Sat Oct 11 19:38:02 2014 UTC,Play Heroes 3.  It stands up better than 2 does these days.  Play a Single Scenario on a Large map on Easy mode to learn the game.  It is still played all over the world.
4Xgaming,2iualt,Karma_Gardener,2,Tue Oct 14 02:58:56 2014 UTC,Heroes III is the classic. It's worth adding that there is a high-res mod for it somewhere which really helps. I personally thought Six wasn't actually that terrible and its campaign is pretty fucking epic (heroes four and five were both very poor though) and Kings Bounty: Armoured Princess was an interesting take on the genre (although it lacks the replayabilty of classic).
4Xgaming,2iualt,_tpyo,2,Wed Oct 22 00:07:22 2014 UTC,"Id have to agree that Six was way better than IV or V but still didn't touch the hundreds of hours I've gotten from III both vanilla and WoG mod.

I genuinely squealed with excitement when I realised in later heroes champions started to do muliples of damage depending on the distance they'd moved prior to the hit..... OH AND in SIX (sorry to bang on about six) they have a ghost ability so they can join in the fun on a tower siege. BROKEN AS FUCK. I personally think the coolest faction was the dungeon faction though. It's trope-ish but it managed to really avoid being cliched.    OH WAIT YOU ARE TALKING FACTIONS! Well definitely swamp to win it because Wyverns are fucking stupid so early on. You can clear camps you shouldn't be able to hyper quick and dragon flies are annoying, you can always steal someone else's units later on ;). Not demons, I never really liked demons with their flashy flaming things. Not tower because that golum animation is a thing of slow drawn out nightmares of neverending fights (bish, bash, bish, bash). Maybe Dungeon.... maybe Necro cause I always liked vampires (resurrection is OP), probably outpost though as I just love attack damage. CAN YOU SAY MASS HASTE AND ROCS?"

I've gone entire maps without losing hardly a single troop other than Gremlins until the final battle.  Tower with the Hero Solymnr(?sp) is basically cheating.  He starts with Chain Lighting."

4Xgaming,2iualt,darkcobra1990,3,Wed Oct 22 01:48:05 2014 UTC,Warlock 2 would be my guess. Just play sandbox mode.  You have 1 Unit per Tile Combat and not Armies that are not too big. City development is straightforward. The only problem is that it is more of a Strategy Game then RPG. There are Heroes but they are just stronger Units really.  AoW3 would be my bet for the best on the market atm. Good all around but definetly  a bit more complicated. Imho it is however reasonably easy to get into.  I would recommend watching a few episodes of lets plays of these games to give you a feel for them.
4Xgaming,2iualt,archivis,1 point,Fri Oct 10 10:17:16 2014 UTC,I have Warlock 1. Its cool but it lacks RPG part. Its basically Civ skin. I might give AOW3 a try
4Xgaming,2iualt,Ed-Zero,1 point,Fri Oct 10 11:25:02 2014 UTC,"I second AoW3. While the game is not the simplest 4X, I love the RPG elements, especially all the loot that has been added to the game with the DLC. Seeing some of those Mythical items appear in RNG maps is so worth it.  In regards to the RPG elements, you have your main leader who can level up and fight, and you can get secondary heroes that can also level up and fight. You can raise them to either be leaders, spellcasters or warriors based on what they get when they level up. There is no skill trees, so you can mix and match the skills as you want. If a hero dies, you can research a spell to resurrect them. If your leader dies, you have to wait three turns to respawn.  As a bonus, you can also forge your own items."
4Xgaming,2iualt,_tpyo,1 point,Fri Oct 10 16:36:35 2014 UTC,"Well it's not current nor really a 4x, but it's a nes rpg called Destiny of an Emperor where in the various battles your party characters (who are a pile of generals/commanders) fight other competing generals, with their hit points representing troops.  It's fun and fairly simple, though probably not in the slightest what you're looking after.  I've bought a couple fantasy 4xs in the past couple years but they aren't really simple, sorry."

4Xgaming,2irrjs,Mantees,3,Fri Oct 10 12:26:55 2014 UTC,"Hi everyone,  It has now been 3 weeks since we officially released Endless Legend. Thanks again for your involvement, warm words, constructive criticism to help us make this game a success. It has been a challenging adventure, and the release has allowed us to catch our breath and lick our wounds for a few days. We have not been idle, though, and have continued tracking the technical issue to allow you all to play the game in good conditions.  But as we stated in the past, release was just a stage in the life cycle of the game, so it is time to speak of the future.  First of all, a new patch is imminent, which will incorporate fixes on the gameplay, AI, typos, more of a collection of small items than a big change. But I am confident the release note will be impressive as usual.  Next, the first step for modding will be released. The system is here, along with the UI to select/activate a mod, and it allows to override the full simulation, AI, and GUI bitmaps to create new city improvements, new factions and traits, overhaul the tech tree with new icons, and tune the AI. What we want to achieve before we release it is a set of examples to guide you in the process of creating mods. You can expect to get this first version of modding in a matter of weeks, as soon as our modding instructions and samples are ready. Depending on the success of modding, we will extend it to incorporating new 3D models and textures.  After that we are going to work on free add-ons and expansions, much like what we did for Endless Space.  The focus right now is on a free add-on which we want to release before the end of this year. In order to be efficient, we have restarted our agile process with 2-weeks sprints, meaning that it will be difficult to deliver intermediate versions of the add-on before it is all done and reviewed by the VIP and our QA. Also we want to make a consistent package for each add-on (as we did on Endless Space) rather than a series of smaller updates.  Here is a list of the subjects we will process during the development of the coming add-ons. It is possible that not everything will fit in it, and that we will have several add-ons.  -Some cool stuff involving weapon visuals (I cannot say more)  -Advanced world generation options, as well as fixing the remaining generation issues on the exotic operating systems  -New outgame view (the 3d scene behind the menus)  -New side quests  -A new minor faction  -Advanced notifications (idle cities, unassigned heroes, end of pillars, etc.)  -Loading tips to clarify some deep game mechanics which cannot be explained in the tutorial  -Market improvement  -Battle UI improvement  -AI War management: attack (more parallel attacks, opportunistic interceptions)  -AI War management: defence (more units in garrison, regrouping of armies inside cities, better frontier defence)  -AI War management: threat evaluation and region scoring (threat of rising players, minor factions, mission interruption)  -AI Empire Plan Management: avoid hurting the economy to achieve higher tiers at all costs  -AI Resource Management: tweaks and tuning, better use of luxury boosters  -AI Overall Balancing: tech priorities, improve militia  -And more AI improvements on Battle, Unit Design, and Economy  Thanks for your attention, AmpliMath"

That said if Dawn of War 3 comes out, it'll be the first game in years that I immediately pre-order."
4Xgaming,2irnop,kanmax92,4,Thu Oct 9 18:58:57 2014 UTC,"I think the ""eXplore"" part of the 4x setting might cause some problems for a 40k game...I mean, the galaxy is already inhabited from end to end and the Imperium, Tyranids, etc. have their tech (indeed, technological stagnation is part of 40k's lore). I'm not sure how they'd translate part of the fun of a 4x game--encountering new and unknown races, doing research, etc.--into that sort of setting. Maybe if GW introduced new, never encountered before races and a new system of technological development/research, but that would require some hefty changes to the existing lore."
4Xgaming,2irnop,Gunlord500,5,Thu Oct 9 19:06:27 2014 UTC,"Well, yeah there will be no conventional exploration and conventional finding of new species(although the imperium does not know where orks or tyranids or chaos are at all times or where they will strike next).  There will be no exploration and politics and tech in the standard 4X mold but you can replace it with other unique things that fit the universe. It would be more centered around space battles and ground battles on planets and star systems and each faction can have a campaign with its own goals."
4Xgaming,2irnop,Gunlord500,4,Thu Oct 9 20:39:58 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'd really like to see space battles, actually. I was talking with some friends of mine about how we really miss Battlefleet Gothic ;_;"
4Xgaming,2irnop,baconrising,3,Thu Oct 9 21:12:08 2014 UTC,"Woah, the universe is huge.  I don't know if it's still canon, but the 40k started out as ""Rogue Trader"" basically about independent explorers looking for cool stuff in the many frontiers.  You could be a rogue trader, discover a new solar system or planet, all of which could in theory contain a ""lost"" human colony, a chaos cult, an ork or 'Nid infestation brewing in a jungle, a locked necron tomb, or maybe a passing eldar fleet or dark eldar raid.  Research could just unlock the bigger, badder parts of your army list.  The heavily armed plasma spewing tank variants, badass elite units, and eventually the super-tanks and titans."
4Xgaming,2irnop,radioactive_seagull,3,Fri Oct 10 04:33:43 2014 UTC,Perfect excuse to release a new edition with new codexes. It's not like they haven't done it before.

4Xgaming,2irnop,thiosk,1 point,Fri Oct 10 20:59:03 2014 UTC,"Looking at the recently presented Imperia shows a lot of opportunity for a different kind of 4x game. I've been sick and tired of the samey same ""6 empires in a box, race to claim the most planets"" routine.   Consider the possibility where instead of running an empire, you're in charge of a space marine chapter. You have to handle recruitment, choose which calls for help to respond to, explore various planets for relics, all the while combatting the spread of heresy and stamping out the alien as you find it.  Cleverly implemented, you'd have a lot of legs there, without ever needing to send a single colony ship."
4Xgaming,2irnop,Gunlord500,1 point,Wed Oct 15 03:51:39 2014 UTC,That sounds like a really cool idea. Especially if you could create your own chapter instead of using a premade one like the Blood Ravens.

4Xgaming,2irnop,Terkala,10,Thu Oct 9 16:16:21 2014 UTC,"Because they probably had another price adjustment recently, or released a codex he didn't like, or any of a myriad of other stupid reasons. GW haters have been saying the ""bankrupt in a few years"" thing since at least somewhere in the 1990s, and so far it has proven just as accurate as all those times the end of the world has been predicted.  From what I can see, the company is doing just fine and not going anywhere. New model releases are still coming at frequent and regular intervals, their Forgeworld spinoff is more successful each year, book releases have been steadily rising for the past several years thanks to the new 30k universe and they have several licensed videogames under development. That's not the signs of a failing business."

In some cases they're actually made with superior modeling materials (finecast = finecrap) and end up being more durable than the real product.  That being said, they're absolutely hurting GW's sales and doing so in an extremely unethical way.  As a secondary point, I believe this may be the first time that ""Games Workshop"" and ""unethical"" have both been used in the same sentence and had it not actually refer to GW themselves being unethical."

4Xgaming,2irnop,Nemo84,1 point,Thu Oct 9 19:02:55 2014 UTC,"Meh, widespread consumer 3D printers are still at least several years off, and the quality of the printed Warhammer models I've seen so far has been atrocious.  If you want cheap low-quality models to simply play a game of Warhammer there's already plenty of choice out there, and there's even a Vassal module for free. GW models are very expensive, but they are also a lot more detailed than their competitors. Quality costs money, and such quality is still far from achievable on consumer printers."

Particularly in SOTS 1 you had to research a technology in order to unlock some UI functionality in combat or movement abilities on the map... Generally I feel people either didn't notice or disliked it outright, a few appreciated the increased immersion through mechanics.  SOTS 2 had a pretty deep government mechanic that would shift you to one of nine government types based on your actions.  It was a clever system, but fairly invisible too.  I think the reason a lot of games don't attempt to go as deep as SOTS 1&2 for these mechanics is because its a nightmare to balance or program competent AI from a developer point of view.  Hence why tons of games have simplified mechanics."

It's more of a difficulty curve and risk-reward feature: there are difficult to handle features that offer big returns done correctly, but may also fail catastrophically if you don't. Especially if the game is versus AI of a big difficulty (handicap) slider, it's going to be amazing if the risky and weird moves are massively better than just auto piloting it.  A liberal government offers massive productivity but simple mistakes can direct most of that productivity to irrelevant things. Say, whether the people follow your orders depends on empire stability, so if the situation destabilises beyond your control the empire goes tumbling down quickly, requiring radical reforms like government changes and secession of outlying colonies.  Close control over units offers massive effectiveness advantages, but mismanagement can put them in risks that the autonomous program wouldn't. Say, you can try outmanoeuvre enemy crafts but in doing so you can expose weak points normal manoeuvres don't. Or you can try input manual trajectories to send your colony ships to systems not within normal, safe reach, at the risk of losing those ships to a flawed trajectory."
4Xgaming,2im6ug,hylje,1 point,Wed Oct 8 08:56:05 2014 UTC,"Perhaps balance wasn't the best word.  I was focused more on development and design time.  The costs of making these features can be high, while the end user experience from these features can be minimal.  So it literally isn't worth the devs time when some thing a third as complex and expensive will net the same number of sales if not more.  Also streamlined mechanics also lower the barrier of entry to players."

4Xgaming,2im6ug,druebey,1 point,Sat Jan 10 15:32:51 2015 UTC,"I never played SotS1, but SotS2 was, in my view, a brilliant game hidden by a horribly clunky UI. Doing anything in SotS2 required far too many clicks. Nothing was easy to do in SotS2 due to how many different screens you had to click through.  The other problem was battle AI and battle deployment. Ships would often times deploy in the wrong areas meaning you could not intercept a fleet before all of you starbases (which each required countless amounts of tedious clicking to build) were blown to bits. Ships would also often times forget what they were doing and just sit there passively.  Endless Space had a wonderful UI. Very slick, very efficient, and very easy to do whatever you wanted to do. The problem with Endless Space is that the combat was extremely simple. It was just a game of rock-paper-scissors, which is boring.   SotS2 had far more interesting combat. Weapons were good or bad at different things not because one is rock and the other is scissors, but rather, they were good or bad at different things because of the weapon's characteristics. As an example of this, heavy railguns were extremely hard hitting, but their low rate of fire and poor accuracy meant that they were useless against small or agile ships. Meanwhile light weapons were excellent at shooting down small and agile things, but just lacked the hitting power for taking out capital ships. This doesn't mean you couldn't try to shoot down fighters with heavy rail guns, or take out capital ships with a light laser gun. Its just not ideal."

There was this game called Civilization where if you were a Republic it was hard to declare war and as a Democracy it was impossible.[1]  Later versions of the game removed that mechanic because peeps didn't like it.  Another game, MOO3, was designed around the concept of limited ""Imperial actions"" per turn.  The whole system was ripped out and replaced - AFAIK, the debate over how much this hurt or improved [2] the game was never resolved.  KoDP also had something like this: certain ring members came with risks - Eurmali opened up great and fun options, but also caused no end of trouble.  Other ring members might be racist [3] but talented, or vital for some purpose or the other but suspected of being cultists.  In other words, this is a known approach, but hard to implement successfully.  [1]  Was Sid hopelessly idealistic?  Is modern western gov't not a really democracy?  Maybe both.  [2]  There is also some debate about the simple possibility of a game being worse than the released version of MOO3, but it's basically bitter hyperbole.

I think from your post, I'd recommend that first as I feel the Endless Legend combat isn't nearly as interesting.

4Xgaming,2ikhja,Terkala,11,Tue Oct 7 16:08:44 2014 UTC,"I'd disagree. They both have a quite obviously different focus, neither of which is inherently superior. Endless Legend focuses on empire building, AoW focuses on inter-empire warfare. Endless Legends is basically just about building cities, doing quests and vying with other empires, while AoW is about questing heroes, casting magic spells and exploring the world.  And while Endless Legend has a lot of potential, it still has quite a long way to go. Unit variety is piss-poor, combat is so shallow it could just as well be absent and the AI is braindead.  Basically, Endless legends is like Civ in that you build an empire with combat as an afterthought. While AoW is like Total War in that the empire building primarily serves as a system to generate interesting battles. Personally I vastly prefer AoW, because of its deep varied combat system and because its AI can be quite devious compared to the lackluster performance of the Endless Legend AI which struggles to defend its own cities."
4Xgaming,2ikhja,Nemo84,-4,Tue Oct 7 16:32:44 2014 UTC,Agreed. As well as AoW said there would be no dlc and there was/is.

If you want to focus on building/empire development, then of those two games Endless Legend is probably the one for you.   If you are more focused on exploration and combat, then I would say Age of Wonders 3 is probably the best modern 4X game on the market for those aspects of 4X gaming right now. Personally, I think there is a lot of variety in the Age of Wonders 3 combat system.  Have you tried or looked into Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes? To my mind it has a lot of the pluses of BOTH Endless Legend and Age of Wonders 3 though, of course, it is not a perfect 4X game either."

4Xgaming,2ihduh,thetimelyspoon,25,Mon Oct 6 23:17:29 2014 UTC,"Well, first of all, I fundamentally disagree with you on the last point. The winter/summer paradigm is one of the most articulate forms of mechanics as metaphor I've seen in a long time. Saying that story and gameplay are two wholly separate sections of one product limits the possibilities for games on the whole. Plus, I think it actually works pretty well mechanically. Marching on the opponent's capital during the thick of winter while their supply line is crushed and their armies are halfway round the planet was a particular high moment for me.  You do have some solid points against the game, however. The manual combat system is a nightmare. It needs to be patched yesterday. And while I do appreciate that influence spices up the diplomatic game more than the standard fare I've run through, you're absolutely right: it's most useful as a proxy for other resources.   But I think that despite some flaws, the game is fresh and vivid in a sea of fairly samey releases. The factions all play completely differently, the territory nabbing system and Burroughs building is something I have been waiting for forever, and the writing is excellent.   It's definitely not perfect. Especially the combat. But dammit, I love the game to death."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,thetimelyspoon,3,Mon Oct 6 20:44:52 2014 UTC,"I didn't mean that story and gameplay should be entirely separated, just that game mechanics shouldn't be implemented just for the sake of story.  The faction descriptions and opening narrations in ES and EL, as well as each faction's default traits, are examples of what I consider story done well.  The invasion scenario you described exactly the sort of thing that I imagined when I first read about the mechanic.  The random timing just makes it less reliable as a premeditated plan, and winter becomes more of a reactionary matter if you happen to be positioned to take advantage of it when it hits.  The territory/burrough systems are definitely welcome novelties, though I'm not convinced they're very well-implemented.  The maps feel smaller relative to how far armies can move (even infantry can hit 7+ move w/ the right trinket) and cities are mostly defenseless, so factions live or die by their standing army strength.  In a single turn, an army can easily move through friendly roads, then across a few tiles of enemy territory to attack the nearest burrough, crush the militia, and take the city."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,FiveDogNight,11,Mon Oct 6 21:37:31 2014 UTC,"I guess we have differing views on the ludo-narratology front (it's a real term, I promise! I can smart!), because to me those are all the parts of the story that are disconnected from the gameplay :P definitely not a bad thing though, games have been using that method of conveyance since the very beginning and it's still working to this day.  And I think we might also have a fundamental difference of opinion when it comes to the inherent randomness in games like these. I understand the frustration of not being able to control all those disparate elements, but I like being at the mercy of Auriga. Makes me feel less like a player and more like an inhabitant of the game space. Again, it's a case of story and mechanics interlacing, so YMMV, and quite wildly. I totally understand how that could be off-putting, and lead to less than fun scenarios. But in terms of game feel, it's rock solid. Winter is desperate, unpredictable, and occasionally crushing.  Also, I think that playing on a larger world size might allay some of those concerns. Army speed doesn't scale, so those long cross-continental treks can and will range from Hannibal to Bolivar in length. Plus, if you've got any sort of defense program in your cities, any modestly upgraded unit can withstand a siege with the fortification bonus. Personally, I think that the grand strategy of war in Endless Legend is the perfect reconciling of Civs IV and V.   TL;DR: Maybe ya just didn't like the game. And I can respect that. But if you're willing to, give it another chance. Preferably after combat doesn't require RNG to be functional."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,marlowe221,12,Mon Oct 6 22:00:51 2014 UTC,"I think 4x games is just a genre that people really love different things within said genre.  So saying ""your mileage may vary"" is perhaps the most accurate for 4x games...even more so than other genres.  I know tons of games that score well, but I don't find engaging at all and vice versa.    So really don't trust reviews, most 4x games require at least a few playthroughs, yet many reviewers play just enough to write their review and get paid."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,wOlfLisK,5,Mon Oct 6 21:30:22 2014 UTC,"Absolutely. And well said.  I like turn based tactical combat, so I really like games like Master of Orion 2 and Age of Wonders 3.

4Xgaming,2ihduh,marlowe221,6,Mon Oct 6 22:06:27 2014 UTC,I'm that other guy. I play 4Xs mainly for the expand part. I love building empires or cities and growing them from a tiny 1 pop village to a massive 20 pop one. It's why one of the few genres I like more than 4X is city building or GSG games. I'm not a fan of the tactical combat in AoW3. I love the game but personally I would find it more fun if the combat was more like Civ's where simply the strongest army wins. EL works fine for me because the combat is a lot simpler and the auto fight mode actually works.
4Xgaming,2ihduh,Ed-Zero,6,Tue Oct 7 01:32:11 2014 UTC,"Oddly enough, even though I like full tactical combat, I actually like very simple combat models too. For instance I happen to enjoy the Civ5/Warlock combat (even though most people seem to hate it). I also have an appreciation for Civ 2-style combat.  My problem with Endless Legend is that it seems to be trying to be somewhere in between AoW3 and Civ2 - and to me it doesn't do a great job of it.  It's funny though, I sound like a major war monger in this thread but I actually tend to play 4X games relatively peacefully. It's just that when there IS combat, I want to be in control of it."

Basically in both Civ 5 and the Warlock series your units have attack and defense ratings and maybe a special move or two. The tile/terrain the attacker and defender are standing on usually matter quite a bit in this combat system. But there are no ""tactical"" battles like in Age of Wonders 3 - the combat takes place on the strategic map. Otherwise it's very math-based; the main ""tactics"" are to make sure you are attacking the right unit with the right unit and to take terrain modifiers into account.  It seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it system in the 4X community (it certainly is in the Civ community). Personally, I happen to like it just fine but, as always, YMMV."

4Xgaming,2ihduh,Hyndis,6,Thu Oct 9 04:19:53 2014 UTC,"I will just write here instead of hitting reply on everyone's comment.  Combat - It's annoying to me that I don't have more control over the combat. Then again, I admit and acknowledge that I really like tactical combat in 4X games. I know that Galactic Civilizations 2  is a great game but I just can't play it - I want to control my ships in battle! For those not as focused on that aspect it may not matter as much.   Winter - I think the concept of Winter is pretty cool but, if anything, Winter just isn't harsh enough. The real problem is that Winter doesn't really stop me from doing anything and doesn't make me do much of anything terribly different - it just makes me do the same stuff, but slower. I think I would actually like the Summer/Winter mechanic more if there were greater differences between the two seasons.  Influence - I like the idea of my ability to influence other cultures being measurable in some way. It's cool that there are ways that I can make myself more influential. But as a proxy resource (which it is) for other resources, I find it to be somewhat pointless.  Bottom Line - I agree with FiveDogNight that when it comes to 4X games, you have to find the ones that emphasize the aspects of the genre that you like. Endless Legend has a lot going for it in all honesty. But there is no guarantee that its points of emphasis will match up with the preferences of any individual player."

I know that Galactic Civilizations 2 is a great game but I just can't play it - I want to control my ships in battle! For those not as focused on that aspect it may not matter as much.    Oddly enough, I'm of the opposite viewpoint. I like to give top down orders. I want indirect, hands-off control. But at the same time, this means the units carrying out the high level order must be smart enough to carry them out in a meaningful manner.  This means that if I'm playing the role of sovereign of a nation, I want to give orders to my armies, but then let the generals of these armies handle the details themselves. This only works if I have Pattons and Rommels. Things just get really bad if all of my AI leaders have the tactical acumen of George Pickett.  Give me hands off control, but also give me smart units. Don't give me Starcraft style dumb units. And don't give me a suicidally aggressive AI either. Give me a smart AI. Don't give me direct control, but let me give this smart AI high level orders.  I liked the hands off space battles in Endless Space (even though the ""AI"" was just a RNG). I could give general orders and then the ships would do the rest. I only wish that I could have given more detailed orders, such as if a ship is <50% health, do X, else do Y. Something along those lines. What I disliked about Endless Space was that it was rock paper scissors, which is entirely uninteresting so far as I'm concerned. But the hands off thing was interesting at least."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,Hyndis,2,Tue Oct 7 01:51:38 2014 UTC,I wouldn't be opposed to the combat model that you describe... if it actually existed. I cannot recall ever playing a 4X game that had a tactical AI that would be capable of doing that.
4Xgaming,2ihduh,Eschatos,2,Tue Oct 7 05:13:37 2014 UTC,"Kohan 2 is an RTS that came the closest. It was an overlooked RTS, but in my opinion it was a great RTS. Gameplay was very much like Age of Empires II except that it had a fantasy flavor to it. It had wonderful random map skirmishes where you could set up almost any kind of map, teams, and opponents you wanted.  In Kohan 2, you didn't build individual units. You built armies. You could even design these armies by selecting what units would make them up. You had 0 tactical control. All control was at the strategic and logistics level. You had to be able to afford your armies. All you did was march your army to its destination, and then once engaged your general would take over.  All units in your armies would then do things on their own, depending on what kind of unit it was. Melee units would close to melee. Pikemen would try to skewer cavalry units. Archers would hang back, mages would set things on fire with fireballs, and priests would heal. Regardless of how badly your army was mauled so long as there was at least 1 survivor in your army, and your army was within friendly territory, it would resupply and reinforce until it was back to 100% strength. Depending on how badly it got mauled this could take quite a while, but it would happen automatically. Just withdraw back to a friendly city or fortress for it to recover.  Its on Steam, but the game is a bit old these days: http://store.steampowered.com/app/97130/  It plays very much like Age of Empires II with that strategic/logistics level focus. I highly recommend it, but I don't know how well it has aged. Compared to today's RTS games it might be overly simplistic."

4Xgaming,2ihduh,wOlfLisK,3,Mon Oct 6 22:18:20 2014 UTC,"Hello, you're very much like me on this. You ever play as cultist? :D Gotta love the numbskull that designed the preacher unit. Completely and utterly useless, all it does is slow (range 3 so you'll still likely get hit/killed) or buff everything by 15% at the start of the game (so like 3.5 more damage WHOA THERE LET ME HOLD MY HAT LEST IT FALL OFF MY HEAD IN EXCITEMENT). What's fucking hilarious is someone was trolling as the penultimate quest for the cultists is to have two level 5 preacher units :D (you can research and build training buildings to get around this).  I just research market and sell them asap and then buy in some proper units to do the first village, especially if its a tough one that my hero can't solo.  IMO great game, fucking shit game design, so many glaring design issues that just don't make sense. Really sad about it tbh as the fluff was very cool. Oh and winter is totally the opposite of Sid Meirer's ""find the fun"" maxim. Find the ""unfun"" morelike."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,marlowe221,2,Wed Oct 22 05:06:25 2014 UTC,"Combat: Ok, I agree with you there, combat is a bit bad. Personally, I prefer the civ style combat to tactical stuff anyway.    Influence: I disagree, I think influence is a great idea. It makes you think about how you're going to play the game. You can go alliance heavy, sure, but that locks you out of the empire plans. But if you go with the empire plans, you won't have enough to declare war on everyone. It makes you plan ahead. And I think the barrier to diplomacy is fine. Everyone starts out in a cold war. To attack them in their territory or to declare peace requires influence points. But doing nothing still keeps you safe. It gives you some time to actually start building up before the Montezuma wannabe attacks you.   Winters: Winters are so annoying yet so awesome. It forces you to actually pay attention to your cities. In civ it's just set the new pop to a Hex every time the city grows and get the worker to make improvements. But in EL you have to prioritise what you want. Are you willing to take a -30 dust per turn hit to finish the unit within 3 turns? What about to get that extra 30 influence needed for that crucial empire plan tier? It's a great mechanic."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,Beanchilla,2,Tue Oct 7 01:23:59 2014 UTC,"I have probably been a little harsh in this thread. I should say that, overall, I do like the game quite a bit and I agree with those that say that this game is a probably (and hopefully) just a few patches away from greatness.  Really, my biggest problem with the game as a whole is that it is a bit opaque and it is often difficult to tell how things work, and thus can be frustrating to try to make some of the decisions the player must make intelligently."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,runetrantor,1 point,Wed Oct 8 16:49:43 2014 UTC,"I agree with every point except Winter. I think Winter does make things quite a challenge and while it can be infuriating at times, if you plan what kind of moves you want to make when that season hits it works.  That said, I have reviewed this game negatively as well. Not only is influence just another form of currency that you can pump out with citizens, the combat is just completely messed up.  I also hate the fact that expanding lowers morale! What kind of mechanic is that? It makes expanding less appealing.  I like the visual design and the varied races but other than that there isn't much to get me excited about this game. The tech tree isn't very exciting, the combat isn't very exciting, the AI isn't particularly great... It's pretty average other than visually, which I'll admit is fantastic.  I only hope that Amplitude builds on this and makes something more enjoyable to play. Maybe this will draw more people into the 4X genre as well and that's always good."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,megazver,1 point,Thu Oct 9 00:39:50 2014 UTC,"I dont complain about the battle system because, at least to me, was miles ahead of Endless Space's RNG card game, so I saw it as an improvement. How it used the area around you and allow reinforcements from nearby was very cool and unique imo too. Could it have been better? Of course, but I found it had some cool stuff going for it.  Winter was fun, albeit stressful, you had to be careful what you were doing or you could end up like everyone that invades Russia, and then BAM winter came. Movement goes to hell, your cities produce less of everything, and if your economy was not that great, you could run a deficit during it, and I did once purchased a lot of stuff for my heroes and hired a lot more (One per city), so then winter came, with my coffers having like 100 dust and having a gdp of -30.  I do admit I expected winters to be more meaningful, like monsters grew stronger then, or maybe have random disasters occur during it, forcing you to stay on the defensive during it because a snowstorm could hit your capital, or a volcano erupt near your port town. All signs of Auriga's death throes.  I do agree in the lack of plot, I saw the picture for each tech era, and when I reached the last one, with the picture of an apocaylptic hurricane raging on towards a city, I did expect bad things to happen. Like, as each era is reached, new disasters striked Auriga, showing how the end was drawing closer and closer and that the race for victory became much more desperate. Maybe have the last era lock you into winter, making you consider if you should stick around the previous eras to prepare, or rush headlong and suffer because your cities could not handle the eternal last winter."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,krelian,2,Tue Oct 14 05:59:38 2014 UTC,"You've basically right.   Combat.   The studio's design lead has a hard-on for not having direct control of units in combat. If you don't like this combat system, don't buy Endless Space. Personally, I think he should just license the Majesty IP from Paradox and get it out of the system.  If I was a cynical man (which, of course I am not. Of course.) I'd say that the reason you can't control your units is that them being controlled by the dumb AI somewhat mitigates the dumbness of the enemy AI.   Influence.   I dunno. It's a perfectly functional system. I'm not in love with it, but I have nothing against it either.    Winter.   The winter is bullshit, yes. It's very pretty - they drew a whole new set of terrain assets just for that! -  but the only thing it does is make things less fun for ten turns or so. There are no real choices or changes of tactics that it forces upon you, you just waste time. The FPS version of this would be a mode where everyone would randomly get five times slower and did five times less damage every few minutes or so.    Why do people like it?   It has a lot of neat ideas and it's not so broken that they couldn't fix it into what's basically a pretty decent 4X. It's not fucking Elemental. Improve the AI somewhat, find some other solution for city sieges, balance the fucking factions properly, fix a bunch of small annoying shit here and there."

It doesn't even try to be tactical, which is actually fine because the strategy is mostly in ship design, and a little in the battle card countering system.  Actual combat is just throwing two fleets together and letting numbers resolve in a very predictable way.  I'm just irked by EL because it gives us this tactical battle interface, full of possibilities, then just goes ""nope, just kidding, you're still gimped by the AI here."""

My theory is that there is no feedback on what's happening in battles because it doesn't really work as advertised but without showing you any numbers they don't have to take complaints about bugs. On a more serious note he whole no-numbers thing in combat is really perplexing because almost everything else has detailed tooltips."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,stilig,2,Tue Oct 7 01:58:15 2014 UTC,"The main problem with ES combat is that I seem to do just as well choosing my battle cards at random with my eyes closed as I do when I choose them according to some plan or other.  So the combat boils down to: 1) Design the best ship you can, and then 2) Try to guess what number the AI is thinking of and counter it.  The other problem with warfare in ES was that it got really, really old fighting over the same system 15 times in a row..."
4Xgaming,2ihduh,Crapzor,1 point,Tue Oct 7 05:09:49 2014 UTC,"I agree with sectoidfodder's comments. ES combat works (for me) because it's not pretending to be anything else. It's saying 'Hey, this game is already pretty long, and there's a metric shitton of combat fights in this game. If these are anything longer than 10 seconds, the turns are going to be interminably long for anyone not in the current war.' Most of the interesting decisionmaking around combat is around which ship designs to produce and maneuver. The battle cards give a glimmer of gameplay in the fight, but if you want engaging tactical combat, ES is just definitively -not your game-. It is strategic on almost every level rather than tactical.  EL, however, does not portray itself in this simplicity. If it was literally 'throw units together, calculations are performed, and one side emerges victorious', a la Civ, I would like it better. I'm not saying it's the best possible combat system (here's hoping Amplitude reworks it), but it would -work-."

There are some mechanics that dont seem to have panned out and were transmuted into less integregral or impactful  but at least functional game elements. Stockpiles, influence, districts, and population are there and they do something but none of it is very interesting. I guess there could have been something with requiring food stockpiles to survive winters, more interesting and diverse thing to do in diplomacy using influence, something more robust than what there is in terms of empire plan.

You'll take weeks to get from 48 (first start) to modern day though - speed 5 quickly runs like speed 1 especially after around year 2000. But it runs surprisingly stable for an EU4 mod, the observer mode stream a while back ran 2 or 3 weeks virtually without interruption. It obviously gets crazy though especially with a skilled player - if you actually want to play that long you might want to impose some rules on yourself or just do stuff you wouldn't normally do in EU4 - it wont keep you entertained on itself forever. In the end, I feel like the obersver mode streaming may be the best application of that mod. But it can be some fun for a while as player too.  The thing is how would you do ""history-spanning 4X"" without being a Civ clone?

I wish someone would take Civ and GalCiv and make a midpoint game, like BE, you start in a techy level, you land on a planet and expand, just like Civ, but if you zoom out, the world you are in turns into a sphere, a planet around a star in a solar system with other worlds, where some of your enemies landed on. You have to colonize your world and fight for those that were empty, eventually staging orbital invasions to start taking over your enemies.  Essentially, do to Civ what Planetary Annihilation did to Supreme Commander.  As an aside, I wonder how Firaxis would take the competition, Stardock and Firaxis are close, and pretty friendly with each other, I think a Civ dev even gave Stardock tips for Elemental.

Remaking Elemental games on current engine is not really worth it. Sorcerer King should be the last one. But if they'll use Nitrous engine for WoM2 believe me - it will be distinguished from other Elemental 4Xs. This engine means tons of types of models and tons of models simultaneously on screen. Which means lots of really different races (draconian, flying, spider, ghost, whatever, like in MoM) and massive battles. Also, they've learnt much from their mistakes, so I'm pretty sure it'll be game worth playing. It it will ever see the light of day - I'm not sure if Stardock have founding for game of this scale."

Pokemon on the other hand is foremost an RPG, despite the fact that one could argue that especially the early games might have less RPG elements than Warcraft 3 but that's the focus and the ""meat"" of the game (and otherwise nothing else going on, really).  The reason I advocate for the distinction is that it's that distinction that made me fall in love with Paradox' GSGs after Civ has disappointed me in that aspect (and finally understanding how EU3 works). For me, they're basically big alt history simulators with ""close but no cigar""-realism by directing the game flow in certain ways (e.g. unconditional superior starting positions, different tech groups/unit types and other things) but giving you the opportunity to mess around with that, and depending on your skills cause more or less obscure outcomes.   I know those aren't aspects that exlucde the games from being 4X, but I think they are aspects that make it go beyond that and be ""Grand Strategy Games"" (for lack of a more descriptive name). Sure if you enjoy 4X you might enjoy GSG (and if you enjoy the potential alt history aspect of historic 4X like Civ, you'll probably love them) but I really wouldn't put them in the same genre."

4Xgaming,2ia4w4,Fambida,7,Sat Oct 4 16:05:55 2014 UTC,Moo1&2 were both so fabulous. Each race is significantly different and result in very distinct play style. You pretty much have to change playstyle depending on race
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,moo422,6,Sat Oct 4 17:44:39 2014 UTC,"I can't think of another game that incorporates all the I love about 4X's better. Immersive diplomacy? Check. Ship design that matters? Check.

4Xgaming,2ia4w4,Fambida,1 point,Wed Oct 8 09:10:33 2014 UTC,"I'd not heard of it til your post. It looks interesting, but a couple things worry me.  1: Full 3D galaxy maps are not needed, and don't add anything to a game.  2: 1000 systems with up to 10 planets each means that micromanagement will become a chore. Even lategame MOO2 got pretty bad with the micromanagement. This will be way worse.  3: 3D battlefield. Again, 3D is NOT a good thing. When computers have holographic displays I'll revisit that opinion, but until then, 2D is better. 3D GRAPHICS I'm fine with, it's 3D spaces that don't work so well with space strategy.  Other than those though, the listed features seem cool. I'll certainly pirate it at least, and maybe buy it after trying it. (I bought MOO3 on release day, I am NOT repeating that mistake!)"
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,jeffreynya,1 point,Wed Oct 8 12:58:14 2014 UTC,MOO 1/2 are both my favorites as well.  I wish someone would just take MOO2 and do a update to it and release.  Don't need much really.  Just add some more techs ( some species specific techs)and more ship options.  Balance it out some and maybe add some better planet management.
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,Fambida,9,Fri Oct 17 23:01:07 2014 UTC,"I had another thought besides my previous post. You say you know Civ, but which Civ do you know? If you are familiar and comfortable with one Civ, you should always try another. IMO Civ in general builds upon the previous iteration well, and provides a better game each time, BUT there are things previous gens did better in some ways. I highly recommend playing any older Civs you haven't played yet.  For me, the thing that fucking ruined V for me was one unit per tile and the AI's inability to use it (even for my own worker's pathing!) but some people love that shit.  Around here most folks seem to like 1upt and have other qualms.   Even if you stick to Civ alone, by playing all of them you will not only enjoy 5 games, and some expansions, full of goodness, but you will also experience 20 years worth of game design, and its evolution."
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,BlueGoop,4,Sat Oct 4 18:37:49 2014 UTC,"The major problem with V for me is they forgot the central character in the game -- the map.  Virtually no variance in resource distribution, so something like the guy who starts with salt is considered to have a huge lead.  Improvements are limited and insignificant.  The ""builder"" game play is discouraging when you have to spend 8 turns working a tile for one more extra food yield.  They even removed completely the gold yield from the map with the last expansion pack.  I enjoy finding great spots to settle, and I like to cultivate good and bad spots into rich lands.  I thought Civ 4 did that much better."
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,san320,2,Sun Oct 5 02:32:12 2014 UTC,"Second to this. I would suggest that if you're familiar with Civ 5, to give Civ 4 a try or other way around if the opposite. They're similar yet quite different from each other."

4Xgaming,2ia4w4,marlowe221,7,Tue Oct 7 02:54:38 2014 UTC,"EU IV is not a 4x. It's under a closely related games category called 'Grand Strategy'. Both are turn based, but they have distinctly different objectives. There's also a missing X in EU IV. (No 'exploit', at least not in the traditional sense. CK2 is better at that particular X, although it's method for such is weird. Characters become the resource to exploit in that game.) Grand Strategy is definitely about Expanding, and in EUIV's case, exploring as well. You generally don't end up 'exterminating' in Grand strategy, but you do end up 'Assimilating' in grand strategy. I love the crap out of CK2, but while I own EUIV, I have never really 'dived in' to fully grasp it's nuances yet.  I've heard good things about Endless Legend and I've been on the fence about getting it. I'm pretty sure I know most of what I need to know about Civ: Beyond Earth and have already preordered it.   I've got stupid amounts of time spent on Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes, but there's some balance and aesthetic issues at times. It's an extremely underrated game, and I suggest checking it out if you've played out Civ and are looking for a challenging change of pace. UI is solid and functional. Game lacks for good tooltips at times though.   Quick overview of the mechanics: Take your basic 4x, add in RPG elements like heroes and leveling. Add those same concepts to your cities. (Each city can have 1 of 3 different classes, and can be one of 5 different levels.), then add in a tactics grid combat system ala XCOM or something similar. Mix in a fantasy setting and that's the gist, and only scratches the surface of the depth and difficulty of FE:LH."
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,DoctorDiscourse,2,Tue Oct 7 17:37:36 2014 UTC,"Saying EU IV has no exploitation mechanism is absurd.  Every province has different tax bases, natural resources, and trade power.  You can amplify the effects of the bonuses and end up with a powerful economy.  I don't understand your distinction between ""eliminating"" and ""assimilating"".  When I play Civilization as Montezuma, I'm not razing conquered cities and resettling the land with pure-blooded Aztecs.  I'm keeping the cities I conquered and dealing with any discontented population penalties it may have.  EU IV's conquest works in the same way, apart from the fact that you don't have the option to massacre a population.  I do agree that EU IV is a grand strategy game and not a 4x, but that is because it lacks true exploration.  Every EU IV scenario starts the same, and you can replicate powerful opening plays with consistency (read any of the ""Win the 100 Years War"" guides or the early version ""Survive and conquer as Albania"" guides to get an idea of what I'm talking about).  In a 4x, you'd need to figure out your surroundings and what resources were available to you before you were able to decide how exactly you were going to tackle the early game.  Yes, EU IV does have an exploration mechanic later on, and that's part of the reason the game is so popular here.  Having the option of exploring the new world (which a player with a basic education already has a good idea of what he'll find) pales in comparison to the static map of the old world that all players start in when determining game genre."
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,marlowe221,3,Tue Oct 7 23:51:17 2014 UTC,"When people say 'exploit' with regards to a 4x, they mean the natural resources or those generated by the game. In a sense, EUIV does end up doing that, but it's a very alien method to other 4x players. Paradox themselves refer to their games as 'Grand Strategy', and I think there's enough distance between what both are trying to do to call them separate genres or at most, close cousins.   btw, I don't hate EU IV or CK2. (Hell, CK2 is on my highly recommended list.) I love CK2, and haven't really gotten 'into' EUIV yet. I just don't think either of them are in the strictest sense, a 4x to recommend someone as an exemplar of the genre, because I don't think they're really part of the same genre at all."
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,Eschatos,2,Sat Oct 4 20:23:19 2014 UTC,"I disagree that FE:LH is underrated. In fact, I seem to see/hear the game getting MORE credit than it deserves.  I was a little disappointed by Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes, to be honest. There were just too many ""choices"" that ended up being meaningless.   Take the ability to custom design units for example. 99% of games the player is going to design basically the same units every time regardless of which faction they are playing or the layout of the map or other factors. Why? Because there is pretty much a ""best"" way to design your meatshield units, your ranged units, and your magic-user units. So yeah, you could choose but there was no real point - you either made your units the best way or they were of objectively inferior design. There might be very minor variations from game to game based on the resources that you had available to you on a particular map, but those differences were minor and ultimately irrelevant. Unit design was basically just busy work that the player had to do because the default units were crap.   Also, the tactical combat had... issues...  It's not a bad game in any sense but I do think it is a collection of ideas ranging from good to meh that don't really fit together very well most of the time.  I think Stardock is on a better track with Sorcerer King from what I have played of the game so far."
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,ActionFlank,2,Sat Oct 4 21:28:24 2014 UTC,"""99% of games the player is going to design basically the same units every time regardless of which faction they are playing or the layout of the map or other factors. Why? Because there is pretty much a ""best"" way to design your meatshield units, your ranged units, and your magic-user units""   I'd quibble here only a little bit, but mostly agree. If you don't have the metals or crystals, you'll build a fairly different unit than if you did. If you don't have a hero that can cast enchanted hammers or some production focused towns, you might not be able to reliably produce high production units, instead relying on lower production units with some fancy upgrades that don't cost more hammers. There was decent variation, but they could have done with a lot better 'default' options, and it wasn't entirely busy work when you got to customize aspects of their appearance.  There's a lot of stuff here in Sorcerer King that they could have added to Fallen Enchantress: LH and things people asked for. I'm honestly of the opinion that Sorcerer King is more of a parody/deconstruction of the genre than a real successor to Fallen Enchantress: LH, apart from the cool crafting mechanic."
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,boran_blok,2,Sat Oct 4 22:13:44 2014 UTC,"The problem was that the only time that type of variation in unit design happened was when you lacked resources - if you had access to metal or crystal there was never any reason to NOT design your units around the presence of those resources. That's what made it a false choice, crystal/metal units were basically always better.   Sorcerer King - you may be right. The game is very tongue in cheek and that won't be to everyone's taste. The crafting system is definitely legit though."

Sword of the Stars is also excellent, though it can be a bit hard to get used to navigating the full-3D maps, and real-time combat isn't for everyone.

4Xgaming,2ia4w4,Crapzor,1 point,Sat Oct 4 18:58:41 2014 UTC,Oh I see. Prioritizing colonization on other worlds within the system is a lot easier than which system is best at the galaxy level.
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,Ophidios,4,Sun Oct 5 02:53:48 2014 UTC,"Civilization: Beyond Earth: It's impossible to judge any aspect of an unreleased game, so it doesn't really belong in this list. Endless Space has a great and polished UI and simple straight-forward mechanics, but is otherwise a bland soulless game with very poor AI and variation. Since you are a 4X novice I can still somewhat recommend it as a first attempt to the genre, as it is highly polished and accessible, which are somewhat rare qualities in the 4X genre. Endless Legend so far appears to have a lot more soul than ES, yet with similar mechanics and keeps the same level of UI polish and has far more attractive graphics. Still suffers from lack of variation and braindead AI though. Best wait a while to see how this one evolves, but it's looking promising so far. Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is just a bad game. It has all the flaws of Endless Space (poor AI, soulless, bland, shallow) but without the polish and technical proficiency. It's UI (since that seems to be your focus) gets the job done, but is nothing special. The mechanics feel like a pile of separate ideas thrown together with little cohesion and often poor implementation. Europa Universalis IV is not a 4X game. The interface for all the Paradox titles is rather complex, but has gone through a lot of iterations so ends up rather useful and informative. All the useful info you need is presented somewhere, the trick is merely to find it. Personally I recommend Crusader Kings 2 over EUIV, it's just a lot more immersive. Age of Wonders 3 is a great game with a very informative and smooth UI and accessible yet deep mechanics. Think of it as a combat-focused fantasy version of Civilization. Highly recommended. Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion: Not too familiar with this one, so I'll leave this to other commenters.  Sword of the Stars: This one belongs in any list of great 4X games, despite its age, so I'll briefly mention it here. Consider it a great choice once you've grown into the genre. The UI is simple and clean, though not perfect, and will require some googling to fully understand. It is however unique in that certain UI functionality needs to be unlocked through research. It's got a lot of quirky unique gameplay mechanics that really set it apart from the other games in the genre, and this gives it a lot of soul.  Just stay far far away from the sequel."
4Xgaming,2ia4w4,Crapzor,2,Sun Oct 5 03:08:05 2014 UTC,"Sins of a Solar Empire is my personal favorite 4X game (although it's a little more RTS). I feel like this is a very well polished game (it has essentially stayed the same throughout the all of the expansions - which I feel did more to enhance user experience rather than unnessarily change the funamentals of the game).  I also enjoy Endless Space, as I feel it is one of the easier space 4X games to get into, in regards to UI and mechanics, without sacrificing any quality or functionality.  Some of the earlier 4X games, although they may not be up to today's graphics and complexity, are just as good, if not better than newer titles.

4Xgaming,2i7ie8,Hyndis,3,Fri Oct 3 20:11:37 2014 UTC,"Endless Space was a gorgeous game. Its UI, visuals, and sound effects were outstanding.  Gameplay, however, quickly ran flat. Later game ended up with identical fleets fighting identical battles to conquer identical star systems. There was little to no variation once mid game hit, and late game was all more of the same."
4Xgaming,2i7ie8,igncom1,1 point,Fri Oct 3 20:48:29 2014 UTC,Not a bad first game by the company however.
4Xgaming,2i7ie8,Hyndis,2,Fri Oct 3 23:52:37 2014 UTC,"Definitely not. They didn't make a masterpiece that will endure for the ages, but they can certainly make a damn slick UI experience. Very slick. This is almost Apple-tier UI experience."
4Xgaming,2i7ie8,krelian,1 point,Fri Oct 3 23:56:49 2014 UTC,What I dislike about Endless Space is the nonsensical battle system. You get absolutely no feedback about how your ship design decisions affect the combat. You can't even pause the combat to see what's going on!
4Xgaming,2i7ie8,Gunlord500,1 point,Sat Oct 4 12:44:49 2014 UTC,"I agree with this. Also, IMO the card system was really boring, too reminiscent of Rock Paper Scissors for me. The graphics, music, and general ambience were wonderful, though."

4Xgaming,2i7ie8,Herxheim,2,Fri Oct 3 19:30:09 2014 UTC,"i like it a lot. i have a third of the tracks on my mp3 player and mix them in at work every now and then.   at one point i put multiple copies of my favorite tracks in the soundtrack folder so they would come up more often. it seemed to do the trick, but recently i put a bunch of galciv2 tracks in there and they never come up. one of these days i'll get around to tricking it into playing more tunes."
4Xgaming,2i7ie8,TrevorBradley,1 point,Fri Oct 3 21:04:11 2014 UTC,"I quite like the soundtrack, but I play Endless Space a lot and the soundtrack can get repetitive.  There's no randomization and the tracks always play one after another in the same order.  The soundtrack for the upcoming Civilization: Beyond Earth is absolutely gorgeous."
4Xgaming,2i7ie8,Avohaj,1 point,Fri Oct 3 20:12:14 2014 UTC,"I think it's not only on of the best space 4X soundtracks, or even best 4X soundtrack. The Endless Space soundtrack is one of the best (original) game soundtracks.  It's definitely one of the few non-forgettable ambient music soundtracks, but still I put it up there even with heavy rocking stuff like the classic Tiberian Dawn or MGR:Revengence (which I actually only played after hearing the soundtrack)"

4Xgaming,2i4ud6,Sahkuhnder,3,Thu Oct 2 22:23:56 2014 UTC,So how's Warlock 2 at this point? Is it worth it? Does AI suck just like in Warlock 1?
4Xgaming,2i4ud6,Eraser1024,3,Fri Oct 3 00:13:30 2014 UTC,"I've cough tried it when it came out and it's pretty much the same game but they've put a semi-hard limit on how many cities you can own (a somewhat clumsy solution to the first game's ICS issue) and the spell research is different.   From what I've heard 1UPT basically makes it impossible for the AI to be anything more than not outright shit both here and in Civ5. You can teach it not to feed you its vulnerable units, but any actual clever tactics are too much of a technical challenge at this point in time."
4Xgaming,2i4ud6,megazver,2,Fri Oct 3 10:43:26 2014 UTC,Thanks.
4Xgaming,2i4ud6,Eraser1024,3,Fri Oct 3 12:04:37 2014 UTC,"It's better to think of the Warlock series as ""PvE"" games. If you think of the AI players as just another part of the hostile environment for the player to overcome it works a bit better. To me conquering the environment is the real fun of Warlock."
4Xgaming,2i4ud6,marlowe221,2,Sat Oct 4 15:36:20 2014 UTC,"So you are not a player among other (AI) players, but the player among hostile environment. Interesting point of view."
4Xgaming,2i4ud6,Eraser1024,3,Sat Oct 4 15:47:55 2014 UTC,"Basically, yes. I have always looked at the Warlock games like, ""Here is this untamed land filled with monsters that I have to tame/conquer."" And in fact, the wandering monsters and other neutrals can be quite challenging at times. The fact that the AI is not required to run an empire with those ""factions"" is probably very helpful in that regard."
4Xgaming,2i4ud6,marlowe221,2,Sat Oct 4 22:11:51 2014 UTC,"I got the base Warlock game for free (like everyone else). Is the DLC needed for a good game (ala Europa Universalis III), or is it more cosmetic?"
4Xgaming,2i4ud6,sonovel,1 point,Fri Oct 3 19:33:06 2014 UTC,The DLC is both functional and cosmetic but is definitely not needed to play as it is more of an extra addition than a game-changer (like EU3). That being said the DLC when on sale is pretty inexpensive and does add some new gameplay choices.

4Xgaming,2i3wbr,DwarvenPirate,1 point,Thu Oct 2 17:27:28 2014 UTC,"There's a lot of tongue in cheek humour with this game by the way. He comes up and says “Hey, you know how these 4X games work right, alliance victories are a winning condition.” But who exactly is that a winning condition for? And he'll respond, “Oh that's not important.” But yes it is a victory condition – for him. If you ally with him you become his slave and you die. That's a Beta joke, actually, that particular one might not make the full release, but we thought Early Access players would get a kick out of that. Seeing your traditional 4X model turned on its head.   Dude was coked up for the interview, I think."

4Xgaming,2i3tm2,DoctorDiscourse,0,Thu Oct 2 17:50:36 2014 UTC,"Seems like such a cheeky, parody kind of game when FE:LH rebranded and given a 2.0 update would have likely been cooler. FE was already mould-breaking enough with a tactics grid based combat, and depthy rpg mechanics in a 4x. This is just parodying the mould breaking of a game that could be so much more. Updated graphics also kind of is like a 'really?' to those of us that liked FE and could have done with a graphics and engine update to push it over the top and make it a distinct alternative to Civ. I mean.. it's a cool concept and all, but this feels like the sequel they should have made if FE took off and was a popular game for them, instead of just letting the FE games die."
4Xgaming,2i3tm2,DoctorDiscourse,1 point,Sat Oct 4 14:57:25 2014 UTC,"They say they will continue to support FE:LH. Let's hope that means 2.0 will some day see the light of day. I'm at the same time afraid FE:LH will share the same fate as WOM, which was replaced with FE. WOM deserved to be abandoned, but FE:LH doesn't. I would be so mad if they'd let FE:LH die."
4Xgaming,2i3tm2,DoctorDiscourse,1 point,Sat Oct 4 15:42:44 2014 UTC,"It's such a great concept for a 4x, and if they did some graphics update love like this one got, it'd be a damn impressive 4x. It's already the hardest 4x on the market, (even maddjinn only played it on expert, leaving 2 more difficulties above it) The AI is one of the more sophisticated AIs in 4x."

4Xgaming,2i1pid,Eraser1024,4,Thu Oct 2 00:55:10 2014 UTC,"I suppose this was probably revealed previously, but I'm disappointed to see that two of the factions are essentially ""Asians"" and ""Australians"".  I was hoping for factions with interesting flavour more along the lines of Alpha Centauri.  I know part of that is tied into their new affinity system, but that can't come close to covering Alpha Centauri's philosophical differences between factions."
4Xgaming,2i1pid,Alphanos,2,Thu Oct 2 09:06:55 2014 UTC,"That's why Firaxis' mantra has been ""beyond earth is not a direct or spiritual successor to alpha centauri"" even though the media still says so and for obvious reasons. Really, I don't want an Alpha Centauri HD anyway. But both Alpha Centauri and Beyond Earth are ""civ games in space"" at their core, so some similarities are inevitable - but they are different games still and should be treated like that.  Of course that doesn't mean you can't compare and hold Beyond Earth up to Alpha Centauri, but I think BE's faction+affinity system could work out just as well despite being different than AC's faction system. It should at least be given a chance, not instantly dismissed 'because it's not Alpha Centauri'."
4Xgaming,2i1pid,Avohaj,6,Thu Oct 2 10:39:02 2014 UTC,"Id be lying if I said that this doesn't look like much more than a Mod for CIV5  Sure it's got some new cool stuff (I love the idea of developing a tech further, rather than instantly knowing everything about it in one big hit) but I'm not blown away.  That being said, I can't wait to be wrong."
4Xgaming,2i1pid,asswoopman,2,Thu Oct 2 07:10:57 2014 UTC,"I think the looks are deceiving because there is no big graphical leap like from 4 to 5. But really where would that even go now? In that genre? It doesn't look worse and maybe even better in terms of fidelity. Just no need to add HDR bloom or physics to a game like Civ I think. In terms of game mechanics there is:   that new tech (not-)tree virtues (which seem to be more than reskinned social policies, I think there are explicit synergies for example) affinity (though I haven't really seen how those play out yet) orbital structures diplomatic concept of favors (no idea how those really play out either)   and those are just from the top of my head based on some of the videos of the 250 turn alpha some youtube channels have released.  Of course all those are just features for now and it is questionable if they make the experience more fun, but hey that's always a risk with new games experimenting with new game mechanics.   I was really doubtful when it was first announced (and already hyped, made me extra careful) but after seeing a few gameplay videos I'm now really excited for it."
4Xgaming,2i1pid,Avohaj,2,Thu Oct 2 10:25:49 2014 UTC,"It uses the same core mechanics but pretty much every system of consequence has been overhauled and/or expanded. It's Civ 5 refined, not an attempt at a whole new take on the genre like the leap between Civ 4 and 5. The benefit to this imo is that it will be a ""complete"" experience out of the box and we won't have to wait for expansions to reintroduce mechanics like espionage or address design flaws. If anything I would say it's more like a sequel to Civ 5 than 5 was to 4."

4Xgaming,2hss0g,Herxheim,1 point,Mon Sep 29 18:27:19 2014 UTC,"iirc, the only way the ai ""cheated"" was that it could see the whole map (they said it was too hard to account for fog of war.) man it's been forever but i think even on the hardest difficulty it only got a slight economic bonus.   i used to build scanner ships and send them out to form a perimeter. well, the damn ai flew a couple massive fleets all the way out to the edge of the map, around behind their sensor range and surprised the shit out of me. the ai was good about cherrypicking their targets to hit you where it hurt the most."

Rock Paper Shotgun had this to say: ""No tease before the jump here, let’s get straight to it. Distant Worlds: Universe is my favourite space strategy game. Not my favourite space strategy game released this week and not my favourite space strategy game released this year. It’s the definitive version of the best space strategy game I’ve ever played and I want to share the excitement with everyone..."" I pretty much mirror that sentiment.   Edit: Let me also address the number one complaint about the game: graphics.  Some people don't mind bad graphics, but with other's it prevents them from even picking up a game.  While yes Distant Worlds graphics are pretty underwhelming, try to step back and realize your favorite games you grew up with have bad graphics by today's standards.  Does that make them bad games?  No.  It simply means there's a lot more to a game than just the graphics.  Once you get over that, you'll see everything else the game has to offer.  Trust me, it's worth picking up."

It's got a huge amount of micromanagement from controlling each individual colony, the amount of troops present on it and the ships in orbit around it to the different custom make and models of each ship.  The diplomacy isn't unique but it definitely functions. You trade techs, make alliances, throw down trade sanctions, choose to trade rare resources as well as spy on other empires and steal research.  Tons of mods too!

4Xgaming,2hrdct,DwarvenPirate,0,Mon Sep 29 04:13:28 2014 UTC,"I started playing Sword of the Stars (the first one) yesterday at ~9PM and have pretty much played non stop since... such a great game.  TONS of important, but easy to use micro every turn, the real-time fleet battles are simple, yet deep and have a huge impact on the game, the tech tree has so many tough choices...  It feels like Endless Space's older, beardy brother.  Stars consist of one planet which has one resource, a habitability rating which effects length and expense of colonization, and a size that sets max population.  They are attached via lanes like Endless Space, but each of the races uses the lanes differently.  Humans can travel much faster down the lanes than the other races, but have pathetic 'off road' speed.  One of the other races can only go faster than light by teleporting between gates, but the gates have to be put in place by slower than light ships...  There's a cool feature that shoots off random events every once in a while at random planets, but I turned it off on my second start.  My homeworld got raped by some mothership thing on like the 50th turn.  Which was probably a good thing, since I completely screwed up that start. (I should have read the manual or done the tutorial, like I never do)  I will say though, that it seems there isn't much diplomacy.  You can send the AI certain preset phrases to make a coherent message, and it replies in kind, but it seems like it's broken.  I researched how to speak the language of my first neighbor, got a ceasefire, and they send a message saying ""Our Queen would like to get to know you better.""  Oh, sweet.  Next turn- they destroy one of my colonies.  I don't know if that's a praying mantis's sense of humor or what, but the next two empires I met were equally despicable.  Ya, so I definitely recommend SotS to anyone who likes space 4x's, especially if you're going to play multiplayer."

The game won't go anywhere so you can wait for a sale if you have something else to play. Each buy forces developers to extend the game lifetime, so there's that."

Dont buy into this crap.You buy a game based on how it is now.You do not owe the company anything, dont listen to idiots. you buy a game when you want to play it and if its not in a state that satisfies you atm do not buy it period. Making games is a business not a charity.If after watching a lets play and reading about the game's features and reading a few metacritic and steam community criticisms you do not feel absolutely confident you want it you probably should not get it. If later on it will get good support from the company and maybe an expansion and will seem more like a sure thing buy it then and at a cheaper price."

4Xgaming,2hbqvc,Mantees,12,Wed Sep 24 13:00:57 2014 UTC,"I gave it an 8.5 myself and I stand by that. It's a great 4X game that needs a little end-game help and another iteration or two with the AI, but it has potential to be among the best of all time."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,Jellye,9,Wed Sep 24 14:45:06 2014 UTC,"Same here. Improve the AI, polish a few rough edges here and there, balance a few numbers... and we might have one of the greatest 4X games right here.  Usually, when people say that a game has ""potential to become great"", it's just wishthinking - often what's needed to achieve that potential would require a complete redoing of basic features in the game. Fortunately, this isn't the case here at all: the kind of tweaks that Endless Legend needs are all stuff that could be very realistically patched into the game (and, even now, the game is already pretty good to begin with)."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,lykouragh,9,Wed Sep 24 19:29:41 2014 UTC,"I seem to recall they did a pretty good job of post-launch support with Endless Space, too.  The end-game criticism fusses me though because Endless Space's endgame was godawful, and it's so hard to get that right in a 4x."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,Jellye,10,Wed Sep 24 19:40:19 2014 UTC,"They did! Endless Space improved a lot since its launch.  The endgame in Endless Legend is already better than the one in Endless Space. I actually find it to be only marginally worse than the end-game of any other 4X, right now.  Unfortunately, bad end-game is a genre issue that no one managed to truly fix yet, as far as I'm aware."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,pdxsean,6,Wed Sep 24 20:13:19 2014 UTC,"Civ IV had a lot of interesting aspects to the end-game with corporations. I mean the last 10% was often drudgery but that was better than the last 30% you often run into where the winner steamrolls toward some condition. Unfortunately, Civ V - even with the improvements of BNW - was a step back in that sense."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,Ilitarist,5,Thu Sep 25 06:19:17 2014 UTC,"Civ V - even with the improvements of BNW - was a step back in that sense   I very much disagree. Civ 5 has avoided adding not used features - seriously, who uses corporations? - and created interesting mechanics for cultural victory and ""natural"" World War alliances. BNW was the first 4X game that hadn't me clicking through endturns just waiting for enough culture/science."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,pdxsean,3,Thu Sep 25 10:21:18 2014 UTC,"I agree that BNW did add a lot to the end game - it's far better than vanilla Civ V and GNK. But I still think IV's corporations really made the end game interesting. I don't get your ""who uses corporations"" sentiment, because I certainly did!  Now keep in mind I'm not a super-player (I only have 1000 hours in Civ V) and never used a mod for Civ IV, but I loved corps and maxed them out as soon as they were introduced.  Also don't think I'm one of those guys who is pining for the days of Civ IV. Aside from corporations, I think Civ V is a superior game. I just miss that one aspect, which was relevant to the discussion at hand."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,Jellye,2,Thu Sep 25 17:05:25 2014 UTC,"I love both Civ4 and Civ5, but I must confess that I never really gotten into Corporations.... I'll probably give them a more serious try next time that I play Civ4.  I very much enjoyed Civ5's Ideologies, it was a step in the right direction, for me. Still not enough to save the endgame, but it was some progress"
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,pdxsean,3,Thu Sep 25 20:10:02 2014 UTC,"I felt corporations were basically late-game religion. They were fun to spread around, they provided a lot of specific benefits to cities. You could start a limited number (3?) and some were mutually exclusive, so there was some strategy to it. You could do some solid specialization with the right combos. They also made a ton of money if you got in early and spread to neighbors.  I really like Ideologies, I agree it's a big improvement. They really shape the political atmosphere for the last half of the game imo. However they don't work out as well as I'd hoped - long-time friendly neighbors will pick an opposing ideology for no apparent reason. Just the usual AI shortfalls."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,wipqozn,2,Thu Sep 25 20:35:59 2014 UTC,"Improve the AI   I've heard negative things about the AI, and it's making me hesistant to buy the game. Mind sharing your thoughts on what you thnk of the AI?"
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,Jellye,2,Thu Sep 25 13:11:15 2014 UTC,"Its very passive with everything related to war. It doesn't start many wars and, most importantly, it doesn't do much to defend itself when in a war.  In most game with 7 AIs, there will be one or two aggressive AIs, and those will completely destroy the other AIs. And them they will easily fold to the player when the player decides to attack, because they leave themselves wide open."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,Terkala,2,Thu Sep 25 20:12:30 2014 UTC,"The AI isn't good at using defensive terrain when it would be an advantage to use it, and city defenders are basically cannon fodder by era 2-3. So even if they did defend their cities, they'd likely lose those fights even worse than their expansion attempts."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,marlowe221,5,Fri Sep 26 19:14:44 2014 UTC,I'm glad to hear you say that. This game is definitely a future purchase for me.

The sub is very heavily and stricltly moderated and there are lots of good traders there. Just read the basic rules of trading there and you will be safe as the mods themselves help you in case you get scammed.

I get that they're in demand, and I don't much care about what they're for, but how is it that people use them to trade for games without effectively paying for the games at equal value? Do you just play the market, buy low and hope they go back up so you can get a game? Can you farm for them somehow?"
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,pdxsean,2,Fri Sep 26 12:34:05 2014 UTC,"Keys are bought at a flat $2.49 fee; special events drop special keys which are usually turned into regular keys at the end of the event.

One of the things I'm really excited about - and haven't seen many people talk about - is that you can build custom factions. That was one of my favorite parts of Endless Space, and while pretty standard for 4x Space games I can't really think of the last time I saw it in a 4x Civ-type game.  Maybe Warlock had it? So I should clarify: I can't remember the last time I saw it in a worthwhile 4x Civ-type."

Lots of people love the game, it has solid reviews, but there's a lot I don't like about it even if I feel like I should.  I'll be sure to poke around some forums and read up more on FE:LH before I buy, those 8/10 games with some weird things can really be frustrating if they push the wrong buttons."

4Xgaming,2hbqvc,Avohaj,1 point,Thu Sep 25 10:33:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah that's what I'm saying. Plus I felt that Warlock was a real disappointment. Not much challenge in the game, ICS was the obvious winning strategy. It was an OK game but it had so much promise."
4Xgaming,2hbqvc,HitmanZeus,0,Thu Sep 25 17:06:23 2014 UTC,"Except that customization really is lackluster, especially compared to Fallen Enchantress, Galactic Civilizations or Age of Wonders 3.

Can anyone tell me if it they have synergies and can have drastic effects on playstyle? While not 4X, 'Path of Exile' has an expansive skill-tree that has nodes that can combo strangely --and extremely interestingly-- with others and almost requires one to almost relearn their tactics. It's one of my favourite progression systems across most of gaming, actually.  I too am also VERY glad that the issues encountered in the end-game are ones that can be patched out."

4Xgaming,2h7pmr,Stacked_Deck,7,Tue Sep 23 09:14:47 2014 UTC,"I remember Sid Meier saying that all those games are about choices. It's very vague, of course, but the point is that not only all 4 X's are different ways, not just different parts of the game. You choose between exploring and exploiting, between expanding and exterminating. Those sides of gameplay affect each other but do not come together.  Star Craft 2 has is all about extermination. You need economy and expansion but they're subjugated by military. You can use force to get more resources, map vision or territory, but it all comes to force. You fight to win, you win by fight.  In 4X games you may win ignoring some eXes. You can ignore army or use it only to fuel your expansion, not trying to defeat all others by force. You can explore for goodies or just to find a place for your next colony. You can expand or build a few well-defended outposts. And all of it is viable strategy.  So the point is you have strategic choice between several completely different sides of the game. Not the choice between tanks and jet-fighters, but the choice between trade, cultural conquest and so on."
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,Ilitarist,3,Tue Sep 23 11:30:14 2014 UTC,"That's the thing though, I can't think of any 4x game where it's not easier/ quicker to win via conquering.  Or one that makes non-aggressive gameplay fun.  Seems like every game makes sure that war is balanced and detailed and fun, but none try to do the same for civil pursuits.  Vicky 2 is the only game close to a 4x that manages to do it.  The economic and political gameplay is deep enough that you don't even need to go to war to have fun.  EU4 on the other hand suffers from basic 4x gameplay syndrome.  War is fun, peace is pointless."
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,SharkMolester,3,Tue Sep 23 16:15:11 2014 UTC,It depends on a person.  I love tactical games with only war like Battle for Wesnoth or Silent Storm or even Warcraft. But when I play Civilization war becomes just a necessity. I've only won 1 domination victory in the default scenario in my 6+ years of playing civilization. Though of course when I play on Emperror some people just don't want to buy my blue jeans and I win cultural victory after selective nuclear holocaust. In fact it was hard for me to get into military mind in Civ4 and Civ5 cause peaceful living is so interesting. Thouh EU4/CK2 indeed requires war but it's well integrated into a game and is not as complex as Civ5.  Recent Endless Legend is also like that. Battles are rather simplistic so the war is less complex than city-building side. Therefore the game is well rounded.
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,Ilitarist,1 point,Tue Sep 23 16:26:58 2014 UTC,"where it's not easier/ quicker to win via conquering   Yeah but go win a game of starcraft or age of empires AT ALL without conquering.  Maybe it is easier to win via conquest. But it's not the only way. And maybe it just depends on your personality, maybe some hardcore pacifist would have a much harder time with conquest because of his own morals and expectations and a more peaceful victory comes much easier to them. Different genre, but I know at least some people say that playing evil guys when possible in rpgs is better/more fun/more rewarding but I just can't do it. I tried a few times but I never really continue such attemps and my natural choice will always be the nice and diplomatic path - different people, different playstyles. In 4X games I like defensive economic and scientific empire building much more than offensive war-focused domination empires (and I suck at games were I'm forced to be offensive to not suck, because it just isn't my natural choice of action)"
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,Avohaj,2,Thu Sep 25 09:53:58 2014 UTC,"A really interesting point, you can always rely on Sid to make insightful points on game design. Thanks."
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,Crapzor,-14,Tue Sep 23 11:35:31 2014 UTC,4x games are turn based strategy games in space.
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,SharkMolester,1 point,Tue Sep 23 15:35:17 2014 UTC,"I think the biggest thing that makes defining 4x games these days is that so many games incorporate mechanics from other genres.  RPG mechanics where you level up characters and fight the map itself, not just other players.  RTS mechanics where the person that can click the fastest and knows the best build-tree by heart wins.  Grand strategy game mechanics where diplomacy and politics play an important part.   Even pen-and-paper game mechanics, where the galaxy is made up as you go along.  MMO mechanics, where you can fight other players instead of AI in some or all of the game.    I wonder what games the grognards will be reminiscing about in 30 years.  ""I used to play ______ way back when Windows 8 was around, pesky kids and their Windows 16, don't even know what a proper game is without holographic projectors."""
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,TheBadWolf,1 point,Tue Sep 23 16:03:21 2014 UTC,"I'm new to the genre, but to me one of the major draws over traditional strategy games is how casual 4X can be. If I want to play Warcraft, I'll need to sit down and concentrate on it for at least 45 minutes per game. With Ogame I can log in and play for five minutes. And when I log out, the game is playing itself."
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,ActionFlank,-3,Tue Sep 23 23:50:34 2014 UTC,Reevaluate your definition of 4x.  Starcraft is 4x if you choose to look at it loosely.
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,ActionFlank,3,Tue Sep 23 09:48:36 2014 UTC,"Loosely? You've got it backwards. I was specifically looking at the term 4x. It's the the idea of a 4x genre that's defined loosely. If you're implying that there's more to a 4x game than exploring, expanding, exploiting and exterminating then all you've done is re-word my OP, the very title is asking what makes a 4x a 4x."
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,Crapzor,3,Tue Sep 23 10:54:20 2014 UTC,"Yep, I'm a dummy.  It does boil down to empire management above and beyond upgrading combat efficiency, and victory conditions beyond extermination or time attack."
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,fauxmosexual,-3,Tue Sep 23 14:11:32 2014 UTC,You are not a dummy.4x has always meant a turn based strategy game in space.The term was coined when describing master of orion.
4Xgaming,2h7pmr,Crapzor,3,Tue Sep 23 15:38:23 2014 UTC,"That was when it was coined, but plenty of 4x games aren't in space. Arguably they might not even be turned based - Sins of a Solar Empire sits somewhere in the grey area at the edge of the definition, and that's real time."
4Xgaming,2h6j87,FiveDogNight,7,Tue Sep 23 00:29:52 2014 UTC,Looks like they are making a game and not just a collection of mechanics.  Best of luck to them!

4Xgaming,2h6j87,Nemo84,1 point,Tue Sep 23 18:51:49 2014 UTC,"I actually joined as a Founder a few days ago even though I wasn't a huge fan of Legendary Heroes.  Sure, it's a risk. But from what I've seen of the game in the founder's vault of screenshots and design documents it should be quite different from LH, and more than just cosmetically.  Besides, once it goes into EA it's going to be $40. Whether that would also be the price on full release has not been announced but personally I would rather spend $20 on a game I might not like than $40 and I know myself well enough to know that I would buy it eventually anyway. I can't resist even a mediocre 4X game forever..."
4Xgaming,2h6j87,Nemo84,0,Thu Sep 25 02:12:28 2014 UTC,"Don't know if this was any of your radars, but it should be.   Just about 10 days away from seeing it!"
4Xgaming,2h6j87,Jellye,1 point,Tue Sep 23 00:30:13 2014 UTC,"Given Stardock's abysmal track record, why would any sane person waste $20 on buying this early access? Just play one of the actually good fantasy 4x like AoW3 until this one gets released, and if it's actually a decent game for a change one can still pick it up at that price or less during the next sale."
4Xgaming,2h6j87,Nemo84,2,Tue Sep 23 10:20:54 2014 UTC,"So a company has an abysmal track record from one game?  They gave those that bought that game two free games to make up for it.  How is that in any terms 'abysmal'. Name one other company that has done anything like that. Plus, the end result, Legendary Heroes, is actually really good."
4Xgaming,2h6j87,Jellye,1 point,Tue Sep 23 11:10:11 2014 UTC,"So a company has an abysmal track record from one game?   Demigod (where Stardock was responsible for the multiplayer infrastructure and seriously messed that up), Elemental, Fallen Enchantress and Legendary Heroes? That's four, not one. Four in a row. In fact, the only good game the company ever made was GalCiv 2. Hardly a track record worth mentioning. We call that a one-trick pony where I'm from.   They gave those that bought that game two free games to make up for it.   And both free games were also bad. Not that giving away free games is any excuse for the turd that was Elemental, especially for a company that liked to brag about its ""Gamer bill of rights"" (which incidentally was quietly removed from their website shortly after the Elemental debacle).   Name one other company that has done anything like that.   Most companies have to actually release good games or face bankruptcy. Stardock had the advantage of being a publisher as well, so they could take the loss. Everything else was just PR, if they hadn't done the free games bit they would be stuck with a bad reputation and nobody would have bought the sequels.   Plus, the end result, Legendary Heroes, is actually really good.   Perhaps if you've never played a good Fantasy 4X before. LH is highly mediocre, with an AI that is both braindead and an obvious cheater at every difficulty level, not to mention a lot of problems in balancing and pacing."
4Xgaming,2h6j87,Nemo84,1 point,Tue Sep 23 14:05:53 2014 UTC,"Okay, now I'm curious, what other fantasy 4x is so much better?  I'm not saying LH was perfect, but I think it's really good fun.   I'd say that both Galactic Civilizations were good, FE was alright, LH is very good, and GC3 looks to be pretty good, too.   Plenty of developers and publishers release crappy games and have never done anything remotely as cool as giving two games away. I'll always give them a chance as a result. They simply didn't have to do that"

My third fleets were oneshot wonders as the resupply logistics were woefully inadequate to hang for any prolonged engagement.   But my fourth fleet was able to obliterate the entire navy of NPC races, and simultaneously land sufficient occupation forces to subjugate a slave race of billions."

The problem, for me, was after that tutorial ends (and it's hardly an all-inclusive tutorial) I felt just as much in the dark as I was before I started.  I have tried several times to get into Aurora but I just can't persist past the frustrating stages of learning.  It's too maddening.  And yet I had no problem mastering Dwarf Fortress...?

The game is set in the year 1493, and deals with the discovery and conquest of the Americas.  A deluxe version of the game was released in 1997    Conquest was an innovative game. Considered a leap forward in gaming when it was published in 1996; Interplay had managed to combine top-notch graphics, sound, and gameplay with a detailed historical framework to create a title that was both addictive and entertaining.

The Halflings have a Luck mechanic in combat that is based on the morale of that particular stack/army which is cool as well. The Halflings are a little silly in some ways and that will be a bit of a turn-off for some but, honestly, the Age of Wonders series has always had some tongue in cheek-iness to it anyway.  There is also a new magic school called Wild Magic (read: Chaos, not evil Chaos, random Chaos) that is fun to use. There is also a new skill, Partisan that allows for guerilla-style attacks and some other things.   In addition there is also a new victory condition, improved diplomacy options, better AI, new stuff on the strategic map, some new monsters, a new (short) campaign about the Halflings, and so on.  If you already like Age of Wonders as a series or Age of Wonders 3 specifically, it's totally worth the $11.99 USD. I think it's still on sale for 20% off too.

4Xgaming,2gurw5,-21,2,Fri Sep 19 16:52:41 2014 UTC,"I haven't played Fallen or Endless, but the combat is similiar to Fallen. When you get into battles it drops into a tactical screen like in Fallen (or Heroes of Might and MAgic). The only victory is military, and the diplomatic options are limited. It's a fantastic game, but if you're looking for something closer to Civ, which has several victory types, you'll want to look elsewhere."

4Xgaming,2gurw5,marlowe221,1 point,Fri Sep 19 17:22:26 2014 UTC,You will find Age of Wonders 3 to be less complex on the strategic map and (I would argue) more complex on the tactical combat maps.   There is still a lot of exploration and resource gathering and wandering monster killing in Age of Wonders 3 - but with a LOT less mircro-management than FE:LH.
4Xgaming,2gurw5,Trollatopoulous,1 point,Fri Sep 19 21:39:02 2014 UTC,I would argue AoW 3 isn't really a 4X game because really the meat of the game is the tactical combat so it's more a TBS in the vein of Heroes of Might and Magic. I think it might be better in multiplayer but as a SP game it's pretty underwhelming because the battles are just repeats of each other and the strategic map could just as well not exist.
4Xgaming,2gurw5,Reefpirate,1 point,Sat Sep 20 18:29:50 2014 UTC,"Personally I prefer AoW 3 to Endless Legend. I had fun with Endless Legend, and I wish those guys wrote the UIs for every 4X game in history... I just don't like a lot of their mechanics. There's a lack of variety in military units, and I just want units to be a little more 'standard' between factions/races.  Basically if you like units/tactical combat go with AoW 3. If you want ease-of-use, interesting lore and artwork, and a really cool tech tree implementation I would go with Endless Legend."

4Xgaming,2gurw5,Crapzor,-4,Sun Sep 28 13:38:09 2014 UTC,"Thats cool, now make an actually interesting campaign eh? These games are very hard to play in multiplayer because of their length so you'd think a game that was not primarily geared towards multiplayer would have an awesome campaign but no.  The campaign is linear and boring.  Seems like an unfortunate time to release this with another turn based fantasy game released just yesterday.  EDIT:I do like the game."
4Xgaming,2grifz,batonius,11,Thu Sep 18 14:30:34 2014 UTC,"From the release announcement:   The Cultists faction (more details below!): very exotic, very fun, very dangerous. If an AI plays it next to you, make sure you kill them before they overwhelm you. I was defeated yesterday evening by those bastards, thanks Nosferatiel Custom factions: our Technical Director has already found the one killer custom faction he is inordinately proud of. Final animated ambassadors for all factions, including the large ones (negotiation screen) and smaller ones (diplomatic status) The Mezari faction (Vaulters skin for Endless Legend [classic or founder] Dungeon of the Endless founder pack owners) The Icewarg minor faction (for Endless Legend founder pack owners) The Drakken special hero (for Endless Legend founder pack owners) The Nydia minor faction, for all. It may feel reminiscent of another faction from another Amplitude game. #tease Lots of AI tuning and improvements, faction behaviour has been improved (if you play next to a Roving Clans empire get ready to see mercenaries coming your way, even though he claims you are his best friend). All battle data has been re-tweaked. I loved the way the battle played yesterday, yet we still cannot wait to get your opinion on which unit or faction is overpowered or underpowered. Try to keep in mind the global balancing though; for example, the Broken Lords hero is very strong, but expanding BL cities is expensive, so this makes them a conquering faction, rather than an expanding one. We have also rebalanced some buildings’ costs, minor faction difficulty, region sizes, etc. to make the game experience fluid and interesting at all stages We have of course fixed tons of bugs, especially some nightmarish random crashes and freezes which were very hard to nail down."

4Xgaming,2grifz,visage,10,Thu Sep 18 16:18:46 2014 UTC,"Some of the same concepts and UI from endless space carries over, such as FIDS.  ...but it really is a different beast in that it's a hex-grid 4X fantasy game with tactical combat.  At least as of the last beta, it's a reasonable 4X game.  The AI wasn't great, there were some weirdnesses (one that really jumped out at me was that there are combat units flagged as Support without any actually support abilities (at least as far as I could tell) which would, under some circumstances, revert to trying to support other units rather than attacking enemies).  To my disappointment, yet another 4X game has the problem that the AI bonuses don't scale with time, so at higher difficulty levels you spend the early game terribly behind until you break out (or not).  I'd really like to see a game where they boost the AI bonuses progressively so you're more likely to track the pack.  Some quibbles:   You need to read the manual to get some concepts (like how cities grow) Some things are presented confusingly in the UI.  (One of the bonuses for going Military is ""-50% dust on empire"".) It's very easy to not realize what path an army is going to try to take to get to a destination, and I don't think there's any ""preview move"" option."

What about the situation makes you so angry to follow the sequel around and post comments like this?

4Xgaming,2gq220,Terkala,6,Thu Sep 18 17:21:16 2014 UTC,"He promised the moon, and sold early-access to people for access to that moon.  Then he said ""Well, I'm going to start over"", and released his unfinished game as version 1.0, then ceased development/patches.  Now he is making that game he promised in the first place, and asking for money again from all the people who thought that they had already paid for this game.  For details, look at his first kickstarter:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1319847883/stardrive-a-4x-action-strategy-game-for-the-pc  The bullet points of features are the most damming. I've crossed out the points he never actually implemented.   Customize your Race by selecting from a large list of physical traits, socioeconomic traits, and traits relating to your history and tradition  Deep, module-based ship design as described above  Lead your forces into battle with your own flagship that you control like an arcade shooter; command your fleets like you would in a real time strategy game with simple mouse commands (note: this was ""kind of"" implemented, but done in such a way to never be useful)  Tactical ground combat to take over enemy planets (I have X guys, you have Y guys, they shoot automatically, there is no tactics)  A deep research tree with many dozens of technologies  Alien Artifacts to find and collect, which give bonuses to your empire  Rich diplomacy options, allowing you to make and break treaties with alien races; trade technologies and artifacts, sell ships, declare wars, and design joint operations with your allies.  Finally, MULTIPLAYER.  Do this all with your friends online.   Compare this to Elemental War of Magic. Which was awful out of the gate and unfinished. But the developer created patches for it and actually gave free keys to the sequel games to those people who had pre-ordered the game."
4Xgaming,2gq220,cwilsons,3,Thu Sep 18 18:40:30 2014 UTC,"Man, the info circulating on this game's development has entered meme status. It's no-one's fault for genuinely not knowing something, but I've also seen people who I know ""know better"" spread around misinformation. Not saying that's you, just that it's out there.  Let's have a look.   Customize your Race by selecting from a large list of physical traits, socioeconomic traits, and traits relating to your history and tradition.   http://stardrive.wikia.com/wiki/Trait  ""Each race has pre-set default traits, but you may pick your own traits to customize the way you wish to play. "" It's in the galaxy creation screen when starting a new game. It works like the MoO trait picker.   Tactical ground combat to take over enemy planets. (I have X guys, you have Y guys, they shoot automatically, there is no tactics)   You need to turn off ""Automatic ground combat"" under the AI options. Then you can land your troops where you like on a planet and have them move and attack enemy troops and offensive structures manually.    Rich diplomacy options, allowing you to make and break treaties with alien races; trade technologies and artifacts, sell ships, declare wars, and design joint operations with your allies.   ""Sell ships"" definitely isn't in the game. ""Joint operations"" isn't implemented beyond convincing an ally to join you in a war, which they will do, but ""operations"" isn't the right word for that. The rest is a part of diplomacy, but I personally would have liked to see more expansion on that side of the game.   Finally, MULTIPLAYER. Do this all with your friends online.   No two-ways about it. There's no multiplayer in StarDrive. The dev had a long ordeal trying to make it work, and dealing with the negative backlash for his failures. He made impulsive promises of stand-alone multiplayer modes to try and console disappointed and angry fans, which he shouldn't have done because he didn't think about the logistical implications of such a promise at the time. But at the end of the day; the multiplayer mode he thought he could implement when he wrote his kickstarter design doc didn't make it into the final game.  But overall, the main thing that needs to be pointed out is that this list is from the kickstarter page- which is not a point of purchase for final products. What's posted there is an outline, a design document- not a bill of sale.  There were definite disappointments with development of the game. But I've seen people unhappy with a feature's iteration declare that the feature is thus ""non-existant"", and then go on to tell others that the feature isn't in the game, which is dishonest in my opinion. I see people posting that multiplayer was advertised on Steam (which was demonstrated untrue using internet archives), and that this is a case of false advertising.  This narrative around the game has been so persistent that the publisher posted a response on their website: http://www.iceberg-games.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=384 (Check under FAQ)  At this stage though it's really pointless to try and challenge the dominant thought on any of this.

That said, it did turn out to be an enjoyable game that I do not regret purchasing in the slightest. The only feature really missing from your list above is multiplayer, and I don't give a rip about that. You can do tactical ground combat by turning off the AI, and I make a custom race damn near every time I play the game.

Had zero stuck with SD and made it the game it had the potential to be that would be one thing.  But between the censorship, his communications, and him starting development of SD2 when he did left a bad taste in pretty much everyone's mouth.  The reason you got called out as a shill is because you somehow didn't experience the issues with Zero pretty much everyone else familiar with SD feels.    Hopefully Zero learned some rather valuable PR and development lessons, but these were very costly ones.  Reddit and the 4x community will not be quick to forgive perceived censorship, though making a great 4x game would probably accomplish that.  During this renaissance of 4x games, there really have been zero gems, classics or even great 4x games.

What attributes space crafts will have? How will they work?  III. Will there be fighters? If so how do you plan to implement fighters to be relevant in late-game?  IV.

4Xgaming,2gp9ru,IdeaLcenter,4,Wed Sep 17 22:08:39 2014 UTC,"I. * Our tactical battle will be in full 3D. Also we are thinking about option when it could be limited to 2 dimmensions. * Definitely turn-based. * initiative-based. Initiative of a ship is calculated relation from ship weight and ship thrusters. * rather without grid which will have influence on gameplay. We don't want to limit possibilities of ship movement/rotations etc. But we may add grid (which may be turned off/on) only for information purposes.  II. Confirmed attributes are: * WARP SPEED - speed on main space map. * SYSTEM SPEED - initiative and speed during space battles. * SCANER - scaner range of a ship - on main space map. It will be possible to fly ship/fleet out of colony scanning range and patrol space to early detect incoming enemy fleets... or to monitor enemy movements on the borderline. * NOISE (probably) - starship noise which determine detection. If fleet is larger and louder, it can be detected more easily. * MARINES - responsible for ship defending and boarding enemy ships. TROOPS - troops for ground combat   Of course ships will have weapons.. so this will determine different kinds of attack points (beams, missiles, point defense etc.) Structure points  Armor points  Shield points   Those 3 are well know from MoO.. I think I don't have to explain them ;)  *Ship computer - responsible for aiming and evasion *No of crew members and level of their experience.  III. Yes. There will be fighters. They will form ""pack of fighters"" so you will manage whole squadron. Fighters will be great at Point Defense, fighting with other fighters and very effective against large ships without good point defense.  In late game you can't have only Titans packed with solar converters. Such ship will be quite fast taken down by fighters if it don't have proper point defense.  IV Master of Orion II :)"

That's why we can't show you right now tactical combat.  Ships have main 3 point types: * shield - which blocks weapons without reaching ship. They can be renovated during combat. Yes they are energetic.  That's why it's important to have reliable and strong spaceship engine. * armor - physical. They block weapons at border of the ship. * structure  - if weapons get through shield, then armor, they hit ship and destroy its structure. If structure of ship hit 0, ship is destroyed."
4Xgaming,2gp9ru,IdeaLcenter,3,Wed Sep 17 23:43:09 2014 UTC,"I like ""shield - armor - structure"" trio, not too complicated (over-complicated game mechanics is your enemy!)."
4Xgaming,2gp9ru,IdeaLcenter,2,Thu Sep 18 00:32:53 2014 UTC,"Yes, we don't want to make M.O.R.E. too complicated. It's our goal to make it easy to understand and play."

4Xgaming,2gp9ru,IdeaLcenter,1 point,Thu Sep 18 00:30:30 2014 UTC,"Thank you. Right now we created basic interfaces. Later, after alpha release we will be able to polish them even more."
4Xgaming,2gp9ru,trancedellic,3,Thu Sep 18 09:15:39 2014 UTC,"Why should we invest after you've been so delayed, hardly communicate, and don't seem to have made that much progress?"
4Xgaming,2gp9ru,IdeaLcenter,2,Wed Sep 17 22:44:22 2014 UTC,X.2013  IX.2014  It's one screen.. and you can see big difference. But we've made many features during last year.
4Xgaming,2glma8,LetThronesBeware,1 point,Tue Sep 16 21:43:47 2014 UTC,Right. That's a reasonable suggestion. I think my real concern with having to move ground forces between worlds is that it would require a lot of organization and coordination once the player count shoots upward of ~100 because the number of planets would grow quite quickly.
4Xgaming,2glma8,gogilitan,2,Wed Sep 17 05:39:13 2014 UTC,"Why not both? If a ""stargate"" like technology exists in your game world, there is no reason not to allow players to use them to aid invasion forces... because that's exactly what a real military commander would do. If your concern is that players would be able to zerg using them, you could easily get around this by making them cost/time prohibitive, and give players a tech option to detect them."
4Xgaming,2glma8,LordArchibald,1 point,Wed Sep 17 15:41:01 2014 UTC,"Good question!   Honestly, it's a matter of time and energy. Seeing as I'm developing as a hobby, I only have a limited amount of time to develop functionality. Adding one way to move troops between planets is essential, adding a second won't be a good use of my time, because there are lots of other things that need to be done too."

Graphics do not make a game for me. It could have really horrible graphics for all I care. The gameplay is where  it is at. If the gameplay sucks, great graphics do nothing."

Anyway, everybody can check this here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1447560584/more-oldschool-turn-based-4x-space-strategy-game/posts Also we are posting more often about our progress on our forum: http://morethegame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=334  If you want to check gameplay of M.O.R.E. visit our Kickstarter soon. We will make new update with pure uncut gameplay.  And as I wrote somewhere else. We don't create another FIFA or CoD. We aren't big company, but we are doing our best to create very complex game. If we want to do it good, it have to take some time."
4Xgaming,2gjs7o,IdeaLcenter,3,Wed Sep 17 21:10:22 2014 UTC,Be very cautious with this one.  The developer's original goal was a release date around winter 2013.
4Xgaming,2gjs7o,PapaSmurphy,2,Tue Sep 16 13:05:50 2014 UTC,"Yes, this was our biggest mistake. We should make release date for our 1st Kickstarter for Dec 2015. But... will we be able then to get all those fundings? Or so long release date would scare people off our project? Anyway. We are still working on this game, and visible progress in last months is huge.  Sometimes it's good to wait for something interesting, than receive anything on time. Anyway... Even projets which have very large budgets (milons of dolars) are sometimes late over a year."
4Xgaming,2gjs7o,IdeaLcenter,5,Wed Sep 17 21:14:47 2014 UTC,Same old Kickstarter story: overly ambitious plans and lack of experience with managing larger projects. I'm still cautiously optimistic about the game though.

What made MOO a legend is the blend of good, easy to use, user interface with deep gameplay that was nonetheless easy to control and easy to look at plus some personality.  That 3D ship design looked kind of questionable.I would like to hear more about your game but I am afraid a luckluster visual design will make it hard for many players(including me) to try out your game.It does not have to be super high poly with insane textures, it just needs to look nice, uniform and with some character.   In the the video the portraits, the galaxy, the planets all look nice but the blocky UI and 90's looking 3D ships look off-putting."

Though SotS 2 has it's own thing going for it, it's quite a bit more complex and wasn't well received.  Some people really like it though.  I recommend Sots 1, and if you like it, give SotS 2 a try.  SotS 1 can keep you occupied for hundreds of hours though, and still holds up very nicely."

4Xgaming,2gh98u,thiosk,8,Mon Sep 15 18:10:37 2014 UTC,It was great and had a lot of wonderfully implemented elements.  But it was largely unfinished (There is a lot of angst over this in the 4x community BTW.)  But I'm willing to give this guy a second shot (development team of one)
4Xgaming,2gh98u,klngarthur,8,Mon Sep 15 18:22:50 2014 UTC,"I saw a lot of parallels with star ruler. They made a game, but learned a lot about making games in the process. Sometimes you need to start over.  This is the danger of early access, but the reason I support it is that I want developers to be rewarded for making games that interest me. And taking a new look at 4x is something I've rewarded a lot."
4Xgaming,2gh98u,Benthetraveler,8,Mon Sep 15 18:45:36 2014 UTC,"It's not just that the first game was unfinished, that happens. It's that the developer, zer0, decided to release said completely unfinished game anyways and claim it was finished while acting like a total jack ass to many of his customers throughout the process.  StarDrive I is still available on steam, with no indication that it is totally unfinished and will never be finished."
4Xgaming,2gh98u,runetrantor,7,Mon Sep 15 20:15:11 2014 UTC,"You forgot hw he censored his own as well as the steam forum. Anything that wasn't super positive got removed, any complain = ban.

4Xgaming,2gh98u,klngarthur,2,Mon Sep 15 22:46:34 2014 UTC,"But Star Ruler did became feature complete, even if it was not the best thing ever.  StarDrive lacked some major stuff that was promised.  It would have been passable if he had at least admitted he made wrong, or even better, finish the promised stuff as it's your obligation to customers, not run off to make a sequel."
4Xgaming,2gh98u,Boonaki,16,Tue Sep 16 04:41:01 2014 UTC,This game should really have free beta access for anyone who bought the first one.  I'm very reluctant to give this game a chance given how terribly zer0 handled the situation with the first game.

It captured the Victorian Era incredibly well, it does politics really well, managing your populations, the rise of liberalism, socialism, fascism, and communism and captures imperialism really well as well.  If you want something engrossing and more in depth to scratch that Civ itch, I would advocate Victoria 2."
4Xgaming,2ggxic,paradoxpancake,-1,Mon Sep 15 23:43:23 2014 UTC,Not crusader kings 2?That game has so much content.
4Xgaming,2ggxic,Crapzor,1 point,Tue Sep 16 12:05:44 2014 UTC,"Crusader Kings 2 is good, but it lacks a lot of stuff to do during peace, even with the Historical Immersion Project. Victoria 2, on the other hand, you can go an entire game without going to war yet be incredibly influential and powerful on the global stage.  Dealing with global crisis' as a great power, the colonization of the Pacific, Africa, etc. Watching the political ideology of your country shift based on the decisions that you make, the advent of Great Wars, the technology shift to trench warfare, and the birth of the industrial revolution. Victoria 2 captures these so damn well save some wacky economic things (like liquor being the backbone of the industrial revolution and being incredibly profitable in factories). I used to also believe that CK2 was the best in content, but Victoria 2 really has it beat once you get into the nitty gritty of it.   I mean, as an example? It's pretty fascinating when ahistorical stuff happens like a reactionary revolution happens in the United States and they become a Presidential Dictatorship, causing a bunch of states to splinter off and form democratic unions like the New American Union and the Free States of America (exists in the /gsg/vickymod which is the most popular and widely used mod for the game) splinter off with the Confederate States of America and you watch this entire conflict unfold to see who eventually emerges triumphant. I've seen the Free States completely dominate and become the new Union and great power while the Old Union is sometimes completely absorbed or relegated to a weak standing in the world compared to the Free States.  It's also something taking a country like Romania from being a mere pawn of the Ottoman Empire and then making it a Great Power eventually capable of dismantling the Soviet Union (something I've done).   It's a great game and the games tend to be different each time. I love it far more than CK2 and would highly recommend it to any Paradox fan, or really any strategy fan in general. There's a lot of meat to it and it takes a bit to learn, but it's so satisfying once you do."

Nice work, and your website seems to be gathering up content quite well!  I just hope that a better crop of space 4x is going to come out. I've been really unenthusiastic about them of late."

4Xgaming,2g9a94,Lobo7922,6,Sat Sep 13 02:22:18 2014 UTC,"Reviews anyone? The early-access reviews were not terribly favorable, but I'm willing to give games a 2nd chance review on full release."
4Xgaming,2g9a94,Terkala,2,Sat Sep 13 04:11:50 2014 UTC,"I was tempted too but decided to skip it. This seems to be a case where the game moved to ""Full Release"" not because the developers were happy with how it had been refined and improved with player testing but because the developer has moved on to the next project do this one is ""finished"".  There are multiple bugs that will crash the game, it's pretty shallow in terms of mechanics, but my favorite foible is the fact that apparently you have to disable additional monitors before the game can run. Not change settings so the game is only displayed on one monitor, you have to completely disable the other monitors in the control panel. I haven't encountered this issue in probably ten years which leads me to assume a very simple fix exists.  Basically, you won't find anything new or innovative. The game will most likely just make you want to play a better 4x game."
4Xgaming,2g9a94,PapaSmurphy,2,Sat Sep 13 08:38:35 2014 UTC,Its been a significant challenge lately to innovate on the style. Its been a depressing rennaissance for the 4x genera-- I feel like all I've gotten out of it is distant worlds.

4Xgaming,2g7y2z,watersplash,8,Fri Sep 12 18:03:36 2014 UTC,Civ V is really the only 4x game with a touchscreen mode.  Some low resource requirement games that may be reasonable to play on a touchscreen would be like Space Empires 4 or Master of Orion 2. I used to play SE4 way back when on my old Windows XP Tablet Edition stylus machine.
4Xgaming,2g7y2z,combatwombat-,7,Fri Sep 12 18:41:23 2014 UTC,"I don't know about touch screens but as far as a laptop with a low end graphics chip/card, I would say look to the past.   SMAC, Master of Orion 1 & 2, Master of Magic, Civ 3, Free Civ,  etc."
4Xgaming,2g7y2z,marlowe221,4,Fri Sep 12 19:09:46 2014 UTC,"I haven't found much out there that will respond well to a touch-screen. I too have a touch-screen laptop with a low end video card (Intel HD 4400).    So far, the best game I've played with the touchscreen is Kingdom Rush."
4Xgaming,2g7y2z,fishy007,4,Fri Sep 12 18:39:36 2014 UTC,"It's not strictly 4x (it's a 3x), but Dominions 3/4 are both excellent on laptops. I played Dom3 extensively on my gen-1 tablet PC. It is fully functional without a keyboard, and turn based so you never have to worry about CPU speed."
4Xgaming,2g7y2z,Terkala,3,Fri Sep 12 23:47:15 2014 UTC,"Master of Orion 2 isn't touch optimised or anything (it IS old) but IIRC it is all left click driven, so should work with touchscreens just fine. Also, it IS old, so your hardware CAN run it. The only issue will be setting up a batch file to kill explorer.exe while it runs, in order to avoid a pallette bug.  said batch file will look something like this:  echo off taskkill explorer.exe c:\your Moo2 directory here\Orion95.exe explorer.exe   It's been a while since I messed with it, so if anyone sees any glaring errors in my batch file there please tell me so.  If you can't get the win95 version to run, you can always run the DOS version with DOSBOX. GoG's version (which only costs like $3) runs the dos version in a preconfigured dosbox."
4Xgaming,2g7y2z,Fambida,2,Sat Sep 13 02:09:53 2014 UTC,"In case you worry about running strange code, such as my batch file there,  echo off   makes less messages pop up in the cmd window  taskkill explorer.exe   stops the explorer.exe program. this IS a central windows file, and you need it to be running to do most shit, such as see your desktop or the taskbar, but we restart it after the game closes, so you're fine.  c:\your Moo2 directory here\Orion95.exe   runs the game  explorer.exe   restarts explorer.exe once the game closes"

4Xgaming,2g7y2z,Fambida,2,Sat Sep 13 15:21:18 2014 UTC,"Older 4x games like MoO2 or GalacticCiv will have very low requirements but you might run into compatibility issues with Windows 8. I'm not aware of any except Civ5 that support touchscreens, but that's mostly because I haven't really played any modern 4x games.   Regardless of which game you decide to buy I'd suggest getting it from GOG.com if possible since they will refund your money if it doesn't work on your machine (at least that's what I've heard, never tried it myself)"
4Xgaming,2g7y2z,Ze_German_Guy,2,Sat Sep 13 01:20:46 2014 UTC,"In regards to Moo2, I made a post here that describes how to get the win95 version to work right. I'm not 100% sure it works for Win 8, but I am 100% sure it works for Win 7, since I wrote it and used it."
4Xgaming,2g7y2z,Fambida,2,Sat Sep 13 02:18:18 2014 UTC,Saw someone recommended Civ 3 and I've gotta second it. Yeah it's an older game but the graphics hold up really well and there is a very easy fix to play it in widescreen resolution. It's a lot of fun and you can get the complete edition for $5 from Steam and other places.
4Xgaming,2g7y2z,EmmEffer,1 point,Sat Sep 13 05:00:36 2014 UTC,Distant Worlds. I have an ativ500t. It's not nearly fast enough to run civ 5. I've had little luck getting any decent strategy games to work on it. But distant worlds worked great.
4Xgaming,2g7y2z,klaxxxon,1 point,Sat Sep 13 00:48:03 2014 UTC,"Have you tried playing Civ V in the 2D strategic mode? It works really well for me (I have a bit more powerful tablet though, with Core i5 and HD4400)."
4Xgaming,2g7y2z,megazver,1 point,Sat Sep 13 01:02:42 2014 UTC,"People recommend Civ3 but frankly it's straight up worse as a game than Civ IV and I believe Civ IV should run on your laptop just fine. (Arguably it's actually a slightly better game than Civ V as well, but let's not start that argument again.) Quick googling seems to think you'll be able to play it with the touchscreen, too."
4Xgaming,2g7mqz,Digi_Ent,7,Fri Sep 12 16:19:18 2014 UTC,I voted for it on Greenlight. It looks pretty cool to me.  Two things -   Is the combat real time or turn based? I would also suggest looking into releasing the game on GOG as well - you will find a lot of old school 4x fans there.
4Xgaming,2g7mqz,marlowe221,5,Fri Sep 12 19:08:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the questions!   The combat, and the whole of the game, is turn-based. We are definitely considering GOG as an option, thanks for the input!"

4Xgaming,2g7mqz,trancedellic,3,Sun Sep 14 17:55:47 2014 UTC,Not bad. I love the fact that the game is turn based. I can play it while working ☺ Keep up the good work.
4Xgaming,2g7mqz,specter800,2,Sat Sep 13 22:02:12 2014 UTC,A very important detail. I wish Distant Worlds was turnbased. I know you can pause it but that seems like cheating to me for some reason....I really should give that game another try though; it's seems so intimidating.
4Xgaming,2g7mqz,lolasaurusrex1234,1 point,Sun Sep 14 22:58:26 2014 UTC,"HEATHEN!  I think DW needs a better way to display huge amounts of information. If they were able to convey things in a more succinct, or even aesthetically pleasing way it might not feel so stressful when you're trying to micromanage everything."
4Xgaming,2g7mqz,specter800,1 point,Mon Sep 15 14:07:30 2014 UTC,"It may be that. I honestly don't know. Based on what everyone in this sub says, DW has everything I've ever wanted in a 4x game; it's just so bafflingly overwhelming to me for some reason. I sat through a couple in-game tutorials last night and ended up just walking away. The automation is nice but every time I try to do something the game says, ""Do you want to turn off all automation for this task?"" and I think well shit...if I do this my one-planet empire will be a smoking pile of rubble in a matter of seconds so I'll just sit here and do nothing. I will never speak ill of the game, maybe I'm just too simple in my 4x game skills. I love Endless Space; it clicked easily with me and while I suck terribly, I still have fun. DW just makes me feel like a terrible leader who should never have been promoted to ""Leader of the galactic expansion of Earth""."
4Xgaming,2g7mqz,lolasaurusrex1234,1 point,Mon Sep 15 14:14:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah I still sometimes feel that way after about 100 hours. It's possible for a game to give you too much, and I think DW is that. If the automation wasn't there, I wouldn't be able to play it.  I'd recommend playing some games of it where you only micromanage one aspect. That way you can get used to the mechanics enough to be confident with them. That worked for me, with the exception of ship design."

There is literally no point in going to your site instead of just directly going to the newssite. It's the definition of blogspam. Don't do it. You want people to recognize your go-to site? Offer something on your site. Actually have content.  If yoou only blogspam you eventually will be banned by reddit and google will rank you nowhere."

That doesn't really count as content since all it does is add more mouse clicks.  It's possible people wouldn't have a problem with it though if you linked to the reviews, previews, and first impressions of Worlds of Magic, or anything that has more than 1 sentence and a link for content.

Meaning that if they do release it next week that people will be testing these features for the first time. Examples: Custom factions, endgame tech. I thought release was months away and you can ask your friends how feature complete it is (based on features mentioned in the dev updates)  You can also check other fans of the game/developers and they all agree it seems rushed. http://www.reddit.com/r/4Xgaming/comments/2fv6go/amplitude_studios_endless_legend_release_date/"

I read your article and thought it was a good overview of the current build of the game. I will be interested to read any thoughts you might have in the future as the game (hopefully) develops.

4Xgaming,2fyqav,SeriousDan,1 point,Wed Sep 10 04:38:23 2014 UTC,I was wondering what happened to the game because it was initially scheduled for Q1 2014 if I recall correctly. Gonna wait first before diving into an early access purchase though.
4Xgaming,2fyqav,Hambeggar,0,Wed Sep 10 06:22:05 2014 UTC,Just me or does this seem like Fallen Enchantress.
4Xgaming,2fyqav,SeriousDan,3,Wed Sep 10 05:30:15 2014 UTC,well the dev wanted it to be like Master of Magic so we get grid-based tactical combat. personally I highly prefer grid over hex so that's fine with me.

Could definitely use some graphical help though.  It's weird, because the ships themselves look meh, but the weapon animations and explosions are great.  I really like the slow-paced Total War- type gameplay.    The skirmishers (fighters) scuffle and do some damage, then the (sloooooow) ships of the line close in, so cool.    I'm downloading it, but at 180 kbps :( it's going to take an hour."

Game really needs more testing, polishing and a lof of features are not implemented in beta yet (2 last research eras, for example). I don't understand why they can't delay the release date. They are indie studio, right? There's no publisher to haste."
4Xgaming,2fv6go,Lexxx20,2,Tue Sep 9 10:29:07 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I cannot say much because I'm in their VIP program, but I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how well this game will turn out.   Also, look forward to a new build by the end of the week. If you still feel that way then perhaps this one missed the mark for you. The build the VIP's have been shaking down, though, is significantly better than the current public build. Until later this week that is!"

4Xgaming,2fpbfz,Infamously_Unknown,1 point,Tue Sep 9 12:08:12 2014 UTC,"Well technically all RTS games are like that. Paradox games are real time but not RTS if that makes sense.

4Xgaming,2fpbfz,General_Josh,1 point,Tue Sep 9 16:11:51 2014 UTC,"Sure, all RTS use some ticks (for the lack of a better word), but those are usually very short time units hidden from players. Here it's in-game days/hours, so it's a matter of scale. I wouldn't really compare e.g. Vicky with Distant Worlds (which also has a calendar, but that's not relevant). In the former game, you might actually end up playing the game day by day, if you get into some huge war with hundreds of brigades on each side. You will hardly play DW tick-by-tick though, you can't even tell them from each other."
4Xgaming,2fpbfz,filthgrinder,2,Tue Sep 9 19:21:26 2014 UTC,"The Total War games are always fun. You have a lot of options in terms of economy, but it's not that in depth. Timing is basically inverse XCOM; The strategic view is turn based, but battles are fought in real time. The later ones also look very, very pretty, and I'm sure there are some mods out there that would make it look even better.  I'd recommend starting with Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai (I've never played base Shogun 2, so take that for what it's worth).  It's currently $30 on steam, but if you wait for a sale it'll go down to less than $7 (that's what I got it for about a year ago)."
4Xgaming,2fpbfz,purpleberry,2,Sun Sep 7 17:47:52 2014 UTC,"Personally I LOVE, Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes. It does have a bad rep due to the ""tragedy"" of the series when it started, but Legendary Heroes is an amazing game.  It does not have your first bullet-point however. The second point it sort of has, it is turnbased, but has an autoturn function which does give the illusion of a faster game, but it's not real time. Has modding, great graphics (IMO)"

On one hand, you could have hostile terrain-- as in alpha centauri. The more you explore, the more you might catch the attention of ""big bads-"" harvester races, something like the tyranids from warhammer lore. This would make exploration interesting, because if you found them, you have to worry about leading them home if you escape.   Alternatively, or in addition, procedurally run races-- where their expansion and aggression is tied to yours-- would give a great way to have other empires and other interests while still enabling the player to focus more on the ""buildy"" aspect of empire management and less on the ""race to win"""

The idea I am bored by is ""6 empires in a box, race to victory conditions.""   I'd rather play the story of a society, as it rose and fell, through the eons. And if the AI is playing by the same rules as you, it doesn't work.   Look at the Anno series-- you have ""AI"" but its not fighting you the way a 4x ai does. If you want to sit on an island and obsess over building placement for 6 hours, you can do that, and aren't punished by game mechanics where now the AI is impossibly too powerful to catch up against.  This concept frees you from build orders and time limits, and I find it extremely fascinating.  If anyone wants to help me build this game out, i'm totally down.

I might be inclined to agree that if a game is not willing to make decent AI they might as well not even bother, but I also probably would not enjoy playing it.  Warlock 2 in particular is a boring series of monster spawns.  I loath fallen enchantress's quests, especially since they are mostly the same game after game."

You can toggle whether creatures and pirates are on, and there's the end-game Shakturi invasion that you can turn on or off.  I've thought about doing a game like that a few times, but haven't gotten around to it.  Having the galaxy to yourself, except for the pirates, and building up your empire then fighting off the invasion alone might be fun.  I'm pretty sure Space Empires and Star Ruler let you do this too.  Though it wouldn't be much fun in Star Ruler since it's 90% combat."

4Xgaming,2fhl56,Taokan,2,Fri Sep 5 01:23:24 2014 UTC,"I think it'd be interesting to have a game with AI, but you don't start out with AI. The AI is created based on your decisions. So take civ for example. You'd start with just your civ and maybe you are a dictator and a group of your people revolt. If they win, they become a new civilization you contend with, but it's your own doing that brought them about. This could be done throughout the game. One of the groups that break off could have their own revolts, with their own civs being created until you get a decently fleshed out world with it's own custom history."

Coming from a Master of Orion fanboy growing up I was stoked for ES. But the game felt empty? like it just didn't give you that feel good feeling like you do with Civ. I dunno how exactly to describe it.    But I liked that they took what actually worked from ES and then made a completely new game. I picked up the title after their last patch and been playing it all week. Game went over my expectations and I have now lost most of my interest in CivBeyond, which was in mind my next game.  I don't get that empty feeling that I did with ES.   Seen a few posts on the forums from people saying that the last patch really brought this game to life from before.

4Xgaming,2eyl0k,Ranor,7,Fri Aug 29 22:48:28 2014 UTC,"Endless Space  Turn-based 4X. Very polished, but lacking in some areas, and not as deep as some other 4X games. I have not played the expansion (or update, or DLC, whatever they are calling it), but a lot of people used to complain about the combat. You pick some cards and go into a screen where you watch the battle unfold. The problem people had is that it requires little skill, because the cards are balanced in a rock-paper-scissors fashion. I personally didn't mind it. It has apparently had an overhaul, but I can't speak to it. I enjoyed Endless Space, but a lot of people seem to be unsatisfied with it.  Sins of a Solar Empire  RTS with 4x elements. This game is pretty fun, but it isn't strictly a 4x. It is a real time strategy game without turns, but games can take a very long time to complete. It's pretty unique and hard to compare to other games, but it's worth playing, even just single player. There are some cool mods out for it, too.  Galactic Civilizations II  Classic 4X. Generally regarded as the pinnacle of the 4x space genre. In my opinion, it is the pinnacle of 4x, period. It's basically Civ4 in space with some key differences: the AI is probably the best to have ever been made in the 4X genre so far. The ship building is a great feature, and adds another layer of strategy into the game. The writing and humor are top notch. The tech tree is the best implementation of a tech tree in a 4X game thus far, in my opinion.  As for the other two, I haven't played Starpoint Gemini 2, and I haven't played enough of Horizon to judge it.  If ship customization and combat is what you want, GalCiv2 is the clear choice.  EDIT:  Endless Space has the least direct combat but the most polish, and is the prettiest. Ship customization is limited and has no cosmetic changes, other than what your ship fires in the combat mode (again, I haven't played since the update, this is going on old information).  Sins of a Solar Empire has the most direct combat (being RTS), and comes in second place for polish and being pretty. No ship customization.  GalCivII has extensive ship building that is both cosmetic and functional, the combat involvement is in between the other two, and it has the least polish, though the explosions are still satisfying to watch."

4Xgaming,2eyl0k,ekolis,-1,Sat Aug 30 01:12:06 2014 UTC,That's... not what cosmetic means.  GalCiv 2 just doesn't have a separate tactical battle mode. You still need to strategize on the main map.

It looks quite decent for something done in spare time :)   You now, my wife is not really happy about this, as I spend a lot of spare time for this :)  Thanks, I'll consider working on icons.  As to science pts - the screenshot is from the late game, where you often have 60-100 colonies and some of them are scientific ones generating a lot of science points. So, to make numbers smaller I need either to have each science centre producing less than 1pt of science, or print not research pts, but research %%.  Win conditions - maybe a radio-buttons-like look is misleading, you can select all win conditions together, not only one out of them :)"

4Xgaming,2eucay,Uloldodok,5,Fri Aug 29 07:46:43 2014 UTC,"I downloaded the file, so perhaps tonight I'll give it a whirl!   I like the concept of tactical fighter combat mixed with captial ships. No one else is really doing that, and it gave the video a total war feel, which is nice.  I agree on the name change.   I haven't seen the rest of the game, but it looked like fairly standard fare MoO/civilization style economy building from what I could glean. It is difficult to differentiate oneself using that game configuration."
4Xgaming,2eucay,cjet79,3,Thu Aug 28 22:40:14 2014 UTC,"This looks very neat! Going to give it a shot and see what I think of it. From the screenshots alone it seems quite nicely put together, and while I might not agree on the color scheme it's nothing that impacts the game itself. :)  ""Remember Tomorrow"" is a pretty sweet sounding name, the only problem is that it doesn't really tell you much, and there are thousands of things playing on that sentence. Have you thought about naming it something in the lines of ""XXXX: Remember Tomorrow"" for release? It'll keep the same flair but will make it easier to find, and the game itself will still be called ""Remember Tomorrow"" unless the XXXX part overshines it.  Will post back with thoughts!"
4Xgaming,2eucay,Uloldodok,2,Thu Aug 28 23:25:07 2014 UTC,"Thanks, ""XXXX: Remember Tomorrow"" is a good idea."

4Xgaming,2eucay,FalseTautology,3,Fri Aug 29 17:23:52 2014 UTC,"That sounds like it fits the bill perfectly! And then you know for sure it's a space game when you hear the name too. Can't find any games related to Galaxia either, just some flash game which doesn't count. :)"

4Xgaming,2eucay,Silent-Viper,3,Sat Jan 17 22:02:39 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Impressed so far! Simple interface suggestion, in galaxy map, allow holding down middle mouse or right mouse button to do the same as alt (rotate the camera). Rather than forcing me to click the x box to close window, let me press esc (when clicking on tech to decide if set as priority or not).  I will try to have more of a play later, but is there an auto resolve for battles? And I have to say, the way battles work in that you can go around is rather interesting, how does that work with retreating from battle? Looks very promising!  I might suggest, see if you don't have to hit shift = or shift - to speed up, just a minor thing. Also zooming in the battles is... jumpy, if it was smoother it would keep the player from getting disorientated by sudden change rather than gradual. Minor things, but suggestions :)  Quite like the tutorial, although the battles were hard! Also, I tried rotating the galaxy map more, but it seems to get stuck? Is there only a limited degree you can turn? If could turn completely would be even more amazing :)  O and do you have a wiki or anything? I started a skirmish and a few races have errors getting their text values. Or alternatively, is it easy to read the file with those  details? Cheers!"
4Xgaming,2eucay,ran88dom99,1 point,Fri Aug 29 10:20:10 2014 UTC,"Thanks, middle button to rotate is a good suggestion. Never thought about it because I develop under Mac and just do not have a middle button :)  I'll check Esc in Science. Maybe I forgot it there - usually Esc should work to close a window like you suggested.  No, there is no auto-resolve, but you can set 32x time that will essentially mean auto-resolve :)  To retreat from a battle you need to command ""retreat"" from Menu->Commands. Then you ship will stop fire and start accelerating for hyper jump. If it is not lucky, it can be caught by enemy fire during this process.  To allow for full galaxy rotation, uncheck ""Restrict map rotation"" option in the settings panel on a Galaxy View screen.   I started a skirmish and a few races have errors getting their text values. Or alternatively, is it easy to read the file with those details?   There seems to be a bug when you start a new game right after the Tutorial. To fix this, exit the game and start it again.  I do not have wiki yet :("
4Xgaming,2eucay,frayuk,2,Fri Aug 29 10:31:21 2014 UTC,"Will def download when I get home from work, scifi 4x's are pretty much my favorite strategy genre.  Quick question: is english your first language?  I only ask because if it is I will point out any grammatical errors, etc but if it's not then you're on your own, ha.  Also, it seems your title was already used by an RPG at some point.  There's nothing wrong with it, per se, but it will help people find your game if you name it something totally unique."

If you are interested in someone aiding in translation a little more formally/comprehensively maybe we can talk (I'd do it for a credit and a copy of the game, personally).   Moldova... I think I used to illegally order cigarettes from there."

4Xgaming,2eucay,carmika55,1 point,Thu Sep 4 04:54:04 2014 UTC,"Everything looks great! except 2 little things; the ships are too colorless like they are made out of soil. Also, when the carriers rotate itself  the animation could be more smooth.  However, the shield poping animations and ship explosion animations are nice.  Overall, this game looks like something that I would buy when it release, if the reviews are not nagative too much  :D"
4Xgaming,2eucay,LordArchibald,2,Thu Aug 28 19:56:36 2014 UTC,"The issue with rotation is that the ships are not real 3D models.   So, making a better looking tactical combat is one of my priorities and this includes moving to a true 3D with ship models while maintaining the 2.5D view."
