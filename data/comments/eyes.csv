The most important difference is that freckles virtually never turn into melanoma, but nevi can.  Your iris is heterochromic (multicolored) and your spots might be concentrations of melanocytes but they're called iris freckles to emphasize they're normal in heterochromia, and not prone to become melanoma."
eyes,3c5qqw,Holy_Headlines,4,Sun Jul 5 14:58:17 2015 UTC,From what I can tell it's called a Choroidal Nevus.

eyes,3c5qqw,Frognificent,2,Sun Jul 5 06:51:01 2015 UTC,I've got one in my eye too. Wanna give an ELI5 on what it is?
eyes,3c5qqw,optometry_j3w1993,4,Sun Jul 5 10:47:03 2015 UTC,It's basically a freckle. Accumulated pigment. It needs to be monitored however with yearly eye exams as there is a chance it could progress to a melanoma. Although most of the time it's just kind of like a freckle and doesn't change.
eyes,3c5qqw,Frognificent,2,Sun Jul 5 12:01:39 2015 UTC,"That's pretty simple, haha. Thanks!  So, if it's looked the same my entire life, I'm probably good?"
eyes,3c5qqw,optometry_j3w1993,2,Sun Jul 5 14:03:16 2015 UTC,Probably! But make sure to keep up with your yearly eye checkups with your eye doctor.
eyes,3c5qqw,Frognificent,4,Sun Jul 5 14:28:01 2015 UTC,Those are a thing? Uh-oh...
eyes,3c5qqw,optometry_j3w1993,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:44:05 2015 UTC,While that is a nevus most likely it is definitely not in the choroid. This is clearly the iris.
eyes,3c5qqw,optometry_j3w1993,2,Sun Jul 5 12:00:28 2015 UTC,That would not be a choroidal nevus because it is nowhere near the choroid. The choroid is the blood supply under the retina in the back part of the eye. This would be a freckle or a nevus. Either way it should be monitored yearly to make sure it does not change or get larger.
eyes,3c5qqw,walczak1987,2,Sun Jul 5 11:59:42 2015 UTC,I like to think they are called speckles

eyes,3c5qqw,lelandselene,2,Sun Jul 5 02:24:07 2015 UTC,Absolutely! It's just a bunch of pigment bunched up basically. Just make sure you keep up with your yearly eye exams so your doctor can make sure it's just a freckle and that it won't grow or mutate into something more serious.
eyes,3c5qqw,Kurisuchein,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:03:26 2015 UTC,I think technically that it is not a freckle. But it's what I've always known it as ha.

We also have a lot of historical places and monuments. I would probably recommend a palace called ""PalÃ¡cio da Pena"" in Sintra. But any monument you visit is probably great, really x)  We also have the country side. I would recommend the Alentejo for people who can handle the heat and who are more into tourism in a vast, almost deserted environment and ""Serra do gerÃªs"" for people who love mountains and forests.  We are a small and diverse country, so you can pretty much choose the things you like the most :P my only advice - never come to Portugal on a diet!"

Mel tambÃ©m, dependendo do tom do olho, jÃ¡ que ""hazel"" Ã© usado quando nÃ£o se sabe dizer qual a cor principal da Ã­ris, entÃ£o varia bastante.  As suas fotos estÃ£o meio embaÃ§adas, mas acho que vocÃª pode ter olhos verdes com heterocromia central."
eyes,3bkh1p,daytr1pper,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:24:24 2015 UTC,Way I ask what you use for such a sharp wing? Or is it free-handed? And is it liquid or pencil?
eyes,3bkh1p,Abby_Marie_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:29:19 2015 UTC,"I use gel liner and an angled brush. The liner is Anastasia colored gel liner in Jet and the brush is Anastasia #20 angled brush with a spoolie   To get it this super sharp, I go underneath the bottom of the wing with the slightest bit of concealer and drag it out. :)"
eyes,3bkh1p,Abby_Marie_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:48:53 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks I use a liquid liner with a very thin brush and either tape or concealer :)

eyes,3bjbun,SayNoToButterflies,5,Mon Jun 29 18:18:04 2015 UTC,I would call your eyes hazel. And also pretty.
